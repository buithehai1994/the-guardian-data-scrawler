Photograph: Eloy Alonso/ReutersAs their album Fables of the Reconstruction turns 40, we assess REM’s hugely varied discography, from mysterious masterpieces to commercial failuresByAlexis PetridisThu 5 Jun 2025 10.12 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 18.32 EDTShare16. Around the Sun (2004)TheREMalbum that REM appeared to hate: guitarist Peter Buck called it unlistenable, “a bunch of people so bored with the material that they can’t stand it any more”. In truth, the songs aren’t bad, but there’s something lifeless about Around the Sun: its best tracks sound infinitely better on the 2007 REM Live album.15. Up (1998)“I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog,” mused frontman Michael Stipe after drummer Bill Berry’s 1997 departure from REM. “It just has to learn to run differently.” Thus Up was heavy on synths and drum machines, muted, crepuscular – and a relative commercial failure. It’s too long and understated to a fault, but the best songs – Suspicion, Hope, Airportman – are worth trawling for.14. Reveal (2001)They had nearly split during the making of Up, and were now steadying the ship. Closer to the sound of “classic” REM (though there’s still a lot of electronics), Reveal is sunny but wistful. It may not be quite a return to peak songwriting form, but the single Imitation of Life is insanelycatchy.13. Collapse Into Now (2011)REM ended their career with an album that feels weirdly career-spanning. Oh My Heart – recently given a boost thanks to TV series The Bear – recalls their early 90s; Überlin and Discoverer evoke their college-rock years. It wasn’t the triumphant finale they might have hoped for – sales were indifferent – but no disaster either.12. Accelerate (2008)Both Stipe and Buck threatened to end REM if Around the Sun’s successor wasn’t an improvement; hence this Jacknife Lee-assisted attempt to harness the power of their acclaimed live shows in the studio. There’s plenty of grit and punch, with Buck’s Rickenbacker ringing out, and the songs are strong without providing a classic.11. Green (1988)View image in fullscreenBill Berry, Peter Buck, Michael Stipe and Mike Mills of REM in the 1980s.Photograph: Lora Voigt/ShutterstockStand and Pop Song 89 were REM at their most commercial, but Green was a darker, more introspective major-label debut than those singles suggested, as shown on World Leader Pretend, I Remember California, Hairshirt, and the oddly eerie love song You Are the Everything. The production makes it the most dated-sounding REM album, but there’s still a lot to love here.10. Chronic Town (1982)Their debut mini-album offers REM at their rawest: despite the experimentation that apparently took place – producer Mitch Easter deployed tape loops and recorded Stipe’s vocals outdoors – it sounded like a band playing live. InWolves, Lower, Carnival of Sorts (Boxcars) and Gardening at Night, it featured songs so great they needed no adornment.9. Out of Time (1991)View image in fullscreenStar power … the band circa 1994.Photograph: Chris Carroll/Corbis/Getty ImagesWidescreen and confident where Green was slightly scattered and tentative, Out of Time turned REM into superstars. Not everything here still works (although full marks for effort with the KRS-One collab Radio Song), but when Out of Time hits – Losing My Religion, Country Feedback, Me in Honey – it’s hugely impressive.8. Monster (1994)Made by a band in turmoil – they temporarily broke up during its recording – Monster is effectively old-fashioned REM (guitars far louder than vocals) put through a distorted glam-rock filter. Its lyrics are preoccupied with sexuality: Stipe came out after its release. Not what a mainstream audience wanted in 1994, it sounds pretty magnificent now.7. Reckoning (1984)You would never know that Reckoning was written and recorded in a hurry by a band exhausted by touring. Crisper and more straightforward than their debut, it feels awesomely confident, although Stipe’s vocals, plaintive but hard to understand, retained an enigmatic air, particularly on standout So. Central Rain (I’m Sorry).6. New Adventures in Hi-Fi (1996)Partly recorded during the seemingly cursed Monster tour, this is perhaps REM’s last unequivocal triumph. New Adventures in Hi-Fi is filled with weary disillusion – “The fame thing, I don’t get it,” sings Stipe, who had just signed one of the biggest record deals in history – but also with raggedly wonderful songs: the closingElectroliteis a career high.5. Fables of the Reconstruction (1985)The REM album that most betrays their geographical roots – or perhaps the tense recording sessions. A southern gothic darkness hangs over even the upbeat tracks: Life and How to Live It deals with mental illness, and there’s something ominous about Driver 8. Less ecstatically received than its predecessors on release, it sounds incredible 40 years on.4. Document (1987)Their biggest album at that point was also REM’s bleakest, filled with intimations of environmental collapse and horror at Reagan-era America: even the joyous It’s the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine) has obvious apocalyptic overtones. Here they sound arena-ready, without compromising their vision or quality.3. Lifes Rich Pageant (1986)View image in fullscreenStipe and Buck on stage in the 1980s.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsA joy from start (the distorted folk-rock guitar figure that introduces Begin the Begin) to finish (the fantastic cover of the Clique’s late 60s obscurity Superman), Lifes Rich Pageant was forceful where its predecessors had been oblique. It features an embarrassment of songwriting riches: Cuyahoga, Fall On Me, These Days.2. Murmur (1983)The genius of REM’s debut album proper lies not just in the magnificent songwriting but the sense of mystery it conveyed. Everything – title, cover, lyrics, an atmospheric production that buries the vocals and pushes the drums – was inscrutable. Here is music rooted in various traditions, from folk-rock to post-punk, that at the time seemed utterly fresh.1. Automatic for the People (1992)Not everyone was delighted by REM’s huge mainstream success: naysaying former fans were winningly invited to “kiss my ass” by Buck, and, listening to their biggest album, it’s hard to see what their problem was. It’s packed with fantastic songs, dark in tone (The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite and Man on the Moon offer rare glimpses of light) and unexpected in its influences: opener Drive was inspired by David Essex’s Rock On. Everybody Hurts is probably too overplayed to pack the emotional punch it once did, but Nightswimming is still incredibly moving, and if you’re sick of the hits, the deeper cuts sound glorious.Explore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockIndieREMfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Enjoy it while it lastsThu 5 Jun 2025 18.13 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 18.39 EDTShareIf you paid attention during physics class you will remember the third law of ego-dynamics. Namely: when two egos of equal mass occupy the same orbit, the system will eventually become unstable, resulting in an explosive separation and some very nasty tweets.To see this theory in action please have a gander at the dramatic collapse of theDonald TrumpandElon Muskbromance. The news has been a nonstop horror show for what feels like forever. Watching two of the very worst people in the world direct their nastiness at each other is extremely cathartic.While I won’t contain my glee, I will collect myself long enough to go over the backstory. First, as you know,Musk spent $277mto help get Trump elected. If this happened somewhere else we would call it corruption and the US might invade the country to install democracy. But this is the US we’re talking about, so it was fine.After Musk donated all thosequids,Trump provided thequo.Musk got his Doge gig, through which he weakened all the agencies that wereregulating his businessesin the name of saving the US a load of money.So long, Elon: the cuts didn’t go to plan, but you completely shredded your reputation | Marina HydeRead moreThis is the point where things started to go wrong andMusk’s reputationstarted to tank. Over the years the billionaire had managed to convince a depressingly large number of people that he was some sort of genius rocket man with anti-establishment views. Once he became part of the establishment, however, and started slashing federal jobs, a lot of people started to get annoyed with how much influence he had over their lives.Musk may be a space cadet but even he could see how much he was destroying his brand. It didn’t help, of course, that Tesla shares were dropping.Soa week agohe did the sensible thing and announced that he was leaving his role with theTrump administration. Rather more interestingly, however, the “first buddy” publicly criticized Trump’s marquee tax bill. Whispers of a rift between Musk and Trump started circulating.At first when Musk parted ways with theTrump administrationI thought the public divorce might be smoke and mirrors: a mutually beneficial PR exercise. Trump got rid of a creepy weirdo who nobody liked and kept causing him problems. Musk got to show his worried investors that he was putting all his energy back into the companies he’s supposed to be running. Rumours of a fallout, I thought, were greatly exaggerated.On Thursday, however, things escalated to the point where I don’t think this fallout can possibly be manufactured or exaggerated.Thursday afternoon, you see, is when the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein entered the chat. Writing on the social network he spent billions buying,Musk tweeted: “Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrumpis in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” To be extra messy he added: “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”It’s worth noting that Musk, a man who reportedly foists his sperm on every woman of a certain age that he meets, has a well-documented history of calling other people sex offenders. The self-sabotage probably started when he called the British cave explorer Vernon Unsworth a“pedo guy”in 2018, without any justification, after Unsworth helped rescue 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave. Musk, in case you had forgotten, had made a lot of noise about how he was going to rescue the kids with a very special little submarine. He did not, in fact, rescue any children and Unsworth hurt the billionaire’s feelings when hesuggestedMusk “stick his submarine where it hurts”.Still, while Musk does not think before he tweets, this seems a tad reckless even for him. It certainly goes well beyond the bounds of “manufactured PR brawl” and enters “burning bridges” territory. And, of course, having been in bed with the guy you’ve just implied was in Epstein’s circle doesn’t exactly make you look good does it?As well as tweeting about Epstein, Musk also said Trump would have “lost the election” if he hadn’t intervened with his hundreds of millions. Musk also suggested that he might start a new political party.Trump, meanwhile, hasn’t exactly been holding his tongue. He called Musk “crazy” and threatened to cut off government contracts with the billionaire’s companies.So is this the end of a big, beautiful friendship? Is it, as conspiracy theorist and Trump ally Laura Loomerput it: “a Big beautiful breakup”?While it feels like it, we should remember that Trump has kissed and made up with his haters before. While the president has very thin skin (all that bronzer can wreak havoc on the epidermis), he’s also a pragmatist.Just look at “Little Marco” AKA Marco Rubio AKA the secretary of state. Before the 2016 election, Rubio described Trump as a “con artist” and suggested he had bladder issues. Trump, meanwhile,called Rubioa “nervous basket case” who was the sweatiest person he’d ever met. “It’s disgusting,” he said. “We need somebody that doesn’t have whatever it is that he’s got.” Various other barbs were exchanged but, almost a decade on, all seems to be forgiven. The two men are now as thick as thieves.It’s also possible that, as a simple woman, I can’t comprehend the testosterone-infused intricacies of what’s going on with Musk and Trump. Conservative commentatorJack Posobiec helpfully tweeted: “Some of y’all cant handle 2 high agency males going at it and it really shows. This is direct communication (phallocentric) vs indirect communication (gynocentric).”Still, while there may eventually be some sort of reconciliation, I for one am enjoying the drama. I think we all are. Well, maybe not Kanye West AKA Ye. On Thursday the disgraced rapper tweeted: “Brooooos please nooooo […] We love you both so much.” As Musk might sayhimself: bet you did Nazi that coming.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsXJeffrey EpsteinInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

We came together in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It was like college: hanging out with my friends, having fun, not really acting. For four weeks we were in boot camp, where we’d dance and do conditioning in the mornings – so sit-ups, stretching and learning the choreography. In the afternoons, we’d learn our 10-part harmonies and go into the recording studio. Sometimes we were really dorky and said: on Friday we’re all going to wear the same colour T-shirts, just to be like a squad.You’ve worked withSir Derek Jacobitwice – in Juliet &Romeo, and the upcoming Tinsel Town. How was he?Derekj2210It was pretty cool to be in scenes with him. Even though we weren’t doing the iambic pentameter, it was interesting to watch how the language fell off his tongue. We were filming in this medieval Italian church. It was zero degrees, but he was so easygoing: always telling stories, with this fun grandpa vibe. He’s one of the most amazing Shakespearean actors ever: in his 80s, still crushing every line. I kept wanting to get selfies with him, because he really is one of the greats.Greggs gave me a £50 VIP voucher: four sausage rolls for the price of three. That’s a lot of sausage rollsI felt the same when I worked with Dame Judi Dench onCats. When I started acting, I always wanted to be like Dame Judi, because I thought I was going to be a serious actor. It just turned out that people like laughing at me. She’s like your grandma, in that you just want to hold her hand, and help her. She’s also got a wicked sense of humour: she’d be throwing out jokes and cursing, which I thought was hilarious. There have been a few times I’ve had to pinch myself. I had to do a boot camp with Sir Ian McKellen for Cats; at one point we were crawling around on the floor, pretending to lick each other. It was so funny.View image in fullscreen‘Universal is developing scripts for another film … the fanbase for Pitch Perfect is awesome.’Photograph: Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures/AllstarWhat is it like being a guest onthe Graham Norton Show? I enjoyedyour rapand the way you took your heels off.VegansRuleThePlanetGraham Norton is such a master of the talkshow. Other talkshows can be a bit of a struggle, but with him, it really is just like having a chat. I did the rap because I was telling the story of when I was 11, I had a rap group with my sister, which was probably the most uncool thing ever, seeing as we were two white girls from Sydney. I took my shoes off because I’m terrible at doing anything in high heels. I do try to wear them to be classy on the night-time talkshows, but I’m terrible at moving in heels: I move like a shuffling wombat.Youwon $250,000 for charity on the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Does this mean you’re not such a Rebel Without a Cause?vammypWe had a great cause: the money sponsored a school in Tanzania, and helped put 40 kids through college. Some have already graduated. The medical students still send me video updates every six months. It’s surreal that going on a gameshow for half an hour resulted in putting 40 kids through college in Africa.My heart rate was pumping because I wanted to win as much money for charity as I could. You think: oh my God, please don’t be an idiot. I play a lot of dumb, stupid characters, but in real life, I do have two degrees – in theatre and performance studies, and law.View image in fullscreenRebel in the 2022 film The Almond and the Seahorse.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyI have a charitable connection to Africa because when I was 18, I did a gap year, and travelled from South Africa to Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. When I got to Mozambique, I got malaria really badly. We didn’t have time to put up the mosquito nets and I woke up with my face covered in mosquito bites. Two weeks later, I was in hospital because it was a really bad strain. I don’t know whether it was the disease or the drugs, but I was hallucinating really badly, and I hallucinated that I won an Academy Award. It was so visceral and real that I came out of hospital and said: “Hey everyone, I think I’m going to become an actor now.” The South Africans were like: “Ah, no, Rebel. The malaria has demented your brain.” My parents were pushing me into law school, so I did law by day and acting by night.Has your positive body transformation led to different scripts coming your way?BradLopez22In the movie I just shot in the UK, Tinsel Town, I play the love interest to Kiefer Sutherland, which is probably not at all the kind of role you’d think I’d get cast as. There was a tendency to think: she’s no longer Fat Amy [from Pitch Perfect], so she can’t play those characters any more. There was a little bit of: also, is she still funny? I’ve just been offered the lead in a horror movie. So it’s not just comedies, musicals and romcoms. It’s good to surprise people.Did I have a Greggs? [Sutherland is anoutspoken fan, so Greggssent a vanto the set]. Yes. I enjoyed a sausage roll. Greggs gifted Kiefer and I a £50 VIP voucher, which I still have. You get four sausage rolls for the price of three as well. That’s a lot of sausage rolls.View image in fullscreenFeline fine … Rebel in Tom Hooper’s 2019 film Cats.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Working Title Films/Amblin Entertainment/AllstarPitch Perfect: The Reunion ...? Any plans for a fourth instalment?writeronthestormOh God, I hope so. We hear rumours all the time. I know Universal is developing some scripts. The fanbase for Pitch Perfect is so awesome and keeps growing as younger people are introduced to it. So, hopefully – there’s a huge desire for another movie.Marmite or Vegemite?TopTrampI’m actually a weird Australian: I don’t eat VegemiteorMarmite. I don’t know why. I just don’t like the look of it. If I was putting something on toast, I’d put Nutella.What role challenged you most?HamesJoyceI dida very small movie called The Almond and the Seahorse, which we filmed up in Liverpool and north Wales, about traumatic brain injury. Because it was such an intense subject, you had to go from zero to 100 emotionally within the same scene. I was like: how am I gonna do this? But it turned out really well, and challenged me a lot more than roles like Fat Amy where I get to sing, dance and be goofy.Juliet & Romeo will screen in selected UK cinemas for one night only on 11 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewRebel WilsonJudi DenchIan McKellenDerek JacobiPitch Perfect 2featuresShareReuse this content"

Then, at 50, I got an eye-opening diagnosis …I spent far too many years lonely and angry, thanks to schoolmates who called me ‘weird’ and bosses who dismissed me as ‘hysterical’. But was it my sexuality that put their backs up – or the autism I am still coming to terms with?Matt CainThu 5 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTShareMy earliest memory is of feeling different. I’m gay, and grew up in the 1980s, in a tough, working-class town in the north of England at the height of the Aids crisis. My gayness was obvious in the way I walked and talked. I was bullied at school, called a “poof”, “pansy” and “fairy”; other children did impressions of me with their wrists limp. I experienced physical violence, too. I was shoved, kicked, my head was slammed against the wall. I was punched in the face more than once.But it wasn’t just my sexuality that set me apart. I was “weird”. I had a rigid attachment to routine and was terribly shy, sometimes freezing in social situations. I needed to be on my own for long periods; not easy when you’re in a family of five and share a bedroom with your brother. I was obsessive, channelling this at first into the Star Wars films, then the Narnia novels and, as I got older, Madonna. Lots of kids have short-lived interests but mine were intense: I’d collect facts and statistics about Madonna, memorise the chart positions of her singles, then reel them off to anyone who would listen. If anyone criticised her, I took it as a personal attack and would be distraught.My anxiety was so acute, I’d bite my nails until my fingers bledI was easily upset in other ways. I was sensitive to touch and hated being cuddled, I burst into tears at the sound of fireworks. If I heard someone eating with their mouth open, I’d put my hands over my ears and run out of the room screaming. My anxiety was so acute, I’d bite my nails until my fingers bled.I found a few activities soothing. I had a security blanket, which I’d twiddle between my fingers. And I found comfort in repeating words or phrases, over and over again. Sometimes, I’d musicalise snatches of dialogue and skip around the house, singing them.View image in fullscreenCain (being held by his mum) with his grandparents and his brother and sister in Bolton in the early 80s.Photograph: Courtesy of Matt CainOn occasion, I’d lose control in the form of “meltdowns” – usually before school. I’d collapse on the floor, my body spasming with rage and tears, yanking off my glasses and throwing them across the room. When I was nine, I was sent away on a camp with the Cub Scouts. When I realised I had to share a tent with some of the boys who bullied me, I started being violently sick. I shivered and sweated so badly that my sleeping bag became soaking wet. The Scout leaders removed me from the tent and took me to sleep in their hut. When my parents came to collect me the next day, I felt a relief like I’d never felt before.A lot of my “weird” behaviour did fit with what, in the 80s, was considered to be “gay”. Adults would comment that I was “dramatic”, “oversensitive” or “overemotional”. I worked hard at school and was neat and fastidious – all seen as effeminate traits – earning me the label “girly swot”. In the working-class north of the 80s, nobody discussed mental health, let alone neurodivergence. There was no way that, as well as being gay, I could entertain the thought that there might be something different about my brain.So I tried to camouflage my weirdness. I copied other people’s behaviour and did everything I could to fit in.In 1994, I got into Cambridge University. Here, it was OK to be studious and gay. But I was now different for another reason: as a working-class kid from a comprehensive school, I was in a minority. The other students, mostly from private schools, did impressions of my northern accent. Sometimes, it was affectionate but often it was cruel. One of my tutors used to make me read out my work and encouraged the other students to laugh at me. I trained myself to avoid saying dangerous words like “cook”, “baby”, “Coke”, or that all-time killer for anyone from Lancashire, “fair hair”. I was often blunt with people, which was put down to my being from the north. But I was also incredibly anxious. For one entire term at Cambridge – in my second year, when I was sharing a room – I woke up every morning and vomited into the sink.In the late 90s, I started working in the media, an industry I knew would be welcoming to gay men. But work pressures seemed to have an impact on me more than others. When plans changed at the last minute, which happened often in TV, I wasn’t just stressed, it felt as if the world was ending. In the open-plan office I was surrounded by TVs and radios blasting and colleagues tapping and talking. The noise felt like an assault; but it only seemed to affect me.I got a job as a correspondent on Channel 4 News and became the subject of vitriol. Twitter users commented I was “ridiculously camp” or “double gay, even … he kills my ears”. The late Sunday Times critic AA Gill compared me to another effeminate man, declaring I was “to arts reporting what Wayne Sleep was to darts”. Although everyone is affected by criticism, with me it caused a hollow ache that lasted for weeks. It hurt so much because I assumed the abuse was homophobic. It took me right back to the school playground.Working on a separate TV documentary series, I was told it had to be re-edited to make me less camp. I objected but received an email response telling me to “MAN UP”. Of course, this could be upsetting to anyone. But I couldn’t control my fury. The bosses told me I was behaving “hysterically” – and I probably was. But I was also scared by how badly I’d lost control of my emotions.As a teenager, I’d discovered that alcohol could not only calm my anxiety but also allowed me to be a different version of myself; one that wasn’t shy but funny and outrageous. On any night out, I’d be the one more drunk than anyone else, doing whatever it took to get a laugh, stripteasing or skinny-dipping, initiating games of spin the bottle. As I moved up the career ladder, the parties I went to became more extravagant: I went to events sponsored by record labels where I was picked up in limos and plied with champagne. I was often at celebrity parties. I got so drunk at one event that Tara Palmer-Tomkinson toldmethat I looked wasted.View image in fullscreen‘If anyone criticised Madonna, I’d take it as a personal attack’ … Cain aged 16 in 1991.Photograph: Courtesy of Matt CainI struggled to maintain romantic relationships, with boyfriends often rejecting me for being “full-on”, and fell into a cycle of casual sex. Growing up, the few gay men I’d seen portrayed in the media were hypersexual – so I just thought this was what we did. At the end of many a night out I’d stagger on to a sex club or sauna for anonymous, sometimes reckless sex. Twice, I was robbed by a man I’d taken home. By the time I hit 30 I’d never had a boyfriend. It also dawned on me that I’d never had sex sober. I became lonely – terribly, breathtakingly, soul-shatteringly lonely.I decided to pursue my childhood dream and started writing fiction. But my first novel, the loosely autobiographical The Madonna of Bolton, was rejected by agents and publishers for 10 years. Much of the rejection was homophobic: one editor called my manuscript “too explicit for comfort”; another said that having a gay character was too “niche”. I thought the cutting despair I felt was gay shame, that after a childhood of absorbing the message that my sexuality was wrong, this was still what I believed deep down. Perhaps it was also why my drinking had become so self-destructive and I was punishing myself by engaging in dangerous sex. I started seeing a therapist, and quit drinking.I crowdfunded that first book, and it was followed by more successful novels with a traditional publisher. My childhood dream had come true – but I couldn’t enjoy it. I still experienced homophobia, with one publisher commenting that she didn’t want me to be “so explicit on the wider LGTB [sic] issues”.And I struggled to deal with the publishing industry’s treatment of working-class authors, especially when contracts took 10 months to process or royalty payments were late by up to 18 months. While some authors can be diplomatic in these situations, I was told by my agent that I was rude and lacked tact. I’d become fixated on the injustice, a storm raging in my head for weeks.Afew years ago a younger family member began to be investigated for autism. So I started researching it beyond the stereotypes. I learned that autism can express itself differently from person to person. While some people are hypersensitive to sounds and touch, others can be hyposensitive – the opposite. The same is true of emotions. I learned that the autistic spectrum isn’t a straight line going from less autistic to more autistic; some people liken it to a pie chart, with different sized slices representing different traits and abilities.I wondered whether autism could explain some of my behaviour. But as far as I knew, autistic people were also supposed to be devoid of empathy, whereas I struggled to control mine: I got so wound up watchingMr Bates vs the Post Officethat I couldn’t sleep for weeks. Autistic people were supposed to struggle with relationships. But I’d had several close friendships for decades and by this time I’d fallen in love and got married. Then a member of my husband’s family was diagnosed with autism, and I couldn’t help but wonder whether our relationship worked because he was used to people whose brains were wired differently.I felt profound grief for the past – for the missed opportunities, all the things I lostIn June 2024, I spoke to my GP. I was referred to a team of clinical psychologists specialising in late-in-life diagnosis. It’s difficult to untangle behaviour that’s symptomatic of neurodivergence from a personality that has been formed over decades of life experience; in my case, hyper-sensitivity and anger as a result of sustained homophobia and class snobbery.There was a waiting list of several months, pages of forms to fill in, and interviews with figures from my childhood that culminated in a five-hour assessment.You are autistic, they said. When I heard the words, my heart was hammering, my breath short and fast. But mainly what I felt was relief. After years of being misunderstood – of misunderstanding myself – I finally had the right framework to build up a better picture of who I truly am.View image in fullscreen‘I’d like to challenge the stereotypes that prevail – not to mention the prejudice’ … Matt Cain.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianA lot of my behaviour started to make sense: twiddling my security blanket was what I now recognise as “stimming” or self-stimulatory behaviour. As was my repetition of certain words and phrases, a habit known as “echolalia”. Then I learned that rejection sensitive dysphoria and emotional dysregulation are common among autistic people. As is anxiety, although autism in itself doesn’t produce anxiety, rather it seems to be caused by the challenges of living as a neurodivergent person in a neurotypical world.I was also diagnosed with ADHD, so needed to get my head around a second condition too. I discovered that some characteristics of autism and ADHD work against each other: autism needs routine and my ADHD needed spontaneity. But other characteristics overlap to create a heightened experience:I used alcohol to calm the anxiety produced by living with autism and, as ADHD causes lower levels of dopamine in the brain, I was driven to activities that boosted it – binge-drinking, risky sex. Understanding this released me from years of self-blame and guilt.In time, I’ve come to see that my neurodivergence has advantages. I feel emotions intensely but this also includes positive emotions such as happiness and joy. My capacity for emotion and empathy has been a great help in writing character-based fiction. My obsessive nature and need to spend long periods on my own mean I’m suited to immersing myself in the fictional worlds I create. And, while my ADHD helps ignite the initial sparks of creativity, my autism kicks in to make sure I knuckle down and bring these ideas to fruition.But I have also felt profound grief. This is primarily for the past, for all the missed opportunities, all the things I lost or had taken away from me. All the times I was criticised for behaviours that I didn’t realise were symptomatic of my autism.I also wonder what my life would have looked like if I had been diagnosed earlier: would I have applied for Cambridge or the job at Channel 4 News? Would I have persisted in writing fiction if I’d known that the rejection would cause me so much hurt? Of course, I should have been able to do these things with accommodations made for my neurodivergence, but the reality is that these allowances didn’t exist 30 – or even 10 – years ago.I’m beginning to make adjustments to my life, securing the accommodations I need. I’ve invested in noise-reducing earplugs, a weighted blanket that regulates my nervous system, and no longer stop myself singing randomly musicalised phrases. I only commit to social occasions I know make me feel good about myself. Likewise, I avoid sensory environments I know will make me uncomfortable and recover from sensory overwhelm by going for long walks in nature. Professionally, I ask for clear, unambiguous communication and I’ve also switched literary agents; my new representative handles the business side of my career to avoid any conflict.Recently, there have been claims that autism is being “over-diagnosed”. Given that it took me until the age of 50 to receive a diagnosis, I’d challenge this. I’d also like to challenge some of the stereotypes that prevail – not to mention the prejudice.Now I’ve written this article, I accept that I’ll always be seen as autistic. Some people might use this against me; if I have any disagreements, my point of view could be dismissed as an expression of my autism.But I also know that, at 50, there’s probably less time ahead of me than there is behind. And with that knowledge, I embark on a new journey, to finally start living as myself, to embrace my neurodivergence and create a life that works best for me.I’m ready.Matt Cain’s latest novel One Love is published by Headline (£9.99).

Trump and Musk had been careful not to hit each other directly, but on Thursday the pair discarded restraint as the feud escalated on their respective social media platforms.In the most churlish moment of the astonishing saga, Musk said on X the reason theTrump administrationhad not released the files into Epstein was because they implicated the president. He later quote-tweeted a post calling for Trump to be removed and said Trump’s tariffs would cause a recession.“Time to drop the really big bomb: Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Musk wrote, after Trump threatened to cut subsidies for Musk’s companies as it would save “billions”.Trump says he is ‘very disappointed’ in Elon Musk after attacks on tax billRead moreIt was a bizarre drama that served to underscore the degree to which Trump and Musk’s relationship has been one of mutual convenience, despite the White House claiming for months that they were simply ideologically aligned.It also caused the rightwing writer Ashley St Clair, who gave birth to Musk’s 14th known child and sued Musk for child support, to weigh in. “Let me know if u need any breakup advice,” she posted on X, tagging Trump.Shares inTesla, Musk’s electronic vehicle company, fell almost 15% on Thursday afternoon with the decline timed to when Trump’s remarks began. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, is not publicly traded, but competitors to SpaceX rose on the news.For weeks, Musk has complained about the budget bill, and used the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimating the bill would add $2.4tn to the deficit over the next decade as an opening to condemn the legislation as a “disgusting abomination”.On Thursday, Trump appeared to finally have had enough of Musk’s complaints. Speaking in the Oval Office as the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, looked on in bemusement,Trump mocked Musk’s recent black eyeand questioned why he didn’t cover it up.Elon Musk calls Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ tax bill a ‘disgusting abomination’Read more“You saw a man who was very happy when he stood behind the Oval desk. Even with a black eye. I said, do you want a little makeup? He said, no, I don’t think so. Which is interesting,” Trump said. “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more.”Trump then ratcheted up his barbs against Musk, accusing him of turning against the bill solely out of self-interest, as the bill did not benefit Tesla, Musk’s electronic vehicle company. Trump also pulled the nomination of Musk’s preferred candidate to lead Nasa.“I’m very disappointed with Elon,” Trump said. “He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we’re going to cut the EV mandate.”Musk then went on the warpath.Within minutes of Trump’s comments appearing in a clip on X, where Musk was responding in real time, Musk accused the president of lying about the bill, and accused Trump of being ungrateful for the millions he spent to get him elected.“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musksaid in a post on X. He added: “Such ingratitude.”Musk taking credit for Trump’s election win initially threatened to be the touchpoint for their relationship, given Trump had made a point to say that Musk’s contributions had no effect on him winning the battleground state of Pennsylvania.But then Trump posted on Truth Social that he had fired Musk from his role as a special adviser because he was “wearing thin” at the White House, and Musk responded: “Such an obvious lie. So sad.”It was less than a half an hour later that Musk fired off his Epstein tweet, in effect accusing him of being part of an alleged child sexual abuse ring linked to Epstein, using a dog whistle for the Maga movement to try to set them against the president.In doing so, Musk ignored his own connections to Epstein. In 2014, like Trump, Musk was photographed at a party with Ghislaine Maxwell, a former Epstein girlfriend who was convicted in 2021 on charges that she helped the financier’s sex-trafficking activities.The public feud comes after a remarkable partnership that lasted longer than many Democrats on Capitol Hill and in Trump’s orbit predicted.Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Trump’s re-election campaign through his specially created America Pac, which shouldered a large portion of Trump’s door-knocking campaign, although the actual impact of that ground-game effort is unclear.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsUS CongressUS SenateTeslanewsShareReuse this content"

Sarah Pochin, the new Reform MP for Runcorn and Helsby, had pressed Keir Starmer on the issue in parliament on Wednesday, and Farage had also said on GB News that it was time for a debate about the burqa.Hours before resigning, Yusuf had posted on X saying it was “dumb” for a party to have asked the prime minister to ban the burqa when it was not its own policy.In a statement on X, Yusuf said: “Eleven months ago I became chairman of Reform.“I’ve worked full-time as a volunteer to take the party from 14 to 30%, quadrupled its membership and delivered historic electoral results. I no longer believe working to get a Reform government elected is a good use of my time, and hereby resign the office.”Yusuf has been working on Reform’s new Elon Musk-style “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit looking at cutting spending in councils where the party is in control.The tech entrepreneur Nathaniel Fried, who was brought in this week with great fanfare to lead the unit, will also be departing alongside Yusuf, leaving the party’s plans to slash “waste” in local government in disarray.The Reform chair has been close to Farage over the last year and the party leader is “upset” about Yusuf going, according to Tim Montgomerie, a Reform supporter and commentator. Yusuf’s exit is likely to add to the impression that Farage struggles to retain senior figures in his parties.In a statement in response, Farage said he was “genuinely sorry that Zia Yusuf has decided to stand down as Reform UK chairman”.“As I said just last week, he was a huge factor in our success on May 1 and is an enormously talented person. Politics can be a highly pressured and difficult game and Zia has clearly had enough. He is a loss to us and public life,” he said.Farage expanded on the reasons for Yusuf’s departure on GB News, saying he could tell even before the burqa row that the chair had had enough and was “very disengaged”.He said he was sad and paid tribute to Yusuf’s organisational skills, but also suggested he had weaknesses.Revealing that he had 10 minutes warning of the resignation, Farage said: “When people have exceptional strengths in some areas of their life or other areas where perhaps they’re not quite so strong. I think, in terms of dealing with staff there was a bit of a Goldman Sachs-type mentality. I mean, politics is different,” he said. “And I think when you come from the background, he comes from, say, Goldman Sachs, where he worked, it is a really tough, brutal environment. Politics isn’t like that. Politics isn’t just about creating a financial bottom line, it’s about doing things that are thoughtful, creative and different.“So were his interpersonal skills at the top of his list of attributes? No. But I always found, with me, he was very polite, very objective in conversations that I had.”But Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats deputy leader, said:“By sacking himself, Zia Yusuf seems to be leading the ‘UK Doge’ by example. You have to admire his commitment to the cause.“It’s already clear Reform UK cannot deliver for the communities they are elected to stand up for. Instead, they have copied the Conservative playbook of fighting like rats in a sack.”View image in fullscreenSarah Pochin pressed Starmer on burqas in the Commons.Photograph: House of CommonsA Labour party spokesperson added: “If Nigel Farage can’t manage a handful of politicians, how on earth could he run a country? He has fallen out with everyone he has ever worked with.

But we don’t talk about race at all. We think everybody should be treated equally. We object very strongly to the segmentation of people into different types.”Some of Reform’s membership had already turned against Yusuf over his role inthe departure of one of the party’s most rightwing MPs, Rupert Lowe. Yusuf clashed with Lowe earlier this year. This led to Lowe’s suspension amid allegations of threats towards Yusuf, which were reported to the police. A decision was later taken not to charge the MP.Farage said he would “rather eat razor blades” than let Lowe back in the party.Yusuf is widely credited within Reform for having professionalised the party, hiring new people, setting up more branches and making it run in a more corporate way.However, he also rubbed some of the Reform old guard up the wrong way with his management style.Arron Banks, the Brexit donor and Reform mayoral candidate, was on Thursday night tipped as a potential successor as chair. In spite of Farage’s warm tribute to Yusuf, Banks posted on social media: “Astonishing that everyone thinks they are responsible for the meteoric Reform rise, as the old saying goes, success has many fathers and failure (is) an orphan. Zia worked very hard but struggled with relationships and people. The corks will be popping in party HQ this evening. Reform will power on …”Yusuf’s decision to go does not appear to have been long planned. He had been giving interviews over the last week about Reform’s plans to slash the state by £300bn, and to raise the birthrate by encouraging “fertile” British women to have more children.Earlier on Thursday, Richard Tice, the party’s deputy leader, confirmed that Reform was prepared to cut government spending to about 35% of national income – amounting to almost £300bn. He told the Politics Inside Out podcast that it had been a “great lie” told to the public that more money equalled better public services, and it should be possible to return spending ratios to mid-1990s levels. “At 35% of GDP, things were working more,” he said.Yusuf had also said over the weekend that it should be possible to slash the state by £300bn to £400bn.Dan Tomlinson, Labour’s mission champion for economic growth, said: “Reform’s fantasy economics would lead to a financial crisis whilst devastating public services. First they announced unfunded spending plans that would crash the economy like Liz Truss did, now they pledge to bulldoze through the public services people rely on every day.“The NHS, our defences, police on the street, and the criminal justice system – all would be under threat with Reform.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Undeserved bonuses will now be banned as part of the government’s plan to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas for good.”Bonuses have been banned for Thames Water’s chief executive, Chris Weston, and Steve Buck, its chief financial officer. Southern Water, UnitedUtilitiesand Yorkshire Water have also had bonuses banned for their chief executives and chief financial officers.Thames, which isstruggling to avoid collapsing into temporary state ownershipas it labours under debts of £20bn, was targeted both for its financial failures and for seven major pollution events, which took place in Slough, in Berkshire; Three Rivers District; the Chilterns; Sevenoaks; Reigate; Runnymede and Enfield last year.Andy Pymer, the chief finance officer of Wessex Water, had his bonus banned over the company’scriminal conviction last Novemberfor sewage leaks that killed thousands of fish, which the company failed to report.Mark Thurston, the boss of Anglian Water, is having his bonus banned for a serious pollution event in Peterborough last September.The other executives who will not be allowed to take bonuses are: Lawrence Gosden and Stuart Ledger, CEO and CFO respectively of Southern Water; Louise Beardmore and Phil Aspin, CEO and CFO respectively of United Utilities; and Nicola Shaw and Paul Inman, CEO and CFO respectively of Yorkshire Water.Last month the Guardian revealed Reed planned toblock Thames Waterfrom paying separate retention bonuses to senior executives from a £3bn emergency loan that was meant to stabilise the company’s finances and save it from collapse.Thames’s chair, Adrian Montague, defended the planned rewards of 50% of salary, arguing senior managers were the company’s “most precious resource”. Thames later announced it was pausing the retention bonus payments and Montague was forced to apologise to MPs last month, saying hemay have “misspoken”when he claimed lenders had insisted on the bonuses.On Tuesday, the US private equity firm KKRpulled out of a £4bn rescue dealfor Thames Water, putting the company’s future in doubt and increasing the prospect of a temporary nationalisation. KKR is understood to have decided the political risks of owning Thames were too great, and it was also concerned about the poor state of the company’s assets.The bonus ban comes into place immediately as part of what Reed promised to be tougher enforcement against failing water companies. Last year alone water executives were paid bonuses of £7.6m while overseeing record levels of pollution.Reed has been accused of putting off investors into England’s troubled water industry by his tough stance. The Conservative MP Victoria Atkins accused him in the Commons of undermining the rescue deal with negative rhetoric.But Reed said: “I will make no apology for tackling the poor behaviour of water companies and water company executives that took place under the previous government and that we are correcting.”Becky Malby, of the campaign group Ilkley Clean River, welcomed the bonus bans but said they were further evidence that the privatised industry could not be trusted.“We are seeing fines, bonus bans and criminal investigations into water companies. This shows us just how broken the system is,” she said. “The public has consistently wanted water companies to be publicly owned. What is it about this plethora of evidence that makes the government confident that the current privatised system can deliver?”James Wallace, chief executive of River Action, said: “Banning bonuses is a welcome step from the government. But we won’t end pollution for profit until water companies are refinanced and governed for public benefit. Any attempt to inflate base pay as a workaround must be stamped out. The era of rewarding criminal leadership must end. No more cream for the fat cats.”Caroline Voaden, MP for South Devon, said it was baffling why South West Water bosses had not had their bonuses banned. “It’s hard to think of a company more deserving to have its boss’s bonuses banned than South West Water,” she said. “Not only did the company preside over the cryptosporidium outbreak in the relevant financial year, but in June, just weeks after the outbreak, South West Water’s CEO saw her salary increased by £300,000, proving their absolute contempt for affected customers.”A spokesperson for Water UK, which represents the industry, said: “Performance-related pay is independently determined by remuneration committees, which will abide by the laws and regulations set by government. Water companies are focused on investing a record £104bn over the next five years to secure our water supplies, end sewage entering our rivers and seas and support economic growth.”Explore more on these topicsWater industryExecutive pay and bonusesCorporate governanceSteve ReedPollutionThames WaterUnited UtilitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Since April,fake reviews have been explicitly banned.Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive, said the undertakings secured fromAmazonmeant shoppers could now “make decisions with greater confidence”. The commitments mattered because “so many people use Amazon and what is clear is that star ratings and reviews have a huge impact on their choices”, she said.Amazon has committed to strengthening existing systems that detect fake reviews and to stamp out “catalogue abuse”. This is where sellers take the reviews of well-performing products and add them to an entirely separate and different product, falsely boosting its star rating.Businesses selling on Amazon face having sanctions imposed for catalogue abuse or for using fake reviews to boost product ratings – and could be banned from selling on the site altogether.Users who post fake reviews, positive or negative, also risk being banned and having all their previous reviews deleted. The retailer will also make it easier for shoppers to alert it to fake posts.The undertakings come after theCMA launched an investigation into Amazon and Googlein 2021 due to concerns that not enough was being done to remove fake reviews or to impose sanctions on the individuals or companies involved. Earlier this yearGoogle made similar pledges, including resolving to take action against repeat offenders.The CMA said it would now move on to scrutinising whether specialist review platforms, the businesses who list products on them and reviewers were complying with the tougher new laws.Under a new regulatory regime brought in under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024, the CMA can now decide independently whether consumer law has been infringed rather than going through the courts.It can also tackle consumer law breaches directly, including issuing fines, ordering businesses to improve their practices, and making them pay redress to affected consumers.Amazon said it already devoted significant resources to eliminating fake reviews and its efforts involved expert human investigators and machine learning models capable of analysing thousands of data points. In 2024 it blocked 275m fake reviews and said “more than 99% of all products in our store contain only authentic reviews”.A spokesperson added: “We also suspend, ban and take legal action against those who violate our policies and have teams dedicated to taking action against bad actors that attempt to solicit fake reviews for products.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonCompetition and Markets AuthorityRegulatorsConsumer affairsE-commerceInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

The children were scored using an international scale of family affluence, which is based on a number of factors including whether a child had their own room and the number of vehicles per household.Children were split into groups of high, medium and low affluence groups, and blood samples were used to measure children’s average telomere length in white blood cells, while the stress hormone cortisol was measured from urine.Telomeres are structures found within chromosomes that play an important role in cellular ageing and DNA integrity, and their degradation is linked to ageing. Telomeres become shorter as humans age.Previous studies have suggested a link between telomere length and chronic diseases, and that acute and chronic stress can reduce telomere length.The study found that children from the high affluence group had telomeres 5% longer on average compared with children from a low affluence group. Girls were found to have longer telomeres than boys, by an average of 5.6%, while children with a greater body mass index (BMI) had shorter telomeres by 0.18% for each percentage increase in fat mass.Children from the medium and high affluence groups had cortisol levels between 15.2% and 22.8% lower than children from the low affluence group.The authors acknowledged the study had some limitations in that the children analysed were not from families living in poverty, and that the study should not be interpreted as showing a link between affluence and “quality” of genes, but rather showing the indirect impact of environment on a known marker of ageing and long-term health.Dr Oliver Robinson, from Imperial’sschool of public healthand senior author of the study, said: “Our findings show a clear relationship between family affluence and a known marker for cellular ageing, with potentially lifelong patterns being shaped in the first decade of a child’s life.“It means that for some children, their economic background may put them at a biological disadvantage compared to those who have a better start in life. By failing to address this, we are setting children on a lifelong trajectory where they may be more likely to have less healthy and shorter lives.”Robinson added: “Our work suggests that being from a low affluence background is causing additional biological wear and tear. For children from the low affluent group this may be equivalent to approximately 10 years of ageing at the cellular level, compared to children from high affluence backgrounds.”Kendal Marston, from Imperial’s school of public health and the first author of the study, said: “We know that chronic exposure to stress causes biological wear and tear on the body. This has been demonstrated in animal studies at the cellular level – with stressed animals having shorter telomeres.“While our study couldn’t show that cortisol was the mechanism, it does demonstrate a link between affluence and telomere length, which we know in adulthood is related to lifespan and health. It may be that children from less affluent backgrounds are experiencing greater psychosocial stress. For example, they may be sharing a bedroom with family members, or they may not have the resources they need for school – like access to a computer for homework.”Explore more on these topicsInequalityChildren's healthMedical researchPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Get down!” Tataco yells, battling to control the vessel before its occupants are skewered by the lance-like boughs jutting out from the shore.Ripping thick vines from his neck, the boat’s 51-year-old skipper hauls the outboard motor from the murky waters, takes a deep breath, and prepares to continue the perilous voyage along a serpentine waterway so clogged with fallen trees it is virtually unnavigable.View image in fullscreenDamë Matis, an Indigenous activist from the Javari valley, pushes his canoe away from a tree during Evu’s dangerous two-day journey along the River Jordan in Amazonas state“We’ll get there,” Tataco says with his trademark bonhomie, despite the countless natural obstacles blocking the way. “It’s just going to take us a little while.”The group’s destination is the south-eastern tip of Brazil’s second-largest Indigenous territory – the Javari valley – a colossal wilderness the size of Scotland, where the British journalist Dom Phillips and the Brazilian activist Bruno Pereiravanished three years ago this week, on 5 June 2022.map v2To mark that anniversary the Guardian – which is today launching a major investigative podcast series about the men calledMissing in the Amazon– joined a gruelling week-long expedition with the activists Phillips was reporting on for his book when he and Pereira were ambushed and killed.Tataco – whose full name is Cristóvão Negreiros – and Matis are key members of Evu, an Indigenous patrol group Pereira helped found with his colleague Orlando Possuelo in the hope of protecting the estimated6,000 Indigenous people who live in the Javari territory, alongside the world’s greatest concentration ofuncontacted tribes.Since Pereira’s death, his collaborators havedramatically stepped up Evu’s activities, working tirelessly to train Indigenous activists to protect the Javari’s rainforests and rivers from illegal poachers, fishers, miners and drug traffickers.View image in fullscreenBruno Pereira at a Marubo village in the Javari valley in April 2018. Pereira was murdered in the Brazilian Amazon in 2022.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThe number of Evu members has risen from just over a dozen in 2021 to nearly 120 today, with the creation of six mobile teams, which use boats to roam each of the region’s main river systems: the Javari, the Itaquaí, the Ituí, the Curuçá, the Jaquirana and the Jutaí.In late May, Tataco, Matis and Possuelo journeyed deep into the jungles just south of the territory to recruit and train the last of those units: nine Indigenous men from the Kanamari people, a group with whom Pereira had spent countless nights singing and consuming the psychedelic brew ayahuasca.“I want to protect my land so nobody can invade it,” says Hitsambá Kanamari, a jovial 39-year-old from a village called Jarinal, who is one of Evu’s newest members.Hitsambá says poachers have been pillaging anteaters, deer, wild boar and river turtles from his supposedly protected Indigenous home. “There will be nothing left for our kids,” he complains, as Evu’s recruits gather in a clearing beside the Jordan River one morning.View image in fullscreenIndigenous families from the Kanamari people at their camp on the banks of the Jutaizinho RiverMany of the Kanamari recruits knew Pereira and recalled roving the jungle with him in search of clues about mysterious isolated Indigenous groups such as the Flecheiros – or Arrow People – who use poisoned darts to kill those they consider a threat.“Bruno was our leader – a good leader and a good man,” says Hitsambá’s father, a 60-year-old village chief called Tupiana Kanamari. Whenever Pereira visited his community, they would stay up late “drinking the vine” and chanting. “Snakes and jaguars [would] appear before you,” Tupiana says.Evu’s expedition began early one Tuesday in Eirunepé, a deprived and isolated river town weeks by boat from the state capital, Manaus. From there, the group hiked north through farmland towards the Javari, with support from two cows, which dragged their equipment – including two 22ft aluminium canoes – into the bush. One of the mud-caked animals was called Pontinha, which roughly translates as Spearhead; the other Senna – a playful reference to the Formula One star Ayrton Senna.A venomous coral snake crawled into the open-air kitchen, its spectacular red, black and white bands contrasting with the forest floorSpearhead and the faster-moving Senna grunted and strained as they trudged towards one of the frontlines of the efforts to save the Amazon, stopping occasionally to rest and feast on succulent rose apples littering the ground.By Thursday the boats had reached the edge of the rainforest. In groups of six, the Indigenous men and their non-Indigenous allies heaved them on to their shoulders and carried them for hours up and down steep, muddy ravines cluttered with decomposing trees towards their camp by the Jordan River, a peanut-coloured backwater that meanders north towards the edge of the Javari territory. Night had fallen by the time they completed their back-breaking,Fitzcarraldo-style mission. Many of the sweat-drenched activists were so drained they struggled to stand.Heat exhaustion was far from the only danger the Evu activists faced. One night, a South American bushmaster – one of the world’s longest venomous snakes – entered their encampment before one of the men subdued it with a wooden club. Another morning, a venomous coral snake crawled into their open-air kitchen, its spectacular red, black and white bands contrasting with the leaf-strewn forest floor.View image in fullscreenThe boats are carried on shoulders though the rainforest to the River JordanOver breakfast, one of the camp’s cooks, José Gomes da Silva, recalled once being attacked by a puma while hunting nearby. “She pounced and sunk her claws right into me … I was covered in blood, cut to shreds,” he said, showing his scars. As a group of Indigenous children arrived in the camp with a dead porcupine for their dinner, Silva warned: “There are loads of jaguars in the forests around here.”Unbeknown to the group, the most treacherous part of Evu’s mission still lay ahead: piloting its two new canoes down the Jordan to the mouth of the Jutaizinho where the vessels would be stationed at a new base the activists were building to keep outsiders out of the protected Indigenous area.View image in fullscreen‘Tataco’ Cristóvão Negreiros, 51, one of the key members of the Evu Indigenous patrol team, holds a venomous pit viper found during its expeditionKanamari villagers, who travel the creek in traditional wooden rafts known ascochos, had told Possuelo they believed the waterway to be relatively free of debris and could be navigated easily. The opposite was true. Within minutes of casting off, Tataco and his team had run into their first obstacle: an immense snarl of fallen trees and branches that formed a seemingly impenetrable barrier.Tataco’s brother-in-law, Valdeci da Silva Castilho, sprang into action, using a chainsaw and machete to shear and slice his way through scores of natural barricades, sawdust flying into the air as he pushed downriver.When the boats were able to advance, they repeatedly ricocheted off the banks of the narrow creek, plunging the crew into spiky thickets filled with ants, spiders and venomous caterpillars. At one point this reporter was thrown head-first into the lukewarm water as two creepers crashed down from the riverside. At other moments the crew was forced to duck for cover or hurl themselves on to the deck to avoid trunks that had fallen across the river. A nest of ferocious Amazonian wasps calledcabaslanded in Possuelo’s boat as he cut his way through one fallen tree, sending him scrambling to hurl it into the river before anyone was stung. Water snakes darted across the surface.‘Blood timber’: western firms fuel conflict and ‘slavery’ in ColombiaRead moreFor two punishing, tense days the group crept forwards, guided by hand-sized blue morpho butterflies that drifted over the boats’ bows.View image in fullscreenThe Evu team cuts through fallen trees blocking the River JordanFinally, on day six of the expedition, the much broader Jutaizinho River came into view and the team breathed a collective sigh of relief. Matis, who wears traditional face-piercings made from a palm called thepatauá, waved his hands towards a cloud-filled sky to ward off rain and the two-boat convoy cruised along the jungle-flanked channel marking the start of the Javari’s Indigenous lands.Evu’s operations have expanded hugely since its activists spearheaded the 2022 hunt for Phillips and Pereira. But the dangers and death threats facing its members remain, despite the government’s efforts to slash deforestation and defend Indigenous communities under the leftwing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, after four years of devastation under the far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro.Possuelo says he believes the threat level is, if anything, increasing, as Evu’s activities have earned it a growing number of enemies among criminal gangs, furious that the group’s work means it is becoming harder toplunder natural resources such as gold and giant pirarucu fish.View image in fullscreenOrlando Possuelo (second left), 40, an Indigenous expert who helped create the Evu patrol team with Bruno Pereira, addresses its newest members from the Kanamari peopleIn January, Possuelo got wind of a plan to kill him in Tabatinga, a notoriously violent town on the border with Colombia. “As if the risks of the rainforest weren’t enough,” he sighs.“But little by little I think we’re changing the reality here,” he says.Tataco, a hardened rainforest veteran who helped leadthe 10-day search for Phillips and Pereira, sheds tears as he describes his personal quest to protect the Amazon and its Indigenous inhabitants. Relatives have begged him to step back from the battlefront and seek safer work but he refuses.“I won’t give up … I’m going to carry on until they kill me.

Others who left the party – or who have been ejected from it – were angered by his corporate approach, which they blamed for making it a cold house for grassroots veterans and mavericks.In his 11 months as Reform’s chair, Yusuf brought with him the ethos and language that might be more associated with a vibrant tech start-up than a hard-right British political party.A businessman who made a fortune from selling his luxury concierge service, Velocity Black, in 2023 for a reported $300m, Yusuf exploded on to the political scene last June by donating a six-figure sum to Farage’s party.The two men had known each other for years, having met at a party hosted by the former Ukip treasurer Stuart Wheeler.In his new role at Reform, Yusuf oversaw a restructuring of the party from branch level upwards, pledging to introduce bespoke technology and enforce the tightest vetting of any political party in Britain in a bid to root out cranks and extremists.At rallies, he was a regular speaker, initially wowing the grassroots and earning the discreet praise even of political rivals. He was often one of the few non-white people in the room and was the living embodiment of Farage’s insistence that Reform was not a racist party.As recently as Monday, Farage sought to fend off allegations of racism and xenophobia being levelled at Reform, by pointing out at a press conference in Scotland that his party’s chair was Scottish born and had “parents who come from the Indian subcontinent”.But there had long been rumours that all was not well in Reform, not least after the falling-out that ledto the departure of its Great Yarmouth MP, Rupert Lowe. Aside from the online abuse, Yusuf is said to have been increasingly at odds with other senior figures in the party.This week’s controversy over comments in parliament by Reform’s newest MP, Sarah Pochin, in whichshe called on the prime minister to ban the burqa, appears to have been the straw that broke the camel’s back. Yusuf wrote on X that it was a “dumb” question, given that was not party policy.For some time, Farage and Yusuf appeared to be joined at the hip, frequently appearing side by side, but the party leader did not come in behind his young chair on the Pochin issue.Yusuf’s tweet on X announcing his departure was as blunt as it gets. Crediting himself with having “quadrupled Reform’s membership and delivered historic electoral results”, he added: “I no longer believe working to get a Reform government elected is a good use of my time.”The response from Farage – also delivered, as custom now dictates, on X – was, on the surface, laudatory, with the leader describing him as “a huge factor in our success”.Yet, a paternalistic tone was obvious. “Politics can be a highly pressured and difficult game and Zia has clearly had enough,” Farage said.Looking back at the longer sweep of the Reform UK leader’s political career, the parting of ways is on brand. Farage’s time in charge of various parties – from Ukip to the Brexit party – has been littered with fallings-out. There is, as many of his admirers and critics agree, room for only one trailblazer at the top of any Farage-led party.However, at a time when Reform is riding high in the polls, the departure of Yusuf comes with a serious question. Could this be the thread that unravels the seemingly unstoppable Reform juggernaut?Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageanalysisShareReuse this content"

The presidential proclamation cited Harvard’s links with China as a particular cause for concern.‘They are in shock’: Indian students fear Trump has ended their American dreamRead moreFor Jerry*, a 22-year-old applied mathematics student at the University of California, Los Angeles, the uncertainty started last month, when the Trump administration suddenlyhalted Harvard University’s ability to enrol any international students.Jerry has a place on a health data science masters programme at Harvard, which is due to start in the autumn. The US government’s attempt to ban Harvard from accepting international students appears to have beenblocked, at least temporarily, by the courts. But Trump’s announcement on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority.Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, hasannounced that the authorities willbe targeting Chinese students specifically, nationwide.It is “total discrimination,” Jerry said. “I don’t think anyone would consider that reason sufficient. That’s just pushing Chinese students to go elsewhere”.Unsure about whether or not he will be able to enrol at Harvard, Jerry is considering taking up a place on a PhD programme at Oxford University in the UK. He said on Thursday that following Trump’s latest attack on Harvard, Oxford seems like an even more likely option.Although he hopes to study at Harvard, Jerry feels lucky to have a back-up plan. “A lot of the people who accepted Harvard offers don’t have other options. So it must be much more anxious for them”.Across the US, universities have been scrambling to find ways to reassure the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students on their campuses about their academic future.In a memo sent to Chinese students at University of Oregon, the school described the state department’s announcement about revoking the visas for Chinese students as “vague” and said: “A revoked passport does not impact your legal status in the US because it is only an entry document used when entering the US”. However, the university warned that a revoked visa could lead to removal proceedings by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).Warning about being targeted by ICE have taken on a new gravity since the agency started targeting international students with the lawful right to remain in the country. They includeMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestine activist who was detained despite holding a green card to reside in the US. Khalil is now fighting a deportation order.Steven*, a 34-year-old Chinese PhD student at the University of Oregon, said that although he is not planning to apply for a new student visa soon, the prospect of an encounter with ICE concerned him. “Nowadays, even if you have a green card, you have legitimate status, you could get caught by ICE, because these guys are crazy”.Steven has been in the US for a decade. In that time, the US has become a less attractive destination for Chinese students, he said, something he sees borne out in his part-time job helping Chinese students with their college applications. The numbers wanting to study in the US have declined, with people favouring countries in South-east Asia, such as Singapore, which are more culturally similar to China. The US is “just not that friendly” any more, Steven says.The loss of top Chinese students in the US would be a blow to academic research, and to the funding for higher education institutions, experts say.In the 2023-2024 academic year, there were about 277,400 Chinese students in the US, according to government statistics. That is a 25% drop compared to 2019-2020.“By barring Chinese students and scholars from America, theTrump administrationwill strangle the pipeline of high-end talent into our universities, companies, and research institutes, sparking a serious deficit in talent and expertise that will damage American competitiveness,” said Denis Simon, non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute, who specialises in science and technology policy in China.The state department’s announcement last week specified that students with connections to the Chinese Communist party (CCP) or studying in “critical fields” would be included in the visa crackdown.For years, the US has tried to root out Chinese espionage in academia, with concerns raised about CCP-backed programmes to recruit top talent in science and technology fields that are strategically important to China. But academics and campaigners say that this has bled over into racism, with all Chinese researchers or those of Chinese heritage being treated with suspicion.Jerry, the mathematics student, said he has experienced discrimination in the US, but not on campus. But if Chinese researchers, staff and PhD students feel they have to leave the US because of an increasingly hostile environment, “it’s going to be a disaster for American universities,” he said.*Names have been changedAdditional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaTrump administrationHigher educationAsia PacificUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bassem Abudagga paced around his flat in Manchester waiting desperately for an answer. He knew from a WhatsApp group of 800 relatives, set up by his extended family inGaza, that houses near where his wife and two young children were holed up to the west of Khan Younis were being hit by Israeli missiles. His wife, Marim, was not picking up.“Every single minute, I am with them 24 hours a day and night. When there is any risk, I keep in contact all the time with them online,” he says. “It depends on the connections, sometimes they are very bad. Even when I am sleeping I keep the notifications very loud and I keep just waking up when one goes off. When they are at risk they just text me. It is very exhausting because they feel that if I am in touch with them it is like a hope, they just hold it. I cannot sleep if there is a bombardment.”On this occasion, a month ago, contact was lost. Abudagga, a lecturer in business studies fromAl-Azhar University in Gazawho is on a British Council scholarship to the UK, tried making an international call to Marim. But there was no response. “They were very, very hard moments,” he recalls. “Everyone texted me and asked: ‘Have you any information?’ And I said: ‘No information.’ These moments went on for five to 10 minutes – but it was so long. The first message I finally received was from my mum [who was also staying in the house]. It said: ‘We are all safe.’ It was a moment of pure relief.”View image in fullscreenBassem Abudagga’s children, Karim and Talya, in a tent in Gaza during the last Eid.Photograph: Bassem AbudaggaThe couple’s five-year-old boy, Karim, had been unable to bear the sound of drones and left the bed in which they all had tried to sleep, crying. His nine-year-old sister, Talya, and Marim, without her phone, joined him and they had just hugged on the floor, terrified. The impact of the Israeli pounding shattered the windows but there was no direct strike on their building, just broken glass and dust everywhere. It was one of so many similar incidents. “They have survived on many such occasions, just by the mercy of God,” says Abudagga.That they are still alive may at times feel like a miracle. But exactly why Marim, Talya and Karim remain in Gaza at all and have not been evacuated to be with their father is a question now facing the UK Foreign Office andHome Office. The British Council, which awarded Bassem Abudagga his three-year scholarship to the UK to do his PhD in business studies at York St John University back in 2022, is sponsored by the Foreign Office.Under UK immigration rules Abudagga could have brought his family with him in 2022 but decided he could not afford to and that he would visit them when he could. He last saw them a few weeks before the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October, during a trip back to Gaza. Abudagga being a foreign student studying and working here (he lectures part-time in Manchester to earn money), the government does not question their right to be re-united in the UK. But it seems to Abudagga that it is doing nothing to allow it to happen.“The government could have done something,” says Abudagga. “I am entitled to have my family here and there are many British citizens who have been evacuated. I have all the papers in place.”‘I wish I had never come to the UK’: Palestinian academic despairs of getting visas for family stuck in GazaRead moreHis case has been taken up by the Labour MPs for York Central, Rachael Maskell, and Salford, Rebecca Long-Bailey. The Observer firsttook up Abudagga’s case in March last year. The authorities responded by saying that Marim must get fingerprints in order to make an application for she and her children to be evacuated. But this is impossible as there is no facility left standing in Gaza to do so. Abudagga has asked that the demand for fingerprints be deferred until they have crossed the border into Egypt – if they could ever find a way to do so.The Abudagga family’s suffering is one case among millions in Gaza, but it is unusual in being one for which the UK government bears a direct responsibility. Rachael Maskell said: “It is intensely frustrating when ministers are treating the case like any other, when Bassem was the only parent invited to join this UK study programme from a university in Gaza. These are exceptional circumstances for which the government must make an exception and stop hiding behind the bureaucracy which fails to support people in such desperate situations.”View image in fullscreenBassem Abudagga with Karim and Talya and his father during his last visit to Gaza.Photograph: Bassem AbudaggaMarim, Talya and Karim are now living in a tent near the sea in Gaza in an area the Israelis say is safe. “Of course it is not safe at all,” Abudagga says. Since the war began more than 250 members of his wider family have lost their lives. Every time they are displaced their entire life is uprooted.Two weeks ago, Abudagga sent a message to the MPs backing him and others who are trying to help, saying the situation was fast deteriorating. Of the children he said: “They are now in critical conditions: severely traumatised, living in constant fear of bombardment, and suffering from acute hunger and lack of access to basic needs. Their mother is doing everything in her power to care for them, but the burden has become crushing and unsustainable. We believe that facilitating the children’s evacuation – even without Marim for now – is essential not only to protect them, but also to ease her unbearable situation.” But nothing has changed.Abudagga’s supervisor at York St John University, Dr Alexandra Dales, which is providing him with extra financial assistance from its hardship fund, cannot speak highly enough of her student. “It is a privilege to supervise Bassem. He has shown incredible fortitude during the conflict and has continued studying throughout. It has been incredibly distressing to witness the impact of the conflict on Bassem and his family.”The British Council said it “has and will continue to urgently highlight Bassem’s case”. The Foreign Office said the case of the Abudagga family was a matter for the Home Office which in turn said: “Subject to meeting eligibility requirements, international students can bring dependents to the UK. The visa application centre in Gaza is currently closed; however, visa application centres are open and operating in Egypt and Jordan. It is longstanding government policy that we do not comment on individual cases.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHome OfficeMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesImmigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the coming months, she suggested, “Turnstile summer” would replace her ubiquitous “Brat summer”. Hedging her bets slightly, she also suggested that 2025 would be the summer of everyone from Addison Rae and PinkPantheress to Kali Uchis to Pulp. Nevertheless, Turnstile’s name stood out: the quintet are, at root, a hardcore punk band, a product of the fertile Baltimore scene that spawned Trapped Under Ice, Ruiner and Stout. For the most part, hardcore exists in its own world of rigid rules and codes, some distance from the mainstream: extant hardcore punk bands seldom get shouted out by huge pop stars.View image in fullscreenTurnstile: Never EnoughThen again, hardcore punk bands don’t tend to receive Grammy nominations or make the US Top 30, as Turnstile have done. Meanwhile, Charli xcx’s endorsement is just another celebrity nod in the band’s direction after backing from Metallica’s James Hetfield, Judas Priest’s Rob Halford, R&B star Miguel and Demi Lovato, who described them as her favourite band. Their tipping point came with the release of2021’s Glow On, on which frontman Brendan Yates moved his shouty vocal style towards singing, and the band expanded their musical remit in unexpected directions. They may be the only act in history to sound like a warp-speed hardcore band in the time-honoured tradition ofMinor Threator the Circle Jerks, and – entirely without irony or satirical intent – like the kind of glossy new-wave 80s pop to which hardcore was once ideologically opposed, on adjacent tracks of the same album.Four years on, Glow On’s stylistic shifts feel like a tentative dry run for Never Enough. Yates has abandoned the raw-throated aspect of his vocals entirely: the album’s lyrics seem to be dealing with relationship trauma in characteristic emo style (“lost my only friend”, “it’s unfair” etc), but something about his voice and melodies now recall Police-era Sting; there’s an occasional hint of AutoTune in the mix, too. Some of the experiments Turnstile conducted on Glow On are repeated – the vaguely Smiths-y jangle of that album’s Underwater Boi gets another airing on I Care, this time around decorated with what sounds like a Syndrum; guestDev Hynes, better known as alt-pop auteur Blood Orange, is engaged once more on Seein’ Stars, this time part of an impressive supporting cast that includesParamore’s Hayley Williams, Wire star Maestro Harrell and singer-songwriterFaye Webster.Turnstile: Look Out for Me – videoBut they’re joined by deeper forays into unexpected territory. Sunshower starts at 100mph, clatters to a halt, then reboots as a wall of proggy synthesiser and a lengthy flute solo, courtesy ofShabaka Hutchings. Dreaming has a curious, vaguely Latin American rhythmic slant, and horns courtesy members of jazzy funk bandBadBadNotGood. Dull, meanwhile, melds beefy nu-metal inspired choruses to glitchy electronic verses, the latter presumably the work of “additional producer” and xcx affiliateAG Cook. Elsewhere, there is neon-hued pop punk bathed in a dreamy swirl of echo (Time Is Happening), riffs borrowed from Black Sabbath (Sweet Leaf, to be specific, on Slowdive), distinctly U2-esque guitar solos and divebombing dubstep bass (Never Enough).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

No matter which direction Turnstile strike out in, it surprises rather than jars, the transitions smoothed out by an unfailing hooky melodicism that applies as much to distorted riffs as it does to pop-facing vocal lines. The synth-forward pop rock of Light Design and the trad hardcore of Sole might be at different ends of the stylistic spectrum, but they’re united by killer tunes. If the album has a problem, it’s not a lack of ideas or songwriting ability, but the occasional sense that Turnstile have ventured so far from their starting point that they’re in danger of losing their USP, or at least their ability to stamp their identity on the results. As songs, there’s nothing wrong with Seein’ Stars, the closing ballad Magic Man or the brief, electric piano-backed Ceiling, but they could be songs by any act within the vast, homogeneous mass of 21st-century music that exists in the grey area between rock and pop.In isolation, moments such as those can give you pause, but as part of the kaleidoscopic whole of Never Enough, they’re easy to overlook. There’s so much else happening, a profusion of ideas so deftly handled that it never feels sprawling or indulgent. If Turnstile’s grounding in hardcore has taught them anything, it’s the value of being concise. However unexpected their rise into the mainstream, it isn’t about to stop.This week Alexis listened toDemise of Love – Strange Little ConsequenceDaniel Avery, Phantasy Sound labelmate Ghost Culture and Working Men’s Club combine to make moody, delightful maximalist electronic pop.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPunkreviewsShareReuse this content"

Like a lottery win. LikeSpurs winning a European trophy. You can now add to those two: Mel Stride getting a full house for one of his speeches. Not even standing room was available.This just doesn’t happen to Mel. Normally you can book him a broom cupboard and there will still be plenty of space. His reputation for never saying anything of interest precedes him. Just not today. Maybe it was a slow news day. Maybe the refreshments on offer at the Royal Society of Arts were top dollar.Mel has a kind face. But no obvious talent or skillset. He is the shadow chancellor only because someone has to be. There are 120 Conservative MPs and almost all are either halfwits or certifiable or both. Plus the Tories have already tried Jeremy Hunt. Imagine coming second to Jezza in a two-horse race. Jezza only got the job as chancellor because he looked vaguely plausible. Someone who would fit in at the Bank of England. He knew less about the economy than I did. Just think: if you had been elected as a Tory MP in 2024, you could well be shadow chancellor now.But back to the Melster. He has the air of a rural bank manager who has been moved sideways to a branch scheduled for closure. Someone who has made a career out of saying no to nearly every mortgage proposal that crosses his desk, because that way he can never be accused of having made a risky investment. A cautious man who instinctively understands he is out of his depth in a puddle and who longs for a retirement out on the golf course.For reasons best known to himself, Mel chose Thursday to give his first keynote speech as shadow chancellor. Curiously, he decided to make the total failure of the Tory party his subject matter. Though whether that was wholly intentional is another matter. You never can be too sure with the Melster. He’s not as bright as he looks. And he doesn’t look very bright.He began with the analysis that the economy had largely stagnated for the last 17 years. Though he didn’t seem to have realised that his party had been in government for 14 of those. Everything was a bit of a mystery.However he did own up to the mini-budget of 2022 being a bit of a mistake. Not that he could bring himself to say the words “Liz” and “Truss”. That might make it a bit too real. But baby steps and all that. This was the first time that a Tory politician hadapologised in publicfor increasing everyone’s mortgages, so credit where credit was due.The Tory party was in a bit of a pickle, he confided. Things hadn’t gone quite as well as he had hoped. The average age of a Conservative voter was now 63, so his first announcement was to insist that though it had been wrong for Labour to U-turn on the winter fuel allowance it was also the right thing to do. On the two-child benefit cap, he was all for it. If a child had made the mistake of being born to hard-up parents it was right that it should be starved to death. Better that than a lifetime of scrounging. Pour encourager les autres.“Bats must be put up at Claridge’s,” the Melster continued, “and provided with butlers.” People in the audience began to look anxiously at one another. Was he OK? No one had anticipated Stride might be the master of the surreal. Perhaps he had decided that the only way he could get through his speech was with the assistance of psychedelics.Having concluded that the Tories, Reform and Labour were all rubbish and out of ideas he launched into a final paean to the UK. We were the country of Austen and punk rock. I’m so pretty, oh so pretty, I’m vacant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Andy and Mel are clearly old muckers and Andy had decided that his questions would be a lot more interesting than those of the assembled media. So let’s start out with a quickfire round. Love your suit, Mel. Where did you get it from? Where are you going on holiday this summer? And what would you do differently?We would do everything the same but differently, the Melster declared. A world of cautious radicalism where taxes would be cut but not in the way that She Who Must Not Be Named had done. Andy nodded. That all made complete sense to him. Bring it on. Let the good times roll on again. Reluctantly he let a few journalists have a go instead.The Mystic Melster allowed himself to indulge his fantasies. He yearned for a return to the 80s. The era in which he had grown up. When almost no one except him went to university. When he had no debt. When Maggie Thatcher and Richard Branson sailed up the Thames together with the sunlight playing on the water in an endless summer of opportunity. Other versions of the 1980s are available.As for Kemi? Who was Kemi? Oh yes, that Kemi. Kemi was absolutely terrific. In her quirky little way. Of course she didn’t have any real ideas, spent far too much time on social media and was generally hopeless at prime minister’s questions. But given time, she might improve a little bit. She could always hope. At this point, you began to wonder if Mel had delusions of grandeur and fancied a pop at the Tory leadership himself. Vote Mel. Less insane than all the others. It might even work.Come the end, even the usually irrepressibly cheerful Andy was looking a bit downcast at the way the last hour had gone. Could Mel just rewind a little and say something vaguely optimistic about the Tories? There must be some sunny uplands somewhere. Surely? The Melster looked confused. We needed a new age of thoughtfulness, he concluded. So that ruled him and theConservativesout. Meanwhile on social media, Liz Truss was tweeting that she wouldn’t rest till she had bankrupted the country a second time. The battle for irrelevance was far from over.Explore more on these topicsConservativesThe politics sketchMel StridenewsShareReuse this content"

Will its founder’s supercharged voting rights follow?Nils PratleyIt’s odd that the move comes as a ‘sunset clause’ that allows Kristo Käärmann enhanced rights here approaches expiryThu 5 Jun 2025 14.04 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 15.06 EDTShareBack in 2021,the arrival on the London stock market of Wise, a rapidly expanding money transfer company, generated a feelgood factor at a useful moment.It came a month after overhyped Deliverooflopped on debut. And, since Wise was a pure fintech business, as opposed to a pizza delivery outfit with an app, there was reason to think the UK might be getting its act together in the sector that politicians swoon over. Shoreditch’s finest, and its Estonian founders, would show the way in UK fintech. Wise sported a £9bn valuation.Now the company wantsto switch its primary listing to New Yorkin search of a wider pool of investors, more active trading in its shares and “a potential pathway to inclusion in major US [stock market] indices”. A secondary listing will be retained in London, but we know what usually happens. Nine-tenths of the share trading gravitates to the primary location.The obligatory description on these occasions – “a fresh blow for London” – applies. Wise, with revenues of £1.2bn and underlying pre-tax profits of £282m, is a bad one to see succumb to the temptations of New York.Rachel Reeves may take note. The chancellor is cajoling UK pension funds to shove cash into private markets (at a moment when even private equity insiders worry that the golden years for returns could be over) but it is the public markets that are more in need of love and affection from No 11. She won’t do it (almost certainly), but the first step would be to cut the UK’s uncompetitive 0.5% rate of stamp duty on share purchases.There is plenty of evidence that a reduction would pay for itself in increased trading.Yet let’s not overlook a weirdness about Wise’s move – and an unanswered question.The oddness is that the company, now so keen on getting into a US index, never tried to enter a UK one. At flotation, its dual-class share structure meant it could not be included in FTSE indices. Why not now join the grown-ups? With a £12bn valuation these days, Wise would rank halfway up the Footsie. It would be a big fish. The danger in having the main listing in New York is that the firm will be a relative minnow in a tech pond populated by the trillion-dollar likes of Nvidia. But that’s a risk its founder, Kristo Käärmann, is clearly prepared to take in pursuit of greater US visibility for “major US growth opportunities”.Or perhaps the dual voting structure is a bigger part of the story. Wise’s statement described the US listing as having “a structure that aligns with US market practices including those of our US-listed tech peers, which we believe allows us to remain laser-focused on delivering our mission”.That sounds suspiciously like a reference to the enhanced voting rights that now allow Käärmann to own 18% of the shares but have 50% of the votes. Such unequal arrangements cause little fuss in the US, but they remain controversial in the UK, even if they are now allowed for index-inclusion purposes after a change in the rules a couple of years ago.A key point about Käärmann’s supercharged rights, however, is that they are due to expire next summer under a “sunset clause” agreed at listing. Wise could, if it wished, ask its UK shareholders for an extension but that may cause a row in itself – a sunset is meant to mean what it says. Perhaps the company thinks it is easier to wrap continued enhanced rights into a package where the main element is the change of main listing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Free school meals for all children in England on universal credit is rightly being celebrated by schools, nurseries, further education colleges and children’s charities. There may only be 500,000 extra recipients estimated by the government now, but in the long run 1.7 million children will be eligible,says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “Fantastic news,”says the Child Poverty Action Group(CPAG), as 100,000 children will be lifted out of poverty by this annual £500 put back in parents’ pockets.Food matters. Hungry children can’t learn, and many miss school to avoid the public embarrassment of no dinner money and no packed lunch,according to CPAG’sPriced Out of School report. Strong evidence shows a rise in attainment and attendance if you feed children.The Feed the Future campaign findsnot just academic achievement but health, happiness, reduced obesity and lifetime earnings improve if children don’t go hungry. Surely that can’t surprise anyone.The universal breakfast clubs being rolled out now represent real progress. Strict rules stopping schools from demanding absurdly expensive uniforms, sometimes a not-so-subtle way to exclude poorer families, is another part of a developing anti-poverty strategy.But it’s complicated. Nothing in poverty numbers is easy. So while celebrating more meals for more children, we should question the total number of children lifted out of poverty. The government says it’s 100,000 and the IFS agrees. But look what happens when you factor in the dire effect of the upcoming £5bn disability and Pip cuts. Turn to the government’s own paper on the impact.Look at Annex B: “It is estimated that there will be an additional 250,000 people (including 50,000 children) in relative poverty after housing costs in financial year ending 2030 as a result of the modelled changes to social security.”As those receiving support from sources such as Pip lose their benefit, the family gets poorer. Some may find this offset by the addition of free school meals, but not all will qualify, and many families will still find themselves worse off once what they gain from having free school meals is set against benefit losses.The vote on disability benefit cuts is coming up shortly, with up to 170 Labour MPs reportedly ready to rebel. As the Department for Work and Pensions scurries toamend the proposalin time for the vote, it needs to take into account the danger of sending more children below the poverty threshold.Of the many severe critiques of the government’s Pathways to Work plan for these disability cuts, one of the most authoritative is theCitizens Advice response, Pathways to Poverty. It opens: “By refusing to properly consult on its plan to cut billions from disability benefits, the government is choosing not to ask questions it doesn’t want the answers to. The cuts will have a devastating impact on disabled people (and their children), sending hundreds of thousands into poverty, and many more into deeper poverty. This will result from a series of arbitrary reforms that have been designed around savings targets rather than improving outcomes, inflicting hardship on people in ways that the government doesn’t yet fully understand.”Few would doubt the need for the government to take action on the growing numbers of working-age people off sick with mental and physical ailments. Good plans to provide work coaches to help, not bully, them back into working life with an array of supports are unfolding. But the dash for cash suddenly and unexpectedly imposed on the DWP at the last moment when the Office for Budget Responsibility found a gap in Reeves’s proposed £5bn in savings has thrust more brutal cuts forward, regardless of circumstance. In 1997, New Labour’s New Deal to help people into work was a great success: money saved came from finding people jobs, not cutting their benefits in advance, something that was likely to reduce their work capability.The welcome new free school meals policy shines a light on the depths of poverty. How could the appallingly low family income of £7,400 have been the qualifier until now? In Northern Ireland the benchmark is twice as high. Wales and London have universal free meals for primary children; in Scotland, all pupils are eligible for the first five years of primary school. Labour inherited a tax and benefits system that had, since 2010, cut entitlements among families with children by £2,200 a year on average, with those out-of-work losing £5,500 a year,reports the IFS. Reversing that is an uphill task.Many children now getting free meals won’t be lifted out of poverty: it would take a lot more than £500 a year. Lifting the two-child cap would cost less than meals, in terms of freeing children from poverty. That estimated£3.5bn to abolish itwill have to be found by Liz Kendall and Bridget Phillipson’s child poverty taskforce, which will report at budget time in the autumn. There just is no way round it for a government that pledged to take more children out of poverty. Note that they call this free school meals announcement just a “down payment”. The best had better be yet to come.A final thought: for all the panic about disability claims, total working-age benefits as a proportion of government spending havenot risen in the past 20 years. What has happened is cuts for children have been offset by increases for triple-locked pensioners.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPovertyOpinionSchool mealsBenefitsLabourSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

Other countries realise this – when will UK politicians wake up?Thu 5 Jun 2025 11.32 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 12.46 EDTShareYet another attempt to inject sanity into Britain’s archaic drug laws has failed. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last month accepted Lord Falconer’s modest proposal todecriminalise the possessionof small amounts of cannabis. He was stamped on yet again by that citadel of reaction, the Home Office, and its boss, Yvette Cooper. Falconer’s distinguished group of lawyers, doctors and academics did not suggestlegalisation. They simply argued that treating people using cannabis as criminals served no purpose. It confused soft drugs with hard, was racially biased in its enforcement, diverted police time from more pressing matters and denied help to those who needed it.An old game of media interviews is to ask politicians if they have evertaken drugs. Prime ministers from David Cameron and Boris Johnson to Keir Starmer, as well as the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, have either admitted to taking them or refused to deny it. Politicians feel that what the middle classes do at university is harmless fun. If it happens on a council estate, however, it is a route to prison.The reality is that the divide in Britain is not between those “in favour” of cannabis and those against. It is between those who care about the impact of criminalisation and those who don’t, a subset of whom merely want to sound macho. Decriminalisation in one form or another has been proposed for a quarter of a century. In 2000 the Police Foundation committee on drugs, of which I was a member, adviseddowngrading cannabisfrom a class B to a class C drug and in effect decriminalising it – but politicians never followed through. This was despite apoll by the Mirrorin 1997 showing that almost two-thirds of the public were then in favour of decriminalisation.In 2004 cannabis wasreduced to class Cbut not decriminalised. Then, in 2009, Gordon Brown played tough and returned it to class B. The then home secretary sacked the government’s drug supremo, Prof David Nutt, for evenbreathing the word reform. By 2010 there were43,000 convictionsa year for drug possession,more than halfof them for cannabis. An internal government report recommended decriminalisation in 2016but was suppressed. The government even denied afreedom of information request, as if national security were at stake.The more studies and inquiries recommended reform, the more Whitehall dug in. Courts and jails became increasingly clogged and have remained so ever since. The hottest market for cannabis in Britainis now his majesty’s jails.The UK is adrift in the western world in still wasting billions on its “war on drugs”. Half of US states have legalised and licensed cannabis, including cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In California there arecannabis cafes, cannabis farming estates and evencannabis sommeliers.Of course there have been problems, not least withhard drugs in libertarian Oregon. New York’s licensing system has not worked, withillegal outlets outnumbering legal ones. But no one wants to go back. As it is, more Americans todaysmoke cannabis than tobacco, including an astonishing five times more among those aged 18 to 34. There has been no noticeable collapse in American people’s health. Even Donald Trump favourslegalising cannabisfor personal use in his home state of Florida.Other countries, such as Canada and Uruguay, have legalised cannabis. Many more have decriminalised possession, including Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and, as of last year, Germany, where individuals cangrow and use small quantities.Plenty of British police forces have also gone down the Falconer route to some degree. There has beende facto decriminalisation in Durhamand a number of other forces, as well as a successful but not repeated Metropolitan police trial in Lambeth, south London, in 2001.Other countries have researched, experimented and innovated. They have found ways to handle cannabis without disaster. Many places, such as Colorado, have taxed it and seen a boost in local revenue. Strong cannabis, or skunk, is bad for you but large numbers of Americans are clearly finding cannabis preferable to tobacco. It is not going away, any more than alcohol or cheeseburgers.British home secretaries behave like the politics addicts they are. They close their eyes and ears and scream. The real issue in Britain is not drugs. It is the systematic ruining by the state at vast expense of tens of thousands of young lives each year. The damage is done not by cannabis, but by criminalisation, which draws young people into gangs that deal it and from there towards hard drugs and imprisonment.The result is that society suffers a monster misdirection of police resources. Violent crime in Londonhas increasedalmost every year for the past decade. There has been a rise insexual assault, car and phone thefts and petty fraud. Shoplifting in London rose by an extraordinary54% last year. Imagine how much time the police would have were they not spending so much of it stopping, searching, and testing people for drugs.Volunteers struggling to combat drug use – defying the government by testing drugs at music festivals, combating Glasgow’s drug problem and keeping children out of county lines – have known one thing for the past quarter century. Whatever needs to be done about drugs, the criminal law as enforced in Britain is a useless answer. Police forces and charities have tried to advance decriminalisation against rigid opposition from Whitehall. As for elected mayors and local discretion, forget it. Westminster’s contempt for local democracy is unrivalled. The truth is that what is lacking is not more reports or more brains, it is more guts. On drugs, Britain is still in the dark ages.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCannabisOpinionDrugsSadiq KhanLabourHome OfficecommentShareReuse this content"

But I’ve spent three years trying to make amendsThu 5 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 11.48 EDTShareOne day in my late teens I found a pair of jeans that fitted me nicely. This was at the newly opened Merry Hill shopping centre in the Black Country. The jeans were an odd colour but I liked the cut of my jib in them. This was until I told a schoolfriend I’d bought some mustard-coloured jeans. “What kind of mustard?” he asked. “Not English, surely?”I’m afraid they were. But I stuck with them, resolving to wash the colour issue away. Sadly, thanks to the ferocity of the laundering, soon after I’d got them from English mustard down to dijon, they fell apart, bringing the whole unhappy episode to an end.Forty years on, farcically, I made the same poor purchasing decision all over again. I was on holiday in the Italian mountains and came across some (English) mustard-coloured hiking shorts in an outdoor shop. They fitted so nicely that I bought two pairs. I can only imagine that the fresh alpine air had addled my mind. But from Dudley to the Dolomites, a dope’s a dope.Back home, I washed them much more than I’d worn them. And the colour has shifted not a jot. Three years on, they are as mustard as they ever were. If you want to check the colour out, don some protective eyewear and Googlelynx 787. Remarkably, Helly Hansen is still selling them, so I’m not ploughing as lonely a furrow as it feels. Last week, my daughters begged me never to wear the shorts anywhere apart from in my garden, while gardening, and then only if I wasn’t expecting visitors.View image in fullscreenThe shorts, post-dye job.Photograph: Adrian ChilesDuring a pause in weeding, I hatched a plan. I’d dye the bloody things. Ignoring advice that polyamide is not for being dyed, I bought some dark blue stuff, boiled my shorts in it for an hour as directed, and to my considerable delight they are mustard no more. OK, they’re not exactly blue. In fact, they’re exactly green. A similar green to that sported by Australian park rangers, which is fine by me. I do like the colour, which is just as well as I strongly suspect the rest of my clothes will be green too after the next wash. As for the fashion police, I’ve been advised it’s an improvement but, to be on the safe side, best to stick to the garden for the time being.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMen's shortsOpinionMen's fashionJeansMen's trouserscommentShareReuse this content"

On 28 May, the court of international trade ruled his tariffs exceeded his constitutional authority. Point by point, the decision decimated Trump’s arguments as flimsy and false, implicitly castigated the Republican Congress for abdicating its constitutional responsibility, and reminded other courts, not least the supreme court, of the judicial branch’s obligation to exercise its authority regardless of the blustering of the executive and the fecklessness of the legislative branches.Trump’s tariffs, along with his withdrawal of active support for Ukraine and passivity toward his strongman father figure Vladimir Putin, have broken the western alliance, forcing the west to make its own arrangements with China, and cementing the idea for a generation to come that the United States is an untrustworthy and unstable partner.On the economic front, Trump’s tariffs have already begun to increase inflation, shutter trade, devalue the dollar, and undermine manufacturing. They will soon create shortages of all sorts of goods, ruin small business, and force layoffs that bring about stagflation that has not been seen since the 1970s, which was then the result of an external oil shock, not self-harm. On 3 June, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentreported that as a result, principally, of Trump’s tariffs, the US will suffer a decline in the rate of growth from what had been forecast this year. “Lower growth and less trade will hit incomes and slow job growth,” the OECDstated.As a political matter, besides being unpopular, Trump’s tariffs, in combination with his assaults on the institutions of civil and legal society, have drawn out the most intelligent and skillful members of the conservative legal establishment, who themselves have been some of the most crucial players in the rise of the right wing, to man the ramparts against him. These are not the familiar Never Trumpers, but newly engaged and potentially more dangerous foes.While corporate leaders uniformly abhor Trump’s tariffs, they have stifled themselves into a complicit silence on the road to serfdom. But Trump’s new enemies coming from the conservative citadel of the Federalist Society are filing brief after brief in the courts, upholding the law to halt his dictatorial march.Trump naturally cannot help but turn everything he touches into sordid scandal. After announcing his “Liberation Day” tariffs, which tanked the stock market, Trump declared a pause during which he promised he would sign, seal and deliver 90 deals in 90 days. But he has announcedonly a deal with Britain. Most of the deals Trump has seen have been with the Trump Organization. Under the shadow of a threatened 46% tariff, Vietnam, after a visit from Eric Trump, granted a $1bn Trump Tower in Ho Chi Minh City and a $1.5bn golf club and resort near Hanoi with “two championship golf courses”, relative crumbs alongside the billions the Trump family has accrued from across the Middle East, not to mention the $400m jet thathis team solicited from Qatarto serve as his palatial Air Force One.Standing before the white marble plinth of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington national cemetery on Memorial Day, 26 May, after reading prepared remarks about “our honored dead” to a gathering of Gold Star families, Donald Trump fell into a reverie about his divine destiny. “I have everything,” he said. Hespoke about the paradeof troops and tanks he has ordered for 14 June, his 79th birthday, which happens to coincide with the date that George Washington created the Continental army. “Amazing the way things work out. God did that, I believe that too. God did it.”Two days after Trump had mused about his election by heaven to possess “everything”, the court of international trade issued what theWall Street Journalcalled the “ruling heard ‘round the world … proving again that America doesn’t have a king who can rule by decree’”.The US court of appeals for DC then temporarilystayed the rulingwhile it considered the case. But the trade court’s decision to deny Trump his toys was comprehensive, blistering and devastating. Now, Trump’s trade war is his Vietnam, a quagmire of his own.Trump’s entire program dances on the head of his tariffs. By fiat, without congressional approval, he has willfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as cover for his helter-skelter gyrations to reshape the global economy according to his desire for domination of the Earth. He has further explained that his tariffs are necessary topay for the vast tax cutsfor the wealthy in his budget bill that would increase deficits. He claims that the tariffs will replace the revenue raised from income tax, fixed in the constitution by the 16th amendment, ratified in 1913. Without tariffs on the scope he projects his dream house of cards collapses. With his tariffs even as his stated minimal goal he blows up the world.The court of international trade, a court based on specialized expertise, whose judges have lifetime appointments, flatly stated that Trump’s use of the emergency law under which he claimed his authority does “not permit the president to impose tariffs in response to balance-of-payments deficits”, “exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the president”, “would create an unconstitutional delegation of power”, and is “contrary to law”.Having ruled that Trump’s worldwide tariffs are illegal, the court deemed his “trafficking tariffs” imposed on Canada and Mexico also lawless. Trump has asserted them on a contrived national security rationale of preventing the importation of fentanyl. But the court stated that Trump’s “use of tariffs as leverage … is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective but because … [the federal law] does not allow it”. Thus, the court concluded in both instances, “the worldwide and retaliatory tariff orders exceed any authority granted to the president … to regulate importation by means of tariffs. The trafficking tariffs fail because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders.”The trade court’s ruling suddenly exposed the extent to which Trump’s relationship with the conservative legal movement is unraveling. The fissure runs deeper and wider than name-calling. Trump’s trade war has morphed into a widespread civil war within the right with the core of the conservative legal establishment resisting him.Trump’s venomous social media posts against Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society co- chairman and rightwing powerhouse, reads like a memoir of an ingenue taken advantage of in the big city by strangers. “I was new to Washington,”Trump explained, “and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges. I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real ‘sleazebag’ named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.”Slowly, Trump has come to the realization that this Leonard Leo “openly brags how he controls Judges, and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court”. Trump was revealing that Leo understood his power beyond his influence over Trump on appointments. “Backroom ‘hustlers’ must not be allowed to destroy our Nation!” He is victim of a con, Donald Chump.“Talk about friendly fire,” editorialized theWall Street Journal. But there was more to the story than Trump revealed, which the Journal’s editorial page, Leonard Leo’s friend in court as it were, happily provided. The judge on the trade court whom Trump appointed and blames on Leo, Timothy Reif, was in fact, according to the Journal, “recommended to the White House by Robert Lighthizer, who was Mr Trump’s first-term trade representative. Mr Leo had nothing to do with it.” Perhaps Trump is suffering from memory loss.Trump bellowed that the reason for the trade court’s ruling must be “purely a hatred of ‘TRUMP’? What other reason could it be?” “Well,” suggested the Journal, “how about the law and the constitution?” After Leo had been the one to give Trump the names of the three justices he appointed to the supreme court who made possible the infamous decision granting him “absolute immunity” for “official acts” that enabled his evasion of prosecution during the 2024 campaign, this was a thick and rich ragu.The Journal also rushed to Leo’s side with apodcastfeaturing John Yoo, who as deputy assistant attorney general under George W Bush and the author of the notoriousTorture Memos. Yoo said it was “truly outrageous to accuse Leonard Leo, one of the stalwarts or the conservative movement, of being something like a traitor”. Yoo stated: “Why would President Trump turn his back on one of his greatest, if not his greatest achievements from the first term, appointing three justices?” Indeed, Yoo was right that Leo had dictated Trump’s choices, exactly as Trump confessed. What neither disclosed is that it was the price Trump paid for a political armistice with the mighty rightwing Koch political operation. Some deal, some art.And Yoo added in an admission of truth-telling about the supreme court’s invention of absolute presidential immunity for “official acts”: “If it weren’t for Federalist Society judges, he would be in jail right now because it was the Roberts court that said former presidents just can’t be prosecuted for crimes.”But to Trump, the betrayal is cutting. The trade court’s ruling against him echoed the amicus brief filed by a bipartisan group of legal eminences that included leading conservative lights. There was Steven Calabresi, professor at Northwestern Law School, the co-founder and co-chairman of the Federalist Society, and the chief theorist of the conservative doctrine of the “unitary executive”. There was Michael W McConnell, former federal judge, Stanford law professor, and a chief defender of religious right lawsuits. There was Michael Mukasey, former federal judge and George W Bush’s attorney general. There was Peter Wallison, President Reagan’s White House counsel. They all signedthe briefstating: “The president’s tariff proclamations bypass the constitutional framework that lends legitimacy and predictability to American lawmaking.”Trump is enraged that his betrayers from the Federalist Society have claimed roles in the resistanceThe breaking of ranks on the right is not isolated. Other well-known members of the conservative legal establishment have done more than submit an amicus brief. They have become counsels to some of the most important institutions in Trump’s crosshairs – Harvard University, National Public Radio and the WilmerHale law firm.William Burck and Robert Hur are co-counsels representing Harvard in its suit against the Trump administration order denying its enrollment of international students unless the university submits to his draconian control over its academic processes.Burck, former deputy White House counsel to George W Bush and a current member of the board of directors of the Fox Corporation, is the head of “one of a few top US firms that seemed well placed not only to avoid Donald Trump’s wrath but also benefit from connections to the president’s inner circle”, according to theFinancial Times. He was hired to be an ethics adviser to the Trump Organization – that is, until he chose to represent Harvard. Trumprantedagainst him: “Harvard is a threat to Democracy, with a lawyer, who represents me, who should therefore be forced to resign, immediately, or be fired. He’s not that good, anyway, and I hope that my very big and beautiful company, now run by my sons, gets rid of him ASAP!” Eric Trump, who had previouslycalledBurck “one of the nation’s finest and most respected lawyers”,wielded the executioner’s axefor his father.Hur had been appointed the US attorney for Maryland by Trump and served as the special counsel investigating President Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents stored in boxes in his home’s garage. Hur filed no charges, but said of Biden that he was “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory”.In Harvard’s suit against the Trump administration, Burck and Hur state that its actions against the university are “a blatant violation of the first amendment, the due process clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its first amendment rights to reject the government’s demands to control Harvard’s governance, curriculum, and the ‘ideology’ of its faculty and students. The government’s actions are unlawful for other equally clear and pernicious reasons.”For its representation in its suit against the Trump administration, which seeks to slash its funding, National Public Radio has hired Miguel Estrada, a star of the conservative legal firmament, whose nomination to the federal bench by George W Bush was blocked by Senate Democrats in 2002. According to the NPRcomplaint, Trump’s action “violates the expressed will of Congress and the first amendment’s bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association, and also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information”.When Trump issued executive orders against big law firms that had somehow offended him, coercing their surrender to his whim, one of those firms, WilmerHale, subject to such an order for having had as a senior partner Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who headed the investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election, did not cave. Instead, it hired Paul Clement, George W Bush’s solicitor general, who has argued on behalf of many of the most controversial conservative causes before the supreme court, including against the Defense of Marriage Act and against the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.Citing the example of John Adams, who defended British soldiers in the Boston Massacre, Clementarguedagainst the Trump administration that “British monarchs’ practice of punishing attorneys ‘whose greatest crime was to dare to defend unpopular causes’ – which threatened to reduce lawyers to ‘parrots of the views of whatever group wields governmental power at the moment’ – helped inspire the Bill of Rights”.Then, Ed Whelan, who holds the Antonin Scalia chair in constitutional studies at the rightwing Ethics and Public Policy Center, and is a close surrogate for Leonard Leo, savaged Trump’s nomination of Emil Bove, who was his personal attorney in the New York hush-money trial and whom he had appointed as deputy attorney general, to be a judge on the US court of appeals for the third circuit.Bove ordered corruption charges dropped against the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, whicha federal judge said“smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions”. The US attorney for Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, a conservative Republican, resigned in protest, stating that the deal “amounted to a quid pro quo” and that Bove had ordered her not to take notes during meetings. Seven members of the public integrity section of the justice department also resigned.Whelan, writing in the conservative magazineNational Review, called Bove Trump’s “henchman”, decried his “bullying mishandling” of the Adams case, and suggested he might be put on the federal bench to “position him well for the next supreme court vacancy. A rosier possibility is that Bove is tired of being Stephen Miller’s errand boy.”Now, Trump is worried about what conservatives on the supreme court might rule when presented with the trade court’s decision. Herailsin private against Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom he appointed to the supreme court, for her unexpected occasional independence. The Journal, with the inside track,writesthat “the White House boasts it will win at the supreme court, but our reading of the trade court’s opinion suggests the opposite. Mr Trump’s three court appointees are likely to invoke the major-questions precedent” – which would uphold the trade court and force Trump either to bring his policy before the Congress or drop it.Trump is enraged that his betrayers from the Federalist Society have claimed roles in the resistance. He has no loyalty to anyone or thing, but demands personal fealty, certainly now above any ideological litmus tests. The only ideological tests are to be imposed on universities. Trump has learned his lesson. In his insistence on obedient judges, Trump is returning to his first principle as he was taught in the beginning by his mob attorney Roy Cohn, who said: “Don’t tell me what the law is, tell me who the judge is.”Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

The working party under the shadow attorney general, David Wolfson, announced on Thursday, will not look dispassionately at whether the UK shouldwithdraw. It will merely try to say why and how. The policy of withdrawal itself is almost, to coin a phrase,oven-ready.This back-to-front policymaking process exemplifies the party’s rudderless drift under Mrs Badenoch. Tory policy is not now in the hands of the leader or the shadow cabinet. It is in the hands of Reform UK and the opinion polls. Mrs Badenoch is a follower of events. Hers is the approach of someone still trapped in a party bubble which is consumed by the belief that withdrawal is the key to regaining the Conservatives’ squandered popularity.This is nonsensical politics for the Tories. But it is also dangerous for Britain. The UK’s ​long commitment to international law is a cornerstone of this country’s soft power standing in the world. Labour’s reassertion of this approach, with its clear signal to the world that Britain can again be trusted as a partner, has generated national benefits since the party returned to office last year.This does not mean that every aspect of international law (of which the ECHR is part) is unchallengeable or holy writ. The primary responsibility for the rule of law and for human rights is at the national level. The states that signed international covenants and treaties after 1945 “did not give an open-ended licence for international rules to be ever more expansively interpreted or for institutions to adopt a position of blindness or indifference to public sentiment in their member states”.Those words come from the current attorney general, Richard Hermer. They were part of his lucid and balancedlectureon security to the Royal United Services Institute last week. To judge by the fury it unleashed among theDaily TelegraphandSpectatorwriting classes, you might think that Lord Hermer had insisted that only lawyers ​like him could solve the world’s conflicts and injustices, and that anyone who disagreed with him was a Nazi.Lord Hermer said no such thing​s. Those who read his lecture will ​instead find an explicit attempt to depolarise the debate. He criticise​s as “romantic idealists” those who treat international law as the reign of ​universal moral principle and who abhor all concession to nation-state interests. But he also denounced the “pseudo-realists” who argue, amid the current unravelling of the post-1945 order, that nation-state interests can now take precedence over law. This, he said, was Russia’s argument in Ukraine (he was too craven to mention that it is Donald Trump’s philosophy of government too). British politicians drawn to this exceptionalist thinking in the name of realism risked committing “deeply unserious acts in a deadly serious age”.To leave the ECHR would be just such an act. But its consequences would be desperately serious. It would give succour to authoritarian rulers on all continents. It would drain Britain’s reputation for reliability again, as Brexit did. And it would achieve none of the goals in national security, criminal justice and migration control that its supporters imagine. Lord Hermer is right that serious problems can ultimately only be resolved through negotiations, driven by politics, which are then knitted together in laws that must be upheld.

Imagination and skill can bolster external backing – but can’t replace itThu 5 Jun 2025 13.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 14.10 EDTShareSince Donald Trump scoldedVolodymyr Zelenskyywith the words “You don’t have the cards right now,” Ukraine has been keener than ever to demonstrate that it has a few up its sleeve. On Sunday it showed its hand with an extraordinary, audacious drone attack on multiple bases deep inside Russia, which it says damaged 41 aircraft.Operation Spiderweb, which saw the smuggled drones released from their hiding places in wooden sheds and remotely piloted to their targets, was swiftly followed by another attackon Crimea’s Kerch bridgeusing underwater explosives. Kyiv – often coy in such cases – was unusually swift to claim both incidents, but has not taken responsibility for tworailway bridge attackswhich Russia says led to the deaths of seven passengers at the weekend.There is obvious satisfaction in hitting Russian bombers and surveillance planes used against Ukrainian civilians, and Spiderweb’s unexpected method will surely force Russia to think harder about defence. But the greater significance lies in its potential impact on domestic morale and international support.Ukrainehas repeatedly surprised both its enemy and its allies throughout this war. Unexpected successes such as the Kursk incursion have changed the narrative at critical moments. Meticulously planned, and reportedly 18 months in the making, the latest operation must make Russia wonder what else may be on the way.It was also spectacular enough to make Mr Trump pay attention. The US presidentreportedlyjudged the attack to be “badass”. But his cosy phone chats with Vladimir Putin appear to be locking in his tilt towards Moscow. On Wednesday hesaidthat, in a “good” conversation, Mr Putin had said he would have to respond. It did not appear to have occurred to the US president that discouraging retaliation might be desirable. He should be challenging Kremlin talking points instead of amplifying them. If Ukraine hoped to dispel the nuclear spectre which Russia has repeatedly summoned up, Mr Trump seems to be still in its thrall – withsome of those around himtalking up the threat again.The Center for Strategic and International Studies arguedin a reportthis week that Russia’s military performance has been notably poor in this war, with gains coming at a strikingly high cost in terms of both equipment and personnel – hitting an estimated million casualties this summer. But Russia still has many more cards. It continues to grind out its advance, and in late May it launched itslargest drone and missile assaulton Ukraine to date. Its war of attrition may look old-fashioned compared with Kyiv’s innovations, but it still hurts. Meanwhile, talks in Istanbul have producedagreement on a prisoner exchangebut no movement towards peace.There appears to be growing support in the US Senate for further sanctions on Russia, but Lindsey Graham isunlikely to movewithout Mr Trump’s acquiescence, and there is little sign of progress in the House. Pete Hegseth did not attend the session on Ukraine at Thursday’s gathering of defence ministers ahead of this month’s Nato summit – a telling absence, though the Pentagon blamed scheduling issues. Kyiv needs and deserves increased support from Washington, but damage limitation looks like a more realistic aspiration.Ukraine continues to surprise, and to shift its approach as circumstances demand. Unfortunately, there is little sign of the US president, capricious as he is, changing course on this conflict.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On trips to South Korea with my mother, an answer began to emergeByE Tammy KimThu 5 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 01.32 EDTShareAfew years ago, my mom’s brother inSouth Koreaannounced that he would be getting rid of their parents’ graves. My grandparents had been buried separately, and this uncle and his wife were their keepers. They made several annual visits to the burial mounds (endless gridlock) and prepared Buddhist ceremonies at home (endless cooking and cleaning). Now that they were in their mid-60s and their grown children were unlikely to carry on any of these rituals, they wanted out.They set a date to exhume my grandparents’ bodies, cremate their remains and say goodbye again. My mom wasn’t happy about this, but she had no real say. She’d surrendered her rights when she moved to the US.We started early in the morning, at my grandmother’s burial mound. My mom, dad, brother and I, plus my uncle and his wife, other uncle, surviving aunt and cousins walked up a terraced hillside in a lush private cemetery. It was cool and sunny. We bowed at the gravestone and made offerings of fruit, dried fish and alcohol. Three diggers did their work, first by machine, then by hand, as they got closer to the constellation of bones. The coffin had long since decomposed.The workers spoke of the dead in a formal, reverential way, as though my grandmother had passed the day before, not a half century ago. It was comforting, given the absolute weirdness of the event. We all stood around awkwardly, staring into the dirt. We were three generations: dead, old and middle-aged.The diggers combed the soil with gentle strokes, like archaeologists on reality TV, pulling up a sort of intact skull, suggestions of femur, crumbly archaeological bits wrapped in the tatters of a shroud. My mom cried, but didn’t sob. “I never imagined doing something like this,” she said. The process was at once invasive and abstract. They placed every ivory shard on to a blanket, then into a small wooden box. I had never seen real-life human bones.It was more depressing at my grandfather’s mound, set deep in a public cemetery, wild with weeds and thorns, an hour away. The diggers there were brusque. They tossed bone fragments into the box, making an unnervingplonk. I wanted to remind them that someone once wore those bones.We loaded the small boxes into a hired hearse – my uncle had made all the right arrangements – and drove in a caravan to a busy crematorium outside Seoul. The facility was half automated and totally impersonal. We crowded around a window to watch my grandparents’ remains go into a stainless steel firepit. Then we were bumped to the waiting room – vinyl seats, plastic tables. We kept our coats on and ate rice cakes, waiting for our number to pop up on the digital display.Ihate: “Do you have a family?”; “When are you going to start a family?” The asker means children, not ageing parents or a partner or spouse or chosen family or siblings or animals or or or. At my age, any reference to “family” conjures images of school pickups and paediatric appointments. Am I misleading my listener if I use this term to mean anything else?My family is still the one I was born into: mother, father and brother, all of them alive and well – the ultimate luck. Many friends have already lost their parents or slipped into sandwich-generation duties, raising their kids while scrambling for elder care. Others of us have traded reproduction for something like filial piety. I can think of quite a few childless friends who have moved to be near a parent or had a parent move in with them. Midlife for them – and for me – is an open-faced sandwich. The defining event of my adulthood will not be birth or adoption, but the deaths of my parents, especially my mom.View image in fullscreenCheonmasan Bogwangsa temple, outside Seoul.Photograph: bokwangsa.or.krWhen I was a kid, Mom would say, in classically morbid Korean: “I just hope I live long enough to see you through college.” Once my college years came and went, our expectations shifted, or at least her phrasing did. She now says things like: “I’ve lived long enough.” Or: “I mean, I’d like to live longer, but even if I died today, I couldn’t complain.”Every once in a while, she adds: “What if you have justonekid? It’s not too late. I’ll do all the work. I’ll raise her for you.”There’s a movement, or voguish tendency, in South Koreacalled 4B, which emerged online as part of a #MeToo-style feminist resurgence in 2016. It pushed a four-pronged refusal of marriage, reproduction, dating and sex. (TheBis for 비bhee, meaning un- or anti-.) When a rightwing prosecutor named Yoon Suk Yeol rallied men’s-rights voters to win the nation’s presidency in 2022, the feminist wave seemed decidedly over. But Trump’s re-election two years later provoked an American interest in 4B. According to some viral TikToks and newspaper articles, American women were disavowing heterosexual habits. The dust of 4B in Korea swirled temporarily back to life.I was in Seoul with my parents when I noticed the Korean social media posts quoting US social media posts celebrating dated Korean social media posts. My editor asked me to write a short piece about 4B, which I started to outline at the dining table of our rental in the Itaewon neighbourhood, near the decommissioned US military base. I had arranged a home swap with a friend who is also Korean American and a writer; my age, unmarried, childless. After college, he had moved to Korea where his parents were living half of the time. Then his mom was diagnosed with cancer. He cooked and cared for her until she died. Her framed portrait and denim backpack were set up in a little shrine above his desk, next to animation books, Murakami novels and cartoon figurines.I glanced at her portrait as my mom explained 4B to my dad. He nodded in appreciation of the Korean wordplay but offered no comment. “I’m 1.5B,” I said in Korean – no reproduction, meh on marriage. My mom laughed.When my parents and I started making regular trips to Korea, just before I turned 40, all my Bs became more complicated. We usually went in the fall, my mom and I, and sometimes my dad, thanks to their retirement and my rather unanswerable status as a writer. Previously we’d had neither the time nor the money to travel. Now they were 70ish, and I wanted to spend as much time with them as I could. I was growing obsessed with their statistical nearness to death.View image in fullscreenE Tammy Kim.Photograph: Sarah ShatzI was also preoccupied with my own midlife vanity: my face, my hairline, whatever eggs remain in my ovaries. The ascendance of “K-beauty” made me especially self-conscious about my skin, as though I had some obligation, by dint of ethnicity, to maintain an even, dewy complexion. I developed an unflattering habit of using a 3x mirror to zoom in on the age spots, sun spots, emerging wrinkles, scarred-over zits, areas of droop and birthmarks that pocked my face and neck. On one trip to Korea, I paid dearly for a course of “laser resurfacing”. It’s a treatment that burns the ugly stuff off your epidermis and looks and smells like miniature fireworks exploding across your cheeks and forehead. My mom encouraged this indulgence.“But you don’t even wear makeup,” I said.“Yeah, but you’re different,” Mom said. “You live in New York! You’re always meeting people. You have to take care of your looks.”The spots cleared for a while. I slathered myself in sunscreen and wore a hat with a dangling cape that covered my neck and ears. I bought anti-UV gloves and big plastic sunglasses. I slunk out of hiking dates. There was only so much I could do. The pigmentation was apparently hormonal: a condition called melasma. I paid for a second laser treatment the following year, then a third in southern California. Then microneedling, which is as gory as it sounds, at a medical spa near my parents’ house in Washington state.The American clinics tended to be overdecorated in velvety pinks. The employees wore a lot of makeup and went big with their features – cheeks, eyelashes, nails. Acne scars were blasted, lips and foreheads plumped, jowls yanked up. The women waiting next to me for their appointments looked expensive but not always good. If I continued down this path, I would have to be careful.After I turned 40 I spent many insomniac hours Googling the ages of random artists, celebrities and writers. I liked it when successful people were older than me, and took special note of childlessness. Oprah (older, childless); Alison Brie (slightly younger, childless); Amy Tan (older, childless, also obsessed with Asian families); Frida Kahlo (dead, childless). I sought out midlife movies (Private Life, Past Lives, The Forty-Year-Old Version, Peppermint Candy, everything Ozu). I listened to 여둘톡Yeo dool talk(Two women talk together), a Korean chatcast by two fortysomething writers who live and work together in childless, platonic bliss. I avoided reading Sheila Heti’s Motherhooduntil I heard that it doesn’t end, as most such books do, in the inevitable act of reproduction. I was satisfied when it turned out to be more about anal sex than vaginal passage.I became fond of an essay by Rebecca Solnit (older, childless) titled The Mother of All Questions. It begins at a lecture she’s giving on Virginia Woolf, which during the Q&A spirals into a discussion of why Woolf did not reproduce – “a soporific and pointless detour from the magnificent questions her work poses”, Solnit writes. At another talk, a British man grills Solnit about her own choice to go without.“Such questions seem to come out of the sense that there are notwomen, the 51% of the human species who are as diverse in their wants and as mysterious in their desires as the other 49%,” Solnit observes, “onlyWoman, who must marry, must breed, must let men in and babies out, like some elevator for the species.”What I like about Solnit’s essay is that it’s short, as if to say: “This is both boring and none of your business.” Here are some of her answers, though, to this mother of all questions: “The planet is unable to sustain more first-world people”; “I really wanted to write books”; “I am very good at birth control.”Mom had been a stubborn teenager on an unannounced backpacking trip through Korea when her father died, and a twentysomething immigrant in southern California when she lost her mother, the person closest to her in the world. Not having seen them in their final days stuck with her like a punishment – and cemented her distance from home. She stayed in the US, first reluctantly, then why not for ever?She worked at a factory that produced foam packaging (where she almost lost a finger), a Korean-owned mini-mart, a now defunct chain restaurant called Sambo’s and a bank. She enlisted in the US army. She sent money and letters to her younger siblings, whom she still refers to as “the kids” when telling stories in past tense.View image in fullscreenAutumn in Washington state.Photograph: Vince Barnes/Getty Images/iStockphotoMom got her master’s degree in psychology at night. She made a career in elder care, first as a social worker, then as an inspector and bureaucrat, regulating old-age facilities. At Christmastime, she scheduled my brother and me to play carols on the piano at a local nursing home. It scared me to see the residents wheeled toward us and parked in a half circle around the piano. Some of them had bibs on and could not control their necks. I feared their dependency and boredom. Mom went around and greeted them individually. She treated them like full, fully present human beings.Now she is the same age as many of the residents her office oversees. “If I get dementia,” she told me, “you might have to put me in a nursing home. It’s OK – when it gets bad, you don’t know where you are.”My mom had once dreamed of studying Chinese and becoming a foreign service officer, fluent in three languages. In reality, she is fluent in two and speaks to my brother and me in both. When we were in high school, our parents sent us on an Asian birthright-style motherland trip. The programme housed us and dozens of other uneasy diasporic kids in a scruffy hotel that had been built for the Seoul Olympics in 1988. We ate Korean food and learned bits of the Korean alphabet, Hangul, and peninsular history.I guess the motherland trip worked, because I kept trying to find my way back. I took language classes in high school to improve my standard Korean-American Korean (small vocabulary, sloppy grammar), and applied for money to travel. In Seoul, during college, I studiednongakpercussion and translated wall text for the National Museum.I hoped that the Korean I had spoken exclusively from birth to age three had somehow primed me for fluency. In my 20s and 30s, as my Korean got good, then really good, I met my mother anew. We could talk at length, in her best and native tongue, about art, politics, random stuff I now knew the nouns and verbs for.Hearing aid, anarchist, rezoning, surrealism.Like many dutiful immigrant kids, I later went to law school – a poor fit. My classmates seemed excited to master a new vocabulary of power that, for me, whipped up feelings of estrangement and irritation. I went home during a break, to inhale the piney Pacific north-west atmosphere and regroup in my parents’ care. At lunch one day I told them that I wanted to quit. The law wasn’t for me, I said, nor was the life it seemed to imply – a desk job, marriage, kids. I sounded grandiose and also weaselly. Just finish school, they said. My loans already surpassed a hundred thousand dollars and would be impossible to pay back if I didn’t continue. I graduated and passed the bar and did good, decent work at a legal services agency in New York City. About five years in, I decided to try out a second career, and gave myself the same number of years to establish myself, or at least survive, as a writer.View image in fullscreenA protest calling for the impeachment of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul, December 2024.Photograph: Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPAMom was worried, but didn’t object loudly. I think she was afraid of driving me away. (A Korean saying: “There’s nothing scarier than one’s kids.”) I mostly had very good luck in journalism. But in 2018, I was fired from a job in TV, and bet my savings on a reporting trip to Seoul. Trump had just thrown the Koreas into the news, so chances were I’d be able to sell a story or two.Mom came along. She joked that she would be my research assistant, then actually was, clipping newspaper articles and proofreading my emails. We rented a tiny studio apartment up a series of steep hills in the centre of the city. The shower drain smelled of sewage, and the bed drove plastic springs into our backs at night. It was early summer, hot and sticky.Mom wrote to a classmate from junior high school, someone she’d never mentioned before. The woman was a journalist and English-to-Korean translator. We arranged to meet at her rather fancy office. Mom wore a grey-green T-shirt dress made of waffle-weave cotton. She looked slim and lovely, younger than her 69 years in the classmate’s presence. I had wondered if she would envy this vision of a life she might have had if she’d stayed in Korea. But the journalist talked incessantly, mostly about herself. Mom looked relieved when it was time to go.We continued travelling together, back to Korea and elsewhere. We went to Mexico City for Mom’s 75th birthday. She had aced a Spanish class at a community college and was the holder of some kind of quadruple-diamond-league record on Duolingo for her intense, years-long study via Samsung smartphone. Maybe she would be fluent in three languages after all. The jacarandas were in bloom. We saw all the art that tourists see and ate all the things tourists eat. I filmed Mom squirming and saying “No! I don’t want it!” as I held a forkful of grasshopper tamale to her lips.We shared a bed and drank stovetop espresso and sauteed unfamiliar vegetables and walked for miles through the city, practising Spanish phrases. Mom knew the genders of things and had excellent textbook grammar. I had the advantage of romance-language instincts and a shamelessness in speaking with strangers.One day, I got sick and cocooned myself in bed. She brought me cold water and touched her diagnostic hand to my forehead and neck. I was supposed to be the young, vigorous one.Iam trying to work on a book. The book is about my mom and Korean history or the Korean present. It is hard to manage the metabolism of the project: slow and unlimited in words, not fast and short like I am used to in news writing. “Don’t write about me. Write about Korea, about the issues,” Mom has told me multiple times. Dad: “You seem to write about our family when you run out of topics.” I am embarrassed by memoir and simultaneously drawn to the form. I am always reading books by sons and daughters.Most of the books daughters write about their moms come out after the mom is dead. I am hoping for a different sequence; an alternate ending. I want to beat time, but feel superstitious about the drafting. Would writing about my mom cut short our trips together? Could it somehow accelerate her demise? The book, whatever it is, would have to be more than good. It would have to answer the question of what I was doing, what I was building, in lieu of a traditional family in middle age. It has to make up for my fatigue and bristly hair and age spots. It has to be as good as a husband and a child.In the spring of 2023, I went with my partner to Montreal, his former home. I’d arranged to visit a Chinese Canadian scratch DJ and multimedia artist named Eric San AKA Kid Koala, who’s about my age. He lives and works in a converted print shop with his wife and collaborator, Corinne Merrell, and their daughters.San had just released a new album, Creatures of the Late Afternoon, an appropriately midlife title, I thought. Like his earlier work, the tracks mix hip-hop beats with robot voices, rock samples, and the zigzagging play of vinyl – all fingers and hands, no laptops. I asked about one song that stuck out for its romantic, Motown-y quality. It was a tribute to his parents, he said. He had come upon a trove of letters and reel-to-reel tapes they’d exchanged when his dad was studying in North America and his mom was still in Hong Kong. Their story inspired him to compose a transpacific ode, at once a jukebox love song and the balladic offering of a son.“I wanted to see if I could design shows that would involve other generations, including my parents,” he told me. “I wanted to work on stuff that could resonate with them.”Here was a model of what I was hoping to do. But I feared that I was too slow, too lazy, too clumsy with words to make something before my parents were gone. I went to see Kid Koala onstage. There were puppets, dancing and midlife jokes.The parents in the audience looked about my age.The day after my grandparents’ remains were disinterred, my extended family went to a temple east of Seoul, where a family friend is the head monk. He led a liturgy of prayers and chest-throbbing drone songs. We followed along from rice-paper hymnals and took turns bowing before the Buddha. Afterward, we went out to the gravel parking lot, to say a final prayer and spread the ashes in a little forest.View image in fullscreenCheonmasan Bogwangsa temple, outside Seoul.Photograph: bokwangsa.or.krWe carried the two boxes of remains and a giant metal basin of steamed white rice – sticky and cold. The monk instructed Mom and her siblings to pour the ashes into the rice and mix it all together, into glutinous clumps. Better for the birds to carry off, he said.My mom, her sister, and the brother who’d initiated the disinterment (the other uncle went off to smoke) squatted around the basin and sunk their gloved hands into the pulverulent white and grey. They assumed the exact posture of kimchi making.Mom couldn’t do it. It was too weird, too visceral. The bones, the ash, the rice; food, bodies, birds. She let my uncle and the monk do the rest. I held her shoulders.“All I could think,” she told me, “was: ‘This is my parents.’”Iwent home for a few days in January, to my parents’ house, south of Seattle. Mom had recently secured a funeral plot for her and my dad in a local cemetery. She wanted me to know about their plans, so she’d sent me the approval notice – mystical email subject line: “Fwd: Pre Need Letter” – which I’d ignored. I found it impossible to think about their deaths, to consider even the most bureaucratic details, without sobbing. “I couldn’t open the email,” I told her.“Yeah, I know. I know that’s why you didn’t bring it up,” she said.En route from some mundane outing, she and Dad tricked me into a drive around the cemetery.“It’s on the way home,” Dad said. “Let’s just stop by. It’s beautiful.” The grounds were enormous and immaculately landscaped, layered in fog and bereft of visitors. There were discrete sections, divided, as best I could tell, by type of remains (body/coffin, ashes/urn) and style of grave marker (tall, flat). There were hundreds of little American flags.‘I became trapped in my Americanness’: China, the US and meRead more“When it’s time, just go to the cemetery office, and they’ll help you,” Dad said. “Everything should be straightforward.” He had told me that he’d wanted to be cremated, but now he was wavering. Mom was, too. I wondered if it had to do with seeing her parents’ bones.I lowered my car window to get some cold air and take pictures of the dark green expanse. More reference photos for the book project, I thought. Mom pointed out a pair of black-tailed deer at the edge of a meadow, stock-still, necks craned in the same direction. I was grateful for the change of subject. We waited to see if the deer would move, to confirm they weren’t gaudy statues. We drove away and came back, and waited some more. Finally, one turned its head toward us.A longer version of this piece appeared inn+1 magazineListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readSouth KoreaAsia PacificWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Another night to enjoy, and the promise that there may be many more to come. The European champions made their way to Munich where they will defend theirNations Leaguetitle thanks to a 5-4 victory over France which left something more than just the result in Stuttgart.It may not be so absurd to imagine thatthisSpaincould matchthatone, although there are lessons to be learnt at the back. Just as it may not be so absurd to suggest that the 17-year-old in their team is notgoingto be the best, he already is. If this was an audition for the Ballon d’Or against Ousmane Dembélé and Kylian Mbappé, as many said, the award is Lamine Yamal’s.Spain v France: Nations League semi-final – liveRead moreNor is Lamine Yamal alone. He scored two, his every touch a threat, but by the time he did Spain had already scored twice, through Nico Williams and Mikel Merino. And between his brace, Pedri, a player who does everything with a kind of ethereal ease, added a lovely fourth. Spain weren’t alone either:Franceplayed their part in making this so good, racking up 24 of the 40 shots and making a match of this. Down 5-1 after 67 minutes, a belter from Rayan Cherki, an own goal from Dani Vivian and a Randal Kolo Muani header on 79, 84, and 93 minutes respectively contributed to a special and sometimes silly occasion, infusing it with a tension no one had anticipated 20 minutes earlier.That said, this wasn’t just a late flurry from nowhere; it had been fun from the very start, a game that was open and played at pace, the shot count rising almost as swiftly as the players were moving. Theo Hernández clipping the bar while Unai Simón and Mike Maignan both made saves, as if the teams were taking it in turns, before Spain took the lead on 22 minutes. They did so as France had begun briefly to assert themselves, the balance tilting their way, Désiré Doué and Adrien Rabiot both having decent shooting opportunities, and Pedri forced to shift deeper to wrest back some control.View image in fullscreenNico Williams celebrates scoring his first goal by dancing with Dean Huijsen (left).Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersIn the first prolonged passage of Spanish possession the ball was worked to Lamine Yamal, who played in a crisp pass to Mikel Oyarzabal on the edge of the six-yard box. Back to goal, he held off Ibrahima Konaté and neatly nudged it to his right where Williams smashed it into the roof of the net. A superb second came three minutes later, beginning at Robin Le Normand’s feet. Again, Oyarzabal’s awareness and subtleness of touch was the pivot upon which it turned. Merino received, found Oyarzabal and spun; Oyarzabal returned it to him and he finished low into the net.Spain’s lead was maintained by the strong hand of Simón, who saved from Doué, Mbappé and Dembélé. Then just before half-time it appeared to have been extended when a lovely free-kick routine, touched by Pedri, clipped in by Lamine Yamal and set up by Martín Zubimendi’s header ended with Dean Huijsen’s superb volley. The flag, though, was up. Almost immediately Dembélé escaped, only for his shot to be stopped by Simón.View image in fullscreenRayan Cherki crashes home a brilliant volley to make it 5-2.Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/ReutersOn it went, two more French approaches within two minutes of the restart, low crosses flying through the six-yard box inviting a touch. On Spain went, too. And this is a such an incisive, such an inspired Spain, so quick to go for the throat, intent in everything they do.

Lamine gestured to the fans, then took the ball, and his moment, and rolled the penalty into the corner. Checkmate.Only it wasn’t. Spain weren’t stopping there, they were enjoying it too much. A gorgeous touch from Pedri enabled him to glide into space, exchange passes with Williams and lift over Maignan. The superiority was striking now, even if Mbappé did win – now there’s a euphemism – and score a penalty soon after, even if Dembélé hit the post. Because there was Lamine Yamal again, running on to Pedro Porro’s neat volleyed layoff, easing away from Clément Lenglet and poking past Maignan. Now that really was checkmate, or so it seemed.Still France weren’t finished, still the scoring wasn’t either, providing a wild ending if not quite a comeback and it was Lamine Yamal flashing a smile at the end, braces sparkling in the light.Explore more on these topicsNations LeagueSpainFrancematch reportsShareReuse this content"

No challenge, not even the task of ending an era of total dominance at Roland Garros, felt beyond her.In the face of her greatest rival on the courtIga Swiatekhas made her own, Sabalenka converted her phenomenal form and fortitude into one of the most significant victories of her career, as she held her nerve in three delicious, tension-filled sets to topple the four-time French Open champion 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 and reach the final at Roland Garros for the first time.French Open semi-finals: Sabalenka dethrones Swiatek, Gauff routs Boisson – as it happenedRead moreSaturday’s final will be a tussle between the top two players after Coco Gauff, the No 2 seed, put an end to Loïs Boisson’s fairytale run to the semi-finals by ruthlessly dismantling the local wildcard 6-1, 6-2 to reach her secondFrench Openfinal and third major final overall.Having entered her first grand slam tournament with a wildcard and a modest ranking of No 361, Boisson has produced one of the most surprising grand slam runs in history, defeating the world No 3, Jessica Pegula, and the No 6, Mirra Andreeva, en route to the last four. Gauff, who has been the most consistent player during the clay-court season with finals in Madrid, Rome and now Roland Garros, proved a step too far.“I couldn’t manage to get my game going, but apart from today’s match, which wasn’t all positive, the tournament as a whole was very positive,” said Boisson. “And even today it’s all positive, even though, you know, it is disappointing but she was just too tough for me.”Despite long being considered a player who thrives on all surfaces, Sabalenka’s sixth career grand slam decider marks the world No 1’s first final appearance away from her favoured hard courts. Swiatek’s incredible 26-match winning streak at Roland Garros and her pursuit of an unprecedented fourth consecutive French Open title comes to an end.View image in fullscreenSwiatek chases the match in vain.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty Images“It was a big match, and it felt like a final, but I know that the job is not done yet, and I have to go out there on Saturday, and I have to fight and I have to bring my best tennis, and I have to work for that title,” said Sabalenka. “I’m ready. I’m ready to go out, and I’m ready to fight. And I’m ready to do everything it’s going to take to get the win.”Although Sabalenka and Swiatek have established an era-defining rivalry in women’s tennis over the past few years, only one of their previous 12 meetings had occurred at a grand slam tournament. The significance of this heavyweight bout was told by the dramatic, emotionally exhausting battle that followed.While Swiatek has spent this tournament trying hard to rediscover her best form after a difficult period, Sabalenka has looked perfectly at ease throughout. She has worked tirelessly on her game in recent years, evolving from a one-note shotmaker into a complex attacking player with variation and restraint. Her mental transformation has been even more essential, with the 27-year-old growing from an impulsive and over-emotional competitor to a player who remains composed under pressure.The challenge of facing Swiatek on the Pole’s favoured surface offered Sabalenka every reason to lose her composure. After taking apart Swiatek’s pitiful serve early on, her own serve crumbled under pressure from her opponent’s returns in a turbulent first set, but Sabalenka kept her cool and closed out an excellent tie-break. Then, in the second set, the tide turned rapidly as Swiatek played her most assured stretch of attacking tennis. As she has done so often over the past 18 months, Sabalenka shrugged off her disappointment, reasserted pressure on her great rival and did not let up throughout a flawless final set.“The way the third set went, it’s actually shocking for me, to be honest,” said Sabalenka. “I’m super happy that I found the rhythm on my serve, and it was much easier after I figured I’m in control of my serve, and also I put so much pressure on her serve.”View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff celebrates her semi-final victory.Photograph: David Winter/ShutterstockOne day after the French crowd had first made its presence felt with an impromptu rendition of the national anthem before Boisson’s stunning victory over Andreeva, they punctuated every shot of the warm-up with a cry of “olé” while Gauff’s introduction to the crowd immediately generated scattered boos.Unlike Pegula and Andreeva, however, Gauff maintained her composure and she blunted the French crowd with her own brilliance to reach another major final. “I tried to block it all out,” Gauff said. “When you guys were chanting her name, I was saying to myself my name.”Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenTennisAryna SabalenkaIga SwiatekCoco Gauffmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Which is a pity as he is spending a warm-weather training week withEnglandat the magnificent Camiral Golf & Wellness resort; the expected venue for the 2031 Ryder Cup.Formula One. Palmer attended the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday with Thomas Tuchel and the rest of the England squad, which he thought was good. “I went to the one in Abu Dhabi not long ago,” he says, presumably meaning the race in Bahrain or Saudi Arabia. Who knows, who cares? “But I fell asleep at that one.”Eberechi Eze on his bike as England’s World Cup 2026 preparations heat upRead moreThe searing heat in the US, which Palmer will experience with Chelsea in the coming weeks at the Club World Cup. And then again next summer if and when England qualify for the World Cup, which is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico. “It will play a part because I’m not used to it, but I don’t think it will be a big problem,” he says.Oh, and southerners. Manchester’s finest made a comment last summer about how he was finding them hard work after his first season at Chelsea. Has he come to terms with them now? “No, they’re all still moody,” he says. “I think because it’s so busy, they’re all stressed. It must be a southern thing. I don’t live in central London. Sometimes I go in but I couldn’t live there.”If Palmer is a unique talent on the pitch, he is unique to interview as well. Short shrift is his default setting; plenty of his answers are monosyllabic, some just a sound: hmmm. A shrug. It is impossible to ignore the quintessentially Manc vibe.Palmer has a deadpan expression which wonders: “Why are you asking methat?” Example: how is he spending his downtime at the Camiral? “Play PlayStation … Fifa,” he replies. Like, seriously? As on the pitch, Palmer is cool, cold. He is highly entertaining.When was the last time Palmer was angry? “Errr,” he says, after a typically long pause. “I don’t really know. Maybe when I’m playing PlayStation. I’m not just a robot like you guys in the media think I am … and don’t show no emotion. Obviously when there’s no cameras and I’m on the phone to my mates and I’m doing stuff I enjoy doing …”Palmer is asked where his temperament comes from. “Maybe my dad,” he says. “He’s laid-back like me. My mum says: ‘Try and be a bit more involved and a bit more smiley and energetic.’ Maybe she’s like that but me and my dad are just too laid-back, I think.”View image in fullscreenCole Palmer (right) with his England teammate Morgan Rogers at the Spanish Grand Prix this week.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAAnd yet no one in the room at the Camiral, which is dominated by a beautiful Jack Nicklaus watercolour, can fail to be struck by Palmer’s single-mindedness; the steel and hunger. It is there when he talks about Chelsea, how they proved the doubters wrong in the closing weeks of the domestic season to secure a return to the Champions League, sewing up qualification withthe final-day victoryat Nottingham Forest.“Because we had that little spell where we weren’t too great … everyone was saying: ‘They’re not going to get Champions League,’” Palmer says. “So to get it was good. We finished well. When we got it at Forest, it was like a relief.”Palmer has a Champions League winners’ medal from 2022-23 with Manchester City, although he was an unused substitute in the final against Inter; indeed, he did not get off the bench in any of the knockout rounds. He has made only one start in the competition: in City’s dead-rubber final group tie that season, against Sevilla. This time, with Palmer having turbocharged his profile and influence, it stands to be different.“I always say that I don’t feel like a Champions League winner,” Palmer says. “It doesn’t really mean anything to me. When people say it … yeah, but I didn’t play, I wasn’t involved. Obviously I played in the group and stuff like that but it’s not the same, is it? I’ve still got the medal, I’ve not thrown it away. But it’s not like I feel like I’ve won it.”Palmer’s focus is on England. Having missed Tuchel’s first camp in March because of injury, he is determined to impress in Saturday’s World Cup qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona. There is then the friendly against Senegal in Nottingham next Tuesday.The issue for Tuchel is how best to accommodate Palmer when he also has Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden. It is the same issue that his predecessor Gareth Southgate faced; ditto Lee Carsley, who was in interim charge before Tuchel took over.View image in fullscreenPalmer chats with the England head coach, Thomas Tuchel, in Catalonia.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesSouthgate never started Palmer in a competitive game. He used him exclusively off the bench at Euro 2024 where the 23-year-old came on to score the equaliser in the final against Spain, a game thatEngland would lose 2-1. Palmer has 11 caps to date, four as a starter. Foden has missed out on this camp because of injury.“It’s play well at my club … hopefully people can see it and I can turn into a starter for England,” Palmer says. “Last season I played all wide [in midfield] and this season I’ve moved [more centrally]. Wherever he [Tuchel] puts me, I’ll play.”Palmer’s goal against Spain was the perfect illustration of his ability to live in the moment and seize it, oblivious to the pressure. It was a similar story in Chelsea’s Conference Leaguefinal winover Real Betis last week, albeit the stakes were not as high. One-nil down, Palmer said he was “sick of going backwards and sideways”. So he trusted his skill, ran at Betis and made it happen with two assists. Chelsea won 4-1.Palmer is back on the up after an unfathomable dry spell from mid-January when he went 18 matches without a goal. The run ended with the penalty against Liverpool in the fourth-last game of the Premier League season. He finished with 15 goals and 12 assists in all competitions.“Things weren’t happening for me and it went on a bit longer than I thought it would,” Palmer says. “But I spoke to people about it and they explained it’s going to happen. They said that when I get out of it, I’ll be an even better player. When you go to Chelsea and you jump up and then you go into a dip, you think: ‘What’s going on?’ But I didn’t mind …”Palmer catches himself, and there is a rare line from him before he remembers who he is. “Well, obviously, I did mind,” he says. “But I didn’t think: ‘Ah, this is the end of the world.’”Explore more on these topicsEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s nothing like an England squad announcement video to get you in the mood for a major tournament. “I hope you can feel it from the streets to the stands, the summer is in the safest hands,” the poet Sophia Thakur tells us, exactly one month out from England’s first game of Euro 2025 against France.The slogan is “It’s time to go again” and the squad is announced by a host of big names, from Maisie Adam, Daisy May Cooper and Keely Hodgkinson, to David Beckham, Alex Scott, Bukayo Saka and Harry Kane.Euro 2025: Sarina Wiegman’s England squad – in picturesRead moreIs the Lionesses’ title defence in the safest hands, though, how strong are those hands andhow much damage has the last week of turmoil done?Sarina Wiegman’s 23-player squad is pretty much what many expected; Lauren James is winning her battle to be fit and ready, according to the manager, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Esme Morgan have received the nod in defence and the youngArsenal forward Michelle Agyemang is the wildcardpick.There are gaps, though. Looking down the list there is a lack of experience in goalwithout Mary Earpsand there are only five named midfielders for the month-long tournament in Switzerland and one of those is Georgia Stanway, who has played only an hour of football since December (45 minutes against Spain on Tuesdayevening and15 minutes against Portugalon Friday night).“We have to announce it as strikers, midfielders and defenders, but you can move players around, into different positions,” said Wiegman. “So it looks like there’s not much depth on paper, but in the team we have enough depth in midfield.”That is true. James can operate at No 10, the captain Leah Williamson and Manchester United defender Maya Le Tissier can operate in the deeper midfield role that Phil Neville also tried Lucy Bronze in, and Lauren Hemp can play more centrally if needed. However, it is hard to look at those possible shifts as anything more than emergency moves given the weakening that would take place in the positions those players would be vacating.View image in fullscreenEngland head coach Sarina Wiegman insists she is happy with her squad and the atmosphere between the players.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThese types of positional changes are not something that Wiegman has experimented with to any great extent. That said, the loss of Keira Walsh to injury and unexpected switch to a back five for England’s final World Cup group game in Australia in 2023 was hugely successful and brought an air of unpredictability to an increasingly predictable team.Theretirement of Fran Kirbyand Earps andwithdrawal from selection of Millie Bright, all for their different reasons, has taken a hefty chunk of experience out of the squad and rocked the narrative around the Lionesses in the past week.In 2022, the air of unity around the home Euros was strong. Players, staff, the public, the media all sang from the same hymn sheet. In 2023 the vibe at the World Cup wasn’t quite as harmonious, theplayers’ dispute with the FA over bonusestaken public, such was their frustration at a lack of progress.This time thebonuses issue has been resolved, but the abrupt departures of Earps, Kirby and Bright just over a month before the tournament, despite the big differences in their nature, has left question marks over squad harmony.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s competition going on in the group, and I hope there’s competition going on. We’re going with this 23 to the Euros now and I feel very comfortable with this team, very happy with this team and I’m very excited. For me, it doesn’t feel like a crisis at all.”Crisis may be way too strong a word, but the sky is definitely a little less blue and a little more overcast over England. Why did Earps not want to stay and fight, or at least usher the next generation through a major tournament? How did we reach a point where Bright’s mental and physical health have been so eroded that she has had to step back? There is work to be done here. A holistic approach to player welfare must be a priority.Wiegman was praised by players for her straight-talking approach and for providing clarity on positions and strategy when she first came into the head coach role in the run-in to the Euros in 2022. It is inevitable, though, that that approach will be potentially fractious when the news is less good.“For me, it’s really important that I am honest and that I treat people in the right way,” said Wiegman. “Sometimes you have very good news, sometimes you don’t have good news, I don’t go around the bush about that. I just give the message, I can’t control how people respond to that. I just hope they have clarity and we can move on.”The nature of the conversations between Earps and Wiegman, or Kirby and the manager after she was told she would not be going to Switzerland, or how aware Wiegman was that Bright was struggling will remain, of course, unknown. Now, though, it is time to move on. The impact on the defending champions of the last week will only show come the end of July.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen's footballEuropean ChampionshipcommentShareReuse this content"

United have been widely castigated for letting the 28-year-oldleave his boyhood club for £25mlast summer.Chelsea’s Jadon Sancho loan was not disastrous but they need an upgrade | Jacob SteinbergRead moreRobertson, Scotland’s captain, joked that McTominay has started speaking to his international colleagues in Italian on the field. The more serious aspect is the extent to which McTominay has turned heads at a new club.“I think he went over there with a point to prove,” said the Liverpool full-back. “I think he wanted to prove Man United wrong and prove people in the Premier League wrong. He has gone over there and done that pretty successfully. That’s credit to him, credit to his attitude and his determination to be the best version of himself. Now he is a king over there.“At Man United he probably lacked getting that run of games consistently, he was in and out and things like that. He probably didn’t get the respect he deserves. Then he goes over there, puts in a magnificent season and fair play to him to end it with the league title.“Even before he was atNapoli, his standards for Scotland were unbelievable. He’s getting better and better, he has taken it to a whole new level.”View image in fullscreenMcTominay and his Scotland teammates in training before their friendly against Iceland.Photograph: Colin Poultney/ProSports/ShutterstockRobertson has just won another Premier League title. Yet it is an indication of McTominay’s standing that it is he, rather than Robertson, who is on everyone’s lips as Scotland prepare to host Iceland in a friendly.Robertson and his manager, Steve Clarke, are keen to shine a spotlight on Billy Gilmour. The former Chelsea and Brighton midfielder was also part of Napoli’s history-making squad. “It’s impossible to overlook Billy because he’s been excellent since he went over there,” added Robertson.“Billy was talking about how if he goes out in Naples he can walk about a bit more freely, while Scotty is surrounded. Everyone knows how passionate their fans are so for them to love one of ours, it’s pretty special for Scotland too. They love Billy too so credit to the both of them for going over there, being successful and winning the trophy.”Clarke was always an advocate of McTominay and Gilmour setting sail for Serie A. The Scotland manager was typically to the point when asked why it has worked out so well. “Just confidence, confidence in their own ability,” Clarke said. “The answer is that short. They’ve both got big confidence in their own ability and they’ve showcased their talent in a different league. No surprise to me.”It is a nod to the togetherness of this Scotland squad that McTominay, Gilmour and Robertson have not shunned two June friendly games after championship celebrations. The Scots travel to Liechtenstein on Monday.“I thought the decision of the two boys to go to Napoli was really brave, as it was for Lewis Ferguson back in the day to go to Bologna,” Clarke said. “Lewis has obviously been there a little bit longer and to be the captain of the Bologna team that lifts the Italian cup is amazing.“The two boys going to Napoli, it’s just like a dream, to make that decision to go abroad and to end up winning Serie A against a really top Inter team. I think the last month of the season, everybody in Scotland became a Napoli fan, we were all so desperate for them to win the title. And they did.“It was nice of Scott to turn up on the last day of the season and score another goal. Billy played that game as well and was outstanding. So Scott’s been the one that’s grabbed the headlines, but that’s not to forget Billy, who was there when they needed him when [Stanislav] Lobotka was out injured. He never let his side down. Well played both of them.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandNapoliManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

And to compound matters, Blitzer’s Danish club Brøndby have qualified for the Conference League, so the prospect of the FA Cup winners dropping into that competition is also not an option due to the European governing body’s multi-club ownership rules.John Textor seeks sale of Crystal Palace stake in bid to avoid European banRead morePalace executives, including Textor and the chairman, Steve Parish, metUefaofficials in Nyon on Tuesday to try to broker a solution without reaching agreement. The Guardian has learned that the so-called blind trust option in which Textor’s Palace shares would be placed in the hands of trustees next season was rejected by Uefa, as the club missed the deadline for registering the trust.Manchester City and Manchester United both used blind trusts to ensure compliance with Uefa multi-club rules last season after their partner clubs, Girona and Nice, also qualified for the Champions League and Europa League respectively, while the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, alsotransferred his shareswhen Nuno Espírito Santo’s side and his Greek club Olympiakos looked on course to qualify for next season’s Champions League.However, Uefa rules state that such ownership changes must take place before 1 March to take effect in time for the following season, with Palace told this week that they will not be shown any flexibility. European qualification was not on the agenda for Palace before March, as they were mid-table in the Premier League and had not progressed beyond the FA Cup fifth round.Palace are in danger of paying a heavy price for their lack of foresight, leading to considerable frustration at Uefa’s lack of flexibility.Uefa declined to comment, but sources at the European governing body stressed that given more than 300 clubs take part in its competitions each season, it has to ensure that the regulations are applied consistently.Textor told the Daily Mail after Tuesday’s meeting that he is looking to sell his 45% stake in Palace, but there is little realistic prospect of that happening in time to influence Uefa’s decision, with the Europa League qualifying draw due to take place on 17 June.View image in fullscreenJohn Textor bought a 40% stake in Lyon back in 2022.Photograph: Allili Mourad/SIPA/ShutterstockOnly three weeks ago, on the eve of the FA Cup final, the Guardian revealed that Textor was seeking tobuy out his fellow American shareholders, Blitzer and Josh Harris, who own 36% of the club between them.The two parties have previously held talks about buying each other out, but have never got close to an agreement on price. Textor also signalled his intention to sell Palace when he wasattempting to buy Everton last summerwithout making any discernible progress.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In addition to his 45% stake, Textor has 25% equal voting rights with Parish, Blitzer and Harris, and is known to have played a key role in the appointment of the manager, Oliver Glasner, last year. Textor has declined to comment.Uefa rules make clear that any influence at two clubs in the same competition is prohibited. “No one may simultaneously be involved in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration, and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a Uefa club competition,” the regulations state.“No individual or legal entity may have control or influence over more than one club participating in a Uefa club competition, (including) holding a majority of the shareholders’ voting rights; having the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the club; being a shareholder and alone controlling a majority of the shareholders’ voting rights pursuant to an agreement entered into with other shareholders of the club; or being able to exercise by any means a decisive influence in the decision-making of the club.”In the event of Palace being barred from the Europa League, Forest could be promoted to take their place after qualifying for the Conference League by finishing seventh in the Premier League. Palace’s rivals Brighton, who finished eighth, could then replace Forest in the Conference League.Palace’s European position is under threat rather than Lyon’s, as Uefa rules state that the club ranked highest in their domestic championship will be given entry to the competition. Lyon’s sixth-place finish in Ligue 1 gives them precedence over Palace, who came 12th in the Premier League.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceEuropa LeagueUefaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One that he thinks of when his head hits the pillow at night. Out of all the cloud-busting strikes that have flown from his blade in the last 15 years, all the boundary-clearing smites across the globe, delivered with dead-eyed assassin temperament under his trademark bleached mohawk. One shot stands out. One six to rule them all.“The one off Hardik Pandya at the Wankhede in the 2016 World Cup,” he says. “That one was just massive. Perfect swing. Right out of the middle.” There’s a moment of silence before Russell blows out his cheeks at the memory. “That one was crazy.”You can look it up and decide for yourself, watch the umpire Richard Kettleborough’s chuckle of astonishment as the ball soars into the top tier of Mumbai’s famous stadium and he signals the obvious. Yeah, that’s a six all right.England cricketers forced into emergency travel plans before third West Indies ODIRead moreRussell has just arrived in a “chilly” Durham before West Indies’ T20I series opener against England. The 37-year-old all-rounder is “feeling strong, feeling good” and is acclimatising to the north-east from the heat of the IPL, where he recently completed his 13th tournament and 11th stint with Kolkata Knight Riders.For more than a decade “Dre Russ” has been traversing the planet as one of world cricket’s most in-demand T20 franchise players. From Kolkata to LA, London to Lahore, Montreal to Sydney, for Tigers and Leopards, Warriors and Gladiators, Sultans, Royals, Kings, Tallawahs, Daredevils, Renegades and Rapids. To reel off all the teams Russell has represented is to sound like Billy Joel doing We Didn’t Start the Fire.Russell is a cricketing superstar and has no regrets about the path the game has taken him on. He’s won two T20I World Cups and the IPL, is one of only six men to win 10 or more T20 tournaments (proper tournaments – that involve five or more teams). Tellingly, three of the other men on that particular list are West Indian too: Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine. It’s a point that Russell is keen to make in response to Virat Kohli’s comments upon winning the IPL for the first time this week that the achievement was, for Kohli, “five levels under Test cricket”.“I think when you’re from India, Australia, England, those places where they look after their Test players, it’s totally different to being from West Indies,” says Russell. “Those guys get lucrative central contracts to play Test cricket and play on the biggest stages, of course they want to play. West Indians? You might play 50 or 100 Tests and you know, after you retire, there’s not much to show for it.”View image in fullscreenRussell fields off his own delivery against New Zealand during the ICC men’s T20 Cricket World Cup in 2024.Photograph: Darrian Traynor-ICC/ICC/Getty ImagesRussell isn’t just talking about the financial side of things, though adds: “Of course, you want the possibility of living a comfortable life and taking care of your family”. His is a familiar tale of a West Indian talent being either actively turned or eventually shying away from playing Test cricket, to be lured, understandably, by the siren call of shorter-format tournaments overseas. Largely as a result of confused and chaotic selection policies delivered by the parochial power structures ofCricketWest Indies.Progress has been made and reforms announcedrecently but too late for Russell and his generation. Although he makes a point of saying he “never retired from Test cricket”, despite only playing a solitary match against Sri Lanka in 2010. “I was basically pushed out of the Test set-up. They saw me as more of a white-ball player and that was that.” Would he trade some of those sixes and franchise wins for a longer crack at Test cricket?“Honestly? No. I believe in Test cricket, but at the end of the day, I’m a professional. It wasn’t part of my journey. I have no regrets because it wasn’t me that turned my back.”Russell is a keen watcher of the Test game and is taken by fellow all-rounder Ben Stokes. He describes “easy on the eye” Barbados-born Jacob Bethell as a star of the future. He was coached by Brendon McCullum in Kolkata in 2019 and is a fan of his approach. “He lets you be you, he backs you and gives you freedom. For me, that’s the best thing a coach can do.”He swats away any enquiries about whether he is weighing up his own career as if they were a juicy leg stump full toss: “I’m looking at at least another three years, age is just a number.” The ultimate impact player and finisher isn’t ready to call time just yet and does have his eye on something: after racking up more than 140 white-ball matches for West Indies he’s yet to score a century. “It’s not like I study the stats or anything … but that would be the cherry on the cake.”If it does come then it will no doubt be quick and include plenty of sixes. Word of warning for those in the English stands this week. Even if you are seated at the very top.Explore more on these topicsWest Indies cricket teamCricketVirat KohliinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We’ll see how long I can keep the jersey for. Friday is a stage that suits me a bit more, so I’m going in with a bit more confidence than today.”Deignan was prominent ­throughout the stage, but when Le Court, winner of this year’s Liège-Bastogne-Liège, broke clear on ­Langburn’s Bank, the steepest ­gradient of the second classified climb, Deignan’s Lidl-Trek team were distanced.Le Court’s powerful acceleration on the 16% sections at the base of the climb proved too much for her rivals, including Deignan’s teammate, the Paris 2024 silver medallist Anna ­Henderson, who tried to give chase but was unable to follow the move.View image in fullscreenIt was a frustrating day for Lizzie Deignan (right) and her Lidl-Trek team.Photograph: Alex Broadway/Getty ImagesOnly Faulkner, of EF Education-Oatly, was able to close the gap and the pair, who joined forces on the descent, then worked together to build a half-minute lead on their pursuers during the undulating run into Redcar. Even though Deignan’s team had four of their five riders in the chasing group, and were aided both by Cat Ferguson’s Movistar team and the French FDJ-Suez team, they were unable to close down the half-minute advantage.But Faulkner almost came unstuck on a right-hand bend in the closing kilometres, misjudging her speed and skidding to a halt against a traffic island. Sportingly, Le Court, knowing that their break had a better chance of success if the pair stayed together, waited for the American.While Lorena Wiebes, a past stage winner, took third in the sprint, ­Ferguson, making her debut in the race, was the first British finisher fifth. The junior world road race champion is now sixth overall, 18 seconds adrift of Le Court.Ferguson, who also took the lead in the best young rider ­classification, admitted she had expected there to be a ­regrouping in the final kilometres. “I thought it would definitely come down to a sprint,” the 19-year-old said, “so for the two to stay away was a surprise. They were too strong, so credit to them for staying away.”View image in fullscreenCat Ferguson receives the young rider’s jersey.Photograph: Olly Hassell/SWpix.com/ShutterstockBy her own admission Deignan’s days as an overall contender are probably gone, but Skipton-born Ferguson, seen as her natural heir, is well-placed to make an impact as the race goes on. “I’ve not thought about my strategy yet,” she said, “but I’m just going to take it day by day and approach each day like we did today, like a real team.”Friday’s second stage of the four-day race takes the peloton from Hartlepool to Saltburn-by-the-sea and finishes with the infamous ­hairpins of Saltburn Bank, the venue for recent National Championships. The steep climb to the finish is well-known to British riders in the peloton and was pivotal to the outcome of the women’s road race in 2023 and 2024, both of which were won by Pfeiffer Georgi, of the Picnic PostNL team.Explore more on these topicsWomen's TourLizzie DeignanCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the first big trial to result from the #MeToo movement in thevideo games industry, and Haushalter said the case had revealed “overwhelming” evidence of harassment.In four days of hearings, female former staff members variously described being tied to a chair, forced to do handstands, subjected to constant comments about sex and their bodies, having to endure sexist and homophobic jokes, drawings of penises being stuck to computers, a manager who farted in workers’ faces or scribbled on women with marker pens, gave unsolicited shoulder massages, played pornographic films in an open-plan office, and another executive who cracked a whip near people’s heads. The three men deny all charges.Haushalter said “the world of video games and its subculture” had an element of “systemic” sexism and potential abuse. He said the#MeToomovement in the gaming industry had allowed people to speak out.“It’s not that these actions were not punished by the law before. It’s just that they were silenced, and from now on they will not be silenced,” he said.Ubisoft is a French family business that rose to become one of the biggest video game creators in the world. It has been behind several blockbusters includingAssassin’s Creed,Far Cryand the children’s favouriteJust Dance.The court in Bobigny, in Seine-Saint-Denis, heard that between 2010 and 2020 at Ubisoft’s offices in Montreuil, east of Paris, the three executives created an atmosphere of bullying and sexism that one member of staff likened to a “boys’ club”. One alleged victim told the court: “The sexual remarks and sexual jokes were almost daily.”Tommy François, 52, a former vice-president of editorial and creative services, is accused of sexual harassment, bullying and attempted sexual assault. He was alleged once to have tied a female member of staff to a chair with tape, pushed the chair into a lift and pressed a button at random. He was also accused of forcing one woman wearing a skirt to do handstands.“He was my superior and I was afraid of him. He made me do handstands. I did it to get it over with and get rid of him,” one woman told the court.At a 2015 office Christmas party with a Back to the Future theme, François allegedly told a member of staff that he liked her 1950s dress. He then allegedly stepped towards her to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her by the arms and back. She shouted and broke free. François denied all allegations.Another witness told the court that during a video games fair in the US, François “grabbed me by the hair and kissed me by force”. She said no one reacted, and that when she reported it to her human resources manager she was told “don’t make a big thing of it”.The woman said that later, in a key meeting, another unnamed senior figure told staff he had seen her “snogging” François, “even though he knew it had been an assault”.She said François called her into his office to show her pictures of his naked backside on his computers and on a phone. “Once he drew a penis on my arm when I was in a video call with top management,” she said.The woman said these incidents made her feel “stupefied, humiliated and professionally discredited”.François told the court he denied all charges. He said there had been a “culture of joking around”. He said: “I never tried to harm anyone.”View image in fullscreenSerge Hascoët told the court: ‘I have never wanted to harass anyone and I don’t think I have.’Photograph: Xavier Galiana/AFP/Getty ImagesSerge Hascoët, 59, Ubisoft’s former chief creative officer and second-in-command, was accused of bullying and sexual harassment. The court heard how at a meeting of staff on an away day he complained about a senior female employee, saying she clearly did not have enough sex and that he would “show how to calm her” by having sex with her in a meeting room in front of everyone.He was alleged to have handed a young female member of staff a tissue in which he had blown his nose, saying: “You can resell it, it’s worth gold at Ubisoft.”The court heard he made guttural noises in the office and talked about sex. Hascoët was also alleged to have bullied assistants by making them carry out personal tasks for him such as going to his home to wait for parcel deliveries.Hascoët denied all the charges. He said: “I have never wanted to harass anyone and I don’t think I have.”The former game director Guillaume Patrux, 41, is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. He was alleged to have punched walls, mimed hitting staff, cracked a whip near colleagues’ faces, threatened to carry out an office shooting and played with a cigarette lighter near workers’ faces, setting alight a man’s beard. He denied the charges.The panel of judges retired to consider their verdict, which will be handed down at a later date.Explore more on these topicsFrance#MeToo movementGamesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We see this, and it means that it is normal that we must also adapt to this. We need adaptation. We need discussion about the rules that we want to have, and there is no taboo.”He added: “I see the necessity to adapt but we must also do this respecting our core values.”There is growing political pressure in several European countries to overhaul the ECHR’s scope, particularly in response to migration.Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, is expected to take an even harder line in a speech on Friday. She will say that Britain should consider leaving the convention entirely, arguing that it impedes efforts to tackle migration.“I have thought long and hard about this, and I am increasingly of the view that we will need to leave, because I am yet to see a clear and coherent route to change within our current legal structures,” she will say.Human rights organisations have expressed alarm at recent rhetoric around reform, warning that undermining or withdrawing from the convention risks weakening protection for society’s most vulnerable groups, including refugees fleeing war and persecution.Many argue that the ECHR plays a vital role in holding states to account, especially in areas such as detention, pushbacks over border crossings and surveillance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The chair of the victims’ committee, Anders Helliksen, said the state had “finally accepted its responsibility”.The Kielland, a semi-submersible platform that at the time was housing 212 workers from the nearby Edda drilling rig, capsized when one of its five legs snapped in strong winds and high seas on 27 March 1980. Twenty-three Britons were among the dead.Several investigations have failed to assign responsibility, with the rig’s French builders blamed for structural failings and its Norwegian and US owner and operator, Stavanger Drilling and Phillips Petroleum, for not maintaining or anchoring it properly.The disaster led to major changes in safety routines and regulations in the oil industry, but a report by experts at the University of Stavanger this year concluded the Norwegian authorities’ actions before and after the collapse were seriously flawed.While the immediate cause was a welding defect, multiple mistakes contributed to the heavy loss of life: doors and hatches were left open, only five workers onboard had had safety training, and the platform was never approved for use as living quarters.“This incident became a disaster because of a long chain of negligence, omissions and violations of rules designed precisely to prevent an accident becoming a disaster,” one of the report’s authors, Eva Joly, said earlier this year.She told Norwegian media: “The fatigue failure itself could also have been discovered if normal audit requirements had been met and exemptions had not been granted. This was the state’s responsibility.”The 89 survivors and the bereaved families – between 300 and 400 children lost their fathers, according to campaigners – received some compensation from Phillips and Stavanger Drilling’s insurers in the 80s, but no payout from the state.“Many have had a very difficult time, with trauma, psychiatric issues, substance abuse and poor finances,” the Kielland Networksaid on its website. The state was also accused of failing to properly investigate the disaster or care for victims.Norway’s parliament, the Storting, formally apologised for state authorities’ shortcomings in 2022, a year after the national auditor general issued strongly worded criticism of the government for failing in its duty to victims.The parliamentary motion said: “It is now time for the victims of the largest industrial accident in Norwegian history to receive compensation – making it also possible for survivors, bereaved families and society at large to put an end to this matter.”Passed by a narrow majority, it demanded the government set up a “separate compensation scheme” for the Kielland victims, and that the auditor general “clarify the state’s responsibility” for the disaster and its lack of support for victims.“The fact that this has taken so long shows that the state has never taken any responsibility for what happened in the North Sea,” said one survivor, Oddbjørn Lerbrekk. “It’s about time.”The amount of compensation has not yet been set.Explore more on these topicsNorwayOilFossil fuelsEnergyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The strikes will continue for as long as it takes. Unite calls on the decision makers to let common sense prevail in upcoming negotiations.”Bin workers in Birmingham have been striking since January and walked out indefinitely in March in a dispute over job and pay cuts.Piles of black bags in the streets and overflowing wheelie bins have led to an influx of rats in some parts of the city.Huge queues have formed at mobile waste collection points as residents try to get rid of their rubbish. Police were called to shut down roads because of overwhelming crowds on one occasion.The city council made a renewed offer to the workers last week after mediated negotiations, but Unite said it was too little and too late.‘The posh areas get cleared’: bin strikes illustrate Birmingham’s wealth gapRead more“After smearing these workers in public since January and telling them to accept a fair and reasonable offer that never existed, the council finally put a proposal in writing last week,” Graham said. “True to form, the proposal came weeks late and was not in line with the ballpark offer discussed during Acas talks in May.”She said government commissioners brought in to oversee the running of the council after it declared itself effectively bankrupt in 2023 had “watered down the deal” despite not taking part in negotiations.Relations between striking workers and the council have continued to deteriorate, and in recent weeks the council was granted a court order to stop waste vehicles being blocked from leaving depots by those on the picket line.It said more than 12,000 tonnes of uncollected waste had accumulated on the streets one week in May because collections were disrupted “due to industrial action by pickets” where police had scaled down their presence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It previously said only 17 former WRCOs could lose a maximum of £6,000 and that all have been offered alternative roles on the same pay grade.A council spokesperson said: “This is a service that needs to be transformed to one that citizens of Birmingham deserve and the council remains committed to resolving this dispute.“We have made a fair and reasonable offer that we have asked Unite to put to their members and we are awaiting their response.”The council denied that its leader or the commissioners had watered down any offer, and said Unite’s ballot was not a response to its latest offer made through Acas.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamIndustrial actionTrade unionsUnitenewsShareReuse this content"

What did you do? How late were you in your pregnancy? Were you trying to hide something, were you just so emotionally distraught you couldn’t do anything else?”‘I didn’t know what I was supposed to do’: US women who miscarry are in dangerous legal limbo post-RoeRead moreHe added: “If you were relieved, and you had been telling people, ‘I’d rather get ran over by a bus than have this baby,’ that may play into law enforcement’s thinking, too.”Truman said he was personally opposed to prosecuting women who miscarry, but other law enforcement officials inWest Virginiahad said they would be willing to do so under laws that dictate the disposal of human remains. Although West Virginia bans virtually all abortions, its ban – like other abortion bans in the US – does not penalize abortion patients but instead people who provide the procedure.To protect themselves, Truman suggested that women call law enforcement after they have a miscarriage.“Call your doctor. Call law enforcement, or 911, and just say, ‘I miscarried. I want you to know,’” Truman said.The wave of state-level abortion bans that followed the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade sparked fears among women and abortion supporters that people who miscarry could face charges over their handling of fetal remains. As abortions and miscarriages – which are known in medical parlance as “spontaneous abortions” – can look deeply similar to medical professionals, abortion bans can incentivize police totreat pregnancy losses like crime scenes.In 2023, a woman in Ohio was charged with felony abuse of a corpse after she miscarried into a toilet. A grand jury ultimatelydecided not to indict. Earlier this year, after a Georgia woman suffered a miscarriage and was found bleeding in a parking lot, police charged her with concealing the death of another person and throwing away or abandoning a dead body.Those charges were dropped.“There is no one-size-fits-all way to handle fetal remains in these situations – in fact, doctors often tell women to simply miscarry at home,” Dana Sussman, senior vice-president of the reproductive-rights organization Pregnancy Justice, said in a statement issued after news of the Georgia case broke.“No one is taught how to handle fetal remains, and police and prosecutors should not be weighing in on how women in this situation respond.”Explore more on these topicsWest VirginiaMiscarriageAbortionReproductive rightsWomen's healthRoe v WadeLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister said he wanted to tear up red tape that allowed nature to be a blocker to development.Photograph: Michel Charlton/PAJuniper, aninfluential environmentalistwho is a confidant of King Charles, insisted that “nature underpins growth, so we’ve got to grow nature in order to get economic growth”.Asked if Starmer and Reeves understood that, Juniper said: “I haven’t spoken to them, so I don’t know, but there’s a very strong evidence base that says that this is the reality. I report to the secretary of state for the environment [Steve Reed] and he very much does get it.”Critics of the bill have questioned the conflict of interest in giving Natural England new funds from developers while expecting the body to regulate their actions but Juniper said: “That really isn’t the culture of the organisation. I’ve never come across any example in Natural England where we’re looking at securing more money because it will help Natural England.”But that could change if a future populist government appointed a housebuilder as chair of Natural England. Juniper said such dangers emphasised the importance of long-term legislation such as the Climate Change Act and ensuring “the baton of nature recovery gets carried across not only years but decades”.“I’m sure the same kind of things will be raised in relation to the planning and infrastructure bill to make sure that we’ve got certainty for the long term.”Asked if he is happy with the bill in its current form, Juniper said: “We’ve got our specialists who are working with government to be able to get it as good as it can be in terms of the detail as well as the broad ambition, which we very much support. Parliament will scrutinise all of that. Ministers will make decisions about what they believe are the best choices and we’ll see where we finish up.”Juniper outlined his view that neither nature nor Natural England are a “blocker” on economic growth, but an essential precondition for a thriving economy, atTrumpington Meadowson the edge of his home city of Cambridge.The housing estate was built on green belt, but arable fields were turned into wildflower meadows, which are now a nature reserve where garden warblers sing and grass snakes hide – a store for flood water and carbon, which is also enjoyed by local people.“It’s led to a really good outcome where you can see nature recovery linked to a housing development obviously not only of great benefit to the wildlife but also to the people who live here,” said Juniper, who arrived at the estate on his battered bicycle. “Rather than just being constantly in tension – ‘do we do development or do we have nature?’ – we need more of both and this is the kind of approach that can deliver more of both.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Critics of the planning bill have questioned the conflict of interest in giving Natural England new funds from developers while expecting the body to regulate their actions.Photograph: Julian Eales/AlamyResearch examining more than 17,000 planning appeals made last year found thatnewts or bats featured in just 3.3%. “Natural England is held up as a blocker to development not necessarily by government but in the newspapers sometimes and amongst some of the development community, but if you look at the reality of the position we object to fewer than 1% of planning applications every year,” he said.Under the planning bill, the nature restoration fund will give Natural England vital new resources. When Juniper was appointed,the agency was suffering from deep cuts after a decade of austerityand one staffer asked him: “Have you been brought in to close us down?” Since then, Juniper has reinvigorated the agency, tripling its budget, but has had to make job cuts this year after a funding freeze – a real-terms cut.Juniper argues the nature restoration fund will enable Natural England “to take a large-scale view of the landscape, not just the nature that’s affected where the houses have been built, but to look at the effects on the wider environment, including protected areas that might be quite far away”. He said they had sought this approach to tackle “landscape pressures” such as river pollution and too many nutrients in sensitive meadows and wetlands “for years”.“Moving to much more strategic approaches whereby we can get our arms around these bigger landscape pressures, that’s key,” he said. “This represents a real opportunity but the detail has to be right including having a high level of certainty about will it work, a high level of ambition about what’s aiming to be achieved and some sense that the resources will be available.”Doubts have also been cast on nature mitigation being carried out after a housing estate has been built, given that a study last year found thatjust 53% of nature mitigation measures obliged by planning permissions such as new trees, hedges and bird boxes actually appearedon new housing estates. “Having the right kinds of safeguards is going to be important,” said Juniper.Juniper’s latest book,Just Earth, argues that tackling the biodiversity crisis is completely connected with reducing human inequalities. “People on low incomes are the ones who tend to suffer the worst effects of environmental decline whether it’s access to green space, air pollution or a poor diet,” he said.“One of the most fundamental challenges faced for nature recovery in this country and pretty much everywhere is this ongoing misperception that there is a choice between recovering nature and growing the economy and improving conditions for people.“Nature is often seen as hostile to that and it could not be further from the truth. The more we improve the environment, the more this can help to lessen some of these ongoing inequalities.”Explore more on these topicsNatural EnglandPlanning policyWildlifeConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

The substance, which is similar to human fingernails, is commonly used for traditional medicine in China, Vietnam and other Asian countries. Dealers in the hidden market will pay tens of thousands of dollars for the horns, which are falsely believed to be effective at treating fevers, pain and a low sex drive in traditional medicine.Butnew researchin the journal Science has highlighted ways to better protect the animals from illegal hunters. An assessment of rhino protection methods in the Greater Kruger region of South Africa – home to a quarter of the continent’s rhinos – found that removing horns reduced poaching by nearly 80% between 2017 and 2023.In a collaboration between scientists, conservationists and government officials, the research found no statistical evidence that traditional anti-poaching interventions – such as rangers, detection cameras, dog tracking and helicopters – caused significant reductions in rhino poaching, despite their multimillion-dollar cost, even though they were successful at detecting hundreds of poachers.“Dehorning rhinos to reduce incentives for poaching was found to achieve a 78% reduction in poaching using just 1.2% of the overall rhino protection budget,” said Dr Tim Kuiper of Nelson Mandela University, a lead author of the study. “We might need to rethink our goals. Do we just want to arrest poachers? It doesn’t appear to be making a massive difference to reducing rhino poaching.”To dehorn a rhino, workerssedate the animal, apply a blindfold and earplugs, and cut off the horn with a power saw. The horn will gradually regrow – an average rhino needs to be dehorned every 1.5 to two years. The process poses a very low risk to the animal and does not hurt it.“The headline result is that dehorning stood out for its effectiveness. We are cautious to say that the other interventions are not working. They worked when measured by whether they were detecting poachers. But detecting and arresting a load of poachers doesn’t necessarily bend the curve on rhino poaching,” Kuiper said.View image in fullscreenA sedated rhino has its horns cut off in South Africa. The procedure poses a very low risk to the animal.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesIn South Africa, rhino poaching remains high,with 103 killed in the first three months of 2025. Last year, 420 were lost. In recent decades, rhino populations have collapsed in Asia and Africa due to poaching and habitat loss, continuing falls driven by European colonial hunters.Sauntering on streets and grazing on lawns: what happens when rhinos move into town?Read moreBut the researchers behind the project, representing the University of Cape Town, Nelson Mandela University, University of Stellenbosch and the University of Oxford and other conservation institutions, cautioned that dehorning rhinos was not a magic bullet. A significant stump of horn mass remains on the rhino after dehorning, and some poachers were still prepared to kill rhinos for this section.Sharon Haussmann, a pioneer in rhino conservation in South Africa and co-author on the paper, played a leading role in coordinating conservation efforts in the study area. She died unexpectedly atthe weekendand Kuiper wanted to highlight the collaboration between different sectors that are often mistrustful of each other in her memory.“Is a rhino still a rhino without its horn? That’s a bigger question,” said Kuiper.One study of black rhinosindicated that while poaching rates decreased, dehorned animals became more timid and covered much smaller ranges. Researchers believe that horn is used to establish territories and dehorned rhinos were unable to do this after the procedure.“We wouldn’t like to keep dehorning them for the next 100 years,” Kuiper said. “Ideally we would like to address the drivers of poaching. But it is better than the impacts of poaching”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsAnimalsThe age of extinctionIllegal wildlife tradeConservationSouth AfricaWildlifeAfricaEndangered speciesnewsShareReuse this content"

In several lower-elevation locations within the headwaters of the Colorado River, mountain terrain is already snow-free – the earliest complete melting of snowpack on record.Sexual exploitation and domestic violence soared after Lahaina wildfire, report findsRead more“Such rapid melt rates are not normal,” according to aspecial updateby the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) last month.All western states now have below-normal snowpacks, including California, where this season’s snowfall was above average. About one-third of the western US is now in “severe” drought or worse, the highest proportion in more than two years.This summer’sseasonal wildfire forecastcalls for a continuation of hot and dry weather, especially in the Pacific north-west. Experts now fear that quickly depleting mountains snows will limit summertime water availability in streams and rivers throughout the west, and may kick off a potential feedback loop that could intensify and expand the current drought.In addition to the ominous environmental conditions, federal fire crews are short-staffed due to accelerated retirements and staff reductions taking place across the myriad organizations that make upthe nation’s unified wildland firefighting force.Off-season training has been hampered by an across-the-board spending freeze instituted by Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”. Some crews have reported constraints even on basic off-season necessities,like the inability to buy fuel for chainsaws during training exercisesdue to Doge setting purchase limits to $1.The reduced-readiness state means that firefighters and their support teams, calledincident management teams, could be quickly overwhelmed.“The thing that has me really worried is that I don’t think we’re going to have enough incident management teams to handle all the large fires that are going to pop this year,” said Jim Whittington, a retired federal wildfire public affairs officer who is now a faculty member at Oregon State University.Incident management teams – which include skilled support staff such as meteorologists, cartographers and supply chain experts – are deployed on short notice whenever a prolonged and complex firefight emerges. Whittington and his colleagues estimate that cuts by the Trump administration mean federal agencies will be able to field about 15-20% fewer incident management teams this summer, even amid an outsized fire threat.At the regional level,Washington cut its wildfire prevention spending in halfamid a state budget crisis, raising concern for public safety this summer. Oregon officialsheld a news conference last weekto say that cuts to Environmental Protection Agency, US Forest Service and National Weather Service staff will leave their state less prepared for this year’s fires.Given that fire season isalready on a record-setting pacein the prairie provinces of Canada, Whittington also expectslimited support from international partners, furthering the burden for US fire crews.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Given this year’s staffing constraints, however, they may need to stay at their home offices.The Trump administration’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) is undergoing a comprehensive review.The rapid onset of summer-like conditions is a clear symptom of the climate crisis, and ithas been occurring more frequently in the western US in recent years.There are more than a million homes in the wildland-urban interface in Washington state – about the same as in southern California –and the number is growing quickly.“There’s a good chance that the Wildland Fire Service will not be able to meet the expectations that we’ve created in the past,” said Whittington. “I know they’re going to bust their ass to try.”“I think everybody who lives in fire country needs to have a really good plan this year and have some contingencies off those plans because you never can tell when you’re going to be in the thick of it, and there just may not be the resources there that you expect there to be.”Explore more on these topicsUS wildfiresTrump administrationClimate crisisWaternewsShareReuse this content"

It is absurd and misleading to call any part of the ocean that allows these activities protected.”Campaigners have been calling for years for a ban, but public outcry has intensified sincea film by Sir David Attenborough was released last month, to coincide with his 99th birthday.The film, Ocean – which was released in cinemas and will be available on streaming services in June – showed in detail some of the vital habitats raked by the massive nets that in effect plough up the seabed, leaving deep scars where it can take many years for marine life to recover.Toby Perkins, the chair of the Commons committee, said: “Ministers must ensure that marine protected areas live up to their name. [They] have all the information they need to press ahead with banning bottom trawling in the offshore protected areas where it presents the most risk. Why the delay? Our oceans cannot afford any more prevarication. It is time to act.”The UK will send representatives to a UN oceans conference later this month. Ministers have previously indicated they could take action, and there are protections in place against damaging fishing practices in about 60% of the current marine protected areas but no full ban has yet been brought in.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment,Foodand Rural Affairs said: “Our precious marine animals and habitats have been under threat for too long. This government is committed to protecting and restoring our oceans to good health.”Explore more on these topicsFishingConservationFoodAnimalsMarine lifeWildlifeGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Firefighters dealt with about 10 separate ebike-related fires over just five days.Government data also shows ebike-related fires led to a total of eight deaths in 2024.In December, a coroner warned of the life-threatening dangers of charging ebikes indoors, after the death of eight-year-old Luke Albiston O’Donnell in Merseyside, during a fire started as the result of an ebike’s charging lithium battery igniting.In another tragic case in Coventry, a fire caused by an ebike battery killed Natasha Johnson-Mall and Karlo Bogdan, along with their two dogs.Nearly half of the fires reported in 2024 broke out inside homes, often in bedrooms, kitchens or corridors. Just over a third started outdoors, including in gardens, balconies or sheds. In almost all cases, the battery or generator was identified as the source of the fire.In response to the growing risks, the UK government has introduced new legislation aimed at regulating the sale of ebikes and similar products. However, the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill has come under fire for failing to directly mention the threat posed by lithium-ion batteries.Speaking in the House of Commons, the Liberal Democrat MP Clive Jones said the bill must “address the growing number of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries”.“There remains no reference in the bill to lithium-ion batteries, despite the real and growing harm they cause,” he said.Justin Madders, a parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department for Business and Trade, responded: “While I fully recognise the concerns raised about batteries, the bill does not and should not single out individual product types.” He added: “At this stage, we are actively exploring what regulatory changes might make the greatest difference on lithium-ion batteries.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A digger was used to remove rubble from one of the abandoned structures. Investigators have also deployed ground-penetrating radar technology that can identify anomalies under the surface.They began winding down the searches in Atalaia, near Lagos, on Thursday afternoon. At around 5pm the German and Portuguese teams were seen having a debrief before shaking hands and embracing. There was a round of applause before one officer was seen carrying a crate of German beer.After the beers were carried away, some officers struggled to grapple with the tents they were taking down because of the blustery conditions.As they packed up, officers could be seen carrying equipment such as bins, boxes and folding tables away from their base area. Personnel also loaded vans, which were parked at the base area near to abandoned buildings, with some of the equipment used in the searches.Earlier in the day, a group of 15 officers had taken part in a hillside briefing by a derelict farmhouse.

He said he was “sure that Mr Kohli did nothing to deserve this” and that the pair had “found this funny, that’s why you were laughing as you did it”.During the attack, which was described at trial as gratuitous, the boy hurled racist abuse at Kohli while punching and kicking him.The girl, who was 12 at the time, filmed the assault on her phone and could be heard laughing and encouraging the boy to attack Kohli.Kohli, who suffered a broken neck and three broken ribs, had been on his daily dog walk in a park near his home in Braunstone Town when the two children accosted him.“Our house feels so empty without him and will never be the same,” his daughter, Susan Kohli, said in a statement after the teenagers were convicted. “The area we have loved for so many years and called home feels so different now and we will never feel safe. Having happened only a minute’s walk of where we live is something we cannot get away from and it is a constant reminder.”She said her father was “a loving dad, grandad, brother, uncle, a retired businessman and a close friend to many”, as well as “an amazing man who loved life”.She added: “I feel angry and disappointed that the sentence they have both received today does not, I believe, reflect the severity of the crime they committed. When they are released, they still have been full lives ahead of them. They can rebuild their lives. We cannot. More could have been done to prevent my dad being killed.”Harpreet Sandhu KC, prosecuting, told the court there was evidence the attack was premeditated and racially motivated and part of a “deliberate humiliation”. Kohli told paramedics who treated him he had been called a racist slur during the assault.The court heard the girl had taken an image of Kohli a week before the assault, that the boy approached Kohli while wearing a balaclava, and that the video played in court was not the entirety of the attack, but “part of a seven-and-a-half-minute period of sustained aggression”.Sandhu said the boy had told a number of people that his assault was not intended to be fatal. He had told one witness he “had anger issues and just didn’t stop punching Mr Kohli” and another that once he began the attack on Kohli, who was then on the ground, that he “just couldn’t stop kicking him”.The court heard the boy had lied about details of the assault, saying Kohli had a knife and that he had seen Kohli hitting the girl. Both claims were found to be untrue.Defending the boy, Balraj Bhatia KC told the court Kohli’s injuries were consistent with a single push, not with a sustained assault, and the court could not be certain that the attack, for which he said the boy was remorseful, was racially motivated as no racist language was heard in the clip or found on the boy’s phone.However, the judge said the boy’s remorse was “diluted” as he had refused to take responsibility for his crime and lied to police.Bhatia argued that the boy’s age led him act in a way he regretted, and he had “made significant strides in bettering himself and moving in an appropriate way forward”.Jeremy Benson KC, representing the girl, said it was not the prosecution’s case that the girl’s crimes were the same as the boy’s as she “had no intention to cause physical harm of any sort” and that she was “some distance from the original violence”.Benson argued that a custodial sentence would have a “severe and harmful” impact on the girl’s mental health. The statements from both defence barristers drew subdued reactions of anger and disbelief from the public gallery.Explore more on these topicsLeicestershireCrimeUK criminal justiceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) causes fibrosis (scarring) and can lead to cirrhosis and is linked to greater risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and liver cancer.But the vast majority of people do not know they have the condition. An international group of researchers examined prevalence and diagnosis of aggressive fatty liver disease in the US, UK, Germany andFrance.The researchers found that just under 3% of people in the UK, France and Germany, and 4% of those in the US have MASH, but diagnosis rates were below 18%. That means about 20 million people in the US, UK, Germany and France are living with MASH but only 2.5 million people have a diagnosis, leaving more than three-quarters – about 16.7 million people – unaware they have the condition.Thereport, published in the Lancet Regional Health Europeand presented at the meeting of the global thinktank onsteatotic liver diseasein Barcelona, Spain, on Thursday, calls for a doubling in diagnosis rates from 2022 levels. Traditionally, MASH was diagnosed through biopsy, but now non-invasive methods such as blood tests, ultrasound and MRI scans can be used. As a result, everyone with type 2 diabetes; obesity combined with one or more other risk factors; and those with persistently high liver enzymes should be screened for MASH, the researchers conclude.Dr Jeffrey Lazarus, the lead author of the paper and a professor of global health in New York and Barcelona, said: “Undiagnosed MASH costs economies billions of pounds in lost productivity and poor health. Unless diagnosis rates are doubled, alongside similar increases in treatment and care, direct health costs alone are predicted to triple over the next 20 years.”Responding to the findings, Emmanouil Tsochatzis, a professor of hepatology at University College London and a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Free hospital, said: “More than 15 million people across the US and Europe have the deadliest form of fatty liver disease – and don’t know it. Without faster diagnosis and access to treatment, the human and economic toll will skyrocket.”The research has also prompted renewed calls for weight loss jabs to be used to treat MASH.Contraception warning over weight-loss drugs after dozens of pregnanciesRead moreDr Paul Brennan, a co-author of the Lancet paper and a hepatologist at NHS Tayside, said: “GLP-1s (including Wegovy and Mounjaro) offer the potential to resynchronise our metabolism, by introducing feelings of satiety – fullness – and delaying the time the stomach takes to empty. These effects often result in reduced calorie intake, and improvements in how the liver handles nutrients as a result of weight loss, thus reducing scar tissue formation in the liver.”Michael Betel, the president of the Fatty Liver Alliance, said: “Too many people living with type 2 diabetes or obesity are never tested for MASH until it’s too late. We need a huge increase in liver health assessments in patients living with these diseases, alongside lifestyle changes and for some, when appropriate, weight loss drugs to reduce blood sugar and appetite. While weight loss drugs weren’t created to treat liver disease,trialssuggest they could benefit multiple metabolic-related conditions, and improve our liver health.”Separately astudypublished on Wednesday found that the diabetes drug dapagliflozin, which reduces blood sugar levels, can also reduce fat levels and fibrosis in the liver.Explore more on these topicsHealthMedical researchGermanyFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Leithfield School principal Rob Cavanagh told Stuff the response to the fundraiser had been “pretty overwhelming”, with 19,000 blocks sold.“I wasn’t quite aware of what a popular commodity butter is in this day and age.”Meanwhile, some people are using social media to teach others how to make their own butter, and bakeries across the country have reported making the tough choice to either increase their prices or face closure.Owner of Kayes Bakery based in Southland, Luella Penniall, said she was frustrated at having to import cheaper alternatives, despite living in a country that produces so much dairy produce.New Zealand is the world’s top dairy exporter, producing a third of the world’s dairy trade. The industry represents about $11.3bn or 3.2% of New Zealand’s GDP, and plays a significant role in regional economies.Penniall uses an Australian broker to find the best priced butter of the right quality, which often results in half her butter order being shipped from Australia.Kayes Bakery uses roughly three tonnes of butter every two months. The business is “surrounded by dairy farms” and Penniall would prefer to use New Zealand products but the cost can be prohibitive.“Farmers deserve everything they get, they work hard, but somewhere in between it seems to be getting out of control.”Global supply problems and high demand for New Zealand’s products are driving local prices higher, according to the chief executive of Infometrics, Brad Olsen.About 95% of New Zealand’s dairy products are exported, which means the international market determines domestic prices.It is “a double-edged sword”, where high prices are good for the country’s economy but tough for domestic shoppers, Olsen said.“I’m not saying that at the moment its the right happy balance, but given that commodity prices … are going to be dictated by the international market, that is sort of how the game is played.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificFoodInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Bongolan previouslytestified about her friendship with Ventura and described an alleged incident from 2016 in which she says that Combs dangled herfrom the balcony of Ventura’s 17th-floor apartment in Los Angeles for 10 to 15 seconds, before throwing her on to some balcony furniture.She testified that the incident left her bruised and emotionally scarred and that she experiences nightmares and paranoia.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyerschallengedBongolan’s credibility, citing inconsistencies between her current testimony and prior statements she gave regarding the alleged balcony incident.Cassie Ventura’s friend testifies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs dangled her from balconyRead moreOn Thursday morning, Combs’s lawyers pressed her on the timeline. They claimed that the alleged balcony incident could not have occurred when she said because Combs was performing on the east coast for much of September 2016.Before concluding the cross-examination, Combs’s lawyer suggested that Bongolan was lying about the balcony incident and the injuries.“I can’t agree with you,” Bongolan responded, adding that she could not recall the exact date of the alleged incident, but she “will never forget him holding me on that balcony”.Another former girlfriend of Combs’s, who alleges she was abused and made to participate in drug-fueled sex sessions known as “freak-offs”, began testifying on Thursday afternoon.Testifying under the pseudonym “Jane”, the woman has been described by prosecutors as a single mother who first met Combs in 2020.Jane testified on Thursday that she met Combs in 2020 during a girls’ trip with a friend who was dating him at the time. Jane recalled finding Combs “really charming” and said they exchanged numbers.They began dating in early 2021, she said, and were still dating at the time of his arrest last September.Jane said that she fell “pretty head over heels” for Combs after their first date in early 2021, and that several months later, Combs began introducing her to his sexual fantasies and the idea of her having sex with other men.One night in May 2021, she said she agreed because she wanted to make him happy. Within hours, she said she was in a hotel room watching his assistants prepare the room for a so-called freak-off.Soon after, she said a man from an escort service arrived, and she said she had sex with him while Combs watched and masturbated.Jane testified that the May 2021 encounter opened a “Pandora’s box” in their relationship, adding that “it was a door that I was unable to shut for the remainder of the relationship.”Jane told the court that she only wanted to have sex with Combs, not other men, and that she repeatedly told Combs this during their relationship but that he would be dismissive.Jane said that she felt “obligated” to comply since Combs controlled aspects of her life, including paying her rent.The court was then adjourned for the day and Jane is expected to return to the stand to continue her testimony on Friday morning.Prosecutors have said that Jane’stestimony is similar to that of Ventura, Combs’s former longtime girlfriend, who testified duringthe first week of the trial.Ventura, who dated Combs on and off from 2007 to 2018, told jurors last month that she was subjected to years ofphysical and emotional abuseduring the relationship. She alleged shewas coerced, through violence andblackmail, into taking part in the so-called freak-offs which she said were orchestrated and directed by Combs and involved drugs and male sex workers.During cross-examination, Combs’s attorneys sought to portray Ventura as a willing participant in the freak-offs, framing the encounters as part of a“swingers lifestyle”.Now in its fourth week, the trial has featured graphic and emotional testimony from several witnesses. To date,more than 16 witnesses have testified, including thesinger Dawn Richard,three of Combs’s formerassistants,Ventura’s motherandrapper Scott Mescudi, also knownas Kid Cudi.Combs, 55, wasarrested in September 2024and faces federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.Prosecutorsallegethat Combs ran a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice, with the help of his associates and employees.While Combs’s lawyers have acknowledged his history of domestic violence, they argue that the women participated in the freak-offs consensually and they maintain that Combs isnot guilty of sex trafficking or racketeering, or of operating a criminal enterprise.Prosecutors have said that they may rest their case next week, with the defense expected to begin calling its own witnesses soon after.However, Combs’s lawyershave signaledthat their presentation may take longer than anticipated, potentially extending the trial into early July.If convicted on all counts, Combs could face life in prison.The Associated Press contributed reportingIn the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

It was considered eradicated in 1998, but cases continue to occur due to spread from other countries.The US is also confronting a significant measles resurgence, with a vaccine-skeptical Mennonite Christian community straddling the Texas-New Mexico border hit particularly hard.Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has undermined confidence in the MMR vaccine – a highly effective shot he has falsely claimed is dangerous and contains fetal debris.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMMRVaccines and immunisationAmericasHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He is a proven hand at directing new plays, classics and musicals. He is a very good producer who appears to rejoice in the success of his colleagues. And, at a time when the vogue is for “reimagined” versions of old plays, he is that rare figure: one who respects an author’s intentions while remaining open to new ideas. At 59 he also has an extensive list of credits without being, in words once fatuously applied to the BBC’s former head of Radio 3, John Drummond, “tainted by experience”.As artistic director of London’s Royal Court from 2006 to 2013, Cooke showed exceptional judgment. I well remember an opening press conference where he said one of his aims was to stage plays about the aspirational middle classes. He was as good as his word with productions of Bruce Norris’sThe Pain and the ItchandClybourne Parkwhich satirised, respectively, phoney white liberalism and bourgeois property fetishism.View image in fullscreen(From left) Jessica Barden, Charlotte Mills and Mark Rylance as Johnny ‘Rooster’ Byron in Jerusalem.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut Cooke also championed a whole school of then unknown young writers including Bola Agbaje, Anya Reiss, Polly Stenham, Penelope Skinner and Mike Bartlett. And it was during his tenure that the Royal Court stagedJez Butterworth’s Jerusalemnow widely regarded asthe best new play of the current century.While promoting new work Cooke has also shown his skill at directing the classics, ancient and modern. I very much admired his pairing ofThe Winter’s Tale and Pericles for the RSC in 2006in joint promenade productions. What he brought home with unusual clarity was the idea that Shakespeare’s late plays are quasi-religious experiences underpinned by resurrection myths: in a single day we saw Kate Fleetwood miraculously restored to life first as the secluded Hermione and then as the coffined Thaisa. His production of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible reminded us of the danger of unyielding intellectual rigidity and his current West End version of Shaw’sMrs Warren’s Professionsensibly trims the text to highlight Shaw’s vehemently anti-capitalist message: it also reminds us in the play’s climactic mother-daughter showdown that, in a good play, everyone is right.Imelda Staunton plays Mrs Warren and she has been a feature of Cooke’s two most successful ventures into musicals. In his outstanding2017 National Theatre production of Follieshe not only brought out Stephen Sondheim’s fascination with duality: he showed us how every character was haunted by his or her past. When Staunton’s Sally sangIn Buddy’s Eyesyou saw a woman filled with a deluded belief in her life-partner’s ardour: by the time she sang Losing My Mind the same woman was a lovelorn wreck on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Cooke’s recent London Palladium production ofHello Dolly!also breathed new life into a Broadway standard: Staunton sang the title song not in the usual style of a superannuated showbiz legend but in that of a cheery little soul renewing her acquaintance with the beloved haunt, and the waiters, of her youth.Stars, shockers, psychos and evangelists: Rupert Goold’s mighty end to his high-wire Almeida tenureRead moreCooke has worked profitably in other media. His TV production of Shakespeare’s Henry VI trilogy and Richard III was excellent and his two feature films, On Chesil Beach and The Courier, both had great style. But his domain is the theatre and he will be judged at the Almeida by his ability to combine a sensitivity to the present with a respect for the past. There is every reason to hope he will not only be as good as Goold but will forge his own style.Explore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatreRoyal Court theatreDominic CookecommentShareReuse this content"

There isn’t a jury-based award, instead there’s one decided by an audience vote and, far more often than not, their picks have lined up with those of the Academy.Since 2008, only one People’s Choice award winner hasn’t then gone on to either take home or be nominated for the best picture Oscar, and while the picks haven’t always been the greatest (hello, Jojo Rabbit, Belfast and Three Billboards), they’ve indicated a broad, crowd-rousing appeal. Last year, despite predictions thatAnoraor Conclave might triumph, out of nowhere the far less buzzy, and, at that point, distribution-less Stephen King adaptation The Life of Chucktriumphed, a win that preceded a deal with awards-securing outfit Neon and, now, a confidently positioned early summer release.Ballerina review – Ana de Armas racks up the kills as she pirouettes into John Wick spin-offRead moreSuch a victory, combined with a sense-assaulting marketing campaign highlighting words like “life-affirming”, “profound”, “celebration” and “magical”, would have you believe that something rather special is about to burrow its way into your heart, a feeling of wonder set to overwhelm (one quote claims it to be “It’s a Wonderful Life for today”). But try as writer-director Mike Flanagan might, there’s something coldly unmoving about it all, a disjointed and dry-eyed tearjerker that never rises above Instagram caption philosophy.Flanagan has become the unofficial adapter-in-chief of King’s work, having made three films while working on two TV shows based on his writing (the pair have both expressed deep admiration for the other on multiple occasions). It tracks given Flanagan’s interest in both scares and sentiment (his non-King shows like The Haunting of Hill House have balanced them well) although there’s yet to be a real slam-dunk among them. Like many of the more faithful adaptations, bothGerald’s Gameand Doctor Sleep have their share of effective moments (the latter boasting a particularly terrifying turn from Rebecca Ferguson) but they get dragged down having to untangle King’s often baffling explanations, fumbling overly convoluted plots that might have worked better on the page (Flanagan’s best film remains his stripped-back King-less debut, the barnstorming home invasion thrillerHush).The Life of Chuck has the unmistakable feeling of back-of-drawer King, familiar ideas given a quick, yet incomplete, dust-off for a late-stage novella (it’s one of three stories from the 2020 collection If It Bleeds, the last adaptation beingMr Harrigan’s Phone, a similarly reheated misfire). It’s a trio of tales, all centered around Chuck, played as an adult by Tom Hiddleston, who initially appears on a strange billboard seen by Chiwetel Ejiofor’s confused teacher (Ejiofor gives one of the film’s few standout performances). In the first, most effective, section, the world is crashing to a halt with natural disasters forcing people to examine their lives and lost loves, hoping to find a hand to hold as everything fades to black. Tributes to Chuck haunt them, as if his death somehow means more than theirs, from posters to TV commercials to his face inside their windows. In the middle section we get to actually meet him, as an everyman accountant, life narrated by Nick Offerman in one of the film’s more annoyingly mannered touches. He engages in a rather mortifying dance sequence before we go back for the final act, encountering him as a child.It’s a film about life and death and love and family and dreams but only ever in the most simplistic of fridge magnet ways (it could have been called The Live Laugh Love of Chuck), urging and insisting us tofeelsomething without ever giving us enough for any of it to sink in. The tease of the storytelling, hinting at a great, earth-shattering reveal, masks a rather empty space at its centre, and when details of the “twist” arrive, if one could even call it that given how messy the plotting gets, it turns a feelgood film into an odd and, from one viewpoint, sinister tale of narcissism and revenge (a thriller using similar components could have been far more entertaining). The big problem is that we never really get to know or understand Chuck; we’re mostly just told about him via voiceover (he contains multitudes, allegedly!) and we’re expected to figure him, and the meaning of life, out from faux-profound sermons about math and the cosmos. Hiddleston has very little to do but dance and we spend more time with Benjamin Pajak as a younger Chuck, who does an effective job at charming us through well-trodden coming-of-age scenes. Flanagan elsewhere relies a little too heavily on his go-to troupe of actors (Mark Hamill, wife Kate Siegel, Samantha Sloyan), which leads to some distracting miscasts.I’m not really sure what to take from The Life of Chuck, a solidly directed yet stilted, stop-start piece of film-making that reveres a lesser, little-known work of King but doesn’t really explain to us why. The final scene, intended to hit us with a cascade of emotion, is abrupt and unsatisfying, frustration overriding any impulse to cry (the end-of-days melancholy of the first section is close to piercing through the most) and we’re left feeling empty. Life is full of meaning but The Life of Chuck struggles to find any.The Life of Chuck is out in US cinemas on 6 June, Australian cinemas on 21 August and in the UK on 22 AugustExplore more on these topicsTom HiddlestonStephen KingChiwetel EjioforKaren GillanMark HamillDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

All Rights Reserved./PAMoviesReviewPredator: Killer of Killers review – animated anthology of Arnie’s old antagonistsForty years on from the original, the Predators are back in Viking times, samurai-era Japan and second world war US – but you can’t help think it would be better as live actionCatherine BrayWed 4 Jun 2025 23.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 23.01 EDTShareIt’s hard to imagine, back in 1987 when the first Predator film came out showcasing big Arnie’s rippling biceps, that anyone could have predicted it would spawn such a diverse array of sequel material. But here we are: 2025 brings us an animated anthology, with Predators tearing human kind a new one in Viking times, samurai-era Japan, and Florida during the second world war. This follows the excellent 2022 movie Prey and the mostly stupid Alien vs Predator from 2004, in which a lady makes friends with a Predator, which rather nullifies the scare factor.Killer of Killers opens with the Viking chapter, The Shield, set in AD841. One of the film’s better ideas is the Vikings referring to the Predator as Grendel, a reference of course to the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, in which a humanoid monster walks in darkness and hunts the weak … sound familiar? Much Game of Thrones style Sturm und Drang follows, before the most powerful Viking is abducted by the Predators who are essentially doing casting for their version of a reality show.This essentially sets the pattern for the rest of the film. Medieval Japan follows in The Sword, with some handy lessons about teamwork, and then it’s on to The Bullet, set in Florida in wartime, a section home to some of the better action sequences, with planes getting sliced into cubes in mid-air by Team Alien.The only problem with this stuff is that you can’t help picturing how much more spectacular it would look in live action. The animation is all perfectly competent but it’s lacking a little something – that spark of life and ingenuity that can make even flawed animation so fascinating. There’s something quite slick about all this, almost to a fault. Was AI involved? We’ll probably never know, but it’s a problem that the suspicion has got inside the door.Things pick up when we get to the Predators’ homeworld for the final showdown, with a Viking, samurai and US pilot set to fight to the death in an arena for the entertainment of the locals. There are some decent jokes and the basic issue of communication between the three is a nice note. It could have sparked a little more joy, perhaps, but it’s nice to see a franchise nearly 40 years old committed to constantly defying expectations.Predator: Killer of Killers is on Disney+ from 6 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The musical was based on Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel of the same name – which was in turn based on the story first told in L Frank Baum’s 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, adapted into the 1939 film starring Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale.The trailer for Wicked: For Good shows Elphaba in hiding, for her opposition to the Wizard’s regime, and also teases the arrival of Dorothy, who famously kills Elphaba with a bucket of water in The Wizard of Oz. The actor who will play Dorothy has not yet been named.The director, Jon M Chu, has said it was “impossible” to make Wicked into one film “without doing some real damage to it”. Both films were cut simultaneously in the editing process before the first film’s release last year.“As we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years,” Chu said. “We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one Wicked movie but two.”Wicked grossed US$755m worldwide on a US$150m budget, becoming the highest-grossing musical film adaptation made to date and landing 10 nominations at the Academy Awards – including best picture – and winning two.Along with Erivo and Grande as the film’s main characters, Wicked: For Good also stars Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero, Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard of Oz.Wicked: For Good will be released in cinemas on 21 November.Explore more on these topicsWickedMusicalsAriana GrandeCynthia ErivonewsShareReuse this content"

That ambition faded in his 20s and 30s as his success as a conductor increased, and it wasn’t until the 1930s, when he was in his late 40s, that Fürtwängler returned to composition, perhaps as an escape from the ever worsening political situation in Germany and Austria, and the pressures that the Nazis placed upon him.From then until his death in 1954, he produced a succession of large-scale works, the most significant of which were three symphonies. The Second Symphony, which Fürtwängler began in January 1945, immediately after taking refuge from the Nazis in Switzerland, is the most massive of them and regarded as his finest achievement; Neeme Järvi’s performance with the Estonian orchestra, which, while recognising the work’s massiveness, never seems unnecessarily slow, lasts 74 minutes.Yet it’s a strange, problematic work, easier to admire than to like, and built from an amalgam of Romantic voices from Schumann to Richard Strauss with Bruckner and Brahms featuring most prominently. From moment to moment the music is pleasant enough, but without ever becoming truly memorable; themes tend to move in predictable, stepwise fashion and developments are worked out at pedantic length.Järvi’s recording joins versions by Barenboim, Jochum and Fürtwängler himself already in the catalogue; if it’s a work that carries real curiosity value, it’s one that few are likely to want to hear very often.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Specifically a rock star of the late 80s and early 90s, when he didn’t have to dress down, à la grunge, or gloss up, à la ozone-depleting poodle metal, and instead slipped on a leather jacket and leaned into the camera as a freight train pulled out behind him.Defiant lands smack bang in the middle of that Peak Barnes Moment and it is no coincidence that while Barnes shared the songwriting with some old hands and near-family, the production is given over to that master of Australiana rock, Kevin Shirley. You’d know his work from early Silverchair, the Screaming Jets, the Angels, Baby Animals, Cold Chisel … and Tina Arena. You’d know his work by the ringing clarity in your ears.It’s in the in-your-face drum sound (that snare snap is sharpened to a point) and forward-facing guitars (you could do your hair in the reflection from the shine on them), and it’s in the careful middle ground of keyboards and a smattering of modern country to show range. You can recognise it in the prominence given to every corrugation of that lived-through voice and the softening agent of rich backing vocals and, in the powered-up ballad Beyond The Riverbend,even in the bagpipes. If this album were any more 1990s, it would come with a Hawkeian cigar and a Rachel haircut.A song like Damned If I Do, Damned If I Don’t has the skinny-arse shaking beat of the Rolling Stones or the Faces, but those drums won’t let you do anything other than stomp. Things are a little lighter in opener That’s What You Do For Love, its “woah-ohs” softening the ground, but the backing vocals of an escalating chorus and a hero-cast guitar solo don’t resist the temptation to go full back-of-the-beerbarn anthemic.If the muscular rock of Nothing Comes For Nothing and the brassy southern soul Sea Of Love, possibly the most satisfying song on the album, gives Barnes a moment to ease back on the throat – but there’s little evidence he was looking for respite. He rips it up in the title track and pushes it to the edges in the husky Never Stop Loving You; even at half-force in Dig Deep he feels powerful, controlled rather than raw against the saloon piano. What heart operation?That operation and its aftermath, however, does play through Barnes’ lyrical focus. Not just in the obvious I-get-knocked-down-I-get-up-again rugged roar of the title track’s “I don’t get tired, I just higher/I stand defiant”, but in the reflections of a man given yet another chance.There are throwbacks to the stories he’s told us in his series of hugely successful memoirs. Of mistakes and repair, like The Long Road’s declaration that “I’m on the long road to perdition”, and of coming through a childhood where “if you showed any weakness, the streets will make you bleed”, as he sings in Dig Deep. And there is Never Stop Loving You’s clear view of the complications and satisfactions of a long love affair that was not only life-saving but life-affirming.It’s true that this makes for an album that could hardly be said to break new ground or reach stellar heights. But it’s also true that it nails the essentials ofJimmy Barnes– and even more so, the Jimmy Barnes that people wanted to hear in the good and the bad times almost half a century ago.Defiant is out now (Mushroom)Explore more on these topicsAustralian musicPop and rockJimmy BarnesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The language that Ligeti invented for himself, which invested tonality with a whole new set of relationships and incorporated elements from a variety of non-western musical traditions, was unveiled in his Horn Trio of 1982, but it was in the two major concertos that followed, for piano in 1988 and violin in 1993, that the full power of his new language was revealed.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harmonia MundiBoth are remarkable works, which seem utterly fresh and original, yet identifiably remain part of the concerto tradition. It’s no surprise that the violin concerto particularly has been taken up by a number of soloists, or thatIsabelle Faustshould have wanted to add her reading to the series she has made for Harmonia Mundi. It is a typical Faust performance, perceptive, technically immaculate, and just a little on the cool side, and it’s paired with an equally accomplished, if a little more mechanical, account of the piano work with Jean-Frédéric Neuburger as soloist. Neuburger also includes Ligeti’s early, Bartókian Concert Românesc, while Faust leads performances of two ofGyörgy Kurtág’sAus der Ferne sequence, as exquisite interludes.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Past narrators have included Jacob Fortune‑Lloyd, Richard Brown and Tom O’Bedlam, and that’s before you get to the various radio dramatisations. But few can match this narration from the Howards End actor Samuel West, first recorded in 2011, which captures the menace and seediness that runs through Greene’s novel.It tells of 17-year-old Pinkie Brown, a razor-wielding hoodlum who is trying to cover up the murder of a journalist, Charles “Fred” Hale, killed by his gang in revenge for a story he wrote on Pinkie’s now deceased boss, Kite. Pinkie sets about wooing Rose, a naive young waitress who unwittingly saw something that could implicate him in the murder. His plan is to marry her to prevent her testifying against him. But he doesn’t bargain for the doggedness of Ida Arnold, a middle-aged lounge singer who smells of “soap and wine” and who happened to meet Hale on the day he was killed. On learning of his death, Ida refuses to believe the reports that he died of natural causes. She resolves not only to bring his killer to justice but to protect Rose from a terrible fate.Brighton Rock is one of several Greene audiobooks being rereleased this year by Penguin; others include The Quiet American (narrated by Simon Cadell), Travels With My Aunt (Tim Pigott-Smith), The Power and the Glory (Andrew Sachs) and The Heart of the Matter (Michael Kitchen).Available via Penguin Audio, 9hr 10minFurther listeningNormally Weird and Weirdly NormalRobin Ince, Macmillan, 9hr 7minInspired by his ADHD diagnosis, the co-presenter of Radio 4’s science comedy The Infinite Monkey Cage investigates neurodiversity and asks: what does it mean to be normal?

In it, three young men from Geraldton, Western Australia, grapple with their sexuality in a hyper-masculinised environment.Now, in his first novel written for adults, King of Dirt, one young(ish) man who has fled Geraldton after being outed by a mate, returns to rake over his choices and confront the forces that worked against him in his youth. It’s almost as if this new novel is an extension of the first, or a more wary, complex reckoning with its themes.Giacomo “Jack” Brolo is a digger. Not a soldier, but a bloke who drives a mini-excavator for a living, in as remote an environment as he can manage. When we meet him, he’s doing his best to resist the gay dating apps while keeping his head down on a job in the Nullarbor. But when an openly gay man, Spencer, joins the crew and he and Jack hook up, things go awry fast. It’s not until a wedding invitation arrives, however, that Jack’s precarious, isolated and peripatetic way of living is challenged in a serious way: will he spin further from the axis of friends and family, or return to face his demons?‘Deliciously addictive’, ‘dripping with suspense’: the best Australian books out in JuneRead moreFrom the outset, Sheppard establishes Jack’s desperately sad, self-sabotaging behaviour, a consequence of his internalised homophobia; the novel’s opening line is: “All the other blokes in the yard hate Spencer cos he’s a homo, but none of them knows I’m secretly a homo too, so I hate Spencer the most.” Jack is an alcoholic, wilfully reckless and suicidal. It’s a grim portrait – likely all too familiar to rural gay boys without solid support networks – of stunted desire and hopelessness.When the novel moves back to Geraldton and the veil is lifted on Jack’s backstory, we slowly come to understand what has led him to his current impasse. A fledgling sexual relationship with a boy in his friendship group named Xavier was destroyed by Jack’s cousin Rocco, who also outed him to the family and, by extension, the whole town. Jack’s return for Rocco’s wedding is a way to smooth tensions but also an opportunity to reconnect with Xavier, who now goes by the name Brick – this might bring Tennessee Williams’ drunken bisexual protagonist in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to mind but is actually a reference to Maitland Bricks.Before his family can exhume their buried grievances, Jack hooks up with a woman from his mum’s choir, Elena. “Fresh off the boat” from Italy, she takes a shine to him without for a minute swallowing his bullshit, and remains a figure of support throughout. But his parents are taken with Elena and start to imagine an alternate reality where she and Jack will get together and Jack can “be normal” again. Sheppard sets in motion a moral choice between full but isolating disclosure and companionable but emotionally exhausting repression. Given the Brolos are Italian, this cultural and familial pressure is all the more acute.‘No consent’: Australian authors ‘livid’ that Meta may have used their books to train AIRead moreHaunting the edges of this novel, and certainly representing an anxiety of influence for Sheppard himself, is the work of Christos Tsiolkas – most notably, his debut, Loaded, about the self-destructive nihilism of young gay Greek man Ari. Jack isn’t a nihilist but he is crushed between the rigidity of his concept of masculinity and the insistence of his own desire.King of Dirt is written, like Loaded, in first person, present tense; this gives it a psychological immediacy but also limits its scope. But where Tsiolkas located Ari in a specific cultural milieu, then extrapolated beyond the merely sociological, Sheppard doesn’t quite succeed in making Jack representative of anything larger than himself. Cultural markers are strangely thin – the Italian family eats spaghetti under a picture of The Last Supper, while Brick’s First Nations heritage is completely unsupported by detail – which undercuts not just the novel’s naturalism but also its emotional stakes.While it’s refreshing to see a representation of queer men that leans away from cliched urban norms – there isn’t a single reference to Kylie or glitter or drag – there is something oddly performative and retrograde about the parameters of Jack’s relationship with Brick. They “drink beer and bourbon. We have an impromptu burping contest. We eat barbecue Meatlovers pizza from Domino’s. We bet on the footy together and compare our multis. We give each other bro-jobs at half-time.” It reads like a straight fantasy of gay life, where everyone’s a bloke, every ride is pimped and the Pies keep winning.There is a more interesting, more provocative book buried somewhere in King of Dirt – the kind of knowing exploration of sexuality and violence that Bret Easton Ellis interrogates in The Shards, or Adam Mars-Jones explores in Box Hill – but Sheppard seems too content with his contrarian vision of gay life to unearth it. Jack’s journey towards self-acceptance might traverse some desolate landscape, but the destination is never really in doubt. At its best, its portrait of taciturn, damaged men trying to connect recalls the work of SE Hinton, flinty and deeply poignant. But Sheppard struggles to move out of the realm of young adult fiction, where the emotional stakes are more simplistic and the resolutions neatly predictable.King of Dirt by Holden Sheppardis out now (Pantera Press, $34.99)Explore more on these topicsAustralian booksAustralian book reviewsFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

New Zealand’s prime minister captured the world’s imagination with her empathetic leadership, her desire to prioritise the nation’s happiness rather than just its GDP, and her bold but deeply human approach to the early stages of the pandemic (though her “zero Covid” strategy of sealing borders to keep death rates low came back to bite her). She governed differently, resigned differently – famously saying in 2023 that she just didn’t have “enough in the tank” to fight another election – and has now written a strikingly different kind of political memoir. It opens with her sitting on the toilet clutching a pregnancy test at the height of negotiations over forming a coalition government, wondering how to tell the nation that their probable new prime minister will need maternity leave.Ardern is a disarmingly likable, warm and funny narrator, as gloriously informal on the page as she seems in person. A policeman’s daughter, raised within the Mormon church in a rural community down on its luck, she paints a vivid picture of herself as conscientious, anxious, and never really sure she was good enough for the job. In her telling at least, she became an MP almost by accident and wound up leading her party in her 30s thanks mostly to a “grinding sense of responsibility”. (Since it’s frankly impossible to believe that anyone could float this gently to the top of British politics, presumably New Zealand’s parliament is less piranha infested).Her book feels constructed for an international audience, eschewing domestic political detail for events that resonated globally – like the 2019 terror attack on a Christchurch mosque, after which she led the nation’s mourning with great sensitivity and rushed through gun control laws in a matter of weeks – and for the more universally relatable dramas of her private life.Ardern soldiered through the first crucial weeks in power keeping her pregnancy hiddenAs a young politician, she’d bitten her tongue through years of sniping about whether she was only there for window dressing, plus endless public speculation about whether or not she was pregnant. When a broadcaster suggested, within hours of her becoming leader, that she owed it to the country to reveal whether or not she planned to have children, “all of the times when I had said nothing … suddenly came crashing through to the surface”. On behalf of women everywhere facing intrusive questions from their bosses, Ardern issued apublic rebukethat was already going viral by the time she left the studio.The irony, of course, is that for much of the time she was batting off such questions, she and Clarke Gayford, her then partner, now husband, were privately on the emotional rollercoaster that is fertility treatment, culminating in that surprise eve-of-election conception. What happened next suggests Ardern must be steelier than she’s letting on.The new prime minister soldiered through her first crucial weeks in power keeping the pregnancy hidden, so queasy with morning sickness that she was terrified of vomiting on live TV, lying to her protection officers to cover up visits to her obstetrician. She scheduled a press conference 72 hours after giving birth on the assumption that it would be fine because “Kate Middleton did it” (unsurprisingly, it was not fine). And she was back at work after six weeks, worrying both about being seen as not coping and about being seen as copying too effortlessly, lest she be turned into a stick to beat other working mothers with. As she frequently acknowledges, it took a village – Clarke as stay-at-home dad, her mother as backup, aides who babysat – and even then it wasn’t easy. At one point during the pandemic, she sits down to play with her daughter and all she can see are Covid graphs: “I wasn’t there. Not all of me. And not even most of me.” It’s not hard to understand how she eventually burnt out.But while all this makes for an emotionally rich and candid read, the downside of skipping the political detail is that it’s hard to get a sense of how exactly her astonishing early popularity ebbed away. By the end, with New Zealand experiencing the same painful post-pandemic inflation as the rest of the world and anti-vaxxers camped outside parliament, the mood had turned ugly.Ardern seems largely untroubled by policy regrets, standing by her zero-Covid strategy – which worked at first, (albeit at great cost to New Zealanders stranded abroad when the borders closed) but was overwhelmed by the more infectious variants. She’s also notably keener to dwell on what her tenure says about kindness and empathy being powerful mechanisms for changing lives than she is to engage with the critique that she failed to deliver on some of her more tangible promises around alleviating poverty.Nonetheless, I closed the book feeling a pang of nostalgia for a time when scrapping tax cuts and spending the money on a more generous safety net, or clasping immigrants to a nation’s heart, (as she did after Christchurch) still seemed completely plausible things for a prime minster to advocate. A different kind of power, for what now feels like a sadly different world.A Different Kind of Power by Jacinda Ardern is published by Macmillan (£25).

From new tech to add-ons, our guide will help you decideKeith StuartThu 5 Jun 2025 06.09 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 17.59 EDTShareSince itsannouncement in January, anticipation has been building for the Nintendo Switch 2 – the followup to the gaming titan’s most successful home console, the150m-selling Nintendo Switch. Major console launches are rarer than they used to be; this is the first since 2020, when Sony’s PlayStation 5 hit shelves. Whether you’re weighing up a purchase or just wondering what all the fuss is about, here’s everything you need to know.The basicsThe Switch 2 is out today, 5 June, priced at £395.99 (US$449.99/A$699/€469.99) or at £429.99 (US$499.99/A$766/€509,99) bundled with its flagship game, Mario Kart World. Like its predecessor, it’s a portable games machine with a built-in screen – you can use as a handheld mini-console when you’re out and about, or slide it into the dedicated dock device and plug it into your TV via an HDMI cable for a big-screen experience at home. A little bigger than the original Switch, with a crisp, clear 7.9in LCD touch screen, as opposed to the old 6.2in display, it comes with two Joy-Con controllers, which are chunkier than the previous versions. These now attach magnetically to each side of the screen with a pleasing clunk, replacing the fiddly sliding mechanism that most Switch owners disliked. They’ve also got bigger L and R buttons on the top, which sounds like a minor detail but is a huge deal for anyone trying to perfect their Mario Kart power-slides.The specView image in fullscreenBig tech advances … Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoThe tech inside the Switch 2 is a lot more advanced than the previous console, featuring a custom nVidia processor, and a screen capable of displaying at 4K resolution (when plugged into a compatible TV) or 1920x1080 resolution in portable mode. It’s also got 5.1 surround sound, and supports high-dynamic range lighting (HDR) graphical effects at frame rates of up to 120hz. This brings the Switch 2 almost up to scratch with other modern consoles: most experts are placing its tech specs somewhere between the PS4 and PS5, or between Xbox One and Xbox Series X.In the boxTheNintendo Switch2 comes with the console itself, two Joy-Con controllers, a power adaptor and USB-C charging cable, a dock, a Joy-Con grip (which allows you to connect the two Joy-Cons together to create a traditional-looking games controller), and two Joy-Con wrist straps to stop them flying out of your hands.Out of the boxNintendo is going big on the social features of the console. Its GameShare function will allow you to play compatible games with other people who don’t own a copy – they just need their own Switch or a Switch 2, and can play along in the room with you or connect online. This is particularly important for families sharing one copy of a game. Meanwhile, GameChat is kind of like Zoom, but for games: you can invite a bunch of pals into a group video chat session where you can talk to each other while playing the same game, playing different games, or just hanging out. If you all buy theNintendoSwitch 2 Camera you’ll be able to see little video windows of each other on the screen, too. GameChat requires a paid subscription to Nintendo’s online gaming service, which costs £17.99 (US$19.99/€19.99/A$29.95)a year or £3.49 (US$3.99/€3.99/A$5.95) a month, but is free until 31 March.The gamesView image in fullscreenBig news … Mario Kart World game.Photograph: NintendoThe console is launching with around 25 games, though many of these are enhanced versions of older Switch titles. The big newcomers areMario Kart World, an open-world take on the classic karting game; the introductory gameNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour; the co-op survival challengeSurvival Kidsand anti-gravity racer,Fast Fusion. Some favourites making it across areFortnite, Cyberpunk 2077andThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom. Most games will retail for between £45–£70 and will be available to buy and download online, or as physical boxed copies. You can also still play almost all your old Switch games on the new console, and there’s a huge back catalogue of retro NES, Nintendo 64, SNES and GameCube classics from the 1980s, 90s and 00s available to play with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.The accessoriesView image in fullscreenAdd-ons … Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller and camera.Photograph: NintendoThere are three things you may want to buy alongside the console. TheNintendo Switch 2 Pro controlleris a traditional console joypad intended for serious play. Then you have theNintendo Switch 2 camera, basically a webcam compatible with the GameChat service, but also with any games that might use camera features. You may also want a microSD Express card to provide additional storage for your games.Where can I buy one?If you haven’t pre-ordered, you may have to be patient and shop around. Some of the larger retailers including Amazon, Argos, Currys and John Lewis are saying theymayhave a few in stock today and it’s worth tryingNintendo’s online store. Be extremely wary of buying from private sellers on eBay or similar sites – there will be a lot of con artists out there.

His work, especially his watercolours of demi-monde life in interwar Paris and New York, is a distinct and vivid record of the times. His paintings are held in major institutions – as is his extensive archive, which is housed at Tate Britain in London.And yet he remains “one of the great known unknowns of modern British art”, according to Thomas Kennedy, the curator of anew retrospectiveshow at Tate Britain. It is being held more than half a century on from Burra’s last show at the Tate in 1973, three years before he died aged 71. There are lots of reasons for Burra’s “unknown” status, explains Kennedy. “He worked alone, and not being part of a defined group doesn’t help to place an artist. But probably more important is the fact he absolutely hated talking about his work.” Kennedy cites some excruciating documentary footage (also from the early 1970s) illustrating Burra’s painful reluctance to engage with questions about art. “He just hated that stuff and would call art ‘fart’ and things like that. Apparently, he walked through that Tate show as if wearing blinkers, not looking at the work and just wanting to get it over with.”Edward Burra’s The Snack Bar: grasping the energy of a seedy urban worldRead moreThe exhibition runs alongside a parallel show of works by Ithell Colquhoun, another radical British artist who, like Burra, challenged artistic conventions and explored parallel ideas of identity and sexuality in surrealist work that often reflected her occult beliefs.The two defining features of Burra’s early life – he was born in 1905 – were the wealth of his family (prominent in banking) and the fact he suffered from extremely poor health. This combination resulted in him later being able to travel – to France and Spain, the United States and Mexico – then return home to Rye in East Sussex, where he spent most of his life, to recuperate after his exertions and paint the things he had seen.His illnesses – rheumatoid arthritis and the blood disease spherocytosis among other conditions – also helped dictate the nature of his art in that it was physically easier for him to work with watercolours flat on a table than with oils at an easel. “As a watercolourist he pushed the boundaries of a traditionally delicate medium to create bold graphic works, rich in detail,” says Kennedy.His illness also informed his empathy for those on the fringes of society and in his subject matter he engaged with some of the 20th century’s most significant social, political and cultural events. “After Paris in the roaring 20s and the Harlem Renaissance, he sort of pivoted to depict the violence of the Spanish civil war and then the second world war, before taking on British landscapes and reflections on postwar industrialisation and environmental degradation.”While Burra was publicly reticent about his art, the Tate show’s exploration of his archives serves to deepen understanding of the man. As well as letters there are his gramophone records – mostly jazz – books and calendars he kept that show his obsessive cinema-going, sometimes seeing several films a day in French and German as well as English.“Bringing these sources together is quite revealing,” says Kennedy. “It all adds to the tapestry of his influences and what emerges is a socially conscious art that is warmly satirical while also being willing to confront the darker side of life.”Travelling man: five of Edward Burra’s key worksView image in fullscreenEdward Burra’s Three Sailors at a Bar, 1930.Photograph: Todd White Art Photography/Edward Burra/Lefevre Fine ArtThree Sailors at a Bar, 1930Burra’s sexuality is ambiguous, but his work in the 20s and 30s often reflected queer culture and sensibility. While this image of a bar in the south of France is among his more explicitly queer work, it also reflected a general sense of sexual liberation among Burra’s circle in the roaring 20s.Minuit Chanson, 1931 (main image above)In this Parisian music shop where you could pay to listen to a gramophone record, Burra’s vibrant street scene celebrates its diverse clientele. In characteristic fashion, he deploys a satirical eye to heighten his subject matter rather than to cruelly caricature it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Tonight is about legacy – not just the Grammys and multi-platinum hits which made Richie’s name, but the way that songs such as Truly and the Commodores’ Three Times a Lady have become intertwined with people’s lives. “I’ll just fit myself in best I can,” he booms, laughing.He has joyful chemistry with his band, and together they put plenty of polish on Richie’s trophy cabinet of hits. Dancing on the Ceiling is glittery and buoyant, veering into Van Halen’s Jump before some surprisingly gritty guitar shredding. Brick House is raw and funky, with Richie slinking left to right with the band in tow, like a matured T-Birds. Sometimes the band (and the audience) overpower his glorious, buttery voice, but he ad-libs and riffs and ends every song with a proud, showbizzy “yeah!” – even tender, cinematic ballads such as Endless Love.View image in fullscreenRaw and funky … Richie and his band.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianPerhaps that montage skirted dangerously close to an In Memoriam – lots of dry ice, photos of Richie looking angelic against a night sky – but, at 75, the man himself is larger than life. He puts in a tight five between most songs, riffing on Scotland’s bad weather, and implores the audience to feel empathy for refugees and immigrants: “Those people, they’re us,” he urges. “You would do the same for your family.”This Hits tour shows us Richie on cruise control, but radiant nonetheless. He struts up and down the thrust stage, laser-focused on making the furthest corners of the Hydro feel special, and if anyone’s earned the right to lean on charm, surely it’s Richie. Tonight feels breezy rather than electric, and even a soaring, hip-shaking encore of All Night Long is homely rather than thrilling. A night of few fireworks, perhaps, but full of deep love and mutual appreciation. Such worn-in comfort takes decades to get just right.Lionel Richie’sSay Hello to the Hitstours the UK and Europe until AugustExplore more on these topicsLionel RichiePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Do you see an elephant first or a forest? A butterfly or an apple? Jungjin Lee’s exhibition, called Unseen,is in some ways an elevated version of that. The series of large, black-and-white landscape photographs – all made last year in Iceland – do not tell you anything about the times, or the place. Instead what you see depends on what is buried in you – threatening to open up that scary, unbidden “unseen”.Lee, who lives in New York, is little known in the UK beyond her photobooks. This small show of 10 works is her first solo show in the UK in a 30-year career. Her background is important in deciphering these images. Her first artistic training was in the traditional calligraphic arts, as a child growing up in South Korea. Later she studied ceramics at Hongik University in Seoul, where artists such as Lee Bul were among her peers.View image in fullscreendramatic vistas … Unseen, #83.Photograph: (c) Jungjin Lee, image courtesy Huxley-Parlour, LondonIn the late 1980s, her first photography project followed an old man living on a remote Korean island, documenting his search for wild ginseng. In a decade, he had never found a single plant. But by the time Lee had finished the project, she realised what she had made was more a reflection of her own state of mind, and that she would never be a documentary photographer. She turned her back on the genre for good.After moving to New York, she worked for a time as an assistant to Robert Frank. His attitude, rather than his style, influenced Lee, who was moved by the way he followed his instincts and interests. In the 1990s, she began to travel the US and make portraits of a decaying American landscape and its elements: the barren desert, the unforgiving wind, the endless debris. These clamouring landscapes were, and continue to be, portraits of the artist as rocks, trees, and thrashing waves. They come to be portraits of the viewer, too.This new body of work was all made last year, in Iceland. Many contemporaries of Lee have made work about or with the Icelandic elements: Roni Horn, Ragnar Axelsson, Olafur Eliasson. Lee also responds to this aspect of the place. The specific topographies there provided Lee with what she needed: dramatic vistas capable of carrying the epic literary qualities of her work, the full range of human emotion. They are brooding, fearsome and roar with the supremacy of nature. The landscape, to Lee, is an expression of existential angst and metaphorical musings. Out there is the only subject capable of holding everything that’s in here, in us.View image in fullscreenMother and child? … Unseen, #49.Photograph: (c) Jungjin Lee, image courtesy Huxley-Parlour, LondonWe are placed on an empty road that plunges into a dark abyss on the horizon (#83), or at the frothy seam of the sea and land (#55). You can almost feel the salty air slap your face in a portrait of an imposing rock standing resolute against the choppy water that whips up around it (#76). Its coarse and craggy surface seems to contain the history of the world. A smoky cloud descends on a blackened earth, its symbolism striking.What you see, of course, is subjective. A mournful picture of two rocks (#49) shows them rising like tombstones from the sea, one large, jutting out, one tiny and intrepid, as if heading off into the distance. I make out the tender figures of a mother and child, the child forging ahead, falteringly, off into the unknown. I see Frank’s influence surfacing: the “humanity of the moment.” And the moment is uncertain.You have to be a decent artist – even more so, working with a camera – to make a landscape picture interesting. Part of the brilliance of Lee’s work comes from her technical mastery, which reflects her journey as an artist, from the calligraphy of her childhood and the same raw approach to moulding the earth with her hands, adapted from ceramics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She then brushes the negative with processing emulsion soaked on to delicatehanji, or Korean mulberry paper, and bathes them at a slightly higher temperature than is conventional for fixing. This optimises the mottled, etched textures. These hand-emulsified images are then transformed again, into digital images, at which point she tinkers with the contrasts and prints them again.The brushstrokes to the surface are palpable and are as evocative Korean ink paintings – you can’t help but trace the influence of a pictorialist tradition that seeps unmistakably into Lee’s work. The knockout textures and the charcoal tones are aesthetically closer to drawings. At times the photograph seems to dissolve completely: in #10, a minimalist picture of a sloping mountain is stretched to abstraction, its suggestive black lines merely mimicking what was there.Jungjin Lee: Unseen is atHuxley-Parlour Gallery, London, until 5 JulyExplore more on these topicsArt and designPhotographyExhibitionsArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

They embody people, flora and fauna with outsider status, joined by guest performers including disabled dance groups Corali and Camberwell Incredibles. There are voiceover descriptions at the beginning of each section, describing the performers and what they’re going to do. It’s for inclusivity and accessibility, but is effective at giving everybody an in, directly connecting us to the dancers with a key to sometimes avant garde ideas, whether Annie Edwards dancing an endangered nightingale (and a curlew, swallow and white-tailed eagle) with neat feet and swiftly turning spirals; Perry as a blade of grass; or Jahmarley Bachelor in an ode to the dust in Quentin Crisp’s flat.Two standout turns: charismatic Azara Meghie throwing in some hip-hop to her embodiment of James Baldwin, with his wise words played in voiceover, and Hay-Gordon’s dance of remembrance set to Brahms. On theme, Hay-Gordon is one of most natural dancers you’ll ever see; dancing is absolutely innate for him, and it’s transfixing to watch him deeply inside the music. This is a show that’s rich, thoughtful, ridiculous and quite wonderful.AtBattersea Arts Centre, London, until 7 June then at theLowry, Salford, 10-11 JuneExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreCabaretDanceBattersea Arts CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

In remarksreported by the Hollywood Reporterand Screen, Elba said: “There’s a crazy number across the entire continent – less than about 3,000 cinemas, actual cinemas that you and I have grown up with. I would love to be able to tackle some of that, because I believe that the cinema experience that we all have gone through should be experienced by a new generation. I don’t think it should all be on a phone.”Elba added: “How do I do that? Building a model of data that shows that actually people do want to watch films, that they will enjoy the experience of theatre. I’m not going to try and boil the ocean, but it’s going to happen one bit at a time … Yeah man, I want to build the African Odeon.”Elba, who was born in London to a Sierra Leonean father and a Ghanaian mother, has spoken previously about his ambitions to support the film industry in sub-Saharan Africa,saying in October: “It’s really important that we own those stories of our tradition, of our culture, of our languages, of the differences between one language and another.” He is also part of a consortiumdeveloping an “eco city” on Sherbro Island in Sierra Leone.In London, Elba mentioned an AI-powered app called Talking Scripts that turns written material into audio, aiming to help people with reading difficulties such as dyslexia, as well as a digital wallet he had co-founded, called Akuna Wallet, designed to help creatives send money across borders more easily than before.He added: “Any film or piece of music that was made in the 80s was made on equipment less superior than your phone is now. These kids know that. They are making films, they are making songs on these devices. Ultimately, there is a wall when it comes to getting it out there and monetising it, [but] I think the confidence that Afrobeats,Nollywood, has given African creators, young creators, is huge.”Explore more on these topicsFilmIdris ElbaAfricaSXSWFilm industryFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the first title to make a real mark for the Writers and Readers Cooperative’s series For Beginners, comic books on great thinkers and big topics aimed at readers of all backgrounds. Appignanesi produced enduring titles in collaboration with his close friend the illustratorOscar Zarate. Freud for Beginners (1979), translated into 24 languages, has been a bestseller for more than four decades.Appignanesi was a master of the graphic novel – the term was coined by the comic book historian Richard Kyle in 1964, and the genre was a relative innovation in the UK.He was hands-on, marrying text and image, editing and storyboarding. Writing to the art criticJohn Berger, he claimed that he was the only writer member who “dirtied his hands” on the shop floor. In 1980 his work brought him a Directors Club (New York) merit award for art direction.View image in fullscreenThe cover of King Lear, part of the Manga Shakespeare series edited by Richard AppignanesiAfter the cooperative broke up in 1984, he co-founded Icon Books, which expanded the series under a new name, Introducing ..., with more than 100 titles. His standalone contributions include Lenin, existentialism and postmodernism.Introducing Postmodernism(2004) is a rollercoaster – taking in Marilyn Monroe, Disney World, The Satanic Verses and cyberspace – the labyrinthine subject illuminated with wit and cartoons by Chris Garratt, cartoonist ofthe Guardian’s strip Biff(1985-2005).Appignanesi became series editor ofManga Shakespeare(2007-11), adapting Shakespeare plays illustrated by UK Manga artists, the text abridged but unaltered. The 14 titles are still much appreciated by teachers and fly off library shelves.Emma Hayley of the series’ publisher, SelfMadeHero, remembered his wicked humour: King Lear was illustrated byIlya, known for publications for Marvel, with Lear as the Last of the Mohicans. Hayley also worked with Appignanesi on the Graphic Freud series:The Wolf Man(2012) and Hysteria (2014), exploring Freud’s famous early case studies of psychological disorders through visual storytelling. Introducing The Wolf Man, Appignanesi was circumspect: “It remains for me an open question whether there is such a thing as a cure. Psychoanalysis seems to me a life commitment – like writing.”He was a pioneer in a field now widely thought by educationists to develop critical thinking, opening the way to deeper reading. His two series for beginners added wry observation to the narrative, raising questions as much as answers. Introducing Lenin and the Russian Revolution (1977), at 175 pages, gives the complexities of the revolutionary movement and Lenin’s rise, but leaves it open whether he was responsible for Stalinism.Hysteria takes a clearer position on Freud. It is a mordant tale of medical hubris, with Freud’s theories and his doubts and reflections on the errors of his mentor, Jean-Martin Charcot, set alongside the contemporary crisis of mental health and treatment with drug therapies.View image in fullscreenThe cover of Hamlet, part of the Manga Shakespeare series edited by AppignanesiAppignanesi’s fiction trilogy Italia Perversa – Stalin’s Orphans, The Mosque and Destroying America (1985-86) – is a dense epic about the relentless European wanderings of a Stalinist Quebec revolutionary who turns terrorist. His novel Yukio Mishima’s Report to the Emperor (2002) received a dressing-down for biographical inaccuracy about the ultranationalist writer whose attempted coup ended in his ritual suicide in 1970. But one online reviewer found it: “a very enjoyable ride. It’s one-part Mishima biography to two parts Mishima’s own fiction to three parts Appignanesi madness.”His humour, internationalism and literary bandwidth were a pleasure and a support for me when, from 1993, I was working at Arts Council England and had to navigate divisive issues in the visual arts. He was editor ofThird Text, the leading journal of art in a global context, founded by the artistRasheed Araeen, and for Arts Council England compiledBeyond Cultural Diversity(2010). When it was published the following year, Third Text described it as “a timely and uncompromising investigation of what has gone wrong, and why, with state-sponsored cultural diversity policy in Britain”.He was one of the co-curators for the ICA, London, on Winds of Change: Cinema in Muslim Societies (2011), a programme of film screenings and talks prompted by the uprisings of the time known as the Arab spring, and was a contributor to Critical Muslim, the journal founded by his friend and collaborator Ziauddin Sardar.Born in Montreal, Canada, Richard was the eldest son of working-class Italian immigrants. His father, Ezio Appignanesi was a talented saxophonist and drove taxis. His mother, Angelina (nee Canestrari) was an amateur actor, seamstress and a great storyteller.Possessed of Italian good looks and a ponytail, he referred affectionately to his family as “the mob”. Though he won a music scholarship to the Montreal Conservatoire, he gave up the piano when he heardGlenn Gould, the great Canadian exponent of Bach.View image in fullscreenThe Manga Shakespeare version of Romeo and JulietAfter he was suspended from university at 16, his mother sent him to the Jesuit Loyola College, where, “a jazz loving existentialist under the benign tutelage of the Brothers”, he graduated with a degree in English literature in 1962. After being given a large studio, he took up painting, producing big expressionist canvases, not unlike stained glass.In 1967 he married the writer Lisa Borensztejn,the daughter of Polish parents from Paris. Lisa wanted to do a doctorate in Britain, at Sussex University, and Richard followed, gaining a PhD in art history (1973). During those years they lived in Vienna and Paris. Once they were back in Britain, settling in London, Lisa wrote about a Munich-based bookshop collective. In 1974 this spurred the American publisher and activistGlenn Thompsonto found the Writers and Readers Cooperative with his wife Sian Williams, the Appignanesis, Berger, the playwrightArnold Weskerand the writer Chris Searle. Among their first publications were works by the educationistsIvan Illichand Paulo Freire.Richard’s maverick versatility drew him to the early 20th-century Portuguese writerFernando Pessoa, whose more than 70 imaginary identities, termed heteronyms, inspired the contemporary art exhibition that Appignanesi curated in 1995 in collaboration with the writer Juliet Steyn. The show toured to Rome with Appiganesi’s play Fernando Pessoa: The Man Who Never Was. He also collaborated with Open Space Vienna, and a version of the resulting exhibition,Raising Dust, was shown in London (2010-11). A central feature in the multimedia show wasthe broom, an emblem of basic human endurance in predominantly eastern European artists’ meditations on waste and the geopolitical irregularities of the continent. In 2005 he co-curated the British Council’s Writing Europe Conference in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.He and Lisa had a son, Josh, and divorced in 1984. In 2014 he married Helen Askey, and they had a son, Raphael. He also had a daughter, Rosa, with Juliet Steyn.He is survived by his wife, his three children, and his brother Augusto.Richard Appignanesi, writer, born 20 December 1940; died 8 April 2025Explore more on these topicsBooksBiography booksPolitics booksEducational booksobituariesShareReuse this content"

Writing on Instagram, Stewart complained of “not feeling well”.Now Stewart has cancelled a Thursday concert, too, apologising to fans and explaining: “My doctor ordered a bit more rest while I recover from the flu. Thanks for your love and understanding.” He has not announced whether that concert will be rescheduled.Stewart has had a few health setbacks this year. He cancelled three concerts in January after suffering both strep throat and Covid in the space of a few days, and after a concert in May, he was seen with a sign around his neck reading: “Sorry. Cannot talk. Having vocal rest.”The 80-year-old is currently on his One Last Time tour, which he has said will be his last time doing a “large-scale world tour”. Speaking in November 2024, he added: “I have no desire to retire. I love what I do, and I do what I love … I’d like to move on to a Great American Songbook, Swing Fever tour [in 2026] – smaller venues and more intimacy.”He is set to perform the Sunday teatime “legends” slot at Glastonbury, made even more nostalgic and crowd pleasing this year as it will be followed by Nile Rodgers & Chic. That evening’s music will then be rounded out by Noah Kahan and Olivia Rodrigo.Stewart returned to the top of the charts in 2024 with his album Swing Fever, a collaboration with Jools Holland.Explore more on these topicsRod StewartPop and rockGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025Music festivalsFestivalsLas VegasnewsShareReuse this content"

From freshening up your bedding to making the most of weeds, here are some low-cost, low-effort ideasEmma BeddingtonThu 5 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 06.16 EDTShareWhatever the weather, June marks the start of what we consider summer in the northern hemisphere, and many of us are seized with a frenetic desire to make the most of it. We want our homes to be light, airy and inviting and our outside spaces full of colour and scent – but if you’re anything like me, that stuff doesn’t necessarily come naturally. Instead, I’m chasing bluebottles, sweating into my sofa and staring enviously over the neighbours’ wall at their impeccable garden. But in summertime the living really can be easy: I asked home and garden experts for their favourite simple ways to welcome the season.Stimulate your sensesSensory tweaks that instantly conjure summer are “so fricking cool”, says colour psychologist Tash Bradley, design director ofLick. A gentle hum of jazz in the background, a summery candle burning (basil or tomato leaf scents are instantly evocative), or, best of all, real greenery. You don’t need a garden to raid: “When you’re next on a walk, pick foliage or bring branches in – the trees are so luscious – and put them in vases around the house,” Bradley says. (Garden designer Sean Pritchard’s bookOutside Inis full of ravishing inspiration for this.)Get ready to be spontaneousView image in fullscreenKeep a drinks tray on standby.Photograph: ninavartanava/Getty Images/RooM RF“Embrace the spirit of a never-ending holiday by prepping your space for spontaneous gatherings,” says Rebecca Lowrey Boyd, design writer and author of theWee Birdynewsletter. “Keep a ready-to-go drinks tray or a basket of picnic essentials on standby, so you’re always five minutes from hosting a garden soiree, or at least pretending you are. If you’re feeling fancy, throw in a sprig of mint and a set of cocktail napkins.” (Lowrey Boyd likes a “natty embroidered”Anthropologie set; I’ve found good ones on eBay.)Sow selectively“With a few honourable exceptions, once May is out of the way it begins to get a bit late for planting, and certainly for sowing things that will bulk up and present an impressively romantic spectacle for the summer months,” saysAndrew Timothy O’Brien, garden writer and host of the Gardens, Weeds & Words podcast. “That said, some seeds sown in early June will get going remarkably quickly. On the veg front there’s French and runner beans, courgettes and pumpkins, lettuce, pak choi, sweetcorn and carrots. Ornamentals that you sow now will extend the season by flowering in later summer and into autumn: try nasturtiums, sunflowers or night-scented stocks. To avoid disappointment, make sure you’re using freshly bought seed, not something from a packet you’ve had sitting in the shed since lockdown.”View image in fullscreenYou change your clothes with the seasons, why not your cushions and curtains?Photograph: Posed by models; Uwe Krejci/Getty ImagesLet the mismatched garden magic happen“I like things that maybe don’t quite go together,” says Allan Jenkins, former Observergardening columnist and author ofPlot 29. “Happy accidents are more interesting than regimented rows.” This time of year in the garden – or, in Jenkins’s case, on the allotment – is for spontaneity and serendipity. “From May onwards I will have beans, maybe peas. Sunflower seeds might find a home.”Bring your holiday homeIn her new book, Dopamine Decor, interior stylist and colour evangelistKate Morganrecommends taking inspiration from holidays: the places you enjoy spending time in – cafes and bars, hotels, tavernas – and the treats you eat. Morgan is a big fan of fruit motifs. “When I think of a good holiday, I think of warm places, blue skies and lovely bowls of pineapples, coconuts, mangoes, watermelons, lemons and limes – and a fruity cocktail or two! Delicious zingy flavours and bright colours.” Her home is full of fruity touches, from a blueberry milk jug to a cherry toilet brush.Get a summer scent“A summer simmer pot is simple, quick and cost-effective,” saysLesley Bramwell, sustainable fragrance entrepreneur and author ofFragrance Your Home. “Add sprigs of summer plants – mint or eucalyptus – a handful of fresh rose petals or lavender buds and a few slices of lemon or orange to a large pan. Cover with water, filling the pot to around two-thirds full. Bring to the boil and then gently simmer. Add a few spices to bring warmth, like fresh ginger or cloves. As the pot simmers away, the steam will gently release summery aromas.”View image in fullscreenPut your heavy coffee table books away for winter.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesLighten upChange your fabrics for lighter, breezier versions. “As a nation we are not particularly good at seasonal changes but, done well, they can feel like a full redecoration,” says design writerKate Watson-Smyth, author of multiple books and award-winning interiors blog Mad about the House, and co-host of theThe Great Indoorspodcast. “I once met a Danish fashion designer who was baffled by our reluctance to swap things in and out during the year: ‘You change your clothes with the seasons, why not your cushions?’”No need to stop at cushions: Morgan recommends swapping “duvet covers, tablecloths, shower curtains, blankets, rugs and towels” for lighter, brighter summery patterns. “Make like the Danes and change heavy thermal curtains for linen panels,” suggests Watson-Smyth. Lowrey Boyd agrees: “Your home will feel airier, brighter and, dare I say, almost continental. Less Victorian parlour, more Mediterranean hideaway.” She has her eye onIkea’s crushed linen curtainsfor an affordable switch-up.Give your coffee table a makeoverWatson-Smyth gives her coffee table a seasonal facelift. In winter it holds large coffee-table books, dark candles with heavier scents and decorative boxes of matches. “In summer the books return to the shelves, to be replaced with magazines, bud vases and perhaps a reed diffuser in a pretty glass bottle. Anything that refreshes the room will lift the mood.”Draw the eye outside“At this time of year,” says Bradley, “the best room in the house is the garden.” To connect indoors and out, she suggests repainting a door leading to outside space, or a window overlooking it, in a nature-inspired green or blue. “It’s a really quick win to zhoosh up a room, make it a focal point and draw the eye out into the garden.”View image in fullscreenThe best room in the house is the garden, so connect indoors and out.Photograph: Posed by model; Kathrin Ziegler/Getty ImagesHelp out your houseplantsYour plants are probably happier in summer, but they still need TLC. “As the light, temperature and length of the days increase, keeping up with watering is vital so our houseplants don’t wilt,” saysSarah Gerrard-Jones, author ofThe Plant Rescuer: The Book Your Houseplants Want You to Read. “Plants that may have only needed water every few weeks during winter might now need to be watered more frequently. The easiest way to know is to check the soil for moisture by sticking your finger deep into the pot, or weighing it in your hands. A pot that feels light indicates it’s time to water.”The houseplant murderer: can I become green fingered in eight easy steps?Read moreFeed plants once a month through the summer growing season. It’s also a good time, Gerrard-Jones says, to check which need repotting. “A clear sign that a bigger pot is needed is roots growing out of the holes in the bottom, or the soil drying out quickly, which suggests there is little potting compost left.” Check for pests, too: “It’s far easier to get rid of one or two before it becomes a full-blown infestation.”Get herbaceous“Fill planters near the back door or window boxes with fresh mint, parsley, chives and rosemary plants,” says O’Brien. “That way they’ll always be on hand to snip for the kitchen, or to wrench off a sprig and stick it straight into a cocktail.” You don’t need to make a special garden centre trip – supermarket pots will do. I follow botanistJames Wong’s adviceto keep my supermarket basil alive: split up and thin out the dense tangle of seedlings, keep a few clumps of healthier ones and pot them up in good-quality compost.View image in fullscreenHouseplants may need to be watered more frequently in summer.Photograph: Viktoriya Skorikova/Getty ImagesDon’t worry about weeds– enjoy themTackling garden weeds can feel like a losing battle at this time of year, so how about not bothering?Gardener and landscape designer Jack Wallingtonspecialises in working with, rather than against nature. His newsletterWild Wayis full of prompts and tips to reframe how we think about garden “pests” and “weeds”. “Wildflowers – plants like cow parsley, teasel, tufted vetch, yarrow, Welsh poppy, dandelions, hedge woundwort, ox eye daisies and lawn daisies – often flower longer and are more resilient to extremes in weather than many ornamental plants,” he says. “If you allow them, these wild plants multiply prolifically and then manage themselves, reducing maintenance; no need to grow from seed or water these sustainable plants.”They also encourage and support other wildlife: “Many insects evolved to rely on them, and without that rich biodiversity many gardens feel lifeless to me,” Wallington says. Plus, they look great. “Wildflowers we’re told to rip out actually create the most contemporary and chic style. Best yet, of course, they’re free.”… or actually encourage them“It might sound bonkers,” says O’Brien, “but consider creating a weedy planter.” Weeds flourish when everything else is struggling. “These plants are what our soil wants to grow, and sometimes it can make sense to listen to what the garden is trying to tell us. Many weeds are attractive or sculptural. Think of the charming, daisy-like white and pink Mexican fleabane (erigeron karvinskianus); or Lady’s mantle (alchemilla mollis) with its chartreuse flowers and pale green leaves, which show off raindrops to such wonderful effect. Elevate your weeds by collecting a selection and sticking them in a pot or a trough, and placing it somewhere where you can regularly take a good long look at them.”Discourage insectsrather than destroying themThere’s nothing summer chic about the big fat flies thumping into my windows while a billion tiny ones host some kind of rave on my bananas. “We don’t want to be destroying insects; they’re essential for pollination,” says Bake Off legend and eco pioneerNancy Birtwhistle, author ofClean and Greenand the cookbookNancy’s Green and EasyKitchen. Instead, “it’s about repelling them”. Her strategy: halve a lemon and stud each half with cloves (or juice the lemon and fill the hulls with cloves) then place it in your kitchen or fruit bowl or by your houseplants. “Insects hate the smell of cloves. If they get a whiff, they’re off.” If you’re facing invasion from an ant army, Birtwhistle recommends squirting her homemade cleaning spray (160ml water, 60ml vinegar and 40ml surgical spirit) along their pathways.View image in fullscreen‘If the insects get a whiff, they’ll be off’ … use lemons and cloves as repellent.Photograph: imv/Getty ImagesAnd protect your woollies“Now summer’s here, you may not be thinking about your woollen jumpers, but clothes moths very much are,” says Birtwhistle. “Protect your jumpers by putting them in sealed bags or boxes and by using a natural deterrent. Lavender is a great moth repellent and it’s in season now, so collect a few sprigs.”Transform your tabletop“Give your dining table (or the rickety one in the garden) a summer makeover with a bold, stripy tablecloth or some clashing printed napkins,” says Lowrey Boyd. No need for a splurge – grab a length of cheerful fabric or even a retro-inspired tea towel.” Add vibrant napkins (Lowrey Boyd fancies some “jolly ricrac numbers fromRE”) and mismatched coloured candles. “Suddenly, every meal feels like a sun-drenched picnic, even if it’s beans on toast.”As it heats up, chill out“Just as summer really starts to get going and the weather is good for relaxing and entertaining in the garden, growth rates slow down and everything begins to look a little thirsty,” says O’Brien. “The temptation is to dash out and buy things to make the garden look good: replace the patio set, buy a shiny new barbecue and pick up some plants. The problem is, this kind of panic buying rarely hits the spot, and anything you plant now is going to need endless watering and attention to prevent it from looking knackered and carking it within a week of bringing it home.”The secret to happy summer gardening, he says, is doing less (it’s the guiding philosophy of O’Brien’s book,To Stand and Stare: How to Garden While Doing Next to Nothing). “Learn to love what you’ve already got. Lawn looking a bit parched? Let it grow rangy and a bit straggly. Get to know the wildflowers that you’d otherwise spend precious hours decapitating, while bees and butterflies make the most of the nectar resource. You can restore order in autumn; summer is mainly for dossing about.” Amen to that.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleGardening advicePlantsHomesHouseplantsInteriorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The title is as provocative as the book is fascinating in the way it dismantles the legendary origins and marketing of “typical” products and “traditional” dishes to reveal engrossing histories, often more recent and inextricably bound to exchange and migration (Grandi is a professor of food history and economics at the University of Parma). In fact, far from taking anything away, the book makes a rigorous and constructive contribution to a bigger, more interesting global conversation about the past, present and future of food. It is also very funny.I mention this having picked up the book to re-read the chapter on polenta. Grandi reminds us that it is a category of food (rather than a specific one), with polenta being a cooked mixture (the ancients called itpuls, which is Latin for “a mush”) made from something ground into flour and water. Historically, polentas were made from barley, oats, rye, millet and buckwheat, until the second part of the 18th century, when cornmeal cooked into polenta became a principle source of nutrition for many in the north and central regions of what is now Italy.Grandi’s pragmatic, unsentimental but empathetic writing is welcome in this chapter as he explains the role of polenta right up until the 1980s. He also observes that, when we put our slice of polenta next to the sausages and bacon on the barbecue, “we are not repeating an ancient gesture, we are just demonstrating for the umpteenth time the enormous gap that exists between today’s food variety and the unrelenting monotony of our ancestors’”. I interpreted this as him saying that, by seeing things as they really were, rather than indulging in a misty romanticism, it allows us to understand better and celebrate more.With this in mind, today’s recipe is a polenta biscuit inspired by a combination of three things: the polenta biscuits of Molise in southern Italy; a biscuit from Piedmont calledkrumiri, which is shaped like a moustache (or curve, smile or boomerang), and what I had in the cupboard.The biscuits will be delicate, and especially so when warm, so leave them to cool significantly before lifting them on to a rack to cool completely. While they do firm up, the biscuits retain a melting crumble texture thanks to the granular polenta. I find them irresistible with tea, coffee or alcohol. To serve, dust heavily with icing sugar and, if there are any left over, keep in a tight tin or plastic box.Cornmeal and butter biscuits inspired by krumiriMakesabout 30100g caster sugar140g room-temperature butter2 egg yolks160g cornmeal(instant polenta is fine)100g plain flour, plus extra for dustingPinch of saltIcing sugar,to finishIn a large bowl or a food processor, beat the caster sugar and butter until combined, then add the egg yolks and beat again. Add the cornmeal, flour and a pinch of salt, and bring everything together into a soft ball of dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Working with lightly floured hands, break off handfuls of the dough, roll each piece into a 1cm-thick rope, then cut into 8cm lengths. If the dough cracks as you roll it, simply squeeze it and the warmth of your hand will mould it back into shape. Put the lengths on a tray and, if you want, use a fork gently to imprint the surface. Gently bend each biscuit into a curve.If possible, and if the tray fits, chill in the fridge or put it in the freezer for 30 minutes, then bake for 12 minutes, until the biscuits are lightly golden. Turn off the oven, open the door, and leave the biscuits inside for 20 minutes to finish cooking. Leave to cool completely before lifting on to a rack.To serve, dust heavily with icing sugar, and keep any leftovers in a tight tin or box.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkPolentaBiscuitsBakingEggsSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The best time to visit an English vineyard as a punter is right now(in my opinion, of course, but surely a personal column doesn’t need that caveat every week). Hear me out: in winter, a vineyard is all gnarled wood and hard soil, which is an aesthetic I can get behind (no surprise there), but it’s perhaps not the most evocative for drinkers who want a sense of place. Winter is a good time to visit as trade, mind, because the winemaker actually has time to think about their answers to your questions, rather than panicking about whether they should have waited to bring in the ortega.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Then there’s summer: the grapes are hanging pregnant on the vine, it’s sunny, it’s sublime, but there’s simply too much work to do. As a visitor, you always feel as if you’re standing in the wrong place and you feel a bit guilty asking for a tour. But in late spring and early summer, there’s a gentle hum of anticipation. Things are about to get started.Most British wineries are concentrated down south (sorry, fellow northerners), and one region in particular really pulls in the wine tourists: Sussex. It is, like most regions in the south of England, known for producing sparkling wine, and received a PDO (protected designation of origin) in 2022. To get the PDO, Sussex sparklingmustbe made in the traditional, champagne-style method, and it must also be approved by an accredited organisation that’s part ofthe Food Standards Agency.OK, that’s all good to know and everything, but where can I go to drink the stuff? England’s largest single-estate organic wine producer,Oxney, is one of my favourites to visit. It’s all charred timber buildings and feels a lot more intimate than other, bigger operations nearby, and itssparkling non-vintage roséis a perennial crowdpleaser (as, for that matter, are any of its vintage stuff, if you can get hold of it). There are vineyard cottages for larger group visits and a couple of shepherd’s huts for couples.Rathfinnyis another vineyard with charming rooms, and several places to eat/drink extremely well (it tends to be a bit windy, though, so pack a sensible windbreaker), whileStophamrecently reopened its Saturday tasting tours with the winemaker. And though I haven’t yet been myself, I’ve been told thatArteliumis a real treat, and I really like their wines. Much the same goes forWiston’s lavish sparkling wines, and I definitely need to put faces to the names.Today’s pick features a few Sussex wines to get you in the mood for a late-spring excursion. Yes, they’re a fair bit spennier than my usual recommendations, but I’ve already explained the reasons behind the relative expense of English wine inan earlier column. Besides, things are often cheaper at the cellar door, which gives you one more reason to visit and support these English wineries directly.An introduction to Sussex winesNutbourne Vineyards Sussex Reserve 2022£15.49 Grape Britannia, 12%.

It’s a running joke in our household. When I cook – which is most of the time, because I enjoy it – I take time to present things properly. Everything looks orderly and is nicely arranged. But with Jim, it’s a case of just throwing everything on the plate. My meal will look as if it’s just lost a bar fight. It’s a mess.I am usually out working late when Jim cooks, so I do really appreciate coming home to a cooked dinner. But presentation is not his forte. The peas will be in the gravy, and the sausages will be precariously placed on top of the mash and the vegetables.I like everything to be separate on the plate so you can see what you’re eating and really enjoy it.I’m not fussy, and I don’t really have issues with food touching; it’s just that I don’t like being handed a plate where you can’t tell what’s what. When Jim makes curry, it’s dolloped with the precision of a toddler doing finger painting.Maybe  – dare I dream? – he could wipe the edge of the plate with a tea towel. I’m not asking for a Michelin starFood sliding off one side of the plate isn’t fun to eat. Neither is having to pick the vegetables out from under the meat. It hinders the dining experience because it feels as though your food is trying to make a break for it. Our daughter, Amanda, called Jim’s attempt at presenting food “abstract expressionism”, which I thought was quite funny.I know Jim means well, but when he hands me a messy plate it feels as though it’s been made with less care. When I cook, my thoughtfully arranged plate says, “Darling, I made this for you.” When Jim cooks, his plate says: “Here. Eat.”I’d love a little more tenderness. It takes 30 seconds to arrange things properly on the plate. Maybe – dare I dream? – he could wipe the edge of the plate with a tea towel and clear up any loose bits of food. I’m not asking for a Michelin star. I’m just asking him to treat the plate with a bit more tenderness.You be the judge - send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: JimWhenit comes to spooning out the meal, it’s like a big relief–I’m free fromcookingLynsey always complains about my food presentation style, but I don’t think it’s an issue. I’m not on a cooking show, I’m a man who wants to eat in a hurry.When I cook, I’m all about efficiency. I know how to make flavours work, but I don’t like to dilly-dally in the kitchen. Just get it done, that’s my motto. I cook for Lynsey when she comes back late from work. The kitchen is usually her forte, so I think she should be appreciative that I’ve managed to do it in her absence without burning it.The meat can go on top of the veg, the sauce isn’t contained in the middle of the plate. I’m just rushingI’m not a great cook. That’s her remit. But when I do, it’s just about getting it done and on the plate. Do I gently nestle the salmon on to a pillow of salad with tweezers? No, I just whack it on. She says I “slap” the food, which isn’t my intention, though I suppose I’m not checking where I place it. The meat can go on top of the veg, the sauce isn’t contained in the middle of the plate. It’s not deliberate – it’s just because I’m rushing or hungry.I’m not trying to win a food presentation award, I’m just trying to make sure the risotto doesn’t glue itself to the pan and I don’t start a fire. When it comes to spooning out the meal, it’s like a big relief. I’m free from cooking and just have to get the food over the finish line and on to the plate. That’s probably why it looks as though I’m being careless, when really I’m just happy it’s done. Lynsey still eats it and says it tastes good. I’m only cooking for her and our daughter. They don’t need fancy presentation.Home cooking is supposed to be charming and rustic and real, which is what my style is. I could slow it down and be a little more delicate, but it wouldn’t be authentic to who I am, and I’m sure Lynsey wouldn’t want to change me. After 25 years of marriage, I don’t think that’s possible anyway. I just don’t believe that a messy plate should be mistaken for a loveless dinner. That slapping of food on to the plate is the sound of me showing up for her. And that should be more important than what it looks like.The jury of Guardian readersShould Jim be more careful when serving up?Food is a feast for the eyes and the soul. If you’ve put time, effort and love into your cooking, slapping it on a plate doesn’t exactly scream “I care.” Just take 30 seconds and show the love!Yasmin, 53When showing up for your partner, you shouldn’t rush. You wouldn’t hastily throw on your suit for a work dinner you’re the plus-one at – you take time to look good, for their sake. If Jim can cook well, why mix up all the flavours at the final hurdle?Jack, 23Jim is not guilty-ish! There’s a whole lot of pettiness going on here. Lynsey is being unnecessarily fussy – the food tastes good, which is really all that matters. But come on, Jim! You’re doing a kind thing for Lynsey, why spoil it just because you can?Rae, 73Jim, you’re clearly a good cook but you’re falling at the last hurdle on several fronts. A touch of class and a moment of care will finesse how you show up for Lynsey, inspire your daughter and make the dish sing.Jon, 37“If a job’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well” comes to mind here. How food is presented affects our appetite and pleasure, so all Jim needs to do is spend an extra 30 seconds to serve it properly – plus a good while longer working out why he feels the need to be so dismissive of Lynsey’s request.Chris, 77Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Jim plate up with a bit more finesse?The poll closes on Wednesday 11 June at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whether Amber shouldstop unplugging her boyfriend’s phone chargerbecause she worries about fire risk.62%of you said yes –Amber is guilty38%of you said no –Amber is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And from late June, the whole city will go Cezanne mad, as the painter’s atelier, north of the centre, and the family home to the west reopen after an eight-year restoration.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But during Cezanne’s lifetime, and for years after his death in 1906, Aix seemed at pains to ignore the artist later called the “father of modern art”. When his widow, Hortense, offered several paintings to the city’s mainMusée Granet, director Henri Pontier declared that Cezanne paintings would enter the gallery only over his dead body.France mapThis year, however (with Pontier dead almost a century), Aix is making up for its neglect with a blockbusterexhibition at Musée Granetto accompany the unveiling of Cezanne’s studio and the estate bought by the artist’s family in 1859. The retrospective will bring together more than 130 works,including still lifes, portraits and landscapes.The paintings were all made in and around the Bastide du Jas de Bouffan, which was a refuge and inspiration for the painter for 40 years. Cezanne’s banker father acquired the 18th-century mansion with its farm and 15 hectares (37 acres) from a bankrupt client. Disappointed that his only son had no interest in finance, he still let young Paul use the ground floorgrand salonas a workspace.View image in fullscreenBastide du Jas de Bouffan; and, below, Cezanne’s depiction of the family home, painted c1885-7.Photograph: ITVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: National Gallery Prague 2025By 2017, however, the house had fallen into disrepair and was closed for a long renovation. Its grand opening is on 28 June, but we grab a sneak preview. Though now in an Aix suburb (20 minutes from the centre, or a few minutes on bus no 8), it’s a charming place, three serene storeys in five hectares of verdant grounds, its shutters painted in Aix’s signature grey-blue.Inside, projections on the walls of the grand salon recreate the paintings (later chiselled off and sold) young Cezanne made on the walls, including a “four seasons” fresco. His card players series – one of whichset a record in 2011for the highest price ever paid for a work of art – was painted here, as was an 1866 portrait of Cezannepèrereading a newspaper. (The artist and his family never used an accent on the first ‘e’ of their name: Cézanne seems to have been a later, Parisian invention.)The family later made a studio for Paul on the second floor, and its tall window, higher than the roofline, can be seen from the front. The kitchen and Madame Cezanne’s bedroom can also be visited.There’s the chestnut avenue he painted, the farm buildings and, most evocative for me, the square pondDailyguided toursof the interior (available in English) will cost from €9.50, but if these sell out, a ticket just for the grounds is still rewarding. For many fans, Cezanne’s genius lies in his outdoor works, and they come to life in the extensive gardens. There’s the chestnut avenue he painted, the farm buildings and, most evocative for me, the squarebassin(pond) that features in dozens of pictures. I’m excited to spot the lion and dolphin statues seen in several canvases, the lions with their bums in the air. (The majestic plane trees and orangery were added by later owners.)After his father died in 1886 and the estate was sold, Cezanne built his atelier in Les Lauves, then a rural area north of Aix, with views to the mountain that had long been his muse, Mont Sainte-Victoire. The 1,000-metre-high limestone ridge can be viewed from many points, including the roof terrace of our hotel, theEscaletto(doubles from €105) on the edge of the old town.View image in fullscreenA painting by Cezanne of his muse, Mont Sainte-Victoire, with Gardanne in the foreground.Photograph: AlamyIt’s a 15-minute walk from here to the atelier, up a road now called Avenue Paul Cézanne. The traditional-style house sits on rising ground, with kitchen and living areas on the ground floor; the first floor is one huge, high-ceilinged studio, with a full-height, north-facing window. This was his last workplace, where he painted the Bathers series,oneof which is in London’s National Gallery. After further renovations next winter, the lower floor will have displays including the artist’s coat, palette and satchel.If Aix had mixed feelings about its famous son, those seem to have been mutual. Of the 1,000-plus paintings Cezanne left, just one is of the city: a watercolour of the fountain in Place de la Mairie. However, he made hundreds in the countryside around, including over 80 of Mont Sainte-Victoire. So the best way to find Cezanne’s Provence is to get out of Aix.The bus to Bibémus quarry – source of the creamy ochre stone that built Aix – is like a ride through a thousand paintingsBetween the city and the mountain isBibémusquarry, source of the creamy ochre stone that has built Aix since Roman times. The bus trip there (no 6) is like a ride through a thousand paintings. These wooded hills are all protected, and daily tickets (from the tourist office) include a shuttle from the terminus at Les Trois Bons Dieux. What pictures can’t convey is the loud birdsong, southern heat and early summer scents of pine and broom.Cezanne made 27 paintings here, developing his pre-cubist style and trademark palette of blue, green and ochre. Reproductions of paintings around the quarry show the vantage point from which they were made – and their current homes: this one now in New York, others in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Baltimore …skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The atelier would have been demolished for housing had a group of US collectors not saved it in 1952. And an American artist,George Bunker, bought the Bibémus quarry in 1954 and left it to the city when he died in 1991, on condition that the land be protected and open to visitors.Canadian sculptorDavid Campbell, now in his late 80s, with wizard-like white hair, was a friend of Bunker’s and has lived here in a quarryman’s cottage for 40 years. We spy him exercising on the edge of the site and he later shows us some of his fluid works in white limestone, plus masterly recreations of medieval masonry.The Red Rock (c.1895, now in Paris’sMusée de l’Orangerie) is one of the best-known Cezanne quarry paintings, and the small post at the bottom left is still there today. But the site calls to my mindanotherin the National Gallery, with, unusually, a figure in white shirt and blue trousers dwarfed by a wall of orange rock.Visitors can also book a6pm visit to Bibémusto enjoy the setting sun on Mont Sainte-Victoire (€17pp) or a half-day electricbike tourfrom Aix (€90pp including bike hire). The area may close unexpectedly, however, if mistral winds increase the risk of wildfires.View image in fullscreenCezanne’s atelier, which narrowly avoided demolition in the 1950s.Photograph: Sophie SpitériOne town the artist did choose to paint is Gardanne, around seven miles from Aix (eight minutes by train). Here, Cezanne tourism is more informal. A plaque on the main street, Cours Forbin, shows where he lived with his wife and son for a productive year in 1885-6.Nearby Colline des Frères (Brothers’ Hill) was an open-air studio for Cezanne, and a free-to-visit walking route includes reproductions of paintings of his favourite mountain, with Gardanne and its bell tower in the foreground. (Power station cooling towers do detract slightly from today’s view.) Again, these works are almost all now in the US – one even in the White House. The local tourist office doesguided tours(€10, in English) on Fridays in July and August.There are no hotels in Gardanne, but aself-catering letmeant we could make the most of the extensive street market under towering plane trees on Cours Forbin (Weds, Fri and Sun).I’m pleased to learn that the square blobs on the right of at least two of Cezanne’s Gardanne paintings are windmills, which still stand. We climb north up Cativel hill and find three mills, one still with its sails, and the date 1567 over the door. They’re on a gorgeous rolling hillside glowing in Cezanne colours, with interlocking shadows of umbrella pines completing the painterly scene.Aix may be all about Cezanne this year, but closer encounters may well be found off the main tourist trail.Cezanne at Jas de Bouffanopens 28 June and runs until 12 October at Musée Granet.

They can’t just go back to Syria like counting to three.”On Tuesday, far-right populist Geert Wilders collapsed his first government after failing to break open the coalition agreementto add 10 new policies on asylum– including deporting Syrians with temporary residency within six months, forcibly if necessary.LiveDutch government collapses as Geert Wilders pulls far-right party out of coalition – videoEleven months into a four-party coalition described by Dutch media as an “unhappy marriage”,Wilders walked out, resigning all of his ministers with immediate effect. His former coalition partners reacted with fury, saying there was no disagreement about reducing asylum and labelling Wildersa political footballerfaking a foul.On the streets of south-east Amsterdam – whereearlier this week an investigationrevealed that children were sleeping in garages and cars because their parents could not find housing – there was a sense of both relief and confusion.Adjoining De Bijlmerhorst school, where one in 20 children have no fixed residence, parents were waiting for their children to exit the As-Souffah Islamic primary.For Ahmed Abubakar, 41, from Somalia and with five children, the fall of the government was confusing. “I don’t know if it’s good news,” he said. “We live in two rooms. I’ve been on WoningNet [social housing list] for 11 years.”Like most of the country’s population, people seemedmost concerned about issuessuch as the need to boost healthcare, build housing andcontrol price-pumping.A snap online poll of 16,117 voters by current affairs programmeEenVandaagfound 60% were happy that Wilders had exited government. Supporters of leftwing parties were glad to see the end of the hard right coalition but the Freedom party’s (PVV) own voters were divided, said pollster Rozemarijn Lubbe.“Two-thirds of them say it’s a good thing that he stepped away: they agree with the points that he wanted, like these 10 asylum points,” she said.“They feel that he was sabotaged … actively opposed by the European Union, by opposition parties but also by other coalition parties.“But 29% of PVV voters are not happy: some say Wilders and [his] asylum minister [Marjolein] Faber should have done more.”Trust in politics, which has forsome years been at historic lows, slumped from 34% after the government was installed to just 23% on Tuesday. “And it dropped with these specific rightwing voters,” she said.Experts suggest Wilders was exploiting a story in rightwing paper De Telegraaf in the middle of May suggesting immigration was adding “a city a year”, or 130,000 people, to the national population – although it failed to deduct almost 20,000 people who left in that period.Statistics Netherlands figures show thevast majority of immigrationis labour migration rather than asylum – and like much of Europe, the Netherlandssaw refugee numbershalve in early 2025.But the PVV wanted to collapse the coalition and was looking for an excuse to exploit its dominant issue, migration, according to Mark Thiessen, campaign strategist at Meute.“After February the dominant narrative in society and politics completely changed … to geopolitics, security, people feeling insecure, and they’re not favouring Wilders,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even for the couple of hundred hours per year ofdunkelflaute(low wind and low sun), it is possible to sustain a reliable power system by expanding renewable energy, rapid growth and modernisation of the electricity  grid, faster interconnection, using electricity far more efficiently, smart energy management and deployment of today’s cost-effective storage technology.And, by the way, it turns out that Sizewell C new nuclear station would bealmost entirely cut offby climate-driven storm-surge floodwater at least once a year by the time it’s built. According toUK government global data, it takes up to 17 years to build just one nuclear station.

What is required in response is a thoughtful, strategic approach that focuses in on actions that are practical and effective in these difficult times and will help build the UK government’s“strong foundations” of national security and secure borders.For example, arguably the biggest near-term threat to UK security is the “mass population displacement” that Lt Gen Richard Nugee refers to. About 3.5 billion people live in an arc around Europe, across Africa, the Middle East and Asian countries such as Pakistan, India andBangladesh. People in these regions are already confronting floods and heatwaves of up to 50C that are making large areas uninhabitable. Rural communities are being forced into conflict and migration, while food production and supplies to cities are being affected.Russia has already identified this as a strategic way to undermine European democracies. It stokes conflict and weaponises people – for example, pushing a wave of 4 million Syrian war refugees into Europe and Turkey. The payoff has been the rise of pro-Russian rightwing parties across Europe. With temperatures rising much faster than expected, this problem will accelerate during the present parliament. It requires immediate action as there’s no way to contain it.What can we do? The UK has a strong track record of using international aid to promote farming in these vulnerable communities. The best approach is regenerative farming, which produces food, builds resilience to extreme weather and draws carbon out of the atmosphere as it rebuilds soil health. It is a strategy for mitigating, and adapting to, climate change. We must salvage and expand this programme within the remaining aid and climate finance budget.It is essential to our national security that we fight climate change at home, through decarbonisation, and that we promote regenerative agriculture at home and in frontline countries around Europe.Dr Adam ParrHertford College, University of OxfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The lessons of Ukraine underline the reality of that threat. But there are other threats to the UK that require engagement across the world and that will not be solved by more drones and more bullets.Battles for territory and for political power beyond Ukraine result in death and despair for millions. Climate change, deepening inequality, poverty, famine and the displacement of populations generate humanitarian agendas that a country such as ours should respond to. They also constitute threats to us. We should not dispense with foreign aid to bolster a narrow perception of what we need to defend against. But what about cost?As Dan Sabbagh asks (Spending constrains Labour’s defence review – but no harm in gradualism, 2 June), even if we accept the need to strengthen the readiness of our conventional forces, why do we need to spend more on nuclear weapons?The existing nuclear deterrent is dreadful in and of itself. Even if we are uncertain about the US’s resolve, the UK and France could unleash mass destruction with what they have now. Surely we cannot see a scenario when we would need to, or choose to, deploy nuclear weapons on the battlefield?We should redirect the funding for more nuclear weapons in the defence review to overseas aid. It’s not enough, but it does signal that we are not being diverted in our commitment to those in the most dire need across the world by the agenda of Vladimir Putin and his coterie in Moscow.Neil SmallLeedsTraditionally, we have seen our armed forces as being necessary to protect Britain’s territorial integrity and safeguard our way of life and independence. As Dan Sabbagh points out, our territorial integrity is not under threat. As for our way of life and independence, there is no threat to this from Vladimir Putin: he does not appear to have any interest in the way we conduct our internal affairs, and even if he did, there is not much leverage he could apply. The same cannot be said for the American administration, which can exercise enormous leverage over our government and has distinct ideas about how it would like to influence our internal affairs, made painfully clear by JD Vance in hisMunich speechearlier this year.Part of this leverage resides in the nature of the dependence of British armed forces on American equipment and support. Under the defence review, this degree of dependence will remain – we will be renewing our nuclear deterrent (missiles provided by the US) and probably buying more equipment from the US. Should we not be looking at decoupling ourselves from the US rather than exposing ourselves to pressure from a potentially malevolent government?Richard HendersonBristolOne must presume that our “battle-ready” prime minister did not read your exemplary interview with Neta Crawford last week (How the US became the biggest military emitter and stopped everyone finding out, 30 May), outlining her analysis of the true costs to the biosphere of an escalation in military spending. Or does not care.The economics aside, the political choices before Keir Starmer and all global leaders in this Anthropocene twilight of “ecological collapse” (‘Half the tree of life’: ecologists’ horror as nature reserves are emptied of insects, 3 June) are exquisitely stark. Either they devote their full energies to the climate emergency and so genuinely lead in attempting to heal an international system’s self-destructive path to planetary annihilation. Or they reprise the last cold-war, nuclear-tipped, military confrontation of the 1980s and so, this time, seal it. Which is it to be?Dr Mark LeveneNew Radnor, PowysThe prime minister proposes to increase conventional defence spending and bring back a form of national service to “make Britain safer”. Butdocuments in the House of Commons librarystate that we will be spending £118bn between 2023 and 2033 on our nuclear deterrent. If nuclear weapons aren’t keeping us safe, what is the point of them? Why not spend this huge sum on social care, housing and other similar projects that would benefit the whole community. Most people would then be happy to let the prime minister have his soldiers, while life improves for everyone else.Peter LoschiOldham, Greater ManchesterZoe Williams’ description of sexual violence in war was a hard read, but a timely reminder, given the bullish talk flowing from the strategic defence review, that war is always an atrocity in one form or another (The story of war is one of kidnapping, slavery and rape. And what we talk about is strategy and territory, 2 June). The second world war ended with the atrocities of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I support strengthening our defences to keep Britain safe from attack, but if nuclear weapons are part of that, let us remember that they are a deterrent, not an opportunity.Anne ConstantineGreat Gransden, CambridgeshireExplore more on these topicsDefence policyNuclear weaponsMilitaryKeir StarmerClimate crisisRussiaTax and spendinglettersShareReuse this content"

Dealers in the hidden market will pay tens of thousands of dollars for the horns, which are falsely believed to be effective at treating fevers, pain and a low sex drive in traditional medicine.Butnew researchin the journal Science has highlighted ways to better protect the animals from illegal hunters. An assessment of rhino protection methods in the Greater Kruger region of South Africa – home to a quarter of the continent’s rhinos – found that removing horns reduced poaching by nearly 80% between 2017 and 2023.In a collaboration between scientists, conservationists and government officials, the research found no statistical evidence that traditional anti-poaching interventions – such as rangers, detection cameras, dog tracking and helicopters – caused significant reductions in rhino poaching, despite their multimillion-dollar cost, even though they were successful at detecting hundreds of poachers.“Dehorning rhinos to reduce incentives for poaching was found to achieve a 78% reduction in poaching using just 1.2% of the overall rhino protection budget,” said Dr Tim Kuiper of Nelson Mandela University, a lead author of the study. “We might need to rethink our goals. Do we just want to arrest poachers? It doesn’t appear to be making a massive difference to reducing rhino poaching.”To dehorn a rhino, workerssedate the animal, apply a blindfold and earplugs, and cut off the horn with a power saw. The horn will gradually regrow – an average rhino needs to be dehorned every 1.5 to two years. The process poses a very low risk to the animal and does not hurt it.“The headline result is that dehorning stood out for its effectiveness. We are cautious to say that the other interventions are not working. They worked when measured by whether they were detecting poachers. But detecting and arresting a load of poachers doesn’t necessarily bend the curve on rhino poaching,” Kuiper said.View image in fullscreenA sedated rhino has its horns cut off in South Africa. The procedure poses a very low risk to the animal.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesIn South Africa, rhino poaching remains high,with 103 killed in the first three months of 2025. Last year, 420 were lost. In recent decades, rhino populations have collapsed in Asia and Africa due to poaching and habitat loss, continuing falls driven by European colonial hunters.Sauntering on streets and grazing on lawns: what happens when rhinos move into town?Read moreBut the researchers behind the project, representing the University of Cape Town, Nelson Mandela University, University of Stellenbosch and the University of Oxford and other conservation institutions, cautioned that dehorning rhinos was not a magic bullet. A significant stump of horn mass remains on the rhino after dehorning, and some poachers were still prepared to kill rhinos for this section.Sharon Haussmann, a pioneer in rhino conservation in South Africa and co-author on the paper, played a leading role in coordinating conservation efforts in the study area. She died unexpectedly atthe weekendand Kuiper wanted to highlight the collaboration between different sectors that are often mistrustful of each other in her memory.“Is a rhino still a rhino without its horn? That’s a bigger question,” said Kuiper.One study of black rhinosindicated that while poaching rates decreased, dehorned animals became more timid and covered much smaller ranges. Researchers believe that horn is used to establish territories and dehorned rhinos were unable to do this after the procedure.“We wouldn’t like to keep dehorning them for the next 100 years,” Kuiper said. “Ideally we would like to address the drivers of poaching. But it is better than the impacts of poaching”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsAnimalsThe age of extinctionIllegal wildlife tradeConservationSouth AfricaWildlifeAfricaEndangered speciesnewsShareReuse this content"

In remarksreported by the Hollywood Reporterand Screen, Elba said: “There’s a crazy number across the entire continent – less than about 3,000 cinemas, actual cinemas that you and I have grown up with. I would love to be able to tackle some of that, because I believe that the cinema experience that we all have gone through should be experienced by a new generation. I don’t think it should all be on a phone.”Elba added: “How do I do that? Building a model of data that shows that actually people do want to watch films, that they will enjoy the experience of theatre. I’m not going to try and boil the ocean, but it’s going to happen one bit at a time … Yeah man, I want to build the African Odeon.”Elba, who was born in London to a Sierra Leonean father and a Ghanaian mother, has spoken previously about his ambitions to support the film industry in sub-Saharan Africa,saying in October: “It’s really important that we own those stories of our tradition, of our culture, of our languages, of the differences between one language and another.” He is also part of a consortiumdeveloping an “eco city” on Sherbro Island in Sierra Leone.In London, Elba mentioned an AI-powered app called Talking Scripts that turns written material into audio, aiming to help people with reading difficulties such as dyslexia, as well as a digital wallet he had co-founded, called Akuna Wallet, designed to help creatives send money across borders more easily than before.He added: “Any film or piece of music that was made in the 80s was made on equipment less superior than your phone is now. These kids know that. They are making films, they are making songs on these devices. Ultimately, there is a wall when it comes to getting it out there and monetising it, [but] I think the confidence that Afrobeats,Nollywood, has given African creators, young creators, is huge.”Explore more on these topicsFilmIdris ElbaAfricaSXSWFilm industryFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The foreign ministry of Laos did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported.mapThere was no immediate response fromIran, but Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, said: “The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child.”The move bans all travel to the US by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo,Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.12Trump imposed a partial ban on travellers from seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from these countries would be allowed, his administration said. The bans would come into effect on Monday 9 June, the White House said.The African Union said the ban would harm “people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement and broader diplomatic relations” built with the US over decades. It appealed to Washington to adopt a “consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned”.Trump said the bans were spurred by a makeshiftflame-thrower attack on a Jewish protest in Coloradothat US authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally.View image in fullscreenA woman who has fled from the Zamzam camp for internally displaced people in North Darfur, Sudan.Photograph: Marwan Mohamed/EPASeveral countries on the list – Myanmar, Libya, Sudan and Yemen – face continuing civil strife and territory overseen by opposing factions. Sudanhas an active war, whileYemen’s waris largely stalemated and Libyan forces remain armed.For citizens of war-stricken countries such as Myanmar, which has been gripped by violence since a military coup in 2021, the announcement is yet another blow. It follows afreeze on refugee resettlementsannounced by Trump in January, andcuts to scholarship programmesthat provided rare opportunities for young people to go abroad and study in safety.A 21-year-old student from Myanmar, who asked not be named, said his plan to study computer science at a community college in New York was in tatters. “[My] visa appointment is 25 June – but then there was this breaking news in the morning … I felt upset.

Going to the army would be like I’m already dead. My name is on their list so I [had to] sneak out of my country,” he said, adding that his family stayed in Myanmar.Young people have desperately sought ways to leave Myanmar after the widely loathed military junta announced last year it would impose mandatory conscription to boost its numbers.Aside from the fear of conscription, people are living with the constant threat of military airstrikes in many areas of the country, the aftermath ofa devastating earthquakethat struck in March and sky-high inflation.“Most of the people are jobless, most of the students are hopeless, we have no future. I think our generation is just for sacrifice,” the student said.The travel ban was yet more bad news for Myanmar refugees in neighbouring Thailand, some of whom had been close to moving to the US when Trump abruptly suspended refugee resettlements earlier this year, said Joe Freeman, Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher.View image in fullscreenHouses bombed by Myanmar military jets in Chin state, Myanmar, in December.Photograph: Valeria Mongelli/The GuardianSince the 2021 military coup in Myanmar, 3.2 million people have been displaced within the country, while 176,400 have fled to neighbouring countries. “Some had already done their orientations for the US. They’ve already had their medical checkups. They’ve already gotten their flight tickets – and then just like [that] the hammer comes down,” Freeman said.The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who had worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on special immigrant visas, generally people who worked most closely with the US government during the two-decade-long war there.Afghanistan was also one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trumpsuspended refugee resettlementon his first day in office.Shawn VanDiver, the president and board chair of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit, said: “To include Afghanistan – a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years – is a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold,.”International aid groups and refugee resettlement organisations roundly condemned the bans. “This policy is not about national security – it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, the president of Oxfam America.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS immigrationVenezuelaSomaliaIranYemennewsShareReuse this content"

It was considered eradicated in 1998, but cases continue to occur due to spread from other countries.The US is also confronting a significant measles resurgence, with a vaccine-skeptical Mennonite Christian community straddling the Texas-New Mexico border hit particularly hard.Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has undermined confidence in the MMR vaccine – a highly effective shot he has falsely claimed is dangerous and contains fetal debris.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMMRVaccines and immunisationAmericasHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The lower court had found thatMexicoplausibly alleged that the companies aided and abetted illegal gun sales, harming its government.The companies had argued for the dismissal of Mexico’s suit, filed in Boston in 2021, under a 2005 US law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that broadly shields gun companies from liability for crimes committed with their products. The Boston-based first circuit court of appeals decided in 2024 that the alleged conduct by the companies fell outside these protections.“Mexico alleges that the companies aided and abetted unlawful sales routing guns to Mexican drug cartels. The question presented is whether Mexico’s complaint plausibly pleads that conduct.

Trump has also accused Mexico of doing too little to stop the flow of synthetic drugs such as the opioid fentanyl and migrant arrivals at the border, even though Mexico has stepped up efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the border in recent years.Mexico had claimed that the companies have deliberately maintained a distribution system that included firearms dealers who knowingly sell weapons to third-party, or “straw”, purchasers who then traffic guns to cartels in Mexico.The suit also accused the companies of unlawfully designing and marketing their guns as military-grade weapons to drive up demand among the cartels.Mexico in the lawsuit sought monetary damages of an unspecified amount and a court order requiring Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms to take steps to “abate and remedy the public nuisance they have created in Mexico”.Gun violence fueled by trafficked US-made firearms has contributed to a decline in business investment and economic activity in Mexico.Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtMexicoUS gun controlAmericasArms tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Leithfield School principal Rob Cavanagh told Stuff the response to the fundraiser had been “pretty overwhelming”, with 19,000 blocks sold.“I wasn’t quite aware of what a popular commodity butter is in this day and age.”Meanwhile, some people are using social media to teach others how to make their own butter, and bakeries across the country have reported making the tough choice to either increase their prices or face closure.Owner of Kayes Bakery based in Southland, Luella Penniall, said she was frustrated at having to import cheaper alternatives, despite living in a country that produces so much dairy produce.New Zealand is the world’s top dairy exporter, producing a third of the world’s dairy trade. The industry represents about $11.3bn or 3.2% of New Zealand’s GDP, and plays a significant role in regional economies.Penniall uses an Australian broker to find the best priced butter of the right quality, which often results in half her butter order being shipped from Australia.Kayes Bakery uses roughly three tonnes of butter every two months. The business is “surrounded by dairy farms” and Penniall would prefer to use New Zealand products but the cost can be prohibitive.“Farmers deserve everything they get, they work hard, but somewhere in between it seems to be getting out of control.”Global supply problems and high demand for New Zealand’s products are driving local prices higher, according to the chief executive of Infometrics, Brad Olsen.About 95% of New Zealand’s dairy products are exported, which means the international market determines domestic prices.It is “a double-edged sword”, where high prices are good for the country’s economy but tough for domestic shoppers, Olsen said.“I’m not saying that at the moment its the right happy balance, but given that commodity prices … are going to be dictated by the international market, that is sort of how the game is played.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificFoodInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The presidential proclamation cited Harvard’s links with China as a particular cause for concern.‘They are in shock’: Indian students fear Trump has ended their American dreamRead moreFor Jerry*, a 22-year-old applied mathematics student at the University of California, Los Angeles, the uncertainty started last month, when the Trump administration suddenlyhalted Harvard University’s ability to enrol any international students.Jerry has a place on a health data science masters programme at Harvard, which is due to start in the autumn. The US government’s attempt to ban Harvard from accepting international students appears to have beenblocked, at least temporarily, by the courts. But Trump’s announcement on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority.Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, hasannounced that the authorities willbe targeting Chinese students specifically, nationwide.It is “total discrimination,” Jerry said. “I don’t think anyone would consider that reason sufficient. That’s just pushing Chinese students to go elsewhere”.Unsure about whether or not he will be able to enrol at Harvard, Jerry is considering taking up a place on a PhD programme at Oxford University in the UK. He said on Thursday that following Trump’s latest attack on Harvard, Oxford seems like an even more likely option.Although he hopes to study at Harvard, Jerry feels lucky to have a back-up plan. “A lot of the people who accepted Harvard offers don’t have other options. So it must be much more anxious for them”.Across the US, universities have been scrambling to find ways to reassure the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students on their campuses about their academic future.In a memo sent to Chinese students at University of Oregon, the school described the state department’s announcement about revoking the visas for Chinese students as “vague” and said: “A revoked passport does not impact your legal status in the US because it is only an entry document used when entering the US”. However, the university warned that a revoked visa could lead to removal proceedings by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).Warning about being targeted by ICE have taken on a new gravity since the agency started targeting international students with the lawful right to remain in the country. They includeMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestine activist who was detained despite holding a green card to reside in the US. Khalil is now fighting a deportation order.Steven*, a 34-year-old Chinese PhD student at the University of Oregon, said that although he is not planning to apply for a new student visa soon, the prospect of an encounter with ICE concerned him. “Nowadays, even if you have a green card, you have legitimate status, you could get caught by ICE, because these guys are crazy”.Steven has been in the US for a decade. In that time, the US has become a less attractive destination for Chinese students, he said, something he sees borne out in his part-time job helping Chinese students with their college applications. The numbers wanting to study in the US have declined, with people favouring countries in South-east Asia, such as Singapore, which are more culturally similar to China. The US is “just not that friendly” any more, Steven says.The loss of top Chinese students in the US would be a blow to academic research, and to the funding for higher education institutions, experts say.In the 2023-2024 academic year, there were about 277,400 Chinese students in the US, according to government statistics. That is a 25% drop compared to 2019-2020.“By barring Chinese students and scholars from America, theTrump administrationwill strangle the pipeline of high-end talent into our universities, companies, and research institutes, sparking a serious deficit in talent and expertise that will damage American competitiveness,” said Denis Simon, non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute, who specialises in science and technology policy in China.The state department’s announcement last week specified that students with connections to the Chinese Communist party (CCP) or studying in “critical fields” would be included in the visa crackdown.For years, the US has tried to root out Chinese espionage in academia, with concerns raised about CCP-backed programmes to recruit top talent in science and technology fields that are strategically important to China. But academics and campaigners say that this has bled over into racism, with all Chinese researchers or those of Chinese heritage being treated with suspicion.Jerry, the mathematics student, said he has experienced discrimination in the US, but not on campus. But if Chinese researchers, staff and PhD students feel they have to leave the US because of an increasingly hostile environment, “it’s going to be a disaster for American universities,” he said.*Names have been changedAdditional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaTrump administrationHigher educationAsia PacificUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was later established that a software error had led the lander to believe it had already touched down when it was still hurtling towards the lunar surface.Resiliencelaunched on 15 Januaryfrom Cape Canaveral, Florida, on the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that carried the Blue Ghost lander manufactured by the Texas startup Firefly Aerospace.Blue Ghostfollowed a speedier trajectory to the moon and made its own pioneering landing on 2 March.The apparent demise of Hakuto-R Mission 2 would be a significant setback for ispace’s Venture Moon initiative that it said would be “laying the groundwork” for an extended human presence on the moon. Ambitious plansinclude a lunar citywith a thousand residents, the first arriving as early as 2040.It also hopes to eventually accommodate thousands more space tourists for shorter visits.“Our goal is to build the cislunar economy, one in which the moon and Earth are economically and socially connected,” ispace’s chief executive, Takeshi Hakamada, said in a prepared statement released before Thursday’s landing attempt.“We view the success of the lunar landing as merely a stepping stone toward that goal. We strongly believe that this endeavor and its long-term success will contribute to making life on Earth sustainable for all humanity.”Resilience was set to deploy a small, European-built moon rover named Tenacious for a two-week mission. High-definition video footage and telemetry would have been beamed back to Earth for monitoring by the EuropeanSpaceAgency (Esa) and partners.The rover has a shovel intended to collect soil samples for evaluation as the search for evidence of the presence of life-sustaining water or ice on the moon continues.Nasa, the US space agency, will pay ispace $5,000 under an agreementsigned in 2020for a chunk of regolith it can study in furtherance of its own plans to land humans back on the moon for the first time since 1972, and ultimately on Mars.“Tenacious is hopefully a very successful technological achievement, but beyond the technology it’s also a symbol of the future of lunar exploration,” Géraldine Naja, Esa’s director of commercialization, industry and competitiveness, told reporters earlier on Thursday.“Esa is extremely proud and thrilled to support ispace Mission 2. This is a very good example of how we can support new space actors in Europe [and] commercialization. We are eager to support, eventually, a sustainable European-Japanese presence on the moon.”The 11lb (5kg) rover was also carrying a more quirky payload: Moonhouse, a model installation created by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg, that would have become the first property on the moon, albeit in miniature form.The bright red Swedish-style house was to have provided a splash of color against the gray backdrop of the moon’s northern reaches.“It’s a small house in a vast, empty place, a symbol of belonging, curiosity and vulnerability,” Genberg toldspace.comin an interview published on Thursday.“I hope it invites people to reflect on our relationship to space, and to recognize the fragility and uniqueness of our own world.”SpaceX Starship breaks up over Indian Ocean in latest bumpy testRead moreWhile the governments of five countries – the US, Russia, China, India and Japan – have successfully landed un-crewed robotic lunar explorers, commercial efforts have seen more failures than successes in recent years.In addition to the previous ispace flop, two attempts by the Texas company Intuitive Machines (IM), with itsOdysseusandAthenalanders in February 2024 and March 2025 respectively, ended prematurely when both spacecraft toppled over on landing.Mare Frigoris is a flatter area of the moon, with fewer boulders than the landing sites chosen by IM and Firefly.Ispace also chose to take its time getting to the moon, with the five-month journey of Resilience during a so-called low-energy transfer allowing the company to thoroughly evaluate its systems and computer programs after blaming a software error for the 2023 crash landing.A contract with Nasa will see ispace attempting to send a larger rover to the moon on a mission scheduled for 2027.Explore more on these topicsJapanSpaceThe moonAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products. Our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined … During the conversation, President Xi graciously invited the First Lady and me to visitChina, and I reciprocated.”Trump added that teams from the US and China would meet soon at a location to be determined.The Chinese foreign ministry said Trump initiated the call, which was only the second time this year the two leaders had spoken one to one. They previously spoke in January, before Trump’s inauguration.The discussion followed posts on social media by Trump that praised the Chinese leader but also suggested it was difficult to reach a deal with him.Trump’s 50% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum come into effectRead moreTrade negotiations between the US and Chinastalledshortly after an agreement between the countries on 12 May to reduce 145% import tariffs on China imposed by Washington, and Beijing’s 125% tariffs on US imports in a tit-for-tat exchange.The agreement allowed for a reduction in tariffs during a 90-day moratorium before talks to resolve differences, especially over the export of Chinese rare earth metals, which are crucial to making electric cars and mobile phones.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, will represent the US side in negotiations.Trump is under pressure to resolve the dispute with China after a series of weak economic figures that showed a sharp slowdown in US growth and a reluctance among private companies to hire staff.

We see this, and it means that it is normal that we must also adapt to this. We need adaptation. We need discussion about the rules that we want to have, and there is no taboo.”He added: “I see the necessity to adapt but we must also do this respecting our core values.”There is growing political pressure in several European countries to overhaul the ECHR’s scope, particularly in response to migration.Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, is expected to take an even harder line in a speech on Friday. She will say that Britain should consider leaving the convention entirely, arguing that it impedes efforts to tackle migration.“I have thought long and hard about this, and I am increasingly of the view that we will need to leave, because I am yet to see a clear and coherent route to change within our current legal structures,” she will say.Human rights organisations have expressed alarm at recent rhetoric around reform, warning that undermining or withdrawing from the convention risks weakening protection for society’s most vulnerable groups, including refugees fleeing war and persecution.Many argue that the ECHR plays a vital role in holding states to account, especially in areas such as detention, pushbacks over border crossings and surveillance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I told her it shouldn’t have happened, but it did. But you have your own difficulty with that, and we do.”He was referring to Merkel, but did not call her by name. The former chancellor visited the White House in 2017, during Trump’s first term of office, when she was given a grilling by Trump over her so-called open-door policy, which allowed around 1 million refugees – mainly from Syria and Iraq – into Germany.Merz’s highly anticipated visit had beenviewed with trepidation in Berlin, amid fears that the German leader may face another Oval Office ambush, such as those endured by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa.In the end, all the criticism was levied at Merkel, a former political rival of Merz. Trump also made a dig about Merkel’s enthusiasm for the building of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brought gas from Russia toEurope.During the 35-minute press conference, Merz struggled to get a word in, though as German commentators noted, that was probably to the relief of his advisers, who feared there were a number of issues on which Trump might have pilloried him, from defence spending to immigration.When he did manage to speak, the former corporate lawyer mostly focused on Ukraine and the need to end the conflict, in particular by bringing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to account.Merz also pushed back several times on Trump’s narrative that Ukraine and Russia were equally to blame for the war.Trump says it may be better to let Ukraine and Russia ‘fight for a while’Read more“I’m here, Mr President, to talk to you later on how we could contribute to that goal [to end the war]. We are all looking for measures and for instruments to bring this terrible war to an end,” Merz said.He compared the US role in ending the conflict with the part US troops played in defeating the Nazi dictatorship. He noted that Friday will mark the 81st anniversary of D-day, in which tens of thousands of US troops joined allied troops in invading Normandy.The US, he said, was “again, in the very strong position to do something” about ending the war. Trump, he said, was the “key person in the world” who could stop the war “by putting pressure on Russia”.Trump praised Germany for having agreed to boost its defence spending to 5% of GDP, after years-long demands from Washington for it to do so.Asked by a German journalist whether Berlin was “doing enough on defence”, Trump said: “I know you’re spending more money on defence now. Quite a bit more money. That’s a positive.”But to some nervous laughter in the room, he quipped that he was “not sure if Gen MacArthur would have said it’s positive,” a reference to the supreme commander for the allied powers, among whose focuses was postwar demilitarisation.Merz prepared for the visit in part by talking to other leaders who have met Trump in recent months to gather tips about the best way to handle him.Merkel has said that she prepared for her first Trump visit – when he was less well-known as a politician – by reading a 1980s interview with him in Playboy and watching episodes of The Apprentice.Merz was put up for the night in the official government guest house, Blair House, which his advisers said was a signal that the two leaders – who refer to one other by their first names – were on a good footing.Merz presented Trump with a gold-framed birth certificate of his grandfather, Friedrich Trump, who emigrated from Germany in 1885, as well as a book titled News from the Land of Freedom – German Immigrants Write Home, which is a collection of letters written by German émigrés in the US to their families back in Germany.“It is a small present to remind him of his family,” Merz said. He has also invited Trump to Germany to visit his grandfather’shome village.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzDonald TrumpUS foreign policyNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It has variously been described as a militia and a criminal gang.The Times of Israel cited defence sources who said that Israel provided members Abu Shabab’s faction with Kalashnikov assault rifles, including some weapons seized from Hamas. The operation was approved by Israel’s security cabinet and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the newspaper reported, noting that its article had been approved for publication by Israel’s military censor.In a video posted on social media late on Thursday, Netanyahu said Israel had “activated” some Palestinian clans in Gaza, on the advice of “security officials,” in order to save lives of Israeli soldiers.The prime minister’s office had earlier said that “Israel is working to defeat Hamas in various ways, on the recommendation of all heads of the security establishment.”The former defence minister and opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman repeated the allegations and alleged that Abu Shabab’s group was affiliated with the Islamic State terror group.“The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister,” Lieberman, who heads the opposition Yisrael Beiteinu party, told Kan Bet public radio. “To my knowledge, this did not go through approval by the cabinet.”The basis for Lieberman’s allegation of ties to IS was not clear. Abu Shabab’s group has previously been accused of involvement in smuggling operations linked to Egyptian jihadi groups.A security official told Israeli news outlet Ynet that the arming of Abu Shabab was approved and led by the Shin Bet internal security service, and described the operation as “planned and managed”, with the goal of “reducing Israeli military casualties whilesystematically undermining Hamasthrough targeted strikes, infrastructure destruction and the promotion of rival local forces.”The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians walk along a road to receive humanitarian aid packages from a US-backed foundation in Rafah on Thursday.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIn recent weeks, Abu Shabab has published anti-Hamas and anti-Palestinian Authority messages while promoting his militia’s efforts on Facebook.Abu Shabab’s links with Israeli forces were confirmed by his family, which issued a statement last week formally disowning him.“We, like everyone else, were surprised by video footage broadcast by the resistance showing the involvement of Yasser’s groups within a dangerous security framework, reaching the point of operating within undercover units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces, who are brutally killing our people,” the statement said.“We affirm that we will not accept Yasser’s return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him immediately, and we tell you that his blood is forfeit.”Abu Shabab has reportedly claimed his group were protecting aid convoys, while Hamas has accused him of looting the aid trucks.On 28 May, Jonathan Whittall, the head of United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in occupiedPalestinian territoriessaid: “Israel has publicly claimed that the UN and NGO aid is being diverted by Hamas. But this doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. The real theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs, under the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point into Gaza.”When contacted by the Guardian, Whittall confirmed he was “referring to gangs such as Abu Shabab.”On Wednesday, a labour union representing truck drivers in Gaza said it was halting transport of aid deliveries within the strip after an incident in which several truckers were shot dead by gunmen.The Private Transport Association said it was calling the strike in response to an incident a day ago in which a convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian aid was attacked by gunmen in the central Gaza.“This crime is not the first of its kind, but it is by far the most serious in a series of recurring assaults aimed at obstructing relief operations and preventing vital aid from reaching hundreds of thousands of civilians facing dire humanitarian conditions,” the statement said.Jihad Sleem, vice-president of the Special Transportation Association, who lost his relative, Mohammed al-Assar, in the attack, said he did not know who the gunmen were.Asked if he suspected Abu Shabab was behind the killings, he said: “It wouldn’t surprise me if he was involved in these attacks. He’s a gangster.”Jamal Risheq contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warHumanitarian responseMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the remains of Judih Weinstein, 70, and Gad Haggai, 72, both of whom had Israeli and US citizenship, were returned toIsraelby the army and the Shin Bet internal security agency after an overnight operation in southern Gaza.Their deaths had been announced in December 2023. “My beautiful parents have been freed. We have certainty,” their daughter, Iris Haggai Liniado, wrote in a Facebook post. She thanked the Israeli military, the FBI and the Israeli and US governments and called for the release of all the remaining hostages.InGaza, food distribution points run by a US-backed group had meanwhile remained closed on Thursday morning after their closure on Wednesday after the killings by Israeli troops of dozens of civilians waiting for food. The US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) had said its sites were undergoing maintenance and repair work. It said later on Thursday afternoon it had resumed food distribution at two separate sites and said a total of 1.4 million meals have been delivered.Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes on Thursday killed at least 10 people in the Palestinian territory.The Israeli military said in a statement on Thursday that Weinstein and Haggai were murdered by gunmen from the Mujahideen Brigades, a small Palestinian group, when they attacked Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.In a statement, the forum of the Israeli hostage families said: “The return of Judi and Gad is painful and heartbreaking, yet it also brings healing to our uncertainty. Their return reminds us all that it is the state’s duty to bring everyone home, so that we, the families, together with all the people of Israel, can begin the process of healing and recovery.’’The forum stressed that decision-makers ‘‘must do everything necessary to reach an agreement that will return all 56 remaining hostages – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for burial. There is no need to wait another 608 agonising days for this. The mission can be completed as early as tomorrow morning. This is what the majority of the Israeli people want.’’At least 20 of the 56 remaining hostages are believed to be alive, according to Israel. Most of the hostages were released as part of deals with Hamas during two temporary ceasefires in late 2023 and early 2025.Since the 7 October attacks, Israel has responded with an air and ground assault on Gaza that has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health authorities, and reduced much of the territory to ruins as food supplies have also been blocked.Gaza food hub stops operations for second day as access routes remain ‘combat zones’Read moreOn Wednesday, GHF announced that its operations would be suspended into the morning on Thursday in order to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites after Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians,killing at least 27and injuring hundreds. GHF pressed Israel to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites.Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gaza havedenied there is evidenceof any widespread diversion of supplies at any stage of the conflict.

Since April,fake reviews have been explicitly banned.Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive, said the undertakings secured fromAmazonmeant shoppers could now “make decisions with greater confidence”. The commitments mattered because “so many people use Amazon and what is clear is that star ratings and reviews have a huge impact on their choices”, she said.Amazon has committed to strengthening existing systems that detect fake reviews and to stamp out “catalogue abuse”. This is where sellers take the reviews of well-performing products and add them to an entirely separate and different product, falsely boosting its star rating.Businesses selling on Amazon face having sanctions imposed for catalogue abuse or for using fake reviews to boost product ratings – and could be banned from selling on the site altogether.Users who post fake reviews, positive or negative, also risk being banned and having all their previous reviews deleted. The retailer will also make it easier for shoppers to alert it to fake posts.The undertakings come after theCMA launched an investigation into Amazon and Googlein 2021 due to concerns that not enough was being done to remove fake reviews or to impose sanctions on the individuals or companies involved. Earlier this yearGoogle made similar pledges, including resolving to take action against repeat offenders.The CMA said it would now move on to scrutinising whether specialist review platforms, the businesses who list products on them and reviewers were complying with the tougher new laws.Under a new regulatory regime brought in under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024, the CMA can now decide independently whether consumer law has been infringed rather than going through the courts.It can also tackle consumer law breaches directly, including issuing fines, ordering businesses to improve their practices, and making them pay redress to affected consumers.Amazon said it already devoted significant resources to eliminating fake reviews and its efforts involved expert human investigators and machine learning models capable of analysing thousands of data points. In 2024 it blocked 275m fake reviews and said “more than 99% of all products in our store contain only authentic reviews”.A spokesperson added: “We also suspend, ban and take legal action against those who violate our policies and have teams dedicated to taking action against bad actors that attempt to solicit fake reviews for products.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonCompetition and Markets AuthorityRegulatorsConsumer affairsE-commerceInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Firefighters dealt with about 10 separate ebike-related fires over just five days.Government data also shows ebike-related fires led to a total of eight deaths in 2024.In December, a coroner warned of the life-threatening dangers of charging ebikes indoors, after the death of eight-year-old Luke Albiston O’Donnell in Merseyside, during a fire started as the result of an ebike’s charging lithium battery igniting.In another tragic case in Coventry, a fire caused by an ebike battery killed Natasha Johnson-Mall and Karlo Bogdan, along with their two dogs.Nearly half of the fires reported in 2024 broke out inside homes, often in bedrooms, kitchens or corridors. Just over a third started outdoors, including in gardens, balconies or sheds. In almost all cases, the battery or generator was identified as the source of the fire.In response to the growing risks, the UK government has introduced new legislation aimed at regulating the sale of ebikes and similar products. However, the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill has come under fire for failing to directly mention the threat posed by lithium-ion batteries.Speaking in the House of Commons, the Liberal Democrat MP Clive Jones said the bill must “address the growing number of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries”.“There remains no reference in the bill to lithium-ion batteries, despite the real and growing harm they cause,” he said.Justin Madders, a parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department for Business and Trade, responded: “While I fully recognise the concerns raised about batteries, the bill does not and should not single out individual product types.” He added: “At this stage, we are actively exploring what regulatory changes might make the greatest difference on lithium-ion batteries.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The children were scored using an international scale of family affluence, which is based on a number of factors including whether a child had their own room and the number of vehicles per household.Children were split into groups of high, medium and low affluence groups, and blood samples were used to measure children’s average telomere length in white blood cells, while the stress hormone cortisol was measured from urine.Telomeres are structures found within chromosomes that play an important role in cellular ageing and DNA integrity, and their degradation is linked to ageing. Telomeres become shorter as humans age.Previous studies have suggested a link between telomere length and chronic diseases, and that acute and chronic stress can reduce telomere length.The study found that children from the high affluence group had telomeres 5% longer on average compared with children from a low affluence group. Girls were found to have longer telomeres than boys, by an average of 5.6%, while children with a greater body mass index (BMI) had shorter telomeres by 0.18% for each percentage increase in fat mass.Children from the medium and high affluence groups had cortisol levels between 15.2% and 22.8% lower than children from the low affluence group.The authors acknowledged the study had some limitations in that the children analysed were not from families living in poverty, and that the study should not be interpreted as showing a link between affluence and “quality” of genes, but rather showing the indirect impact of environment on a known marker of ageing and long-term health.Dr Oliver Robinson, from Imperial’sschool of public healthand senior author of the study, said: “Our findings show a clear relationship between family affluence and a known marker for cellular ageing, with potentially lifelong patterns being shaped in the first decade of a child’s life.“It means that for some children, their economic background may put them at a biological disadvantage compared to those who have a better start in life. By failing to address this, we are setting children on a lifelong trajectory where they may be more likely to have less healthy and shorter lives.”Robinson added: “Our work suggests that being from a low affluence background is causing additional biological wear and tear. For children from the low affluent group this may be equivalent to approximately 10 years of ageing at the cellular level, compared to children from high affluence backgrounds.”Kendal Marston, from Imperial’s school of public health and the first author of the study, said: “We know that chronic exposure to stress causes biological wear and tear on the body. This has been demonstrated in animal studies at the cellular level – with stressed animals having shorter telomeres.“While our study couldn’t show that cortisol was the mechanism, it does demonstrate a link between affluence and telomere length, which we know in adulthood is related to lifespan and health. It may be that children from less affluent backgrounds are experiencing greater psychosocial stress. For example, they may be sharing a bedroom with family members, or they may not have the resources they need for school – like access to a computer for homework.”Explore more on these topicsInequalityChildren's healthMedical researchPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Bongolan previouslytestified about her friendship with Ventura and described an alleged incident from 2016 in which she says that Combs dangled herfrom the balcony of Ventura’s 17th-floor apartment in Los Angeles for 10 to 15 seconds, before throwing her on to some balcony furniture.She testified that the incident left her bruised and emotionally scarred and that she experiences nightmares and paranoia.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyerschallengedBongolan’s credibility, citing inconsistencies between her current testimony and prior statements she gave regarding the alleged balcony incident.Cassie Ventura’s friend testifies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs dangled her from balconyRead moreOn Thursday morning, Combs’s lawyers pressed her on the timeline. They claimed that the alleged balcony incident could not have occurred when she said because Combs was performing on the east coast for much of September 2016.Before concluding the cross-examination, Combs’s lawyer suggested that Bongolan was lying about the balcony incident and the injuries.“I can’t agree with you,” Bongolan responded, adding that she could not recall the exact date of the alleged incident, but she “will never forget him holding me on that balcony”.Another former girlfriend of Combs’s, who alleges she was abused and made to participate in drug-fueled sex sessions known as “freak-offs”, began testifying on Thursday afternoon.Testifying under the pseudonym “Jane”, the woman has been described by prosecutors as a single mother who first met Combs in 2020.Jane testified on Thursday that she met Combs in 2020 during a girls’ trip with a friend who was dating him at the time. Jane recalled finding Combs “really charming” and said they exchanged numbers.They began dating in early 2021, she said, and were still dating at the time of his arrest last September.Jane said that she fell “pretty head over heels” for Combs after their first date in early 2021, and that several months later, Combs began introducing her to his sexual fantasies and the idea of her having sex with other men.One night in May 2021, she said she agreed because she wanted to make him happy. Within hours, she said she was in a hotel room watching his assistants prepare the room for a so-called freak-off.Soon after, she said a man from an escort service arrived, and she said she had sex with him while Combs watched and masturbated.Jane testified that the May 2021 encounter opened a “Pandora’s box” in their relationship, adding that “it was a door that I was unable to shut for the remainder of the relationship.”Jane told the court that she only wanted to have sex with Combs, not other men, and that she repeatedly told Combs this during their relationship but that he would be dismissive.Jane said that she felt “obligated” to comply since Combs controlled aspects of her life, including paying her rent.The court was then adjourned for the day and Jane is expected to return to the stand to continue her testimony on Friday morning.Prosecutors have said that Jane’stestimony is similar to that of Ventura, Combs’s former longtime girlfriend, who testified duringthe first week of the trial.Ventura, who dated Combs on and off from 2007 to 2018, told jurors last month that she was subjected to years ofphysical and emotional abuseduring the relationship. She alleged shewas coerced, through violence andblackmail, into taking part in the so-called freak-offs which she said were orchestrated and directed by Combs and involved drugs and male sex workers.During cross-examination, Combs’s attorneys sought to portray Ventura as a willing participant in the freak-offs, framing the encounters as part of a“swingers lifestyle”.Now in its fourth week, the trial has featured graphic and emotional testimony from several witnesses. To date,more than 16 witnesses have testified, including thesinger Dawn Richard,three of Combs’s formerassistants,Ventura’s motherandrapper Scott Mescudi, also knownas Kid Cudi.Combs, 55, wasarrested in September 2024and faces federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.Prosecutorsallegethat Combs ran a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice, with the help of his associates and employees.While Combs’s lawyers have acknowledged his history of domestic violence, they argue that the women participated in the freak-offs consensually and they maintain that Combs isnot guilty of sex trafficking or racketeering, or of operating a criminal enterprise.Prosecutors have said that they may rest their case next week, with the defense expected to begin calling its own witnesses soon after.However, Combs’s lawyershave signaledthat their presentation may take longer than anticipated, potentially extending the trial into early July.If convicted on all counts, Combs could face life in prison.The Associated Press contributed reportingIn the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

They target Solomy Balungi Bossa of Uganda, Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza of Peru, Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini-Gansou of Benin and Beti Hohler of Slovenia.Donald Trump ordered cabinet officials todraw up sanctions against the ICCafter the court issuedarrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. They were accused of overseeing an Israeli offensive during the Gaza conflict that caused famine and included the commission of war crimes.Two of the sanctioned judges authorised the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, and two authorised an ICC investigation into abuses by US personnel in Afghanistan.“As ICC judges, these four individuals have actively engaged in the ICC’s illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America or our close ally, Israel,” Rubio said. “The ICC is politicized and falsely claims unfettered discretion to investigate, charge, and prosecute nationals of the United States and our allies. This dangerous assertion and abuse of power infringes upon the sovereignty and national security of the United States and our allies, including Israel.”The decision to move forward with the sanctions will escalate Trump’s feud with the court and other international organisations, which he has broadly dismissed as politicised.The US has already sanctioned the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, because of his role in pursuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. Those sanctions have led Khan to lose access to his email and his bank accounts have been frozen, the Associated Press reported earlier this month. Americans who work for The Hague-based court have been warned that they could be arrested if they set foot on American soil.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right, back row: Reine Alapini-Gansou, Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza and Solomy Balungi Bossa are three of the four ICC judges sanctioned by the US.Photograph: Sem van der Wal/ANP/AFP/Getty ImagesIn a statement, the ICC said it “deplores” the new designations for sanctions.“These measures are a clear attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution which operates under the mandate from 125 states parties from all corners of the globe,” the ICC said.“Targeting those working for accountability does nothing to help civilians trapped in conflict,” the statement continued. “It only emboldens those who believe they can act with impunity. These sanctions are not only directed at designated individuals, they also target all those who support the court, including nationals and corporate entities of states parties. They are aimed against innocent victims in all situations before the court, as well as the rule of law, peace, security and the prevention of the gravest crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.”Danya Chaikel, the International Federation for Human Rights’s representative to the ICC, said the types of sanctions imposed by theTrump administrationwere originally designed to “disrupt terrorist networks like ISIS, weapons traffickers, and human rights abusers, not international justice institutions.”“Using them against ICC officials represents a dangerous misuse of executive power and distorts their purpose … It sends the chilling message that enforcing accountability for mass atrocities can get you punished, while allegedly committing international crimes may get you protected.James Goldston, executive director of the Open Society’s justice initiative and a former ICC prosecutor, said: “As a court of last resort, the ICC is the one place victims of the most serious crimes can turn to when other avenues have failed them in their search for truth and justice. These new designations of ICC judges threaten their hopes and embolden the perpetrators. Sanctions against ICC officials are a betrayal of America’s proud commitment to the rule of law and international justice.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyInternational criminal courtTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Theformer political alliestraded threats and insults through posts on their respective social media platforms throughout the afternoon as the company’s price fell.Trump suggested on Truth Social that he could cut Musk’s government subsidies and contracts, of which bothTeslaand SpaceX have been immense beneficiaries. Musk meanwhile threatened to decommission the SpaceX spacecraft that Nasa relies on for transport missions, called for Trump’s impeachment, derided the president’s signature tariffs and accused him of being affiliated with the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Musk said late Thursday evening his company will not decommission its spacecraft.Musk calls for Trump to be impeached as extraordinary feud escalatesRead moreThe decline in Tesla’s share price on Thursday knocked about $8.73bn off Musk’s total net worth,according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The reported $152bndropalso decreased the value of the company to roughly $900bn.Tesla has struggled throughout the year amid declining sales and buyers around the world rejecting the automaker due to Musk’s association with far-right politics. Stock traders who had shorted Tesla shares made billions amid the spat, perthe Wall Street Journal.The blow-up is an unexpected and dramatic escalation of a growing rift between two of the world’s most powerful men. Musk had donated about $275m to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and served as the leader of the cost-cutting “department of government efficiency” (Doge) for months at the president’s beck and call. It also puts increased investor scrutiny on how the clash could affect Musk’s business empire, with his companies such as Tesla facing potential retribution in the form of canceled government deals or increased regulatory oversight.The rift began after Musk recentlyopposed the administration’s new taxbill that eliminates electric vehicle tax credits and would add an expected $2.3tn to the deficit, in effect nullifying the limited “savings” Doge claimed to find. Musk was also reportedly upset about being increasingly iced out of the Trump administration and having the nomination of his preferred candidate to lead Nasa pulled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products. Our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined … During the conversation, President Xi graciously invited the First Lady and me to visitChina, and I reciprocated.”Trump added that teams from the US and China would meet soon at a location to be determined.The Chinese foreign ministry said Trump initiated the call, which was only the second time this year the two leaders had spoken one to one. They previously spoke in January, before Trump’s inauguration.The discussion followed posts on social media by Trump that praised the Chinese leader but also suggested it was difficult to reach a deal with him.Trump’s 50% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum come into effectRead moreTrade negotiations between the US and Chinastalledshortly after an agreement between the countries on 12 May to reduce 145% import tariffs on China imposed by Washington, and Beijing’s 125% tariffs on US imports in a tit-for-tat exchange.The agreement allowed for a reduction in tariffs during a 90-day moratorium before talks to resolve differences, especially over the export of Chinese rare earth metals, which are crucial to making electric cars and mobile phones.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, will represent the US side in negotiations.Trump is under pressure to resolve the dispute with China after a series of weak economic figures that showed a sharp slowdown in US growth and a reluctance among private companies to hire staff.

It is developing the artificial intelligence software that would power the robots but will use hardware developed by other companies.The indoor obstacle course being used for the tests at an Amazon office in San Francisco is about the size of a coffee shop, the report said, with the company hoping the robots will be able to travel in Amazon’sRivian vansand make deliveries from them.Even with a human driver behind the wheel, a robot could theoretically speed up drop-off times by visiting one address while the human employee delivers to another. Amazon also has an interest in self-driving vehicles through its Zoox unit.Amazon has more than 20,000 Rivians in the US and has placed one of the vans in the humanoid testing zone, according to the report. Once it has tested the robots in the humanoid park, it plans to take them on “field trips” in the real world where they will attempt to deliver packages to homes.Amazon has already conducted trials with humanoid robots, deploying devices developed by the US company Agility Robotics in its warehouses. The chief executive of Agility, Peggy Johnson,told the Guardian last yearthat the company’s Digit robot allowed employees to hand off work to humanoids and become a “robot manager”.Last year Amazon was given permission to test-fly drones beyond a human controller’s line of sight in the UK,paving the way for using the technology in home delivery.Prof Subramanian Ramamoorthy, the chair of robot learning and autonomy at the University of Edinburgh, said Amazon had a respected robotics team and its reported focus on “last mile” delivery was not a surprise. The humanoid robot hardware capable of carrying out such a task is becoming available and the field is developing rapidly, he said. However, he added, the challenge was to achieve reliable performance outside highly constrained environments such as the reported “humanoid park”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lesbian was hired for the job instead, and Ames was eventually demoted to a lower position with lower pay, with a gay man taking her previous role.The dispute centered on how plaintiffs like Ames must try to prove a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, national origin and sex – including sexual orientation.Some judges require that those in so-called reverse discrimination cases prove that an employer has a history of discriminating against a majority group, what are known as “background circumstances” that place a higher bar for those from a majority group trying to argue a discrimination case.When the case appeared in front of the US circuit court of appeals, the judges initially rejected Ames’s claims, saying that she failed to demonstrate such background circumstances, and needed to show evidence that those within a minority group had made the discriminatory decisions. Those who were in charge of hiring and demoting Ames were also straight.US supreme court backs Catholic charity group in unemployment taxes caseRead moreBut the supreme court was willing to put this reasoning to a test, with an appetite to rethink what “reverse discrimination” actually means.In a statement toNBC News, Xiao Wang, one of Ames’s lawyers, said that they were “pleased that this is the end of quite a long journey”.“This was a major legal hurdle in front of her. This is something she is incredibly pleased about,” Wang said.The case comes amid broad-based attacks from the federal government under the Trump administration’s campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, or DEI, in American society, which has become a powerful flashpoint among conservatives in recent years.After the supreme courtruled affirmative actionin higher education unconstitutional in 2023, the conservative groups who advocated for the ruling set their sights on the workplace, vowing to end diversity measures set by employers. Over the last two years,dozens of casesthat aim to dismantle DEI policies in the workplace have flooded courts around the country.At the start of his second term, Donald TrumpbannedDEI within the federal government, firing hundreds of employees who the administration deemed had DEI roles throughout various departments and agencies and cutting major programs that promoted diversity. The administration has also targeted universities for federal funding cuts for having DEI programs.Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is liberal-leaning, wrote for the court on Thursday morning: “We conclude that Title VII does not impose such a heightened standard on majority group plaintiffs. Therefore, the judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded for application of the proper prima facie standard.”In other words, the bar for discrimination against a historical majority group is not any higher than minority groups, which could make winning reverse discrimination cases in the future easier for future plaintiffs.In aninterviewwith the Washington Post earlier this year, Ames said that when she filed her discrimination claim, she did not know “that my burden was going to be harsher than somebody else’s burden to prove my case”.“I want people to try and understand that we’re trying to make this a level playing field for everyone. Not just for a white woman in Ohio.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOhioUS politicsDiscrimination at worknewsShareReuse this content"

Procter & Gamble will also end sales of some of its products in certain markets. Procter & Gamble said it will provide more details about that in July.Like many companies, Procter & Gamble is dealing with American consumers who are worrying about their spending as they keep an eye on inflation.US consumer sentiment fell slightly in May for the fifth straight month, surprising economists. The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s closely watched consumer sentiment index declined 2.7% on a monthly basis to 50.8, the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. The only lower reading was in June 2022. Since January, sentiment has tumbled nearly 30%.And on Wednesday the Congressional Budget Office releasedan analysisthat saidDonald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8trn in a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.Baked into the CBO analysis is a prediction that households would ultimately buy less from countries hit with added tariffs. The budget office estimates that the tariffs would increase the average annual rate of inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026.In April Procter & Gamble noted during a conference call that the biggest US tariff impacts were coming from raw and packaging materials and some finished product sourced from China. The company said that it would be looking at sourcing options and productivity improvements to mitigate the tariff impact, but that it may also have to raise prices on some products.That same month, the Consumer Brands Association, which represents big food companies like Coca-Cola and General Mills as well as consumer product makers like Procter & Gamble, warned that although its businesses make most of their goods in the US, they now face tariffs on critical ingredients – like wood pulp for toilet paper or cinnamon – that must be imported because of domestic scarcity.Explore more on these topicsProcter & GambleTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

On top of this, Boeing has already paid $243m of a $487.2m criminal penalty agreed in 2021.Sanjiv Singh, the counsel for family members of some of the victims of the plane crash in Indonesia in 2018, told the BBC the deal allowed Boeing to “sidestep true criminal accountability”.The aerospace company has previously said it was “deeply sorry” for the families’ losses and was committed to honouring the memories of the victims by pursuing broad and deep changes within the business.If the deal is approved by a federal judge, the fraud charge in the criminal case against Boeingwill be dismissed.Two Boeing planes crashed off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019. Many relatives of the victims have spent years pursuing a public trial, more severe penalties for Boeing and the prosecution of former company officials.In October 2018, 189 people were killed whenLion Air flight 610 fellinto the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019,Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashedshortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa airport, which killed 157 people.Both incidents were linked to faulty flight control systems. The second crash prompted the grounding of the 737 Max plane for almost two years.The company avoided prosecution in 2021 after it reached a settlement with the US DoJ, which included the $243.6m fine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring what may have been a lengthy public trial.However, in December, the US district judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worthrejected the deal. The judge said the diversity, equity and inclusion policies in government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in picking an independent monitor to oversee Boeing’s compliance with the agreement. Boeing was approached for comment.A company spokesperson told the BBC regarding the new agreement with the DoJ: “Boeing is committed to complying with its obligations under this resolution, which include a substantial additional fine and commitments to further institutional improvements and investments.”Explore more on these topicsBoeingAerospace industryAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

On-again, off-againtrade tariffsimplemented by Donald Trump, which precipitatedpre-order delaysfrom Nintendo, made the 5 June release date of the highly coveted hardware feel more like a hope than a certainty. A potential price hike up from $450 loomed over launch day, but would-be buyers’ fears did not come to fruition.Nintendo’s Switch 2 is the upgrade of my dreams – but it’s not as ‘new’ as some might hopeRead moreNintendo’s maneuvering around Trump’s tariffs isn’t over, though – far from it. The Japanese console maker managed to luckily launch its device squarely within a90-day tariff pauseissued by the president. If tariffs on countries such as India and Japan return to the levels proposed during Trump’s “liberation day” speech at the start of April, however, experts say Nintendo will have to limber up for yet another delicate trade policy dance.It’s possible that a Switch 2 bought during the holiday season will cost more than it did at launch date. Nintendo’s top gaming hardware competitors – and essentially anyone shipping electronics to the US – have been watching the Switch 2 saga with bated breath.“What saved Nintendo in this case was that Trump chickened out,”Notre Dame professor and international economist Robert Johnsonsaid.Vietnam tariffs forced Nintendo to scrambleSince its launch in March 2017, the Switch has become one of the best-selling video game consoles in history, with more than 150m units sold worldwide. Nintendo teased its successor in January and gave a full reveal during an 2 Aprillive stream, announcing the device would ship on 5 June with a hefty $450 price tag in the US (or $500 when bundled with Mario Kart World). Just hours later, Trumpstepped up to a podium at the Rose Garden, chart in tow, to announce a new volley of tariffs on imports on countries with a trade deficit with the US.Among them: a 24% tariff on Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered, and a 46% tariff on Vietnam, where the bulk of its Switch manufacturing takes place. Stock marketsplummetedas Nintendo fans collectively wondered whether the company would pass the costs of those steep duties on to them.US pre-orders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin later that week on 9 April. Nintendo delayed that date so it could “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions”. The 5 June release date, the company noted, would stay the same. Gamersflockedtovarious social media sitesto vent their frustration – much of it directed not at Nintendo, but at the Trump administration. Pre-orders resumed on 24 April and, predictably, the console quickly sold out.Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for commentPrepared for the wrong tariffs, saved by ‘taco’Johnson notes that Nintendo, like many other consumer electronics makers, has spent years grappling with the question of where to produce.In 2019, during the tail end of the first Trump administration, the gaming company began shifting production of the Switch from China to Vietnam in an effort to sidestep US tariffs on Chinese imports. Nintendo still manufactures some Switch products in China, but those units are typically shipped to non-US markets. Other major consumer tech companies, such as Apple, havesimilarly moved parts of their manufacturingoperations from China to countries such as India to mitigate tariff impacts.View image in fullscreenGamers wait in line outside the New York Nintendo store.Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesThat strategy was ultimately rendered moot when the current administration announced a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, an unexpected move that Johnson says “caught virtually everyone off-guard”. These looming tariffs, and the uncertainty surrounding them, could affect the pricing dynamics of nearly any consumer tech product entering the US.Sony and Microsoft,both expected to release new consoles in 2027, will likely face similar challenges as Nintendo.“It takes a long time and significant capital outlays to bring new production facilities online. Producers really like to operate in a stable environment.” Johnson said. “The current trade environment is the exact opposite of that.”The “liberation day” tariffs could easily have led to a higher Switch 2 price or a delayed release. But Nintendo managed to avoid that fate thanks to backpedaling by the Trump administration, a behavior described by the Financial Times using the acronym “taco” – short for “Trump always chickens out”. Trump’s call for a 90-day pause on tariffs to allow negotiations with targeted countries meant the Switch 2 could still be released during a window in which the import taxes wouldn’t apply.And even if negotiations with Vietnam ultimately fail, reports estimate Nintendo hasalready shipped around 746,000Switch 2 units to the US, which would not be subject to the higher tariffs.Pricier add-onsNintendo consumers will not walk away unscathed by tariffs. The company has said accessories for its device, a major part of the Switch’s dual form factor, will “experience price adjustments”. So far,according to CNBC, docks used to play the Switch on a full-size screen will cost $10 more than before, while straps for the two controllers will see a $1 increase. Johnson also said he wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo considers raising the console’s price around the holiday season, especially if Trump moves forward with a 46% tariff on Vietnam.“I find it difficult to imagine that the Trump administration will want thousands of stories written during the holiday season about how Trump ruined Christmas,” Johnson said. “So I expect they’ll find a way to climb down, but – like everyone else – I’m not sure about that.”But there’s another reason why Nintendo may have an incentive to keep console prices from climbing too high: themajority of its revenuedoesn’t come from physical console sales. Increasingly, the real moneymakers – for Nintendo and its competitors – are software and online subscriptions, neither of which are subject to tariffs.“In the end, Nintendo wants to sell consoles to get people to buy games and accessories,” Johnson said. “As a result, it may be willing to hold down the price of consoles.”Explore more on these topicsNintendo SwitchTrump tariffsGamesTariffsNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Rodgershad given mixed signalsabout whether he wants to continue his career.Bradshaw: Steelers should leave Rodgers to ‘chew on bark and whisper to gods’Read more“I’m in a different phase of my life,” Rodgerssaid in April. “To make a commitment to a team is a big thing. And I don’t think it’s fair to the Steelers or anyone while I’m dealing with a lot off the field.”Whatever those issues were appear to have been resolved, but the Steelers will not get the version of Rodgers who once cut a swathe through theNFLin his prime with the Green Bay Packers, winning four league MVP awards and a Super Bowl along the way. Rodgers’s tenure with the Jets was brief and rocky. After a torn achilles ended his 2023 debut after just four snaps, he returned in 2024 to start all 17 games. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. The team sputtered to a 3-7 record in one-score games.Rodgers’s hesitation over signing a contract had irritated many around the Steelers, including Terry Bradshaw, who led the team to four Super Bowl titles during his playing career.“That’s a joke. That to me is just a joke,” Bradshaw said last month of the Steelers’ prolonged pursuit of Rodgers. “What are you going to do? Bring him in for one year, are you kidding me?”Without Rodgers, the Steelers would probably start Mason Rudolph, who recently rejoined the team from the Tennessee Titans. However, Rudolph was a modest quarterback at best during his first stint with the team.If Rodgers does end up as the Steelers’ starter he will face a familiar foe in Week 1: Pittsburgh are scheduled to play the Jets in their season opener.Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersPittsburgh SteelersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I was mentally prepared that it was to be 99% for her so I was trying to block it out,” said Gauff.Addressing the crowd, she added: “When you were saying her name, I was saying my name to myself just to psyche myself.”Djokovic has nowhere to hide against relentless Sinner in Paris showdownRead moreBoisson knocked out third seed Jessica Pegula and sixth-ranked Mirra Andreeva on her way to the semi-final. But world No 2 Gauff eased to a composed 6-1, 6-2 victory to set upa showdown with Aryna Sabalenkain the final.Boisson looked like she had finally run out of energy against Gauff. But the American paid tribute to her 22-year-old opponent, who she believes can compete at the top of the sport going forward.“Lois is an incredible player and for her to have the tournament she’s had, she’s shown she’s one of the best players in the world,” said Gauff. “I hope we have many more battles in the future, especially here, Today it was just my day.”Gauff, who can become the first American since Serena Williams in 2015 to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup, clearly shifted up a gear after beating compatriot Madison Keys in an error-strewn quarter-final on Wednesday.Her forehand was solid again, her backhand mesmerizing at times and she served consistently throughout. Boisson, on the other hand, made an unusual number of unforced errors as her opponent repeatedly forced her to go for the extra shot.Gauff raced to a 4-0 lead under the Court Philippe Chatrier roof and never looked back, breaking to love at 3-2 in the second set right after Boisson broke her serve for the first time. The American was on an eight-point winning streak and at the change of ends at 5-2, Boisson placed her towel over her head and hit herself in frustration.“It’s always the plan to start strong,” said Gauff. “I knew it was important today. She’s an incredible player, she proved to be one of the best players in the world, especially on clay. I’m sure we’ll have more battles in the future.”The first Frenchwoman to reach the last four at Roland Garros since Marion Bartoli in 2011, Boisson bowed out when she sent yet another forehand long. She does have some consolation though: she will rocket up the rankings and has earned $789,000 for her run to the semi-finals, eclipsing her previous career earnings of $148,000.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Coco GauffFrench OpenUS sportsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

We take security concerns extremely seriously, we want people to be able to go to the World Cup and do so safely.”The order claims at various points that the restrictions are a response to supposed deficiencies in each country’s own vetting procedures. Pressed on Thursday on what relevance other country’s procedures had on the US’s ability to vet immigrants themselves, Pigott declined to elaborate.Nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will be “fully” restricted from entering the US, according to Wednesday’s proclamation. Meanwhile, the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will be partly restricted. The order is set to go into effect on 9 June.The order does contain an exceptionfor “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, travelling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state.” However, that exception does not explicitly cover a number of specific cases or situations that will be relevant for players from affected countries who intend to play in the United States.First, the exception does not specify whether the “World Cup” referred to in the order includes theClub World Cup, which starts this month and is being hosted by the US. Asked by the Guardian whether the Club World Cup – in which a number of players from the banned countries are due to play – was included in the exception, a state department spokesperson declined to comment other than to say they would not get into hypotheticals or specific cases.Fifa also declined to comment to the Guardian when asked about this distinction and whether the organization was involved in lobbying Trump to carve out this exception as part of the travel ban.The definition of “major event” is also left open to interpretation, making it unclear whether or not this summer’s Gold Cup qualifies. That tournament, the regional soccer championship for North and Central America and the Caribbean will feature Haiti, who are scheduled to play the United States in Austin, Texas on 19 June in addition to group games in San Diego, California and Arlington, Texas.A spokesperson for Concacaf, the confederation that oversees the Gold Cup, did not respond to a request for comment.

The P-1 visa most often issued to professional soccer players inMLS, the NWSL and other leagues is not listed among those who qualify for the exception, but specific type of banned visas are specified for individual countries in the order.Venezuela, for example, has various types of B, F, M and J visas that are banned under the order. That means that the order does not impact P-1 visas issued to nationals of Venezuela. MLS currently has three players on international duty with Venezuela. One, the San Jose Earthquakes’ Josef Martínez, became a US citizen last year. The other two, Inter Miami’s Telasco Segovia and LAFC’s David Martínez, are recent arrivals to MLS and do not yet have permanent residency. Venezuela are set to play a World Cup qualifier on Thursday night against Bolivia, and are scheduled for another at Uruguay on Tuesday 10 June – one day after the ban is set to be enforced.An MLS spokesperson declined to elaborate when asked if there were concerns about the Venezuelan players’ immigration status.

Another night to enjoy, and the promise that there may be many more to come. The European champions made their way to Munich where they will defend theirNations Leaguetitle thanks to a 5-4 victory over France which left something more than just the result in Stuttgart.It may not be so absurd to imagine thatthisSpaincould matchthatone, although there are lessons to be learnt at the back. Just as it may not be so absurd to suggest that the 17-year-old in their team is notgoingto be the best, he already is. If this was an audition for the Ballon d’Or against Ousmane Dembélé and Kylian Mbappé, as many said, the award is Lamine Yamal’s.Spain v France: Nations League semi-final – liveRead moreNor is Lamine Yamal alone. He scored two, his every touch a threat, but by the time he did Spain had already scored twice, through Nico Williams and Mikel Merino. And between his brace, Pedri, a player who does everything with a kind of ethereal ease, added a lovely fourth. Spain weren’t alone either:Franceplayed their part in making this so good, racking up 24 of the 40 shots and making a match of this. Down 5-1 after 67 minutes, a belter from Rayan Cherki, an own goal from Dani Vivian and a Randal Kolo Muani header on 79, 84, and 93 minutes respectively contributed to a special and sometimes silly occasion, infusing it with a tension no one had anticipated 20 minutes earlier.That said, this wasn’t just a late flurry from nowhere; it had been fun from the very start, a game that was open and played at pace, the shot count rising almost as swiftly as the players were moving. Theo Hernández clipping the bar while Unai Simón and Mike Maignan both made saves, as if the teams were taking it in turns, before Spain took the lead on 22 minutes. They did so as France had begun briefly to assert themselves, the balance tilting their way, Désiré Doué and Adrien Rabiot both having decent shooting opportunities, and Pedri forced to shift deeper to wrest back some control.View image in fullscreenNico Williams celebrates scoring his first goal by dancing with Dean Huijsen (left).Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersIn the first prolonged passage of Spanish possession the ball was worked to Lamine Yamal, who played in a crisp pass to Mikel Oyarzabal on the edge of the six-yard box. Back to goal, he held off Ibrahima Konaté and neatly nudged it to his right where Williams smashed it into the roof of the net. A superb second came three minutes later, beginning at Robin Le Normand’s feet. Again, Oyarzabal’s awareness and subtleness of touch was the pivot upon which it turned. Merino received, found Oyarzabal and spun; Oyarzabal returned it to him and he finished low into the net.Spain’s lead was maintained by the strong hand of Simón, who saved from Doué, Mbappé and Dembélé. Then just before half-time it appeared to have been extended when a lovely free-kick routine, touched by Pedri, clipped in by Lamine Yamal and set up by Martín Zubimendi’s header ended with Dean Huijsen’s superb volley. The flag, though, was up.

Lamine gestured to the fans, then took the ball, and his moment, and rolled the penalty into the corner. Checkmate.Only it wasn’t. Spain weren’t stopping there, they were enjoying it too much. A gorgeous touch from Pedri enabled him to glide into space, exchange passes with Williams and lift over Maignan. The superiority was striking now, even if Mbappé did win – now there’s a euphemism – and score a penalty soon after, even if Dembélé hit the post. Because there was Lamine Yamal again, running on to Pedro Porro’s neat volleyed layoff, easing away from Clément Lenglet and poking past Maignan. Now that really was checkmate, or so it seemed.Still France weren’t finished, still the scoring wasn’t either, providing a wild ending if not quite a comeback and it was Lamine Yamal flashing a smile at the end, braces sparkling in the light.Explore more on these topicsNations LeagueSpainFrancematch reportsShareReuse this content"

There’s nothing like an England squad announcement video to get you in the mood for a major tournament. “I hope you can feel it from the streets to the stands, the summer is in the safest hands,” the poet Sophia Thakur tells us, exactly one month out from England’s first game of Euro 2025 against France.The slogan is “It’s time to go again” and the squad is announced by a host of big names, from Maisie Adam, Daisy May Cooper and Keely Hodgkinson, to David Beckham, Alex Scott, Bukayo Saka and Harry Kane.Euro 2025: Sarina Wiegman’s England squad – in picturesRead moreIs the Lionesses’ title defence in the safest hands, though, how strong are those hands andhow much damage has the last week of turmoil done?Sarina Wiegman’s 23-player squad is pretty much what many expected; Lauren James is winning her battle to be fit and ready, according to the manager, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Esme Morgan have received the nod in defence and the youngArsenal forward Michelle Agyemang is the wildcardpick.There are gaps, though. Looking down the list there is a lack of experience in goalwithout Mary Earpsand there are only five named midfielders for the month-long tournament in Switzerland and one of those is Georgia Stanway, who has played only an hour of football since December (45 minutes against Spain on Tuesdayevening and15 minutes against Portugalon Friday night).“We have to announce it as strikers, midfielders and defenders, but you can move players around, into different positions,” said Wiegman. “So it looks like there’s not much depth on paper, but in the team we have enough depth in midfield.”That is true. James can operate at No 10, the captain Leah Williamson and Manchester United defender Maya Le Tissier can operate in the deeper midfield role that Phil Neville also tried Lucy Bronze in, and Lauren Hemp can play more centrally if needed. However, it is hard to look at those possible shifts as anything more than emergency moves given the weakening that would take place in the positions those players would be vacating.View image in fullscreenEngland head coach Sarina Wiegman insists she is happy with her squad and the atmosphere between the players.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThese types of positional changes are not something that Wiegman has experimented with to any great extent. That said, the loss of Keira Walsh to injury and unexpected switch to a back five for England’s final World Cup group game in Australia in 2023 was hugely successful and brought an air of unpredictability to an increasingly predictable team.Theretirement of Fran Kirbyand Earps andwithdrawal from selection of Millie Bright, all for their different reasons, has taken a hefty chunk of experience out of the squad and rocked the narrative around the Lionesses in the past week.In 2022, the air of unity around the home Euros was strong. Players, staff, the public, the media all sang from the same hymn sheet. In 2023 the vibe at the World Cup wasn’t quite as harmonious, theplayers’ dispute with the FA over bonusestaken public, such was their frustration at a lack of progress.This time thebonuses issue has been resolved, but the abrupt departures of Earps, Kirby and Bright just over a month before the tournament, despite the big differences in their nature, has left question marks over squad harmony.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAfter the announcement of the 23-player squad, Wiegman was dismissive of any suggestion of friction in the camp, laughing off any mention of a possible crisis.“That is not the case,” she said. “We know what’s going on in the team. There’s competition going on in the group, and I hope there’s competition going on. We’re going with this 23 to the Euros now and I feel very comfortable with this team, very happy with this team and I’m very excited. For me, it doesn’t feel like a crisis at all.”Crisis may be way too strong a word, but the sky is definitely a little less blue and a little more overcast over England. Why did Earps not want to stay and fight, or at least usher the next generation through a major tournament? How did we reach a point where Bright’s mental and physical health have been so eroded that she has had to step back? There is work to be done here. A holistic approach to player welfare must be a priority.Wiegman was praised by players for her straight-talking approach and for providing clarity on positions and strategy when she first came into the head coach role in the run-in to the Euros in 2022. It is inevitable, though, that that approach will be potentially fractious when the news is less good.“For me, it’s really important that I am honest and that I treat people in the right way,” said Wiegman. “Sometimes you have very good news, sometimes you don’t have good news, I don’t go around the bush about that. I just give the message, I can’t control how people respond to that. I just hope they have clarity and we can move on.”The nature of the conversations between Earps and Wiegman, or Kirby and the manager after she was told she would not be going to Switzerland, or how aware Wiegman was that Bright was struggling will remain, of course, unknown. Now, though, it is time to move on. The impact on the defending champions of the last week will only show come the end of July.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen's footballEuropean ChampionshipcommentShareReuse this content"

Which is a pity as he is spending a warm-weather training week withEnglandat the magnificent Camiral Golf & Wellness resort; the expected venue for the 2031 Ryder Cup.Formula One. Palmer attended the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday with Thomas Tuchel and the rest of the England squad, which he thought was good. “I went to the one in Abu Dhabi not long ago,” he says, presumably meaning the race in Bahrain or Saudi Arabia. Who knows, who cares? “But I fell asleep at that one.”Eberechi Eze on his bike as England’s World Cup 2026 preparations heat upRead moreThe searing heat in the US, which Palmer will experience with Chelsea in the coming weeks at the Club World Cup. And then again next summer if and when England qualify for the World Cup, which is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico. “It will play a part because I’m not used to it, but I don’t think it will be a big problem,” he says.Oh, and southerners. Manchester’s finest made a comment last summer about how he was finding them hard work after his first season at Chelsea. Has he come to terms with them now? “No, they’re all still moody,” he says. “I think because it’s so busy, they’re all stressed. It must be a southern thing. I don’t live in central London. Sometimes I go in but I couldn’t live there.”If Palmer is a unique talent on the pitch, he is unique to interview as well. Short shrift is his default setting; plenty of his answers are monosyllabic, some just a sound: hmmm. A shrug. It is impossible to ignore the quintessentially Manc vibe.Palmer has a deadpan expression which wonders: “Why are you asking methat?” Example: how is he spending his downtime at the Camiral? “Play PlayStation … Fifa,” he replies. Like, seriously? As on the pitch, Palmer is cool, cold. He is highly entertaining.When was the last time Palmer was angry? “Errr,” he says, after a typically long pause. “I don’t really know. Maybe when I’m playing PlayStation. I’m not just a robot like you guys in the media think I am … and don’t show no emotion. Obviously when there’s no cameras and I’m on the phone to my mates and I’m doing stuff I enjoy doing …”Palmer is asked where his temperament comes from. “Maybe my dad,” he says. “He’s laid-back like me. My mum says: ‘Try and be a bit more involved and a bit more smiley and energetic.’ Maybe she’s like that but me and my dad are just too laid-back, I think.”View image in fullscreenCole Palmer (right) with his England teammate Morgan Rogers at the Spanish Grand Prix this week.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAAnd yet no one in the room at the Camiral, which is dominated by a beautiful Jack Nicklaus watercolour, can fail to be struck by Palmer’s single-mindedness; the steel and hunger. It is there when he talks about Chelsea, how they proved the doubters wrong in the closing weeks of the domestic season to secure a return to the Champions League, sewing up qualification withthe final-day victoryat Nottingham Forest.“Because we had that little spell where we weren’t too great … everyone was saying: ‘They’re not going to get Champions League,’” Palmer says. “So to get it was good. We finished well. When we got it at Forest, it was like a relief.”Palmer has a Champions League winners’ medal from 2022-23 with Manchester City, although he was an unused substitute in the final against Inter; indeed, he did not get off the bench in any of the knockout rounds. He has made only one start in the competition: in City’s dead-rubber final group tie that season, against Sevilla. This time, with Palmer having turbocharged his profile and influence, it stands to be different.“I always say that I don’t feel like a Champions League winner,” Palmer says. “It doesn’t really mean anything to me. When people say it … yeah, but I didn’t play, I wasn’t involved. Obviously I played in the group and stuff like that but it’s not the same, is it? I’ve still got the medal, I’ve not thrown it away. But it’s not like I feel like I’ve won it.”Palmer’s focus is on England. Having missed Tuchel’s first camp in March because of injury, he is determined to impress in Saturday’s World Cup qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona. There is then the friendly against Senegal in Nottingham next Tuesday.The issue for Tuchel is how best to accommodate Palmer when he also has Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden. It is the same issue that his predecessor Gareth Southgate faced; ditto Lee Carsley, who was in interim charge before Tuchel took over.View image in fullscreenPalmer chats with the England head coach, Thomas Tuchel, in Catalonia.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesSouthgate never started Palmer in a competitive game. He used him exclusively off the bench at Euro 2024 where the 23-year-old came on to score the equaliser in the final against Spain, a game thatEngland would lose 2-1. Palmer has 11 caps to date, four as a starter. Foden has missed out on this camp because of injury.“It’s play well at my club … hopefully people can see it and I can turn into a starter for England,” Palmer says. “Last season I played all wide [in midfield] and this season I’ve moved [more centrally]. Wherever he [Tuchel] puts me, I’ll play.”Palmer’s goal against Spain was the perfect illustration of his ability to live in the moment and seize it, oblivious to the pressure. It was a similar story in Chelsea’s Conference Leaguefinal winover Real Betis last week, albeit the stakes were not as high. One-nil down, Palmer said he was “sick of going backwards and sideways”. So he trusted his skill, ran at Betis and made it happen with two assists. Chelsea won 4-1.Palmer is back on the up after an unfathomable dry spell from mid-January when he went 18 matches without a goal. The run ended with the penalty against Liverpool in the fourth-last game of the Premier League season. He finished with 15 goals and 12 assists in all competitions.“Things weren’t happening for me and it went on a bit longer than I thought it would,” Palmer says. “But I spoke to people about it and they explained it’s going to happen. They said that when I get out of it, I’ll be an even better player. When you go to Chelsea and you jump up and then you go into a dip, you think: ‘What’s going on?’ But I didn’t mind …”Palmer catches himself, and there is a rare line from him before he remembers who he is. “Well, obviously, I did mind,” he says. “But I didn’t think: ‘Ah, this is the end of the world.’”Explore more on these topicsEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The more serious aspect is the extent to which McTominay has turned heads at a new club.“I think he went over there with a point to prove,” said the Liverpool full-back. “I think he wanted to prove Man United wrong and prove people in the Premier League wrong. He has gone over there and done that pretty successfully. That’s credit to him, credit to his attitude and his determination to be the best version of himself. Now he is a king over there.“At Man United he probably lacked getting that run of games consistently, he was in and out and things like that. He probably didn’t get the respect he deserves. Then he goes over there, puts in a magnificent season and fair play to him to end it with the league title.“Even before he was atNapoli, his standards for Scotland were unbelievable. He’s getting better and better, he has taken it to a whole new level.”View image in fullscreenMcTominay and his Scotland teammates in training before their friendly against Iceland.Photograph: Colin Poultney/ProSports/ShutterstockRobertson has just won another Premier League title. Yet it is an indication of McTominay’s standing that it is he, rather than Robertson, who is on everyone’s lips as Scotland prepare to host Iceland in a friendly.Robertson and his manager, Steve Clarke, are keen to shine a spotlight on Billy Gilmour. The former Chelsea and Brighton midfielder was also part of Napoli’s history-making squad. “It’s impossible to overlook Billy because he’s been excellent since he went over there,” added Robertson.“Billy was talking about how if he goes out in Naples he can walk about a bit more freely, while Scotty is surrounded. Everyone knows how passionate their fans are so for them to love one of ours, it’s pretty special for Scotland too. They love Billy too so credit to the both of them for going over there, being successful and winning the trophy.”Clarke was always an advocate of McTominay and Gilmour setting sail for Serie A. The Scotland manager was typically to the point when asked why it has worked out so well. “Just confidence, confidence in their own ability,” Clarke said. “The answer is that short. They’ve both got big confidence in their own ability and they’ve showcased their talent in a different league. No surprise to me.”It is a nod to the togetherness of this Scotland squad that McTominay, Gilmour and Robertson have not shunned two June friendly games after championship celebrations. The Scots travel to Liechtenstein on Monday.“I thought the decision of the two boys to go to Napoli was really brave, as it was for Lewis Ferguson back in the day to go to Bologna,” Clarke said. “Lewis has obviously been there a little bit longer and to be the captain of the Bologna team that lifts the Italian cup is amazing.“The two boys going to Napoli, it’s just like a dream, to make that decision to go abroad and to end up winning Serie A against a really top Inter team. I think the last month of the season, everybody in Scotland became a Napoli fan, we were all so desperate for them to win the title. And they did.“It was nice of Scott to turn up on the last day of the season and score another goal. Billy played that game as well and was outstanding. So Scott’s been the one that’s grabbed the headlines, but that’s not to forget Billy, who was there when they needed him when [Stanislav] Lobotka was out injured. He never let his side down. Well played both of them.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandNapoliManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

And to compound matters, Blitzer’s Danish club Brøndby have qualified for the Conference League, so the prospect of the FA Cup winners dropping into that competition is also not an option due to the European governing body’s multi-club ownership rules.John Textor seeks sale of Crystal Palace stake in bid to avoid European banRead morePalace executives, including Textor and the chairman, Steve Parish, metUefaofficials in Nyon on Tuesday to try to broker a solution without reaching agreement. The Guardian has learned that the so-called blind trust option in which Textor’s Palace shares would be placed in the hands of trustees next season was rejected by Uefa, as the club missed the deadline for registering the trust.Manchester City and Manchester United both used blind trusts to ensure compliance with Uefa multi-club rules last season after their partner clubs, Girona and Nice, also qualified for the Champions League and Europa League respectively, while the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, alsotransferred his shareswhen Nuno Espírito Santo’s side and his Greek club Olympiakos looked on course to qualify for next season’s Champions League.However, Uefa rules state that such ownership changes must take place before 1 March to take effect in time for the following season, with Palace told this week that they will not be shown any flexibility. European qualification was not on the agenda for Palace before March, as they were mid-table in the Premier League and had not progressed beyond the FA Cup fifth round.Palace are in danger of paying a heavy price for their lack of foresight, leading to considerable frustration at Uefa’s lack of flexibility.Uefa declined to comment, but sources at the European governing body stressed that given more than 300 clubs take part in its competitions each season, it has to ensure that the regulations are applied consistently.Textor told the Daily Mail after Tuesday’s meeting that he is looking to sell his 45% stake in Palace, but there is little realistic prospect of that happening in time to influence Uefa’s decision, with the Europa League qualifying draw due to take place on 17 June.View image in fullscreenJohn Textor bought a 40% stake in Lyon back in 2022.Photograph: Allili Mourad/SIPA/ShutterstockOnly three weeks ago, on the eve of the FA Cup final, the Guardian revealed that Textor was seeking tobuy out his fellow American shareholders, Blitzer and Josh Harris, who own 36% of the club between them.The two parties have previously held talks about buying each other out, but have never got close to an agreement on price.

In addition to his 45% stake, Textor has 25% equal voting rights with Parish, Blitzer and Harris, and is known to have played a key role in the appointment of the manager, Oliver Glasner, last year. Textor has declined to comment.Uefa rules make clear that any influence at two clubs in the same competition is prohibited. “No one may simultaneously be involved in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration, and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a Uefa club competition,” the regulations state.“No individual or legal entity may have control or influence over more than one club participating in a Uefa club competition, (including) holding a majority of the shareholders’ voting rights; having the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the club; being a shareholder and alone controlling a majority of the shareholders’ voting rights pursuant to an agreement entered into with other shareholders of the club; or being able to exercise by any means a decisive influence in the decision-making of the club.”In the event of Palace being barred from the Europa League, Forest could be promoted to take their place after qualifying for the Conference League by finishing seventh in the Premier League. Palace’s rivals Brighton, who finished eighth, could then replace Forest in the Conference League.Palace’s European position is under threat rather than Lyon’s, as Uefa rules state that the club ranked highest in their domestic championship will be given entry to the competition. Lyon’s sixth-place finish in Ligue 1 gives them precedence over Palace, who came 12th in the Premier League.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceEuropa LeagueUefaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They organised a nine-day camp last month, half of which was at their Vale Resort base on the outskirts of Cardiff, the other half at La Finca resort near Alicante in Spain, to prevent a physical drop off across the team.Bellamy has said the number of squad members playing in the English Football League presents challenges, because the final games of the regular Championship season were on 4 May, more than a month before the visit ofLiechtensteinto Cardiff, for which Wales will be without the Leeds winger Daniel James through illness.Bellamy said such a long break is “not acceptable” for international football and felt the training camp enabled his players’ muscles not to “shut down”. He said: “It’s not designed for international football so we have to interrupt their break but they [the players] completely understand because we need to keep them moving. We have been able to do that and I feel that has been beneficial, especially this week. I feel like we’re in very good shape leading into this one.”The Wales manager, who is unbeaten in eight matches since his first game last September, said his team cannot afford to disrespect Liechtenstein, who are 205th in the Fifa rankings. “Do I understand people looking past it [Friday’s game]? Of course I do,” Bellamy said. “Do I understand that people believe we should win? Of course I do. But I was up late last night, I didn’t sleep. Does that tell you something? I treat every team the same. I’ve watched the same amount of Liechtenstein as I have of everybody else.“I honestly believe if you disrespect the game, it will catch you out. The same messages have been fed to the players as well. We have to be us. Fight for every ball. Recovery runs. Reactions. We have to be consistent no matter who we’re playing against. The top teams are the ones that are consistent.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he’s in the Brazil teamAlexsandro’s road to the top was tough – picking through rubbish, jobs on building sites and being rejected by almost every club in Brazil – but he would not let his family downJosué Seixas and Tom SandersonThu 5 Jun 2025 09.14 EDTShareIn 2021, Alexsandro wrote down five dreams in his notebook: to marry and have children with his wife, to live in a big house, to take his family out of thefavela, to play for a big club and to save some money for his holidays. This year, he has been called up to the Brazil squad for the first time, and now hopes to play at the 2026World Cup. “Now that I’ve turned those human dreams into reality, it is time to work on my professional dreams even more,” says the Lille defender.Alexsandro, who grew up the eldest son of a single mother in a poor family, knew the meaning of the word work. They lived in the Dique II community, a favela to the north of Rio de Janeiro, where they had to find items in the “Rampa”, a rubbish tip, to make ends meet. His whole family worked by recycling things. They picked up plastic, iron and copper, which they sold to make money for food.“Behind my house, many trucks passed with rubble. We manually removed all those stones with a hoe to sell them. That’s also where a lot of my food, clothes and toys came. People often say it is a difficult place but that’s how we lived for many years. It’s not that I didn’t accept it, but I wanted to change that reality. So, from a young age, I was very focused on seeking improvement for my family through football,” he says.Alexsandro never skipped class or training but he worked with every moment of free time he had to provide for his four younger siblings. No training today? OK, let’s work. The weekend? That’s when he had to put in the most effort. “As a brother-father, what do we have to do? Bring sustenance into the house and set good examples for my siblings, who often call me dad today. I worked on construction sites with my uncle; I helped my grandmother sell sweets on the train. I worked as a counter attendant, serving people. I also sold fish.“I often worked instead of playing or being on the street doing any other nonsense. A dignified way to live, right? I brought sustenance into the house. And having that responsibility was super natural for me. Of course, it’s difficult. There’s that weight, but today I can deal with it very well.”He joined his first club, Bonsucesso, at 13 years old. After a good tournament, he landed a move to Flamengo, where he was in the youth sides alongside Vinicius Junior, who he met again last season whenLille beat Real Madrid in the Champions League. He left Flamengo in 2016 as he wanted to play first-team football but ended up going from club to club without signing a permanent contract.“I went to eight or nine clubs,” he says. “My first evaluation was at Internacional. I didn’t make it so I went back home. I went to Grêmio, did a trial and passed. I trained with the squad but, after two months of training, they released me. In Avaí, the same situation; they let me go after two months as well.“So that’s when the thought of giving up comes. You try once, twice, three, four times. When things don’t happen, you start to lose hope. That dream becomes more distant. I went to Palmeiras, Botafogo twice, Fluminense, Vasco. And all those clubs also rejected me. So it’s normal to think about giving up.”View image in fullscreenAlexsandro playing for Lille in the Champions League.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesAlexsandro’s next chance was at Resende, one of the smaller clubs in Rio. After a solid campaign, the defender went to Fluminense but everything happened the same way as before: he was promised a contract, two months passed and then came another rejection. That was the last straw.“I had taken so many hits, so many rejections. I thought about giving up but when I got home I saw my family’s situation and knew deep down that only I could change that situation. And in the end, I was right. That voice inside me said I couldn’t give up because of them. I would see my brother with all those difficulties. We didn’t have the basics at home. Many times there was no rice, no food to eat. Many times we wanted to go out and had no clothes, no money, nothing.Carlo Ancelotti and the vibes of Brazil: a match made in football heaven?Read more“In my house, there was no shower. We had to use a bucket to throw water on ourselves. I didn’t give up on football because of them, because I wanted to change that situation. And, in the end, God sent me an angel.”That angel is Leo Percovich, a youth coach at Fluminense, and the only one who believed in Alexsandro. He went to Praiense, a club on the Azores in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and asked the defender to join him. After two years, Alexsandro earned a move to Amora, and then to Chaves, both on mainland Portugal. This whole time, he did not see his family in person.“That was the moment when I wrote the list,” he says. “Buying a house for my family at that moment was the most important thing. Something I value very much in this world is family. I had been in Portugal for four years and I hadn’t seen them. I asked for a house – one that had a bed and a shower. We didn’t have a house like that. So, that’s why I asked for a very big house. I hadn’t married my wife yet, we hadn’t had a daughter. So, I was asking for things that were within my sight.”Alexsandro was selected in the team of the season in Portugal, which helped him earn a move to Lille in the summer of 2022. At the start of the season, the new players were asked to share their dreams with their teammates. Some wanted to winLigue 1, others to play in the Champions League. Alexsandro was the last to talk. “I want to help you achieve your dreams,” he said.His desire was to become a key player at Lille but first he had to adapt, and quickly. Over the last three years he has solidified his position in the team and become a leader. A call-up to the national team was slowly becoming a reality. “I set the goal of conquering this during 2025,” he says. “I had already bought my family a house, married my wife and had a beautiful daughter. So now it was time to dream about my life as a player. I played in the Champions League. Now I wanted a spot in theBrazilsquad and, of course, to play in the next World Cup.”View image in fullscreenCarlo Ancelotti gave Alexsandro his first call-up to the Brazil squad.Photograph: Jorge Silva/ReutersWhen Alexsandro was called up to the national team​ by Carlo Ancelotti last month, he was at home with his friends in Brazil. They drove to the favela to spread the love and happiness in a place he felt he belonged. They honked horns and were thankful for the achievement, which was shared by everybody. There were pictures, congratulations, kids running around. A good day.Alexsandro likes to go home, help people out and show them their dreams are also within reach. When he returned to the favela after earning his call-up he ran into Mr Zé, a shopkeeper from his youth, and offered to square up his bill from years ago. “That little stall and that gentleman bring back so many memories from when I was a kid. My mum would send me to his stall to ask for things on credit: ‘Go get something on credit from Mr Zé, get this, this, and this.’ When I passed by there, I remembered, so I went and said something. It was funny, but with a little bit of truth in the end,” he laughs.And that’s how life goes. “We dream but I lived in the present moment. I dedicated myself, I positioned myself, I gave up many things. I stopped having fun and going out with friends to get good rest, eat well, so that in the end I’d have this result. There’s no point in dreaming, asking God for help, and just standing still. We have to go after it, there’s no other way. Even with fear, we have to take that step of faith, believing that he will make it happen. I believed, and in the end, he made it happen, as always.”This is an article byTom SandersonandJosué SeixasExplore more on these topicsBrazilGuardian Sport NetworkLilleLigue 1European club footballWorld CupWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026featuresShareReuse this content"

He said a “period of being out of contract led to very significant financial hard times” and he had “succumbed to temptation”.“Although he had previously experienced periods of being in between contracts or – putting it another way – being unemployed as a footballer, they had largely been on the back of fairly lucrative long-term contracts,” said Rose.He said the “situation was rather different in the background to this”.“Having been out of contract prior to signing for Greenock Morton, he had a brief contract with Kidderminster Harriers but that was very much a short-term contract, almost to try to assist someone he had a good relationship with,” he said.Rose continued: “His football career is finished and that’s something he has brought entirely on himself. It’s a devastating blow for somebody who had such promise and such an impressive football career.”Judge Mills said: “It’s through your own action that you will no longer be known for playing professional football. You will be known as a criminal. A professional footballer who threw it all away.”The judge said Emmanuel-Thomas was on a £600-a-week contract at the time of the incident. He said the defendant recruited his girlfriend and her friend and was “essentially turning the importation of cannabis into an all-expenses paid holiday in the far east”, arranging business class flights, hotel costs and discussing in messages how to maximise their time on the Thai island of Ko Samui.Emmanuel-Thomas looked straight ahead as the judge read out his sentence. He nodded towards the public gallery as he was led to the cells.Piotrowska, 33, of Purves Road, Kensal Rise, north-west London, and Rowland, 29, of Southend Road, Chelmsford, Essex, denied the charge and at an earlier hearing prosecutors offered no evidence in their case.Josse said at an earlier hearing that the women “said they thought they were importing gold, not cannabis”, and the judge directed that not guilty verdicts be recorded for them.Explore more on these topicsFootballCrimeDrugsArsenalScottish ChampionshipEnglandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

In the 90th minute of a game in which the Socceroos had been besieged by Japan, in which a rampant Samurai Blue had done everything but fashion that clearcut chance they needed to score a winning goal, Aziz Behich went back across his body and bent a shot with his non-preferred right foot beyond Kosei Tani and into the back of the net. With one fell swoop, with his first goal in green and gold in 13 years, the veteran defender had all but ensured that Australia punched their tickets to the 2026 Fifa World Cup and, in doing so, cemented his place in Australian football folklore.Australia 1-0 Japan: Socceroos on brink of World Cup 2026 qualificationRead morePandemonium gripped Perth Stadium. Behich streaked away towards the corner flag before being enveloped by teammates from every direction. On the sidelines, Tony Popovic let out a guttural roar before embracing his staff while the pyrotechnics were going off in the stands and strangers embraced each other in delirious jubilation.Australia hadn’t beatenJapanfor 16 years, but now, three points against Asia’s pre-eminent power in the bag, they will enter the final match day of Asian qualifying’s third round three points clear of third-placed Saudi Arabia, whom they will face in Jeddah next week. Hervé Renard’s side saw off Bahrain 2-0 later in the day but, against Australia on 10 June, it would require a freak result for Saudi qualification, owing to the Socceroos’ vastly superior goal difference.View image in fullscreenJapan’s goalkeeper Kosei Tani, right, is unable to stop a shot from Australia’s Aziz Behich.Photograph: Trevor Collens/APBehich’s goal is a moment that will now be immortalised for generations to come. He stands alongside John Aloisi, Josh Kennedy, Tim Cahill, Mile Jedinak and Andrew Redmayne as a hero of Australian qualification. Few will remember the dominance that Japan had enjoyed prior to that goal in the decades to come, and even fewer will care. Because the Socceroos look destined for another World Cup.After 45 minutes had elapsed in Perth, the Japanese had controlled 70% of possession, had seven shots to Australia’s two and made passes in the Socceroos’ half of the pitch 136 times. By the time the full-time whistle rang out, their share of possession had slipped to 69% but they’d now had 13 shots to six, and passed the ball in their foes’ half 336 times compared to 234 in their own. Popovic’s side, just as they had in Saitama last October, were being crushed under the weight of possession and territory.The one small mercy for the Socceroos was that throughout all this, the Japanese managed just a single shot on target in the first half, a long-range effort from Yu Hirakawa that was comfortably saved by Mathew Ryan. Yuito Suzuki had burst through the midfield in the 28th minute in a much more threatening move, only to bend his resulting shot wide of the goal, while Hirakawa would send another long-range effort just wide of the post in the 37th.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a Riley McGree sight on goal in the second, they quickly resumed their offensive pile-on. After a Cameron Burgess one, Moriyasu brought on Takefusa Kubo. One of the few regulars in the rotated squad that had travelled to Perth, his coach had opted to keep the attacker on the bench to start the game alongside other regulars such as Wataru Endō and Zion Suzuki. He flashed a lethal looking shot on goal in the 90th minute but it went just wide. Exhale.Somehow, after 90 minutes of suffering, Australia was still alive. They kept running. And then McGree, brought on as a second-half substitute, made an incredible turn and darted into the box before cutting the ball back. And then Behich met the ball. And then, history.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersAustraliaJapanAustralia sportmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We’ll see how long I can keep the jersey for. Friday is a stage that suits me a bit more, so I’m going in with a bit more confidence than today.”Deignan was prominent ­throughout the stage, but when Le Court, winner of this year’s Liège-Bastogne-Liège, broke clear on ­Langburn’s Bank, the steepest ­gradient of the second classified climb, Deignan’s Lidl-Trek team were distanced.Le Court’s powerful acceleration on the 16% sections at the base of the climb proved too much for her rivals, including Deignan’s teammate, the Paris 2024 silver medallist Anna ­Henderson, who tried to give chase but was unable to follow the move.View image in fullscreenIt was a frustrating day for Lizzie Deignan (right) and her Lidl-Trek team.Photograph: Alex Broadway/Getty ImagesOnly Faulkner, of EF Education-Oatly, was able to close the gap and the pair, who joined forces on the descent, then worked together to build a half-minute lead on their pursuers during the undulating run into Redcar. Even though Deignan’s team had four of their five riders in the chasing group, and were aided both by Cat Ferguson’s Movistar team and the French FDJ-Suez team, they were unable to close down the half-minute advantage.But Faulkner almost came unstuck on a right-hand bend in the closing kilometres, misjudging her speed and skidding to a halt against a traffic island. Sportingly, Le Court, knowing that their break had a better chance of success if the pair stayed together, waited for the American.While Lorena Wiebes, a past stage winner, took third in the sprint, ­Ferguson, making her debut in the race, was the first British finisher fifth. The junior world road race champion is now sixth overall, 18 seconds adrift of Le Court.Ferguson, who also took the lead in the best young rider ­classification, admitted she had expected there to be a ­regrouping in the final kilometres. “I thought it would definitely come down to a sprint,” the 19-year-old said, “so for the two to stay away was a surprise. They were too strong, so credit to them for staying away.”View image in fullscreenCat Ferguson receives the young rider’s jersey.Photograph: Olly Hassell/SWpix.com/ShutterstockBy her own admission Deignan’s days as an overall contender are probably gone, but Skipton-born Ferguson, seen as her natural heir, is well-placed to make an impact as the race goes on. “I’ve not thought about my strategy yet,” she said, “but I’m just going to take it day by day and approach each day like we did today, like a real team.”Friday’s second stage of the four-day race takes the peloton from Hartlepool to Saltburn-by-the-sea and finishes with the infamous ­hairpins of Saltburn Bank, the venue for recent National Championships. The steep climb to the finish is well-known to British riders in the peloton and was pivotal to the outcome of the women’s road race in 2023 and 2024, both of which were won by Pfeiffer Georgi, of the Picnic PostNL team.Explore more on these topicsWomen's TourLizzie DeignanCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

That will be a major boost to England’s chances, with James on track in her recovery from the hamstring injury she sustained in April.There is also a place for the19-year-old Arsenal forward Michelle ­Agyemang, who scored onher debut away to Belgiumin April, while the Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy is included too.There is no place in the squad, however, for the Brighton forward Nikita Parris, while the Aston Villa midfielder Missy Bo Kearns is one of four players named on standby alongside the Brighton goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley, the Manchester City midfielder Laura Blindkilde Brown and the Aston Villa defender Lucy Parker. It means there is not room for the Brighton youngster Maisie Symonds, who received a call-up in March.Wiegman’s squad announcement comes after a tumultuous period for the Lionesses in which Earps and Kirby retired from international duty and Chelsea’s Bright withdrew in order to look after her mental and physical health. The centre-back had minor surgery on a lingering knee problem but, asked if her team were in crisis, Wiegman replied: “That is not the case. We are going with these 23 to the Euros now and I feel very comfortable with this team. I am very happy with the team and I am very excited, and I am looking forward to it. For me, it doesn’t feel like a crisis at all.View image in fullscreenLauren James hasn’t played since early April when she damaged a hamstring.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images“My experiences before ­[tournaments] is that there is always noise. We expect noise until we go into the tournament. The difference between 2015 and 2017 to now is that the attention and visibility of the women’s game has increased so much it seems like there is more noise but there’s just more journalists here. Which is right. It shows what we are doing. That’s a lot more but we have to deal with it and move on. Which we have.”Wiegman was also questioned on whether she has been too honest with players about their positions in the team – which was reportedly a ­factor inEarps’s retirement. Kirby did say she brought her own retirement forward after learning she was not going to Switzerland. But Wiegman said: “After I have conversations with players, I always think: ‘OK, what went well?’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In come Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse and Jamie Overton, likewise Jacob Bethell to offer competition among the batting spots.‘It’s Harry’s team now’: Brook makes instant impact in new England eraRead moreBut perhaps more eye-catching was the news that Archer is back playing second XI cricket for Sussex with a view to turning out at Durham in the round of County Championship fixtures that begins on 22 June. Get through that game and, like Atkinson, the second Test in Birmingham could be a realistic target for a return.“We know with Jof he’s such a talent it doesn’t take him too long to get up to speed,” said Wright, outlining this comeback schedule. “We can assess it from there, how he’s bowled, how he’s feeling. If all goes well and Jofra gets through that Durham game, then he’s available, potentially for selection for that second Test.”As ever with Archer, there is an element of fingers being crossed. The four-year absence from red-ball cricket was triggered by a string of stress injuries to his lower back and right elbow, while his current schedule has already featured one setback after he injured his thumb in the Indian Premier League.But equally, the attributes he possesses are tantalising, while England will welcome any reinforcements for a seam attack that lacks experience and has lost the unsettling pace of Mark Woodto a knee injury. The return of Carse – who revealed last week that he had contemplated “amputation” of his second toe to offer respite from his injury problems – at least offers some snarl, after he picked up 27 wickets in five Tests last winter. Wright, meanwhile, offered a glimmer of hope that Wood could be back for the end of the series, in which England will compete for the new Tendulkar-Anderson trophy.Of the five frontline quicks named for the first Test, only Woakes is in double figures caps-wise, however. And while Wright spelled out that Woakes sits ahead of the retained Sam Cook in the pecking order – Matthew Potts was overlooked altogether – a season delayed by ankle bone stress means the 36-year-old still needs to demonstrate his fitness by playing for the Lions against India A this week.View image in fullscreenEngland Lions coach Andrew Flintoff talks with Chris Woakes during a net session at Northampton on Wednesday.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/ECB/Getty ImagesStarting in Northampton on Friday, that match also has Josh Tongue down to play. And going by Wright’s verdict on Overton – back-up for the faster bowlers but also offering some heft with the bat – the intended three to take on India are Woakes, Tongue and Carse, with Shoaib Bashir the sole frontline spinner in the squad.The batting appears more settled and, even considering his lack of a senior hundred to date, has something of an oversupply with Bethell returning to the mix. The question now is whether the 21-year-old slots straight into the XI for the series opener, something Ben Stokes appeared to hint at before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe only to later claim his wordshad been deliberately misinterpreted.Stokes was chiefly looking after Ollie Pope here, with his vice-captain having made 171 in the match after returning to the No 3 spot that Bethell occupied in New Zealand. Wright notably chose not to commit either way, instead stressing that the final team will be selected when the squad meet in Leeds and conditions are assessed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are always places up for grabs, that’s international cricket. That’s the way it always should be. You want a strong squad. They’re all big lads, they know what it’s all about.“The one thing Baz and Stokes have been excellent with is their man management. I’m sure the players will be very aware of what’s going on.”Meanwhile England have confirmed that Phil Salt will miss the T20 series against West Indies that starts in Durham on Friday due to paternity leave. Jamie Smith, the Test wicketkeeper who now opens for the one-day team, is his replacement.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamJofra ArcherCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

It sells hybrids as well as pure electric cars. BYD first overtook Tesla in January.Tesla has sold 15,002 cars in the UK so far this year, down 7.8% from 16,272 in the same period last year.Tesla sales have fallen in some of its biggest markets this year and there have beenpolitical protests at some of its showrooms. It is also coming up against fierce competition from rivals including BYD.New car sales overall in the UK increased by 1.6% last month to 150,070 vehicles. It was the best May performance since 2021 but still 18.3% lower than before the Covid pandemic in 2019, and only the second month of growth this year, reflecting brittle consumer confidence and economic turbulence, the SMMT said.Demand was driven by corporate fleets and other businesses, responsible for almost two-thirds of car registrations, while interest from private buyers fell for the second consecutive month, down by 2.3%. There were double-digit declines in deliveries of petrol and diesel cars, down by 12.5% and 15.5%, while demand for the latest electric models increased dramatically to take a combined 47.3% market share.Uptake of hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) grew by 6.8% to 20,351 cars, while plug-in hybrid EVs rose by nearly 51% to 17,898. Registrations of battery EVs increased by more than a quarter, accounting for 21.8% of the market, as car manufacturers sought to entice buyers with incentives.Colin Walker, the head of transport at the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the UK’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate – aset of government regulations designed to boost the number of EVs on the road – “continues to do its thing, increasing competition between manufacturers, driving down prices and driving up sales”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

BYD, the only Chinese manufacturer in the top 10, has achieved 261% growth.James Hosking, the managing director of the secondhand car website AA Cars, said EV sales were increasing as more consumers recognised the long-term running-cost savings and environmental benefits, but added: “While manufacturer incentives and falling secondhand EV prices are helping, concerns about charging access and range anxiety continue to hold some buyers back.”Explore more on these topicsTeslaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAutomotive industryElon MuskMotoringTravel and transportnewsShareReuse this content"

It is developing the artificial intelligence software that would power the robots but will use hardware developed by other companies.The indoor obstacle course being used for the tests at an Amazon office in San Francisco is about the size of a coffee shop, the report said, with the company hoping the robots will be able to travel in Amazon’sRivian vansand make deliveries from them.Even with a human driver behind the wheel, a robot could theoretically speed up drop-off times by visiting one address while the human employee delivers to another. Amazon also has an interest in self-driving vehicles through its Zoox unit.Amazon has more than 20,000 Rivians in the US and has placed one of the vans in the humanoid testing zone, according to the report. Once it has tested the robots in the humanoid park, it plans to take them on “field trips” in the real world where they will attempt to deliver packages to homes.Amazon has already conducted trials with humanoid robots, deploying devices developed by the US company Agility Robotics in its warehouses. The chief executive of Agility, Peggy Johnson,told the Guardian last yearthat the company’s Digit robot allowed employees to hand off work to humanoids and become a “robot manager”.Last year Amazon was given permission to test-fly drones beyond a human controller’s line of sight in the UK,paving the way for using the technology in home delivery.Prof Subramanian Ramamoorthy, the chair of robot learning and autonomy at the University of Edinburgh, said Amazon had a respected robotics team and its reported focus on “last mile” delivery was not a surprise. The humanoid robot hardware capable of carrying out such a task is becoming available and the field is developing rapidly, he said. However, he added, the challenge was to achieve reliable performance outside highly constrained environments such as the reported “humanoid park”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On-again, off-againtrade tariffsimplemented by Donald Trump, which precipitatedpre-order delaysfrom Nintendo, made the 5 June release date of the highly coveted hardware feel more like a hope than a certainty. A potential price hike up from $450 loomed over launch day, but would-be buyers’ fears did not come to fruition.Nintendo’s Switch 2 is the upgrade of my dreams – but it’s not as ‘new’ as some might hopeRead moreNintendo’s maneuvering around Trump’s tariffs isn’t over, though – far from it. The Japanese console maker managed to luckily launch its device squarely within a90-day tariff pauseissued by the president. If tariffs on countries such as India and Japan return to the levels proposed during Trump’s “liberation day” speech at the start of April, however, experts say Nintendo will have to limber up for yet another delicate trade policy dance.It’s possible that a Switch 2 bought during the holiday season will cost more than it did at launch date. Nintendo’s top gaming hardware competitors – and essentially anyone shipping electronics to the US – have been watching the Switch 2 saga with bated breath.“What saved Nintendo in this case was that Trump chickened out,”Notre Dame professor and international economist Robert Johnsonsaid.Vietnam tariffs forced Nintendo to scrambleSince its launch in March 2017, the Switch has become one of the best-selling video game consoles in history, with more than 150m units sold worldwide. Nintendo teased its successor in January and gave a full reveal during an 2 Aprillive stream, announcing the device would ship on 5 June with a hefty $450 price tag in the US (or $500 when bundled with Mario Kart World). Just hours later, Trumpstepped up to a podium at the Rose Garden, chart in tow, to announce a new volley of tariffs on imports on countries with a trade deficit with the US.Among them: a 24% tariff on Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered, and a 46% tariff on Vietnam, where the bulk of its Switch manufacturing takes place. Stock marketsplummetedas Nintendo fans collectively wondered whether the company would pass the costs of those steep duties on to them.US pre-orders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin later that week on 9 April. Nintendo delayed that date so it could “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions”. The 5 June release date, the company noted, would stay the same. Gamersflockedtovarious social media sitesto vent their frustration – much of it directed not at Nintendo, but at the Trump administration. Pre-orders resumed on 24 April and, predictably, the console quickly sold out.Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for commentPrepared for the wrong tariffs, saved by ‘taco’Johnson notes that Nintendo, like many other consumer electronics makers, has spent years grappling with the question of where to produce.In 2019, during the tail end of the first Trump administration, the gaming company began shifting production of the Switch from China to Vietnam in an effort to sidestep US tariffs on Chinese imports. Nintendo still manufactures some Switch products in China, but those units are typically shipped to non-US markets. Other major consumer tech companies, such as Apple, havesimilarly moved parts of their manufacturingoperations from China to countries such as India to mitigate tariff impacts.View image in fullscreenGamers wait in line outside the New York Nintendo store.Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesThat strategy was ultimately rendered moot when the current administration announced a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, an unexpected move that Johnson says “caught virtually everyone off-guard”. These looming tariffs, and the uncertainty surrounding them, could affect the pricing dynamics of nearly any consumer tech product entering the US.Sony and Microsoft,both expected to release new consoles in 2027, will likely face similar challenges as Nintendo.“It takes a long time and significant capital outlays to bring new production facilities online. Producers really like to operate in a stable environment.” Johnson said. “The current trade environment is the exact opposite of that.”The “liberation day” tariffs could easily have led to a higher Switch 2 price or a delayed release. But Nintendo managed to avoid that fate thanks to backpedaling by the Trump administration, a behavior described by the Financial Times using the acronym “taco” – short for “Trump always chickens out”. Trump’s call for a 90-day pause on tariffs to allow negotiations with targeted countries meant the Switch 2 could still be released during a window in which the import taxes wouldn’t apply.And even if negotiations with Vietnam ultimately fail, reports estimate Nintendo hasalready shipped around 746,000Switch 2 units to the US, which would not be subject to the higher tariffs.Pricier add-onsNintendo consumers will not walk away unscathed by tariffs. The company has said accessories for its device, a major part of the Switch’s dual form factor, will “experience price adjustments”. So far,according to CNBC, docks used to play the Switch on a full-size screen will cost $10 more than before, while straps for the two controllers will see a $1 increase. Johnson also said he wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo considers raising the console’s price around the holiday season, especially if Trump moves forward with a 46% tariff on Vietnam.“I find it difficult to imagine that the Trump administration will want thousands of stories written during the holiday season about how Trump ruined Christmas,” Johnson said. “So I expect they’ll find a way to climb down, but – like everyone else – I’m not sure about that.”But there’s another reason why Nintendo may have an incentive to keep console prices from climbing too high: themajority of its revenuedoesn’t come from physical console sales. Increasingly, the real moneymakers – for Nintendo and its competitors – are software and online subscriptions, neither of which are subject to tariffs.“In the end, Nintendo wants to sell consoles to get people to buy games and accessories,” Johnson said. “As a result, it may be willing to hold down the price of consoles.”Explore more on these topicsNintendo SwitchTrump tariffsGamesTariffsNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

From new tech to add-ons, our guide will help you decideKeith StuartThu 5 Jun 2025 06.09 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 17.59 EDTShareSince itsannouncement in January, anticipation has been building for the Nintendo Switch 2 – the followup to the gaming titan’s most successful home console, the150m-selling Nintendo Switch. Major console launches are rarer than they used to be; this is the first since 2020, when Sony’s PlayStation 5 hit shelves. Whether you’re weighing up a purchase or just wondering what all the fuss is about, here’s everything you need to know.The basicsThe Switch 2 is out today, 5 June, priced at £395.99 (US$449.99/A$699/€469.99) or at £429.99 (US$499.99/A$766/€509,99) bundled with its flagship game, Mario Kart World. Like its predecessor, it’s a portable games machine with a built-in screen – you can use as a handheld mini-console when you’re out and about, or slide it into the dedicated dock device and plug it into your TV via an HDMI cable for a big-screen experience at home. A little bigger than the original Switch, with a crisp, clear 7.9in LCD touch screen, as opposed to the old 6.2in display, it comes with two Joy-Con controllers, which are chunkier than the previous versions. These now attach magnetically to each side of the screen with a pleasing clunk, replacing the fiddly sliding mechanism that most Switch owners disliked. They’ve also got bigger L and R buttons on the top, which sounds like a minor detail but is a huge deal for anyone trying to perfect their Mario Kart power-slides.The specView image in fullscreenBig tech advances … Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoThe tech inside the Switch 2 is a lot more advanced than the previous console, featuring a custom nVidia processor, and a screen capable of displaying at 4K resolution (when plugged into a compatible TV) or 1920x1080 resolution in portable mode. It’s also got 5.1 surround sound, and supports high-dynamic range lighting (HDR) graphical effects at frame rates of up to 120hz. This brings the Switch 2 almost up to scratch with other modern consoles: most experts are placing its tech specs somewhere between the PS4 and PS5, or between Xbox One and Xbox Series X.In the boxTheNintendo Switch2 comes with the console itself, two Joy-Con controllers, a power adaptor and USB-C charging cable, a dock, a Joy-Con grip (which allows you to connect the two Joy-Cons together to create a traditional-looking games controller), and two Joy-Con wrist straps to stop them flying out of your hands.Out of the boxNintendo is going big on the social features of the console. Its GameShare function will allow you to play compatible games with other people who don’t own a copy – they just need their own Switch or a Switch 2, and can play along in the room with you or connect online. This is particularly important for families sharing one copy of a game. Meanwhile, GameChat is kind of like Zoom, but for games: you can invite a bunch of pals into a group video chat session where you can talk to each other while playing the same game, playing different games, or just hanging out. If you all buy theNintendoSwitch 2 Camera you’ll be able to see little video windows of each other on the screen, too. GameChat requires a paid subscription to Nintendo’s online gaming service, which costs £17.99 (US$19.99/€19.99/A$29.95)a year or £3.49 (US$3.99/€3.99/A$5.95) a month, but is free until 31 March.The gamesView image in fullscreenBig news … Mario Kart World game.Photograph: NintendoThe console is launching with around 25 games, though many of these are enhanced versions of older Switch titles. The big newcomers areMario Kart World, an open-world take on the classic karting game; the introductory gameNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour; the co-op survival challengeSurvival Kidsand anti-gravity racer,Fast Fusion. Some favourites making it across areFortnite, Cyberpunk 2077andThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom. Most games will retail for between £45–£70 and will be available to buy and download online, or as physical boxed copies. You can also still play almost all your old Switch games on the new console, and there’s a huge back catalogue of retro NES, Nintendo 64, SNES and GameCube classics from the 1980s, 90s and 00s available to play with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.The accessoriesView image in fullscreenAdd-ons … Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller and camera.Photograph: NintendoThere are three things you may want to buy alongside the console. TheNintendo Switch 2 Pro controlleris a traditional console joypad intended for serious play. Then you have theNintendo Switch 2 camera, basically a webcam compatible with the GameChat service, but also with any games that might use camera features. You may also want a microSD Express card to provide additional storage for your games.Where can I buy one?If you haven’t pre-ordered, you may have to be patient and shop around. Some of the larger retailers including Amazon, Argos, Currys and John Lewis are saying theymayhave a few in stock today and it’s worth tryingNintendo’s online store. Be extremely wary of buying from private sellers on eBay or similar sites – there will be a lot of con artists out there.

Enjoy it while it lastsThu 5 Jun 2025 18.13 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 18.39 EDTShareIf you paid attention during physics class you will remember the third law of ego-dynamics. Namely: when two egos of equal mass occupy the same orbit, the system will eventually become unstable, resulting in an explosive separation and some very nasty tweets.To see this theory in action please have a gander at the dramatic collapse of theDonald TrumpandElon Muskbromance. The news has been a nonstop horror show for what feels like forever. Watching two of the very worst people in the world direct their nastiness at each other is extremely cathartic.While I won’t contain my glee, I will collect myself long enough to go over the backstory. First, as you know,Musk spent $277mto help get Trump elected. If this happened somewhere else we would call it corruption and the US might invade the country to install democracy. But this is the US we’re talking about, so it was fine.After Musk donated all thosequids,Trump provided thequo.Musk got his Doge gig, through which he weakened all the agencies that wereregulating his businessesin the name of saving the US a load of money.So long, Elon: the cuts didn’t go to plan, but you completely shredded your reputation | Marina HydeRead moreThis is the point where things started to go wrong andMusk’s reputationstarted to tank. Over the years the billionaire had managed to convince a depressingly large number of people that he was some sort of genius rocket man with anti-establishment views. Once he became part of the establishment, however, and started slashing federal jobs, a lot of people started to get annoyed with how much influence he had over their lives.Musk may be a space cadet but even he could see how much he was destroying his brand. It didn’t help, of course, that Tesla shares were dropping.Soa week agohe did the sensible thing and announced that he was leaving his role with theTrump administration. Rather more interestingly, however, the “first buddy” publicly criticized Trump’s marquee tax bill. Whispers of a rift between Musk and Trump started circulating.At first when Musk parted ways with theTrump administrationI thought the public divorce might be smoke and mirrors: a mutually beneficial PR exercise. Trump got rid of a creepy weirdo who nobody liked and kept causing him problems. Musk got to show his worried investors that he was putting all his energy back into the companies he’s supposed to be running. Rumours of a fallout, I thought, were greatly exaggerated.On Thursday, however, things escalated to the point where I don’t think this fallout can possibly be manufactured or exaggerated.Thursday afternoon, you see, is when the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein entered the chat. Writing on the social network he spent billions buying,Musk tweeted: “Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrumpis in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” To be extra messy he added: “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”It’s worth noting that Musk, a man who reportedly foists his sperm on every woman of a certain age that he meets, has a well-documented history of calling other people sex offenders. The self-sabotage probably started when he called the British cave explorer Vernon Unsworth a“pedo guy”in 2018, without any justification, after Unsworth helped rescue 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave. Musk, in case you had forgotten, had made a lot of noise about how he was going to rescue the kids with a very special little submarine. He did not, in fact, rescue any children and Unsworth hurt the billionaire’s feelings when hesuggestedMusk “stick his submarine where it hurts”.Still, while Musk does not think before he tweets, this seems a tad reckless even for him. It certainly goes well beyond the bounds of “manufactured PR brawl” and enters “burning bridges” territory. And, of course, having been in bed with the guy you’ve just implied was in Epstein’s circle doesn’t exactly make you look good does it?As well as tweeting about Epstein, Musk also said Trump would have “lost the election” if he hadn’t intervened with his hundreds of millions. Musk also suggested that he might start a new political party.Trump, meanwhile, hasn’t exactly been holding his tongue. He called Musk “crazy” and threatened to cut off government contracts with the billionaire’s companies.So is this the end of a big, beautiful friendship? Is it, as conspiracy theorist and Trump ally Laura Loomerput it: “a Big beautiful breakup”?While it feels like it, we should remember that Trump has kissed and made up with his haters before. While the president has very thin skin (all that bronzer can wreak havoc on the epidermis), he’s also a pragmatist.Just look at “Little Marco” AKA Marco Rubio AKA the secretary of state. Before the 2016 election, Rubio described Trump as a “con artist” and suggested he had bladder issues. Trump, meanwhile,called Rubioa “nervous basket case” who was the sweatiest person he’d ever met. “It’s disgusting,” he said. “We need somebody that doesn’t have whatever it is that he’s got.” Various other barbs were exchanged but, almost a decade on, all seems to be forgiven. The two men are now as thick as thieves.It’s also possible that, as a simple woman, I can’t comprehend the testosterone-infused intricacies of what’s going on with Musk and Trump. Conservative commentatorJack Posobiec helpfully tweeted: “Some of y’all cant handle 2 high agency males going at it and it really shows. This is direct communication (phallocentric) vs indirect communication (gynocentric).”Still, while there may eventually be some sort of reconciliation, I for one am enjoying the drama. I think we all are. Well, maybe not Kanye West AKA Ye. On Thursday the disgraced rapper tweeted: “Brooooos please nooooo […] We love you both so much.” As Musk might sayhimself: bet you did Nazi that coming.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsXJeffrey EpsteinInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

Imagination and skill can bolster external backing – but can’t replace itThu 5 Jun 2025 13.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 14.10 EDTShareSince Donald Trump scoldedVolodymyr Zelenskyywith the words “You don’t have the cards right now,” Ukraine has been keener than ever to demonstrate that it has a few up its sleeve. On Sunday it showed its hand with an extraordinary, audacious drone attack on multiple bases deep inside Russia, which it says damaged 41 aircraft.Operation Spiderweb, which saw the smuggled drones released from their hiding places in wooden sheds and remotely piloted to their targets, was swiftly followed by another attackon Crimea’s Kerch bridgeusing underwater explosives. Kyiv – often coy in such cases – was unusually swift to claim both incidents, but has not taken responsibility for tworailway bridge attackswhich Russia says led to the deaths of seven passengers at the weekend.There is obvious satisfaction in hitting Russian bombers and surveillance planes used against Ukrainian civilians, and Spiderweb’s unexpected method will surely force Russia to think harder about defence. But the greater significance lies in its potential impact on domestic morale and international support.Ukrainehas repeatedly surprised both its enemy and its allies throughout this war. Unexpected successes such as the Kursk incursion have changed the narrative at critical moments. Meticulously planned, and reportedly 18 months in the making, the latest operation must make Russia wonder what else may be on the way.It was also spectacular enough to make Mr Trump pay attention. The US presidentreportedlyjudged the attack to be “badass”. But his cosy phone chats with Vladimir Putin appear to be locking in his tilt towards Moscow. On Wednesday hesaidthat, in a “good” conversation, Mr Putin had said he would have to respond. It did not appear to have occurred to the US president that discouraging retaliation might be desirable. He should be challenging Kremlin talking points instead of amplifying them. If Ukraine hoped to dispel the nuclear spectre which Russia has repeatedly summoned up, Mr Trump seems to be still in its thrall – withsome of those around himtalking up the threat again.The Center for Strategic and International Studies arguedin a reportthis week that Russia’s military performance has been notably poor in this war, with gains coming at a strikingly high cost in terms of both equipment and personnel – hitting an estimated million casualties this summer. But Russia still has many more cards. It continues to grind out its advance, and in late May it launched itslargest drone and missile assaulton Ukraine to date. Its war of attrition may look old-fashioned compared with Kyiv’s innovations, but it still hurts. Meanwhile, talks in Istanbul have producedagreement on a prisoner exchangebut no movement towards peace.There appears to be growing support in the US Senate for further sanctions on Russia, but Lindsey Graham isunlikely to movewithout Mr Trump’s acquiescence, and there is little sign of progress in the House. Pete Hegseth did not attend the session on Ukraine at Thursday’s gathering of defence ministers ahead of this month’s Nato summit – a telling absence, though the Pentagon blamed scheduling issues. Kyiv needs and deserves increased support from Washington, but damage limitation looks like a more realistic aspiration.Ukraine continues to surprise, and to shift its approach as circumstances demand. Unfortunately, there is little sign of the US president, capricious as he is, changing course on this conflict.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He ran an airline, a university and a winery. Thanks to the Apprentice show that made him a reality TV star, the US president slapped his name on real estate projects around the world built by other companies – along with Trump-branded steaks, vodka, deodorant and bottled water. Many of these businessesultimately failed, but Trump rarely invested his own funds and he still walked away with hefty licensing fees.Today, as the most powerful person in the world, Trump has found perhaps the easiest way to profit off his name: cryptocurrency. Days before his inauguration for a second term on 20 January, Trump’s family businesslaunched a meme coin, called $Trump, which is a type of digital currency often connected to an online joke or mascot. It has no inherent value beyond speculation. The coin quickly soared in value up to $75 per token, but it crashed days later. No matter the ultimate price, Trump and his family rake in millions of dollars in fees as the coin is traded by speculators hoping to turn a quick profit, or those trying to curry favor with him.It’s difficult to keep up with all the ways that Trump is corrupting the US presidency and using it for personal profit, but his crypto ventures are among the most dangerous because they potentially allow him and his family to collect hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign investors and governments that would normally have a harder time funneling money to a US politician. Thanks to the memecoin and other deals, the Trump family’s wealth increased bynearly $3bnin the last six months. Trump has proven himself the most successful president – at monetizing the presidency.Trump’s foray into cryptocurrency underscores the ways he can leverage the presidency for personal gain by exploiting his sense of impunityWhile he is exempt from conflict of interest laws that ban federal employees from profiting off their positions,every US presidentsince the 1970s had voluntarily abided by these rules – until Trump. Previous occupants of the White House either sold their financial holdings or set them aside in blind trusts. But in his first term, Trumprefused to divestfrom his business empire, which is mostly centered around the Trump Organization and is still managed by his sons.Since Trump’s first term, his family business has also evolved beyond a real estate conglomerate that licenses the Trump name to hotels, luxury towers and golf courses around the world, earning millions of dollars inbranding and management feeswithout investing its own funds in most projects. The business now includes a portfolio of social media and crypto ventures, providing Trump with new ways to profit from being in office. And Trump is more emboldened to ignore norms set by past presidents, thanks to a compliant Congress led by Republicans and a USsupreme court rulinglast year which gave Trump “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his official acts as president.Trump’s foray into cryptocurrency underscores the ways he can leverage the presidency for personal gain by exploiting his sense of impunity and an industry that is notorious for fraud and a lack of transparency. After the value of his memecoin collapsed, Trump’s crypto venture announced in April that the220 largest buyersof the token would be invited to a private gala dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club, while the top 25 buyers would get access to a VIP reception with Trump and a White House tour. Once that contest was under way, the $Trump coin got a new round of media attention and its value jumped by more than 50%. The more people bought the token, the more Trump and his family profited from crypto transactions that are usually shrouded in anonymity. Since the memecoin’s launch in January, Trump-affiliated businesses received $312m from crypto sales and $43m in other fees, according to aWashington Post analysisof trading data.Of course, US presidents for decades have used private dinners and gatherings to grant special access to wealthy donors and raise funds for their political parties or their own campaigns. But campaign contributions carry legal restrictions on how they can be spent, and US donors can’t remain anonymous and must disclose all of their donations to political candidates. The sweepstakes dinner organized by Trump’s crypto business was not a fundraiser or campaign event – it was a gathering arranged to directly enrich him and his family.Beyond the inherent conflict of Trump doing business within an industry that he has immense power to regulate as president, Trump also opened himself up to foreign influence as his memecoins became a vehicle for foreign actors to funnel money to his family. While Trump’s crypto business has refused to release a list of those invited to last month’s dinner at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, media organizations compiledlists of attendersthat included foreign citizens who would normally be forbidden from donating funds to US politicians. (The Washington Postfound thatnearly half of the top 220 Trump memecoin holders purchased their coins from crypto exchanges that reject US-based customers, meaning they are probably foreign buyers. And 19 of the top 25 buyers, who were invited to aVIP reception with Trumpbefore the dinner on 22 May, and a “special tour” the next day, had bought coins from similar exchanges.)The best-known foreign investor who attended Trump’s dinner was Justin Sun, a Chinese billionaire who founded the crypto platform Tron and had spentmore than $20mon the president’s memecoins, earning him the distinction of being the contest’s top buyer. In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Joe Biden’s administration, charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. But a few weeks after Trump took office, the SEC asked a federal court topause its lawsuit.The Guardian view on Trump’s conflicts of interest: the shadow of kleptocracy | EditorialRead moreWhat could be behind the SEC’s change of heart about pursuing charges against Sun under the second Trump administration? Sun is one of the top investors in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture launched by Trump’s family in September. After Trump won the November election,Sun bought $75min World Liberty tokens, and he was named an adviser to the company.World Liberty is at the heart of another foreign entanglement – and potential conflict of interest – for Trump and the crypto industry. On 1 May, the president’s son Eric and a business partner, Zach Witkoff (who is also the son of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy), announced that an investment fund backed by the government of Abu Dhabi wouldinvest $2bn using a stablecoin– a form of digital currency – offered by World Liberty. That transaction could eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the president and his family.Years before he got into the business, Trump had dismissed cryptocurrencies as “a scam” which have valuesthat are“based on thin air”. But Trump changed his tune dramatically when he met with the highest-paying customers of his personal memecoin at last month’s dinner. “The past administration made your lives miserable,”Trump told his guests, referring to a Biden administration crackdown on crypto companies. And then the president promised to do things differently: “There is a lot of sense in crypto. A lot of common sense in crypto.”Already, the Trump administration has been pushing to deregulate the industry and in April instructed the justice department todisband a unitthat focused on investigating crypto-related fraud. Last year, a federal judge sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried, who founded the now bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, to25 years in prisonfor perpetuating one of the largest financial frauds in modern history, and bilking his customers out of billions of dollars.Once Trump dismantles regulation and law enforcement of the industry, hehas promised to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet”. And the president will continue to enrich himself and his family along the way.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionCryptocurrenciesUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

On 28 May, the court of international trade ruled his tariffs exceeded his constitutional authority. Point by point, the decision decimated Trump’s arguments as flimsy and false, implicitly castigated the Republican Congress for abdicating its constitutional responsibility, and reminded other courts, not least the supreme court, of the judicial branch’s obligation to exercise its authority regardless of the blustering of the executive and the fecklessness of the legislative branches.Trump’s tariffs, along with his withdrawal of active support for Ukraine and passivity toward his strongman father figure Vladimir Putin, have broken the western alliance, forcing the west to make its own arrangements with China, and cementing the idea for a generation to come that the United States is an untrustworthy and unstable partner.On the economic front, Trump’s tariffs have already begun to increase inflation, shutter trade, devalue the dollar, and undermine manufacturing. They will soon create shortages of all sorts of goods, ruin small business, and force layoffs that bring about stagflation that has not been seen since the 1970s, which was then the result of an external oil shock, not self-harm. On 3 June, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentreported that as a result, principally, of Trump’s tariffs, the US will suffer a decline in the rate of growth from what had been forecast this year. “Lower growth and less trade will hit incomes and slow job growth,” the OECDstated.As a political matter, besides being unpopular, Trump’s tariffs, in combination with his assaults on the institutions of civil and legal society, have drawn out the most intelligent and skillful members of the conservative legal establishment, who themselves have been some of the most crucial players in the rise of the right wing, to man the ramparts against him. These are not the familiar Never Trumpers, but newly engaged and potentially more dangerous foes.While corporate leaders uniformly abhor Trump’s tariffs, they have stifled themselves into a complicit silence on the road to serfdom. But Trump’s new enemies coming from the conservative citadel of the Federalist Society are filing brief after brief in the courts, upholding the law to halt his dictatorial march.Trump naturally cannot help but turn everything he touches into sordid scandal. After announcing his “Liberation Day” tariffs, which tanked the stock market, Trump declared a pause during which he promised he would sign, seal and deliver 90 deals in 90 days. But he has announcedonly a deal with Britain. Most of the deals Trump has seen have been with the Trump Organization. Under the shadow of a threatened 46% tariff, Vietnam, after a visit from Eric Trump, granted a $1bn Trump Tower in Ho Chi Minh City and a $1.5bn golf club and resort near Hanoi with “two championship golf courses”, relative crumbs alongside the billions the Trump family has accrued from across the Middle East, not to mention the $400m jet thathis team solicited from Qatarto serve as his palatial Air Force One.Standing before the white marble plinth of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington national cemetery on Memorial Day, 26 May, after reading prepared remarks about “our honored dead” to a gathering of Gold Star families, Donald Trump fell into a reverie about his divine destiny. “I have everything,” he said. Hespoke about the paradeof troops and tanks he has ordered for 14 June, his 79th birthday, which happens to coincide with the date that George Washington created the Continental army. “Amazing the way things work out. God did that, I believe that too. God did it.”Two days after Trump had mused about his election by heaven to possess “everything”, the court of international trade issued what theWall Street Journalcalled the “ruling heard ‘round the world … proving again that America doesn’t have a king who can rule by decree’”.The US court of appeals for DC then temporarilystayed the rulingwhile it considered the case. But the trade court’s decision to deny Trump his toys was comprehensive, blistering and devastating. Now, Trump’s trade war is his Vietnam, a quagmire of his own.Trump’s entire program dances on the head of his tariffs. By fiat, without congressional approval, he has willfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as cover for his helter-skelter gyrations to reshape the global economy according to his desire for domination of the Earth. He has further explained that his tariffs are necessary topay for the vast tax cutsfor the wealthy in his budget bill that would increase deficits. He claims that the tariffs will replace the revenue raised from income tax, fixed in the constitution by the 16th amendment, ratified in 1913. Without tariffs on the scope he projects his dream house of cards collapses. With his tariffs even as his stated minimal goal he blows up the world.The court of international trade, a court based on specialized expertise, whose judges have lifetime appointments, flatly stated that Trump’s use of the emergency law under which he claimed his authority does “not permit the president to impose tariffs in response to balance-of-payments deficits”, “exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the president”, “would create an unconstitutional delegation of power”, and is “contrary to law”.Having ruled that Trump’s worldwide tariffs are illegal, the court deemed his “trafficking tariffs” imposed on Canada and Mexico also lawless. Trump has asserted them on a contrived national security rationale of preventing the importation of fentanyl. But the court stated that Trump’s “use of tariffs as leverage … is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective but because … [the federal law] does not allow it”. Thus, the court concluded in both instances, “the worldwide and retaliatory tariff orders exceed any authority granted to the president … to regulate importation by means of tariffs. The trafficking tariffs fail because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders.”The trade court’s ruling suddenly exposed the extent to which Trump’s relationship with the conservative legal movement is unraveling. The fissure runs deeper and wider than name-calling. Trump’s trade war has morphed into a widespread civil war within the right with the core of the conservative legal establishment resisting him.Trump’s venomous social media posts against Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society co- chairman and rightwing powerhouse, reads like a memoir of an ingenue taken advantage of in the big city by strangers. “I was new to Washington,”Trump explained, “and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges. I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real ‘sleazebag’ named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.”Slowly, Trump has come to the realization that this Leonard Leo “openly brags how he controls Judges, and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court”. Trump was revealing that Leo understood his power beyond his influence over Trump on appointments. “Backroom ‘hustlers’ must not be allowed to destroy our Nation!” He is victim of a con, Donald Chump.“Talk about friendly fire,” editorialized theWall Street Journal. But there was more to the story than Trump revealed, which the Journal’s editorial page, Leonard Leo’s friend in court as it were, happily provided. The judge on the trade court whom Trump appointed and blames on Leo, Timothy Reif, was in fact, according to the Journal, “recommended to the White House by Robert Lighthizer, who was Mr Trump’s first-term trade representative. Mr Leo had nothing to do with it.” Perhaps Trump is suffering from memory loss.Trump bellowed that the reason for the trade court’s ruling must be “purely a hatred of ‘TRUMP’? What other reason could it be?” “Well,” suggested the Journal, “how about the law and the constitution?” After Leo had been the one to give Trump the names of the three justices he appointed to the supreme court who made possible the infamous decision granting him “absolute immunity” for “official acts” that enabled his evasion of prosecution during the 2024 campaign, this was a thick and rich ragu.The Journal also rushed to Leo’s side with apodcastfeaturing John Yoo, who as deputy assistant attorney general under George W Bush and the author of the notoriousTorture Memos. Yoo said it was “truly outrageous to accuse Leonard Leo, one of the stalwarts or the conservative movement, of being something like a traitor”. Yoo stated: “Why would President Trump turn his back on one of his greatest, if not his greatest achievements from the first term, appointing three justices?” Indeed, Yoo was right that Leo had dictated Trump’s choices, exactly as Trump confessed. What neither disclosed is that it was the price Trump paid for a political armistice with the mighty rightwing Koch political operation. Some deal, some art.And Yoo added in an admission of truth-telling about the supreme court’s invention of absolute presidential immunity for “official acts”: “If it weren’t for Federalist Society judges, he would be in jail right now because it was the Roberts court that said former presidents just can’t be prosecuted for crimes.”But to Trump, the betrayal is cutting. The trade court’s ruling against him echoed the amicus brief filed by a bipartisan group of legal eminences that included leading conservative lights. There was Steven Calabresi, professor at Northwestern Law School, the co-founder and co-chairman of the Federalist Society, and the chief theorist of the conservative doctrine of the “unitary executive”. There was Michael W McConnell, former federal judge, Stanford law professor, and a chief defender of religious right lawsuits. There was Michael Mukasey, former federal judge and George W Bush’s attorney general. There was Peter Wallison, President Reagan’s White House counsel. They all signedthe briefstating: “The president’s tariff proclamations bypass the constitutional framework that lends legitimacy and predictability to American lawmaking.”Trump is enraged that his betrayers from the Federalist Society have claimed roles in the resistanceThe breaking of ranks on the right is not isolated. Other well-known members of the conservative legal establishment have done more than submit an amicus brief. They have become counsels to some of the most important institutions in Trump’s crosshairs – Harvard University, National Public Radio and the WilmerHale law firm.William Burck and Robert Hur are co-counsels representing Harvard in its suit against the Trump administration order denying its enrollment of international students unless the university submits to his draconian control over its academic processes.Burck, former deputy White House counsel to George W Bush and a current member of the board of directors of the Fox Corporation, is the head of “one of a few top US firms that seemed well placed not only to avoid Donald Trump’s wrath but also benefit from connections to the president’s inner circle”, according to theFinancial Times. He was hired to be an ethics adviser to the Trump Organization – that is, until he chose to represent Harvard. Trumprantedagainst him: “Harvard is a threat to Democracy, with a lawyer, who represents me, who should therefore be forced to resign, immediately, or be fired. He’s not that good, anyway, and I hope that my very big and beautiful company, now run by my sons, gets rid of him ASAP!” Eric Trump, who had previouslycalledBurck “one of the nation’s finest and most respected lawyers”,wielded the executioner’s axefor his father.Hur had been appointed the US attorney for Maryland by Trump and served as the special counsel investigating President Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents stored in boxes in his home’s garage. Hur filed no charges, but said of Biden that he was “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory”.In Harvard’s suit against the Trump administration, Burck and Hur state that its actions against the university are “a blatant violation of the first amendment, the due process clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its first amendment rights to reject the government’s demands to control Harvard’s governance, curriculum, and the ‘ideology’ of its faculty and students. The government’s actions are unlawful for other equally clear and pernicious reasons.”For its representation in its suit against the Trump administration, which seeks to slash its funding, National Public Radio has hired Miguel Estrada, a star of the conservative legal firmament, whose nomination to the federal bench by George W Bush was blocked by Senate Democrats in 2002. According to the NPRcomplaint, Trump’s action “violates the expressed will of Congress and the first amendment’s bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association, and also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information”.When Trump issued executive orders against big law firms that had somehow offended him, coercing their surrender to his whim, one of those firms, WilmerHale, subject to such an order for having had as a senior partner Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who headed the investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election, did not cave. Instead, it hired Paul Clement, George W Bush’s solicitor general, who has argued on behalf of many of the most controversial conservative causes before the supreme court, including against the Defense of Marriage Act and against the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.Citing the example of John Adams, who defended British soldiers in the Boston Massacre, Clementarguedagainst the Trump administration that “British monarchs’ practice of punishing attorneys ‘whose greatest crime was to dare to defend unpopular causes’ – which threatened to reduce lawyers to ‘parrots of the views of whatever group wields governmental power at the moment’ – helped inspire the Bill of Rights”.Then, Ed Whelan, who holds the Antonin Scalia chair in constitutional studies at the rightwing Ethics and Public Policy Center, and is a close surrogate for Leonard Leo, savaged Trump’s nomination of Emil Bove, who was his personal attorney in the New York hush-money trial and whom he had appointed as deputy attorney general, to be a judge on the US court of appeals for the third circuit.Bove ordered corruption charges dropped against the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, whicha federal judge said“smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions”. The US attorney for Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, a conservative Republican, resigned in protest, stating that the deal “amounted to a quid pro quo” and that Bove had ordered her not to take notes during meetings. Seven members of the public integrity section of the justice department also resigned.Whelan, writing in the conservative magazineNational Review, called Bove Trump’s “henchman”, decried his “bullying mishandling” of the Adams case, and suggested he might be put on the federal bench to “position him well for the next supreme court vacancy. A rosier possibility is that Bove is tired of being Stephen Miller’s errand boy.”Now, Trump is worried about what conservatives on the supreme court might rule when presented with the trade court’s decision. Herailsin private against Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom he appointed to the supreme court, for her unexpected occasional independence. The Journal, with the inside track,writesthat “the White House boasts it will win at the supreme court, but our reading of the trade court’s opinion suggests the opposite. Mr Trump’s three court appointees are likely to invoke the major-questions precedent” – which would uphold the trade court and force Trump either to bring his policy before the Congress or drop it.Trump is enraged that his betrayers from the Federalist Society have claimed roles in the resistance. He has no loyalty to anyone or thing, but demands personal fealty, certainly now above any ideological litmus tests. The only ideological tests are to be imposed on universities. Trump has learned his lesson. In his insistence on obedient judges, Trump is returning to his first principle as he was taught in the beginning by his mob attorney Roy Cohn, who said: “Don’t tell me what the law is, tell me who the judge is.”Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

Companies with equality-driven agendas risk losing government contracts. Some are receiving McCarthy-like letters asking them to confirm that they have no diversity policies. Activities designed to support women, includinghealthcare research, are being threatened, and companies are backtracking on former commitments. Women’s networking events, the gathering of diversity data and targeted training are being questioned. And some companies are requesting that charities focused on women and girls consider changes to their programmes in order to navigate the current climate. The one I founded, Inspiring Girls, has already been asked to “include men as role models”.This anti-diversity wave isn’t just a social backlash to the many excesses of wokeness – it is politically orchestrated and driven. It crystallised in 2021, when the senator Josh Hawley devotedhis entire keynote speechat the second National Conservatism Conference to “reclaiming masculinity”, calling for boys (not girls) to be taught competitiveness, strength, honesty and courage – as if those were only male values. Since then, the movement has reached the highest offices of power: the White House is its headquarters and its commander-in-chief is Trump’s deputy chief of staff,Stephen Miller, who promised last year to tackle “anti-white racism” if Trump won a second term.The anti-diversity brigade has no shortage of money or allies: several “tech bros” (whether out of conviction or FOMO) have joined in – as have tech venture capitalists and other Maga financiers. These are men who operate in fields dominated almost exclusively by other men and who wield enormous wealth and influence, yet they often cast themselves as victims. They hide their anti-diversity stance under the disguise of meritocracy.On the progressive side, there is a movement claiming that it is actually boys – particularly white working-class ones – rather than girls who are “in crisis”. It is led by the AmericanInstitute for Boys and Men, which last week receiveda $20m grantfrom Melinda FrenchGates. They argue that boys lag behind girls in education and employment. It is true, of course, that many of themanufacturing jobsthat many young men used to rely on are vanishing due to automation and tech (ironically, for the benefit of mostly male tech moguls). Unfortunately, however, this well-meaning movement is fuelling the anti-diversity brigade’s narrative – because they can now claim that even progressives admit it is white men who are suffering.The Trump administration has not yet imposed specific obligations on businesses to withdraw diversity programmes beyond companies who have contracts with the government – including, now,some companies across the EU, but many are taking spontaneous actions. Some companies are doing so because their diversity policies were just for show, while others are simply acting out of fear.The trend is clear: many areeliminating referencesto diversity and equality from their websites and in their reporting; others are reneging from aspirational targets, stopping data-gathering on recruitment and promotions, and dismantling training programmes.Some of the companies that are backtracking have headquarters in the UK or Europe. And many of the US tech companies and funds that are leading the diversity backlash have subsidiaries and offices on this side of the Atlantic. Their actions are in straightforward conflict with the letter and the spirit of British and EU legislation on equality, such as EU corporate sustainability reporting rules or equal opportunities and equal pay directives.And yet the equality ministries in the British and other European governments – and in the European Commission – have remained largely silent. Most equality ministries and agencies are led by herbivorous politicians and officials who favour performative programmes over meaningful action. Confronting Trump is far too scary for them, which is why they have not set the limits of what companies can and cannot do, whether specifically or in general guidelines.Over time, it is possible the anti-diversity movement will yield some positives, as it could drive companies who continue to believe in diversity towards more meaningful, effective and data-based policies. Besides, in a litigation-led country such as the US, it is only a matter of time before the courts impose some limits on government-led anti-diversity intimidation. When they do, the backlash against companies that have acted spinelessly will have its own consequences.But the UK and the rest of Europe cannot be passive spectators waiting for the pendulum to swing again. Our equality authorities should counteract Trump’s raid on diversity by providing clear official guidance to companies on what they can and cannot do – it is their legal and moral duty to do so. America First should not mean America Everywhere when it comes to the fundamental principles of diversity, equality and inclusion.Miriam González Durántez is an international trade lawyer and the founder and chair of Inspiring GirlsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But what sets his actions apart is his crusade against those in the US legallyThu 5 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 12.35 EDTShareThe Donald Trump administration has billed itself as taking unprecedented steps to crack down on illegal immigration. While the total number of deportations has yet to surge, it may happen soon. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, supportssuspending habeas corpusto speed up deportations, and the border czar, Tom Homan, has suggested blatantlyignoring court orders.Private companiesare also lining up to cash in on mass deportations.Nonetheless, Trump’s approach so far to immigration deemed illegal hasnot differedmuch from whatBarack Obama and Joe Biden did. So why does everything feel different?The answer is that Trump has launched an unprecedented crusade againstlegalimmigrants. And the tactics have been jarringly lawless and cruel.The Guardian view on Trump and children: protect the innocent from this dark vision of the US soul | EditorialRead moreFor example, Trump’s administration has almost completelybanned refugeeresettlement, sought torevoke temporary protected statusfor hundreds of thousandswho have immigratedto flee extreme conditions, eliminated the legal status ofthousands of international students, arrested legal asylum seekers at theirimmigration check-ins,jailed other legal asylum seekersin a maximum security prison in El Salvador, declared anend to birthright citizenshipand revoked the legal status of nearly a million humanitarian parolees who had applied for legal entry using theCBP One app.While the Obama and Biden administrations likewise took aggressive measures to regulate undocumented immigration – thus earning well-founded criticisms from immigration activists who took to calling Obama the “deporter-in-chief” – both presidents also worked to expand the pathways for legal immigration. Some of their initiatives wereblocked by Congressor thecourts, but the result was a net expansion of legal immigration under both administrations.On the other hand, Trump has consistently worked to block as many pathways to legal migration as possible. In Trump’s first term, certain aspects of his immigration agenda were similarly constrained byCongressor the courts, but the result was still amajor decreasein legal immigration.In Trump’s second term, this assault on legal immigrants hasescalated at a furious pace, and while courts have already found many of these actionsillegalaccording to long-established precedent, the administration shows no sign of slowing down. Indeed, Trump officials have become increasingly bold indefying court rulings, and all of this is taking place under the watch of a supreme court so Trump-friendly that last year it granted him sweeping immunity tocommit crimes.As a historian of border policy, I find Tump’s attack on the CBP One app especially demoralizing. A longstanding contradiction in our immigration system is that while technically people have the right to apply for asylum once they reach US soil, it is incredibly difficult to arrive in the US to exercise this right. Accordingly, the only legal way to immigrate for the vast majority of people is to first survive a deadly gauntlet of oceans, jungles, deserts and criminal organizations, and only then begin an asylum application, which is still along shot. David Fitzgerald’s 2019 bookRefuge Beyond Reachoffers a detailed description of this insidious system and its long history.While it was largely unappreciated at the time, the Biden administration took meaningful steps to address this deadly contradiction by creating a way to legally apply for asylum through the CBP One app while still abroad. This enabled people facing grave humanitarian crises tostart applicationsoutside the US, and if approved, they could then buy plane tickets and travel to the US safely with humanitarian parole.The initiative was successful, legal, and in many ways, historic. Hundreds of thousands of people were able to migrate legally and escape extremely difficult conditions.This infuriated conservatives, who launched a barrage of vicious lies to demonize the program and the people using it. JD Vance insisted on the debate stage that these immigrants wereillegal, and when corrected by debate moderators, whined that fact-checking was against the rules. Ted Cruz used his podcast to accuse Biden of chartering flights tobring in undocumented peoplewho would vote Democrat. And Trump accused them ofeating pets.Just by cancelling the program for future enrollees, Trump is already launching a disturbing assault on legal immigration. Yet in an escalation of cruelty that is difficult to even comprehend, Trump canceled the program retroactively as well, capriciously revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of extremely vulnerable peoplewho simply followed the rules.If you think that that sounds dystopian and cruel, you’re right. And that’s exactly the point: cruelty itself is a tactic to scare immigrants away.Thechild separation policyfrom Trump’s first term was an early example of this penchant for using visible displays of cruelty as an immigration deterrent and his new administration has worked around the clock to invent creative new horrors: from shipping deportees toGuantánamo Bay, to sendingmasked agentsto disappear students, to indefinitely detaining immigrants withno criminalrecord in a notoriously dangerous prison in El Salvador (many of whom were arrested while attendinglegal immigration appointments), and then sending Noem to El Salvador to do aphotoshootwith these political prisoners as props. The message to immigrants is clear: leave, or never come in the first place, because this could happen to you, even if you do it “the right way”.The takeaway from all of this is that right now, real people – our friends, families, students and neighbors – are suffering at the hands of a cruel and lawless government. And while Republican policymakers are driving these actions, many centrist Democrats, such as Gavin Newsom, are giving tacit approval by writing off these disturbing human rights violations as merely the “distraction of the day”.I refuse to ignore this suffering. I hope you refuse as well.Daniel Mendiola is a professor of Latin American history and migration studies at Vassar College.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionMigrationTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Free school meals for all children in England on universal credit is rightly being celebrated by schools, nurseries, further education colleges and children’s charities. There may only be 500,000 extra recipients estimated by the government now, but in the long run 1.7 million children will be eligible,says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “Fantastic news,”says the Child Poverty Action Group(CPAG), as 100,000 children will be lifted out of poverty by this annual £500 put back in parents’ pockets.Food matters. Hungry children can’t learn, and many miss school to avoid the public embarrassment of no dinner money and no packed lunch,according to CPAG’sPriced Out of School report. Strong evidence shows a rise in attainment and attendance if you feed children.The Feed the Future campaign findsnot just academic achievement but health, happiness, reduced obesity and lifetime earnings improve if children don’t go hungry. Surely that can’t surprise anyone.The universal breakfast clubs being rolled out now represent real progress. Strict rules stopping schools from demanding absurdly expensive uniforms, sometimes a not-so-subtle way to exclude poorer families, is another part of a developing anti-poverty strategy.But it’s complicated. Nothing in poverty numbers is easy. So while celebrating more meals for more children, we should question the total number of children lifted out of poverty. The government says it’s 100,000 and the IFS agrees. But look what happens when you factor in the dire effect of the upcoming £5bn disability and Pip cuts. Turn to the government’s own paper on the impact.Look at Annex B: “It is estimated that there will be an additional 250,000 people (including 50,000 children) in relative poverty after housing costs in financial year ending 2030 as a result of the modelled changes to social security.”As those receiving support from sources such as Pip lose their benefit, the family gets poorer. Some may find this offset by the addition of free school meals, but not all will qualify, and many families will still find themselves worse off once what they gain from having free school meals is set against benefit losses.The vote on disability benefit cuts is coming up shortly, with up to 170 Labour MPs reportedly ready to rebel. As the Department for Work and Pensions scurries toamend the proposalin time for the vote, it needs to take into account the danger of sending more children below the poverty threshold.Of the many severe critiques of the government’s Pathways to Work plan for these disability cuts, one of the most authoritative is theCitizens Advice response, Pathways to Poverty. It opens: “By refusing to properly consult on its plan to cut billions from disability benefits, the government is choosing not to ask questions it doesn’t want the answers to. The cuts will have a devastating impact on disabled people (and their children), sending hundreds of thousands into poverty, and many more into deeper poverty. This will result from a series of arbitrary reforms that have been designed around savings targets rather than improving outcomes, inflicting hardship on people in ways that the government doesn’t yet fully understand.”Few would doubt the need for the government to take action on the growing numbers of working-age people off sick with mental and physical ailments. Good plans to provide work coaches to help, not bully, them back into working life with an array of supports are unfolding. But the dash for cash suddenly and unexpectedly imposed on the DWP at the last moment when the Office for Budget Responsibility found a gap in Reeves’s proposed £5bn in savings has thrust more brutal cuts forward, regardless of circumstance. In 1997, New Labour’s New Deal to help people into work was a great success: money saved came from finding people jobs, not cutting their benefits in advance, something that was likely to reduce their work capability.The welcome new free school meals policy shines a light on the depths of poverty. How could the appallingly low family income of £7,400 have been the qualifier until now? In Northern Ireland the benchmark is twice as high. Wales and London have universal free meals for primary children; in Scotland, all pupils are eligible for the first five years of primary school. Labour inherited a tax and benefits system that had, since 2010, cut entitlements among families with children by £2,200 a year on average, with those out-of-work losing £5,500 a year,reports the IFS. Reversing that is an uphill task.Many children now getting free meals won’t be lifted out of poverty: it would take a lot more than £500 a year. Lifting the two-child cap would cost less than meals, in terms of freeing children from poverty. That estimated£3.5bn to abolish itwill have to be found by Liz Kendall and Bridget Phillipson’s child poverty taskforce, which will report at budget time in the autumn. There just is no way round it for a government that pledged to take more children out of poverty. Note that they call this free school meals announcement just a “down payment”. The best had better be yet to come.A final thought: for all the panic about disability claims, total working-age benefits as a proportion of government spending havenot risen in the past 20 years. What has happened is cuts for children have been offset by increases for triple-locked pensioners.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPovertyOpinionSchool mealsBenefitsLabourSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

Other countries realise this – when will UK politicians wake up?Thu 5 Jun 2025 11.32 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 12.46 EDTShareYet another attempt to inject sanity into Britain’s archaic drug laws has failed. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last month accepted Lord Falconer’s modest proposal todecriminalise the possessionof small amounts of cannabis. He was stamped on yet again by that citadel of reaction, the Home Office, and its boss, Yvette Cooper. Falconer’s distinguished group of lawyers, doctors and academics did not suggestlegalisation. They simply argued that treating people using cannabis as criminals served no purpose. It confused soft drugs with hard, was racially biased in its enforcement, diverted police time from more pressing matters and denied help to those who needed it.An old game of media interviews is to ask politicians if they have evertaken drugs. Prime ministers from David Cameron and Boris Johnson to Keir Starmer, as well as the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, have either admitted to taking them or refused to deny it. Politicians feel that what the middle classes do at university is harmless fun. If it happens on a council estate, however, it is a route to prison.The reality is that the divide in Britain is not between those “in favour” of cannabis and those against. It is between those who care about the impact of criminalisation and those who don’t, a subset of whom merely want to sound macho. Decriminalisation in one form or another has been proposed for a quarter of a century. In 2000 the Police Foundation committee on drugs, of which I was a member, adviseddowngrading cannabisfrom a class B to a class C drug and in effect decriminalising it – but politicians never followed through. This was despite apoll by the Mirrorin 1997 showing that almost two-thirds of the public were then in favour of decriminalisation.In 2004 cannabis wasreduced to class Cbut not decriminalised. Then, in 2009, Gordon Brown played tough and returned it to class B. The then home secretary sacked the government’s drug supremo, Prof David Nutt, for evenbreathing the word reform. By 2010 there were43,000 convictionsa year for drug possession,more than halfof them for cannabis. An internal government report recommended decriminalisation in 2016but was suppressed. The government even denied afreedom of information request, as if national security were at stake.The more studies and inquiries recommended reform, the more Whitehall dug in. Courts and jails became increasingly clogged and have remained so ever since. The hottest market for cannabis in Britainis now his majesty’s jails.The UK is adrift in the western world in still wasting billions on its “war on drugs”. Half of US states have legalised and licensed cannabis, including cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In California there arecannabis cafes, cannabis farming estates and evencannabis sommeliers.Of course there have been problems, not least withhard drugs in libertarian Oregon. New York’s licensing system has not worked, withillegal outlets outnumbering legal ones. But no one wants to go back. As it is, more Americans todaysmoke cannabis than tobacco, including an astonishing five times more among those aged 18 to 34. There has been no noticeable collapse in American people’s health. Even Donald Trump favourslegalising cannabisfor personal use in his home state of Florida.Other countries, such as Canada and Uruguay, have legalised cannabis. Many more have decriminalised possession, including Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and, as of last year, Germany, where individuals cangrow and use small quantities.Plenty of British police forces have also gone down the Falconer route to some degree. There has beende facto decriminalisation in Durhamand a number of other forces, as well as a successful but not repeated Metropolitan police trial in Lambeth, south London, in 2001.Other countries have researched, experimented and innovated. They have found ways to handle cannabis without disaster. Many places, such as Colorado, have taxed it and seen a boost in local revenue. Strong cannabis, or skunk, is bad for you but large numbers of Americans are clearly finding cannabis preferable to tobacco. It is not going away, any more than alcohol or cheeseburgers.British home secretaries behave like the politics addicts they are. They close their eyes and ears and scream. The real issue in Britain is not drugs. It is the systematic ruining by the state at vast expense of tens of thousands of young lives each year. The damage is done not by cannabis, but by criminalisation, which draws young people into gangs that deal it and from there towards hard drugs and imprisonment.The result is that society suffers a monster misdirection of police resources. Violent crime in Londonhas increasedalmost every year for the past decade. There has been a rise insexual assault, car and phone thefts and petty fraud. Shoplifting in London rose by an extraordinary54% last year. Imagine how much time the police would have were they not spending so much of it stopping, searching, and testing people for drugs.Volunteers struggling to combat drug use – defying the government by testing drugs at music festivals, combating Glasgow’s drug problem and keeping children out of county lines – have known one thing for the past quarter century. Whatever needs to be done about drugs, the criminal law as enforced in Britain is a useless answer. Police forces and charities have tried to advance decriminalisation against rigid opposition from Whitehall. As for elected mayors and local discretion, forget it. Westminster’s contempt for local democracy is unrivalled. The truth is that what is lacking is not more reports or more brains, it is more guts. On drugs, Britain is still in the dark ages.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCannabisOpinionDrugsSadiq KhanLabourHome OfficecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to rip them out | Emily MulliganRead moreMy mother is a competent, unsentimental gardener. Last spring she came over to “help” in mine. This involved ripping four ancient rose bushes from the flowerbed along the front of our house on the basis that I could “do better”.Her statement, in its vague enormity, echoed across the months that followed, tingeing my cups of tea at the window above the bereft garden bed. Was it a vote of confidence or menacing battle cry? Could I do better? My mother’s words warbled through the summer heat and fell like petals as the weather cooled. The flowerbed remained empty, save for some weeds and nasturtiums, and a stem of vanquished rose bush piercing through the soil like a hand through a grave.I’d liked the roses, though nobody else seemed to. They were colourful and fragrant and reminded me of somebody’s glamorous great-aunt. Surely that was a start. I could put something bright and lovely in their place. It would be simple after all.

Thunder clapped as I pushed through the gate and made my way to the information booth where the attendant was sheltering.“Is it too late to plant?” I asked faintly, as the Little Match Girl struck her last match in the snow. But the woman in the booth seemed to hear my real question: was it too late to be a gardener?

But the finer details tell a story we might all be familiar withThu 5 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 11.36 EDTShareThe intrusion of politics into personal relationships has been an eagerly documented feature of the Trump-Brexit era, which this week found its perfect expression: a granular account of the end of the marriage between Sarah Vine andMichael Gove. You may think, as I did, you’re not interested in this, but hold up. A recent excerpt in the Daily Mail from How Not to Be a Political Wife, Vine’s forthcoming memoir, contained not only the suggestion that Brexit ruined their marriage, but that a key trigger in its collapse was Andrea Leadsom’s political manoeuvring. Has Andrea Leadsom ruined any of your relationships? It is certainly a question worth asking.Or more broadly: do people really break up with each other because of big-P politics? In the case of Vine/Gove – which sounds like a tortured play at the National that, despite the playwright’s best hopes, never transferred to the screen – it’s a complicated picture. This wasn’t a separation brought on by opposing views about Europe, but rather, in Vine’s account, by the stress caused when her husband backedBrexitand drove a wedge between the couple and their pro-European friends and colleagues. Brexit broke their marriage but only because it put in motion a train of events that ended in David Cameron standing down, Leadsom scuppering Boris Johnson’s first run for top office, Theresa May becoming prime minister, and, ultimately, Gove losing his cabinet position.This isn’t how most of us experience politics, which is to say with a sense of immediate, personal jeopardy. Still, when Vine writes “politics had infected every aspect of our lives – and it caused untold damage”, refers to “BB (Before Brexit) friends” and suggests huffily “I don’t know Andrea Leadsom and have nothing against her, so I’m not 100% sure why she effectively became the touchpaper by which Michael set fire to the Boris leadership campaign and thereby, eventually, to our lives together”, you get the gist of a household in which conflict organised itself around a single political moment.This is recognisable. I’ve just read Elizabeth Strout’s latest novel,Tell Me Everything, in which, returning to her usual setting in Maine, she suggests it is entirely possible to sit on a bench in the sun and chat pleasantly to a friend who voted for Trump, except when that friend meets a man online who deepens her delusions about immigrants and how food banks are exploited by people too lazy to work – and then friendship across the divide doesn’t work. When the novelists give up, you have to worry.In reality, of course, the political issues that have caused the most friendship breaks recently have been neither Trump nor Brexit, two causes so clearly defined between left and right that few of those from one camp were pre-existing friends with the other, but rather Israel/Palestine and gender. I was just in New York, where a friend said with something like shellshock that half her social group isn’t speaking to the other because of opposing views on the Middle East. In these fights between friends, every shred of evidence is marshalled against one another so that “we disagree on this subject” becomes “she was always like this”, before advancing, inevitably, to “she’s a lunatic”. Some political disputes are just that, of course, while others ennoble a personal beef that’s been going in the friendship for some time.Anyway, back toVine and her memoir, to which we come for the political gossip and stay for the kabuki-style prose, in which Vine toggles between a what-are-men-like eye-roll and a seemingly genuine loathing for her ex-husband. “Michael had repeatedly told the nation that he’d never run for leadership,” she writes at one point, suggesting a relationship between Gove and “the nation” that might come as news to the nation.Mostly it provides us with insight into the weirdness of other people’s marriages, a worthy distraction in these fraught times. “I think better when I’ve written things down,” recalls Vine, “so, before Michael was up that Monday, I wrote an email to him that clarified my thoughts.” Do you write your partner summarystrategy emails and then inadvertentlysend them to a PR called Henry, who is different to the Henry you meant to send them to but unfortunately you exist in a milieu in which all the men are called Henry, and this wrong Henry leaks it to the press? A story worth the cover price alone.Towards the end of the excerpt we discover that, as is often the case when people fall out over politics, Brexit is a proxy for more quotidian and depressing dynamics. The Goves are moving house and, in Vine’s telling, her husband does precisely bugger all to help. “Michael opened up his briefcase, removed a couple of books, kicked off his shoes and repaired to his side of the bed to read them … Mum and I did everything – and I do mean everything. I was incredibly upset.” Division of labour, mental load, a man who lets his wife and her mother create a home for him while he focuses on more important things – a marriage done in not by Brexit, perhaps, but still politics.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One poll, published a month on from thesupreme court rulingthat the legal definition of “woman” in the Equality Act is based on biological sex, found63% supportiveof the ruling and 18% opposed. But younger people were far more likely to be in the latter camp, with 53% of 18- to 24-year-olds disagreeing with the judgment. In my age group, 50-64, the figure was just 13%.

Last monthLady Hale, the octogenarian former president of the supreme court, became one of them when she argued that the ruling had been misinterpreted, telling a literary festival she had met doctors “who said there is no such thing as biological sex”.The progressive explanation for the age gap is in the name: progress. As the arc of history bends towards justice, younger people are ahead of the curve. Social scientists call this a cohort effect, which basically means that when you are born is one of the influences (along with income, education and so on) on your politics. In relation to transgender rights, the reasoning is that people born since the 1980s are more relaxed about sex and sexuality, and more committed to personal freedoms including the right to define one’s own identity. The obvious catch to this analysis, at the moment, is the way some young men have swungtowards the hard right.If a cohort effect applies when it comes to gender, and assuming that future cohorts are in agreement, gender identity advocates can look forward to winning this argument eventually. Older, conservative voters (and politicians and judges and journalists such as me), who don’t think someone’s trans identity should take precedence over their biological sex when society decides which sports teams or prisons they belong in, are just causing a delay. This was the view endorsed by David Lammy in 2021 when he said there were“dinosaurs […] in our own party”who want to “hoard rights”. The extinction of such people would, he implied, sort things out in the end.Along with other middle-aged, gender-critical women, I have got used to dismissals such as Lammy’s. One of us, Victoria Smith, wrote a book about such attitudes and called itHags. But terminology aside, I think those who characterise this struggle as being between young progressives and ageing reactionaries are mistaken. While I fully support transgender people’s right to be protected from discrimination, I don’t regard the erosion of sex-based entitlements – including single-sex sports and spaces – in favour of an ethos of “inclusion” as either liberal or leftwing.On the contrary, I think valuing inclusion over bodily privacy (in changing rooms) or fairness (in sports) is sexist – since women are more disadvantaged by these changes than men. And while gender identity campaigners claim autonomy and choice as progressive, even socialist, values, I see their emphasis on the individual’s right to self-definition as congruent with consumer capitalism. Multinational corporations, including banks and retailers, embraceStonewall’s Workplace Equality Indexand fly Progress Pride flags from their buildings because the shift away from the class politics of redistribution towards the identity politics of personal expression suits them.In 2023 the 40th British Social Attitudes survey described the widening age gap in UK politics as “a puzzle”, with changing party loyalties only partly mirrored in answers to questions seeking to place people on a left-right spectrum or a liberal-authoritarian one. To anyone looking for answers to the question of why such age differences exist – in relation to the supreme court or other issues – I would suggest that as well as cohorts (gen X versus Z and so on), they should consider the life cycle. Clearly, some things matter more to people as they get older, pensions being an obvious example. What if biological sex is another?This rings true with aspects of my own experience. For example, it wasn’t until I had children that I learned about birth injuries, came face to face with pregnancy and maternity discrimination, or understood that the gender pay gap is also amotherhood penalty. It’s not that I hadn’t been aware of my female body before this. But one of the things about having babies is the way that the biological and social become so enmeshed. More recently, I’ve become fascinated by female evolutionary thinkers such asSarah Hrdy, whose life’s work has been to explore this tangle.The Guardian view on the UK supreme court’s equality ruling: a clear legal line, a blurred social one | EditorialRead moreNow, at 53, there is menopause and ageing. Most weeks my yoga teacher has something to say about the importance for women of strength-building exercises to ward off osteoporosis; of keeping our femur bones firmly in our hip sockets and using muscles to hold our reproductive organs in place.That male and female bodies go wrong in different ways is nothing new: themost common cancer for womenworldwide is breast cancer, while in Englandprostate canceris the most frequently diagnosed in men. What has only recently become better known, thanks to advances in medical research and campaigners such asCaroline Criado Perez, is that even when we get the same diseasesthere are differences, with examples including heart disease, Parkinson’s and dementia.As with reproduction, later-life physiological divergences have social and economic consequences. Social care is a feminist issue due towomen’s greater longevity, as well as the sector’spredominantly female workforce. Most of thepoorest pensioners are single womenas many wives outlive their husbands, but also because of lower average lifetime earnings linked to women taking breaks from employment to care for children.And what about men? Like women, the older they are, the less likely they are to tell pollsters that gender identity should replace biological sex as a legal and social category. This makes sense to me, since my argument is that consciousness of sexual difference accumulates across the life-course. The fact that men are far less likely to be actively involved in campaigning on this issue than gender-critical women – even when they agree with us – is also easy to understand. Now, as in the past, men need legal protection against sex-based discrimination, abuse or injustice much less often than women.I don’t presume to predict that today’s gender identity activists will one day change their minds. But it has never seemed clearer to me than it does now that women and men have some different needs and experiences that the law must recognise. Far from an old fogey’s statute, I think the 15-year-old Equality Act, with its staunch protection of sex-based rights, is full of life.Susanna Rustin is a social affairs journalist and the author of Sexed: A History of British FeminismDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The same reason Starmer is struggling in the pollsMartin KettleDecades of failures have left liberal democratic governments unable to command public confidence when it really mattersThu 5 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 06.38 EDTShareDefence reviews and foreign policy resets seem to turn up almost as often as the Sussexes’ lifestyle brand relaunches these days. Labour’sstrategic defence reviewthis week comes less than two years after the Conservatives’ hardly less detailed defence white paper in July 2023, which in turn was a “refresh” of Boris Johnson’s ambitious integrated review of defence and foreign policy of March 2021. By this measure, it must be doubtful if, come the 2030s, analysts will look back on Keir Starmer and John Healey’s review and say it broke the mould.TheLabourgovernment was entitled to try to put its own stamp on defence policy, of course, and its review team of George Robertson, Richard Barrons and Fiona Hill did a good, reasonably independent job. Yet this 2020s pattern of repeated strategic adaptation and refocus feels like the new normal now. It is also true that grand strategy does not often survive prolonged contact with the real world. In wartime, as the US general, later president, Dwight Eisenhower once put it, plans are useless but planning is essential.Today, though, war is no longer an academic possibility. So defence policy must adapt afresh, and at pace. Labour’s defence review does not always do this convincingly. Most of the imperatives and innovations of the day revolve around resisting the threat from Russia and adapting to the new weaponry of the drone and cyber age. At times, though, this is hard to reconcile with the review’s dogged assumption that the transatlantic alliance will remain the bedrock of that resistance.Johnson’s 2021 review aimed to recast British foreign policy in the light of Brexit. In some ways, like Johnson’s delusional British tilt towards Asia, it represents a worldview that has gone with the wind. In others, especially on Russia, it describes a conflict that still confronts Starmer today. Yet Johnson’s review came out as Covid was starting to upend the global economy and before Russia invaded Ukraine. The 2023 refresh took those newer convulsions on board but could not, in its turn, know about the most recent disruption: Donald Trump’s return.It is pathetic and shameful that Trump’s name does not appear once throughout the new defence review’s 140 pages. Its absence reflects Labour’s – and London’s – bred-in-the-bone fear of offending the US president. Even so, it cannot disguise that this is a defence review for Britain in an age of greater US isolationism. Trump’s unreliability and his administration’s manifest contempt for Europe cast a long shadow over the whole document and over the government’s determination, even in the context of next week’s Whitehallspending review, to prioritise defence in line with Nato urgings.Since history never stops, this week’s review may itself soon look out of date. Events may grab hold of the steering wheel at any time.China may invade Taiwan, for example, or Russia turn up the heat in the Baltic or against Moldova. Iran may finally test a nuclear weapon. Trump may annex Greenland. Even the ending of the Ukraine war, not just its continuation as before, would necessitate a big course correction and reshifting of priorities for British policy too.If there is a thread running through the document, it is that 21st-century Britain is a big, but not a global power, whose security priority lies in Europe, not elsewhere. The overriding goals for British defence policy are thus, as always, to defend the nation against direct threats, and to make the necessary contribution to the maintenance of peace, freedom and commerce on the European continent. Brexit did not change that. But it was a dramatic illustration of how easy it is to delude a nation that there are magic answers to grindingly difficult problems.The Guardian view on UK military strategy: prepare for a US retreat – or be left gravely exposed | EditorialRead moreIt is a mistake, however, to seek blind refuge in the belief that the world has always been a conflicted and messy place, and therefore to assume that 2025 is merely another unfortunate iteration of it. This may indeed be true in a very long view sense. But it does not adequately explain why 21st century governments in many liberal democracies – not least in Britain – struggle to mobilise national support to bring about almost any big and effective change, not just in defence policy but domestically.It is not enough to blame Russia alone for the suffering in Ukraine, or to denounce the United States uniquely for turning its back on European security – even though both are hugely culpable. Part of the problem also lies closer to home. The issue is that while the liberal democratic nation state is the only meaningful game in town, it is no longer delivering what it once seemed uniquely capable of providing for its people.The run-down of defence following the end of the cold war is merely one example of this widely felt failure, albeit an important one. One can select others from most areas of national life. They range from not embracing the digital revolution sufficiently to help rebuild British industry and education, through the failure to prioritise the care of an increasingly ageing population and the cynical depletion of parts of the welfare state, to the shameful pollution of rivers and lakes, the disdain for localism and the wilful neglect of national culture.The results of this are inescapably wounding to politics itself. The most striking thing that has happened in the last 11 months is that Labour has managed to turn an election victory into what looks increasingly likely to be an election defeat when the time comes. Why has this happened? Not because Starmer and his ministers are bad people, or because they have bad values or even bad policies. Certainly not because voters want the Conservatives back. It has happened because liberal democratic governments are no longer able to command the necessary sustained public confidence, even through rocky times, to deliver what people once instinctively looked to them for.That was true of the defence review this week, which was launched on to a sea of scepticism about Labour’s ability to pay for its plans. It will be even more true of the spending review in a few days’ time. The strands that once meaningfully bound people together within a shared national framework are weaker now. They may not be irreparable. But repairing them requires a lot of humility as well as much determination and a sprinkling of genius. There are no quick answers and it is a massively hard task.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDefence policyOpinionLabourForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a miracle it’s happening at allJamie MackayFor decades, the state has been tightening its rules around who qualifies as Italian. This is a chance to fight backThu 5 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 11.31 EDTShareWhen I first moved to Italy in 2012, I had no idea that more than a decade later I’d still be here. Back then, being British I had the luxury of EU citizenship, and thus of not overthinking things. I was excited by the prospect of spending time in a country that I’d always been fascinated by, and that was that. And yet, post-Brexit, I’m still here. Italy is my home. My community is here and I’ve made my career here. I speak the language fluently, and I’m even making progress with the hand gestures. Politically, I’ve lived through seven prime ministers – from Mario Monti toGiorgia Meloni– but, sadly, one thing I’ve never been able to do, in all these years, is vote in an election.This weekend, Italians willparticipate in a referendumthat includes a proposal to halve the time of legal residency required for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. (My own path to citizenship is covered by a different, post-Brexit process. However, a yes vote would offer me another route if my various EU-era documents and residency proofs are found wanting by the Italian bureaucracy.)Some of my neighbours face more serious obstacles. I recently attended an Italians Without Citizenship event; this grassroots organisation played a key role in gathering half a million signatures last year, which was required to bypass parliament and put this question directly in the hands of the people. Sonny, a 38-year-old man born in Italy to a Nigerian mother, told the small crowd that he’d been waiting for more than a decade to claim citizenship, because some vital documents were sent to the wrong address. Benedicta, whose parents are from Ghana, explained that she had recently gained citizenship after 17 years of bitter struggle.It’s estimated thatas many as 1.4 million people, including 284,000 minors, are living in similar states of limbo, their paths to citizenship blocked due to clerical errors, insufficient income and other systemic obstacles.The fact that this referendum is happening at all istherefore something of a miracle. For the past three decades, the Italian state has been tightening up its citizenship rules so that fewer and fewer are eligible. And the political wind is still blowing very much in that direction. Last year, a broad coalition of parties put forward a proposal to introduce a so-calledius scholaereform, which would have automatically extended citizenship to foreign nationals who have completed a cycle of schooling. Meloni’s governmentquickly quashedtheir efforts. And just weeks ago, her administrationenacted a lawto prevent foreigners from claiming Italian citizenship by descent via their great-grandparents.With the walls closing in, this weekend’s vote is a rare chance for Italians to make the country’s bureaucracy slightly more benevolent. But it has cultural implications, too. Citizens are being asked to go to the polls to make a statement about their own identity and, let’s face it, that identity, like any national identity, is so often tainted by bigotry. Meloni habitually prioritiseswhite, heterosexual, “native” Christian familiesover other Italians, and millions support her. Yet a similar exclusionary logic persists, in more subtle forms, well beyond the far right. Take thedolce vitareverie of clean-cut youths dressed in designer clothes whizzing around on Vespas and eating pizza and pasta in family-run restaurants. How inclusive, really, is this widely accepted fantasy of a country perpetually frozen in the 1950s, that foreigners and Italians alike consume with such gusto?Don’t get me wrong, I love old movies and nostalgic daydreaming as much as the next Italophile. But the focus on traditional identity all too easily feeds into a desire for ethnic and cultural homogeneity, which neglects so many people’s experiences. Where do Olympic volleyball gold medal winners Paola Egonu and Myriam Sylla fit into this national story, for example? Both are Italians with African ancestry, both are, undeniably, national heroes, yet bothstruggledtogain citizenshipand both have faced discrimination since doing so. Or what about Khaby Lame, the world’s most followed TikToker, who, despite living in Italy since he was one, onlygained citizenship in 2022, more than 20 years later? These are just the high-profile cases. By relaxing the rules on naturalisation, Italians would be recognising the dignity and diversity of millions more of their should-be-compatriots, and enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process. Surely this is an opportunity for everyone involved?Meloni and her colleagues do not see it that way. Earlier this week the prime minister declared that she “will not be collecting” her referendum ballot, and several high-profile ministers, including Matteo Salvini, leader of the League party, have been encouraging people to “head to the beach” instead of participating. The government seems to be hoping that fewer than 50% of Italians will turn up to the polls, that the referendum will not reach quorum and that the organisers will be humiliated for their efforts.As a future citizen, albeit one currently without a voice, I am crossing my fingers that enough of my neighbours will demonstrate the requisite common sense and civic duty to at least show up. Politics aside, this is an opportunity for those privileged with the right to vote to prove that they care as much about the future ofItalyas I and so many of my fellow migrant-residents do.Jamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in FlorenceExplore more on these topicsItalyOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeGiorgia MelonicommentShareReuse this content"

But I got better – better in regards to cooking, and to all the other stuff tooWed 4 Jun 2025 22.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 01.56 EDTShareIf there was a single feeling that defined my 20s, it was a generalised allergy to the very concept of home: I learned it’s a myth that you only run away from it once. If you have the skills, you can spend a lot of your life dodging comfort, security and a place to return to. Which I did because I was an alcoholic, and alcoholics are always suspicious of safety. The only true way to be safe is to not drink, after all, and you do not want to stop drinking above all else.This in turn informed my relationship to food. It goes that way for all of us: foodishome. You’re not really staying in a place unless you’ve cooked in it. Otherwise you’re just a visitor. And because I had always wanted to be a visitor, I’d long been almost deliberately malnourished. I often boasted about my profoundly undistinguished palate, because everybody wants to ensure the worst decisions they make sound like some sort of quirky character trait.My pet rat is dying. I can’t stop thinking about all the things he taught me | Joseph EarpRead moreBut then an odd thing happened: I quit drinking. I tried a few times, sometimes making it stick for a few months, once for over a year. And then finally, definitively, I just … stopped. I don’t want to make it sound easy. I mean more that after years of trying to find sobriety, it seemed like suddenly sobriety found me. After that, on the odd day when I caught a glance of myself in the mirror, it seemed like the person there might be someone I might quite like, someday.It was around this time that I purchased an unusual gift for myself: a cookbook. The author was Nigel Slater, whose name rang a bell. Picking it up satisfied one of those odd urges that I had in the early days of a true commitment to sobriety. I later came to understand these urges were newfound pangs of self-preservation.I was immediately taken by the way Slater wrote about food. These were not just recipes. They were short poems, filled with astonishingly beautiful, compact phrases: at one point in Notes from the Larder, he describes garlic being as “fresh and sweet as a baby’s breath”. This poetry was what kept me going through a number of culinary disasters – I learned that before one makes something as wholly nourishing as Slater’s macaroni and tomato pasta, they have to actually learn to cook pasta.But I got better – better in regards to cooking, and to all the other stuff too. I started to cook almost every meal, a profound change to a lifetime of takeaway. I made sweet teas and fish cakes; ricotta pancakes and pink lemonades. All of a sudden, I found I had a new sentence to describe myself. I’d had a few in my back pocket for a long time, all of them either tied to my profession or my addictions: I am an alcoholic, I am a writer, I am a painter, I am a chain smoker. But now I had one which was tied to neither self-destruction nor my career: I like to cook.If you’re an addict, you need to stay sober every single day. It is work that never endsAnd then something else miraculous happened: I met my partner, Rosie. I sometimes say that she taught me everything I know to be good in this world, and I mean it. The world makes sense to me now, because she is in it. Rosie likes to cook too. For many of our early days together, I was her sous-chef, chopping beside her in the kitchen, with a record on, astonished by this feeling that had come over me, which was the feeling of happiness.These days, I do as much of the cooking in our home as I can without denying Rosie her own culinary joy. I cook for Rosie; I cook for our housemate; I cook for my friends. Because I’m a writer, I often work from home, and one of my favourite things is making something that will be ready shortly after Rosie returns from work. It feels like a little gateway into the rest of the evening; a little marker that says, we are here together again and I have something for us to eat.Destruction is sudden. Healing is slow. You don’t actually need to make that many decisions to ruin your life, but you have to make a great deal of decisions to improve it. If you’re an addict, you need to stay sober every single day. It is work that never ends. What also never ends, but is only ever briefly satisfied: the desire to eat. When I return, almost daily, to Slater’s cookbook, I am re-pledging the desire to not die; to simply, uncomplicatedly sustain myself.The other day I cooked a pasta bake. It was mostly done by the time I heard Rosie’s key in the door, the smells of cheese, salt and herbs wafting through the kitchen. And when I heard it, I thought, with a thrill: oh, she’s home. And I remembered again, properly, that I was too.Joseph Earp is a critic, painter and novelist.

He is a proven hand at directing new plays, classics and musicals. He is a very good producer who appears to rejoice in the success of his colleagues. And, at a time when the vogue is for “reimagined” versions of old plays, he is that rare figure: one who respects an author’s intentions while remaining open to new ideas. At 59 he also has an extensive list of credits without being, in words once fatuously applied to the BBC’s former head of Radio 3, John Drummond, “tainted by experience”.As artistic director of London’s Royal Court from 2006 to 2013, Cooke showed exceptional judgment. I well remember an opening press conference where he said one of his aims was to stage plays about the aspirational middle classes. He was as good as his word with productions of Bruce Norris’sThe Pain and the ItchandClybourne Parkwhich satirised, respectively, phoney white liberalism and bourgeois property fetishism.View image in fullscreen(From left) Jessica Barden, Charlotte Mills and Mark Rylance as Johnny ‘Rooster’ Byron in Jerusalem.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut Cooke also championed a whole school of then unknown young writers including Bola Agbaje, Anya Reiss, Polly Stenham, Penelope Skinner and Mike Bartlett. And it was during his tenure that the Royal Court stagedJez Butterworth’s Jerusalemnow widely regarded asthe best new play of the current century.While promoting new work Cooke has also shown his skill at directing the classics, ancient and modern. I very much admired his pairing ofThe Winter’s Tale and Pericles for the RSC in 2006in joint promenade productions. What he brought home with unusual clarity was the idea that Shakespeare’s late plays are quasi-religious experiences underpinned by resurrection myths: in a single day we saw Kate Fleetwood miraculously restored to life first as the secluded Hermione and then as the coffined Thaisa. His production of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible reminded us of the danger of unyielding intellectual rigidity and his current West End version of Shaw’sMrs Warren’s Professionsensibly trims the text to highlight Shaw’s vehemently anti-capitalist message: it also reminds us in the play’s climactic mother-daughter showdown that, in a good play, everyone is right.Imelda Staunton plays Mrs Warren and she has been a feature of Cooke’s two most successful ventures into musicals. In his outstanding2017 National Theatre production of Follieshe not only brought out Stephen Sondheim’s fascination with duality: he showed us how every character was haunted by his or her past. When Staunton’s Sally sangIn Buddy’s Eyesyou saw a woman filled with a deluded belief in her life-partner’s ardour: by the time she sang Losing My Mind the same woman was a lovelorn wreck on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Cooke’s recent London Palladium production ofHello Dolly!also breathed new life into a Broadway standard: Staunton sang the title song not in the usual style of a superannuated showbiz legend but in that of a cheery little soul renewing her acquaintance with the beloved haunt, and the waiters, of her youth.Stars, shockers, psychos and evangelists: Rupert Goold’s mighty end to his high-wire Almeida tenureRead moreCooke has worked profitably in other media. His TV production of Shakespeare’s Henry VI trilogy and Richard III was excellent and his two feature films, On Chesil Beach and The Courier, both had great style. But his domain is the theatre and he will be judged at the Almeida by his ability to combine a sensitivity to the present with a respect for the past. There is every reason to hope he will not only be as good as Goold but will forge his own style.Explore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatreRoyal Court theatreDominic CookecommentShareReuse this content"

Around the Sun (2004)TheREMalbum that REM appeared to hate: guitarist Peter Buck called it unlistenable, “a bunch of people so bored with the material that they can’t stand it any more”. In truth, the songs aren’t bad, but there’s something lifeless about Around the Sun: its best tracks sound infinitely better on the 2007 REM Live album.15. Up (1998)“I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog,” mused frontman Michael Stipe after drummer Bill Berry’s 1997 departure from REM. “It just has to learn to run differently.” Thus Up was heavy on synths and drum machines, muted, crepuscular – and a relative commercial failure. It’s too long and understated to a fault, but the best songs – Suspicion, Hope, Airportman – are worth trawling for.14. Reveal (2001)They had nearly split during the making of Up, and were now steadying the ship. Closer to the sound of “classic” REM (though there’s still a lot of electronics), Reveal is sunny but wistful. It may not be quite a return to peak songwriting form, but the single Imitation of Life is insanelycatchy.13. Collapse Into Now (2011)REM ended their career with an album that feels weirdly career-spanning. Oh My Heart – recently given a boost thanks to TV series The Bear – recalls their early 90s; Überlin and Discoverer evoke their college-rock years. It wasn’t the triumphant finale they might have hoped for – sales were indifferent – but no disaster either.12. Accelerate (2008)Both Stipe and Buck threatened to end REM if Around the Sun’s successor wasn’t an improvement; hence this Jacknife Lee-assisted attempt to harness the power of their acclaimed live shows in the studio. There’s plenty of grit and punch, with Buck’s Rickenbacker ringing out, and the songs are strong without providing a classic.11. Green (1988)View image in fullscreenBill Berry, Peter Buck, Michael Stipe and Mike Mills of REM in the 1980s.Photograph: Lora Voigt/ShutterstockStand and Pop Song 89 were REM at their most commercial, but Green was a darker, more introspective major-label debut than those singles suggested, as shown on World Leader Pretend, I Remember California, Hairshirt, and the oddly eerie love song You Are the Everything. The production makes it the most dated-sounding REM album, but there’s still a lot to love here.10. Chronic Town (1982)Their debut mini-album offers REM at their rawest: despite the experimentation that apparently took place – producer Mitch Easter deployed tape loops and recorded Stipe’s vocals outdoors – it sounded like a band playing live. InWolves, Lower, Carnival of Sorts (Boxcars) and Gardening at Night, it featured songs so great they needed no adornment.9. Out of Time (1991)View image in fullscreenStar power … the band circa 1994.Photograph: Chris Carroll/Corbis/Getty ImagesWidescreen and confident where Green was slightly scattered and tentative, Out of Time turned REM into superstars. Not everything here still works (although full marks for effort with the KRS-One collab Radio Song), but when Out of Time hits – Losing My Religion, Country Feedback, Me in Honey – it’s hugely impressive.8. Monster (1994)Made by a band in turmoil – they temporarily broke up during its recording – Monster is effectively old-fashioned REM (guitars far louder than vocals) put through a distorted glam-rock filter. Its lyrics are preoccupied with sexuality: Stipe came out after its release. Not what a mainstream audience wanted in 1994, it sounds pretty magnificent now.7. Reckoning (1984)You would never know that Reckoning was written and recorded in a hurry by a band exhausted by touring. Crisper and more straightforward than their debut, it feels awesomely confident, although Stipe’s vocals, plaintive but hard to understand, retained an enigmatic air, particularly on standout So. Central Rain (I’m Sorry).6. New Adventures in Hi-Fi (1996)Partly recorded during the seemingly cursed Monster tour, this is perhaps REM’s last unequivocal triumph. New Adventures in Hi-Fi is filled with weary disillusion – “The fame thing, I don’t get it,” sings Stipe, who had just signed one of the biggest record deals in history – but also with raggedly wonderful songs: the closingElectroliteis a career high.5. Fables of the Reconstruction (1985)The REM album that most betrays their geographical roots – or perhaps the tense recording sessions. A southern gothic darkness hangs over even the upbeat tracks: Life and How to Live It deals with mental illness, and there’s something ominous about Driver 8. Less ecstatically received than its predecessors on release, it sounds incredible 40 years on.4. Document (1987)Their biggest album at that point was also REM’s bleakest, filled with intimations of environmental collapse and horror at Reagan-era America: even the joyous It’s the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine) has obvious apocalyptic overtones. Here they sound arena-ready, without compromising their vision or quality.3. Lifes Rich Pageant (1986)View image in fullscreenStipe and Buck on stage in the 1980s.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsA joy from start (the distorted folk-rock guitar figure that introduces Begin the Begin) to finish (the fantastic cover of the Clique’s late 60s obscurity Superman), Lifes Rich Pageant was forceful where its predecessors had been oblique. It features an embarrassment of songwriting riches: Cuyahoga, Fall On Me, These Days.2. Murmur (1983)The genius of REM’s debut album proper lies not just in the magnificent songwriting but the sense of mystery it conveyed. Everything – title, cover, lyrics, an atmospheric production that buries the vocals and pushes the drums – was inscrutable. Here is music rooted in various traditions, from folk-rock to post-punk, that at the time seemed utterly fresh.1. Automatic for the People (1992)Not everyone was delighted by REM’s huge mainstream success: naysaying former fans were winningly invited to “kiss my ass” by Buck, and, listening to their biggest album, it’s hard to see what their problem was. It’s packed with fantastic songs, dark in tone (The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite and Man on the Moon offer rare glimpses of light) and unexpected in its influences: opener Drive was inspired by David Essex’s Rock On. Everybody Hurts is probably too overplayed to pack the emotional punch it once did, but Nightswimming is still incredibly moving, and if you’re sick of the hits, the deeper cuts sound glorious.Explore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockIndieREMfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is the project exploitative or a chance to change society?Eddy FrankelThu 5 Jun 2025 09.59 EDTLast modified on Thu 5 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTShareAfilthy mattress lies in the corner of an otherwise barren room. The only adornments here, screwed to the wall, are a metal table and a payphone. But this is no ordinary prison. Rather, it’s a north London gallery which has been temporarily converted into a humid, fetid cell. For 72 hours, it will cage an artist in solitary confinement.Cell 72: The Cost of Confinement at Harlesden High Street Gallery is the work of young American conceptualist Emmanuel Massillon, with fellow Washington DC artist Allen-Golder Carpenter performing the role of inmate for three days. The gallery is tiny, its glass storefront giving passersby an open view of its cramped, inhumane quarters. What they will see over the course of the performance is a black man in prison-issue attire, incarcerated behind one-way glass, suffering through the ignominy and humiliation of solitary confinement. It is a stark reminder of the cruelty currently being endured by thousands of prisoners who have fallen victim to the American prison industrial complex.View image in fullscreen‘You might say, “wow, this seems cool”, but there’s real people that are being put in these situations’ … Cell 72.But if the idea of an artist recreating a cell and pretending to be imprisoned sets you on edge, you’re not alone. What Massillon and Carpenter are doing could easily be read as little more than an exploitation of others’ trauma. Are they not fetishising the prison experience for artistic gain?“The purpose of the project is not to exploit prison culture or black men being incarcerated for profit. We are trying to raise awareness,” says Massillon, who points out that 15% of the sales from the exhibition will be split between the US prison reform organisationDC Access to Justice FoundationandVolunteer Supported Education, a charity which helps young offenders at Feltham Prison and Young Offender Institution. “I don’t think people really know the horrors of prison, because you might listen to a song, you might hear it in music, and you might say, ‘wow, this seems cool’, because people glorify it, but there’s real people that are being put in these situations. I came up with this project to show people that this isn’t a place you want to be.”View image in fullscreen‘No matter your socio-economic background, when you’re black, you’re still black’ … Cell 72Though neither Massillon nor Carpenter have been to prison, they say that growing up in Washington DC – a city with one of the highest incarceration rates in America – made them aware of the the brutal societal impact of the prison system.“We talk often about being black and from America and our personal experiences of having our family members incarcerated,” says Massillon. “A lot of people talk about the people who are incarcerated, but they never talk about how it affects your family and the psychological trauma it inflicts on the people around you.” He talks about how prison changes people, how they have to adapt mentally to survive, how they go in as one person and emerge as someone totally different. People can, he says, come out “over aggressive, with this animalistic nature, lashing out at my family, threatening our safety”.Growing up surrounded by friends and loved ones being sent to prison creates a constant feeling that you might be next. “No matter your socio-economic background, when you’re black, you’re still black,” says Massillon. “The thing about being racially profiled is nobody knows at first glance if you’re a doctor, a lawyer, an NBA player or a street level thug, you’re just black, so if you match the profile, that’s literally all it takes.”Thirty-two per cent of American prisoners are black, despite making up just 13% of the general population. In Britain, those figures are 13% and 4% respectively. Those are statistics used by racists to justify their bigotry, but they tell a wider story of injustice that Massillon and Carpenter are laying bare.Massillon took inspiration for the installation from pioneering German conceptual artist Joseph Beuys who, in his seminal 1974 piece I Like America and America Likes Me, locked himself in a room with a wild coyote for three days. “What is my coyote? What do I fear?” asks Massillon. “My coyote is prison. Just walking in the street, just being a black man, I could really go to prison at any given time.”View image in fullscreen‘My coyote is prison’ … Emmanuel Massillon.“Going to prison is probably one of my single greatest fears,” echoes Carpenter. “My way of coping with it is getting as close to it as I can, facing it, not turning myself away from it.”So Carpenter will spend three stuffy London summer days stuck alone in this tiny gallery, getting closer than ever to the idea of imprisonment. When I visit the gallery, on a muggy early June morning, it already feels claustrophobically tight and airless: it smells of bodies and sweat, it’s too warm, too small, the atmosphere both dull and unnerving. Carpenter will spend their time in here making improvised artworks out of disposable toothbrushes – the kind used to create makeshift prison shivs – whittling them down and turning the shavings into hourglasses to mark the passing of these 72 hours. After the performance, the prison-issue sweatsuit will be hung on the wall – all that will be left for the rest of the exhibition’s month-long duration will be the remnants of time served.In among all the fear and anxiety of prison life is an acknowledgment that music and film have both spent decades glorifying it. “Prison itself is so intimately tied up with black American culture, especially through hip-hop,” says Carpenter. “It’s inseparable almost, prison is a pressure cooker that deeply impacted and influenced blues and jazz and eventually rap music. I think the glorification of violence through music is at an all-time high. It’s almost like a caricature of itself at this point.”It’s the same here, where an entire generation of UK drill rappers have ended up in prison for crimes ranging from murder to drug trafficking, as English artistRIP Germain recently exploredat Cabinet Gallery to devastating effect. Going to jail has become something to aim for, a status symbol, a badge of honour.View image in fullscreen‘Going to prison is one of my single greatest fears. My way of coping with it is getting as close to it as I can’ … Allen-Golder Carpenter.Photograph: Noah FordSo how do Massillon and Carpenter counter allegations that what they’re doing is appropriative, a kind of incarceration cosplay? “People might project whatever motive on to it they want, but what else could we talk about?” says Carpenter. “I don’t really want to paint pictures of flowers when [black people] are locked up at an all-time high and prison is one of the biggest businesses in America. When private universities like Columbia own shares in prisons and have an active role in profiting from disadvantaging people of colour on a mass scale. I’m trying to say the thing that’s not being said.”Regardless of whatever criticism gets levelled at them, they’ll be satisfied to get people talking, thinking. “I preserve history through artwork and put it in places where people can see it publicly to start conversations,” says Massillon. “These are real-world problems that are being put in front of you. What do you do to make sure that people stay out of these situations? Are you donating money? Are you checking in on your loved ones that are incarcerated?”Ultimately, he’s hoping this confrontational work causes people to examine their own responses. As he says: “If you’re mad at us for creating a mock scenario of somebody locked in a box, why are you upset?”The Cell 72 performance by Allen-Golder Carpenter is atHarlesden High Street Gallery, Londonfrom 6-8 JuneExplore more on these topicsCulturePerformance artUS prisonsPrisons and probationArtRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She called it pat pat putt putt and it was the most legendary game of mini-golf I’d ever played. Until now.Swingers, the interactive exhibition central to this year’sRising festival, brings a dash of whimsy and weirdness to the game. Each of the nine holes is designed by a different female artist in homage to the sport’s little-known feminist history: created in 1867 when women were barred from playing the main game at St Andrews links in Scotland. As curator Grace Herbert says on the Swingers preview night: “We think of [mini-golf] as silly, childlike and infantilising – but it has a subversive history.”In the cavernous space of Flinders Street Ballroom – a hidden section of the train station that lay dormant for decades and now Rising’s go-to venue for quirky art events – this playful, and playable, exhibition comes to life. The ballroom’s peeling walls and eerie hallways are a well-suited match, with most of the courses accessed through doorways along the hall, like portals into different worlds.View image in fullscreenArtist Kaylene Whiskey’s work requires you to putt through Cathy Freeman’s legs.Photograph: Eugene HylandView image in fullscreenSingaporean-Australian sculptor Nabilah Nordin’s work is made of bread.Photograph: Eugene HylandThe rules: there’s a 10-stroke limit, you can move your ball one club-length from the edge of the course without penalty, and an out-of-bounds ball can be placed at the point of exit with a one-stroke penalty. My friend and I decide we will approach it much like any game of mini-golf. There are no scorecards, so we make one in the Notes app then rapidly abandon it.Each night, a 14-year-old tasks two actors with playing her parents.

It’s straightforward – I sink my ball in three putts. Still got it!But the first hole lulled me into a false sense of security. At the second hole, designed by Natasha Tontey, I place my ball through a Devo hat and try to hit it into an adjoining room. Other people’s balls bounce off mine, moving it further away from the goal. I decide that I should keep my day job. I don’t even sink the ball before I move on.View image in fullscreenBritish artist Delaine Le Bas’s golf ‘balls’.Photograph: Eugene HylandFrom there, it only gets loopier, and the game becomes almost secondary to immersing yourself in each wild world. Australian artist Pat Brassington riffs on a carnival classic to create a creepy course that I can’t get away from quickly enough (compliment). The old adage about trying to fit a square peg in a round hole is taken literally by British artist Delaine Le Bas (an extremely difficult and very funny hole). Experimental film duo Soda Jerk contributes one of the more disturbing works – you’ll never look at Teletubbies in the same way again. And Singaporean-Australian sculptor Nabilah Nordin creates a beautiful house made of bread, but the slippery plywood floors make the game tricky.View image in fullscreen‘Experimental film duo Soda Jerk contributes one of the more disturbing works – you’ll never look at Teletubbies in the same way again’.Photograph: Eugene HylandThe signature latex of Tokyo artist Saeborg manifests in us donning wearable ears and tails, the latter of which becomes a makeshift golf club. Another friend there calls this hole the most stressful experience he’s ever had, and gives us a hot tip about which tail to choose. We absolutely smash it, hitting the large foam balls into the goal twice in the 90-second allotted time period.

US rapper Bktherula’s hole is easy to sink with a single stroke, but players are encouraged not to aim for that as hitting the ball against obstacles produces different sounds.View image in fullscreenMiranda July’s hole, Wave of Fortune, gives out life advice.Photograph: Eugene HylandThe final hole is designed by US writer and film-maker Miranda July: you launch your ball through a large wave and it rolls to a maze of different paths, each of which has a flag with life advice on it. “You are insulting yourself in ways you find insulting. Insult a hat like that and I promise the hat will cry. Today you stop,” reads one.It’s a bit live, laugh, love for my liking, but they’re sweet and earnest, and we could all probably use that at the moment. When we run around to see which words of wisdom we’ve received, it’s too late – the balls have gone, and we don’t know which holes they’ve sunk into. As we exit the ballroom, I think to myself that we’ve gained some wisdom regardless: art can and should be fun, weirdness is wonder, and the scenic route is always worth taking.Swingers: the Art of Mini-Golf is open in Melbourne’s Flinders St Ballroomas part of Rising festival until 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsRising festivalGolfArtMiranda JulyMelbournefeaturesShareReuse this content"

How much can they stand before pressing the giant red “Eject” button that sits in front of them?How to describe what Thick & Tight do? They trained as dancers, but their work is more like cabaret, or dance-theatre sketches. Sometimes there’s text, lip-syncing, imitations of real-life personalities; the absurd and the deadly serious live side-by-side; it can be hugely poignant and hugely silly, a belly laugh or a lump in the throat, a cry against climate change, or Hay-Gordon and Perry disco dancing dressed as Donald Trump in the shape of a bright orange pantomime horse talking out of its bottom.View image in fullscreenOne of most natural dancers you’ll ever see … Daniel Hay-Gordon.Photograph: Rosie PowellThe pair’s identity as queer performers is at the heart of Natural Behaviour, questioning what is deemed “natural” in society and nature (tribute is paid to the 1970s study that found Californian seagulls nesting in female pairs, which shook up some of those ideas). They embody people, flora and fauna with outsider status, joined by guest performers including disabled dance groups Corali and Camberwell Incredibles. There are voiceover descriptions at the beginning of each section, describing the performers and what they’re going to do. It’s for inclusivity and accessibility, but is effective at giving everybody an in, directly connecting us to the dancers with a key to sometimes avant garde ideas, whether Annie Edwards dancing an endangered nightingale (and a curlew, swallow and white-tailed eagle) with neat feet and swiftly turning spirals; Perry as a blade of grass; or Jahmarley Bachelor in an ode to the dust in Quentin Crisp’s flat.Two standout turns: charismatic Azara Meghie throwing in some hip-hop to her embodiment of James Baldwin, with his wise words played in voiceover, and Hay-Gordon’s dance of remembrance set to Brahms. On theme, Hay-Gordon is one of most natural dancers you’ll ever see; dancing is absolutely innate for him, and it’s transfixing to watch him deeply inside the music. This is a show that’s rich, thoughtful, ridiculous and quite wonderful.AtBattersea Arts Centre, London, until 7 June then at theLowry, Salford, 10-11 JuneExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreCabaretDanceBattersea Arts CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

We came together in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It was like college: hanging out with my friends, having fun, not really acting. For four weeks we were in boot camp, where we’d dance and do conditioning in the mornings – so sit-ups, stretching and learning the choreography. In the afternoons, we’d learn our 10-part harmonies and go into the recording studio. Sometimes we were really dorky and said: on Friday we’re all going to wear the same colour T-shirts, just to be like a squad.You’ve worked withSir Derek Jacobitwice – in Juliet &Romeo, and the upcoming Tinsel Town. How was he?Derekj2210It was pretty cool to be in scenes with him. Even though we weren’t doing the iambic pentameter, it was interesting to watch how the language fell off his tongue. We were filming in this medieval Italian church. It was zero degrees, but he was so easygoing: always telling stories, with this fun grandpa vibe. He’s one of the most amazing Shakespearean actors ever: in his 80s, still crushing every line. I kept wanting to get selfies with him, because he really is one of the greats.Greggs gave me a £50 VIP voucher: four sausage rolls for the price of three. That’s a lot of sausage rollsI felt the same when I worked with Dame Judi Dench onCats. When I started acting, I always wanted to be like Dame Judi, because I thought I was going to be a serious actor. It just turned out that people like laughing at me. She’s like your grandma, in that you just want to hold her hand, and help her. She’s also got a wicked sense of humour: she’d be throwing out jokes and cursing, which I thought was hilarious. There have been a few times I’ve had to pinch myself. I had to do a boot camp with Sir Ian McKellen for Cats; at one point we were crawling around on the floor, pretending to lick each other. It was so funny.View image in fullscreen‘Universal is developing scripts for another film … the fanbase for Pitch Perfect is awesome.’Photograph: Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures/AllstarWhat is it like being a guest onthe Graham Norton Show?

Other talkshows can be a bit of a struggle, but with him, it really is just like having a chat. I did the rap because I was telling the story of when I was 11, I had a rap group with my sister, which was probably the most uncool thing ever, seeing as we were two white girls from Sydney. I took my shoes off because I’m terrible at doing anything in high heels.

I play a lot of dumb, stupid characters, but in real life, I do have two degrees – in theatre and performance studies, and law.View image in fullscreenRebel in the 2022 film The Almond and the Seahorse.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyI have a charitable connection to Africa because when I was 18, I did a gap year, and travelled from South Africa to Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. When I got to Mozambique, I got malaria really badly. We didn’t have time to put up the mosquito nets and I woke up with my face covered in mosquito bites. Two weeks later, I was in hospital because it was a really bad strain. I don’t know whether it was the disease or the drugs, but I was hallucinating really badly, and I hallucinated that I won an Academy Award. It was so visceral and real that I came out of hospital and said: “Hey everyone, I think I’m going to become an actor now.” The South Africans were like: “Ah, no, Rebel. The malaria has demented your brain.” My parents were pushing me into law school, so I did law by day and acting by night.Has your positive body transformation led to different scripts coming your way?BradLopez22In the movie I just shot in the UK, Tinsel Town, I play the love interest to Kiefer Sutherland, which is probably not at all the kind of role you’d think I’d get cast as. There was a tendency to think: she’s no longer Fat Amy [from Pitch Perfect], so she can’t play those characters any more. There was a little bit of: also, is she still funny? I’ve just been offered the lead in a horror movie. So it’s not just comedies, musicals and romcoms. It’s good to surprise people.Did I have a Greggs? [Sutherland is anoutspoken fan, so Greggssent a vanto the set]. Yes. I enjoyed a sausage roll. Greggs gifted Kiefer and I a £50 VIP voucher, which I still have. You get four sausage rolls for the price of three as well.

On-again, off-againtrade tariffsimplemented by Donald Trump, which precipitatedpre-order delaysfrom Nintendo, made the 5 June release date of the highly coveted hardware feel more like a hope than a certainty. A potential price hike up from $450 loomed over launch day, but would-be buyers’ fears did not come to fruition.Nintendo’s Switch 2 is the upgrade of my dreams – but it’s not as ‘new’ as some might hopeRead moreNintendo’s maneuvering around Trump’s tariffs isn’t over, though – far from it. The Japanese console maker managed to luckily launch its device squarely within a90-day tariff pauseissued by the president. If tariffs on countries such as India and Japan return to the levels proposed during Trump’s “liberation day” speech at the start of April, however, experts say Nintendo will have to limber up for yet another delicate trade policy dance.It’s possible that a Switch 2 bought during the holiday season will cost more than it did at launch date. Nintendo’s top gaming hardware competitors – and essentially anyone shipping electronics to the US – have been watching the Switch 2 saga with bated breath.“What saved Nintendo in this case was that Trump chickened out,”Notre Dame professor and international economist Robert Johnsonsaid.Vietnam tariffs forced Nintendo to scrambleSince its launch in March 2017, the Switch has become one of the best-selling video game consoles in history, with more than 150m units sold worldwide. Nintendo teased its successor in January and gave a full reveal during an 2 Aprillive stream, announcing the device would ship on 5 June with a hefty $450 price tag in the US (or $500 when bundled with Mario Kart World). Just hours later, Trumpstepped up to a podium at the Rose Garden, chart in tow, to announce a new volley of tariffs on imports on countries with a trade deficit with the US.Among them: a 24% tariff on Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered, and a 46% tariff on Vietnam, where the bulk of its Switch manufacturing takes place. Stock marketsplummetedas Nintendo fans collectively wondered whether the company would pass the costs of those steep duties on to them.US pre-orders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin later that week on 9 April. Nintendo delayed that date so it could “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions”. The 5 June release date, the company noted, would stay the same. Gamersflockedtovarious social media sitesto vent their frustration – much of it directed not at Nintendo, but at the Trump administration. Pre-orders resumed on 24 April and, predictably, the console quickly sold out.Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for commentPrepared for the wrong tariffs, saved by ‘taco’Johnson notes that Nintendo, like many other consumer electronics makers, has spent years grappling with the question of where to produce.In 2019, during the tail end of the first Trump administration, the gaming company began shifting production of the Switch from China to Vietnam in an effort to sidestep US tariffs on Chinese imports. Nintendo still manufactures some Switch products in China, but those units are typically shipped to non-US markets. Other major consumer tech companies, such as Apple, havesimilarly moved parts of their manufacturingoperations from China to countries such as India to mitigate tariff impacts.View image in fullscreenGamers wait in line outside the New York Nintendo store.Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesThat strategy was ultimately rendered moot when the current administration announced a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, an unexpected move that Johnson says “caught virtually everyone off-guard”. These looming tariffs, and the uncertainty surrounding them, could affect the pricing dynamics of nearly any consumer tech product entering the US.Sony and Microsoft,both expected to release new consoles in 2027, will likely face similar challenges as Nintendo.“It takes a long time and significant capital outlays to bring new production facilities online. Producers really like to operate in a stable environment.” Johnson said. “The current trade environment is the exact opposite of that.”The “liberation day” tariffs could easily have led to a higher Switch 2 price or a delayed release. But Nintendo managed to avoid that fate thanks to backpedaling by the Trump administration, a behavior described by the Financial Times using the acronym “taco” – short for “Trump always chickens out”. Trump’s call for a 90-day pause on tariffs to allow negotiations with targeted countries meant the Switch 2 could still be released during a window in which the import taxes wouldn’t apply.And even if negotiations with Vietnam ultimately fail, reports estimate Nintendo hasalready shipped around 746,000Switch 2 units to the US, which would not be subject to the higher tariffs.Pricier add-onsNintendo consumers will not walk away unscathed by tariffs. The company has said accessories for its device, a major part of the Switch’s dual form factor, will “experience price adjustments”. So far,according to CNBC, docks used to play the Switch on a full-size screen will cost $10 more than before, while straps for the two controllers will see a $1 increase. Johnson also said he wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo considers raising the console’s price around the holiday season, especially if Trump moves forward with a 46% tariff on Vietnam.“I find it difficult to imagine that the Trump administration will want thousands of stories written during the holiday season about how Trump ruined Christmas,” Johnson said. “So I expect they’ll find a way to climb down, but – like everyone else – I’m not sure about that.”But there’s another reason why Nintendo may have an incentive to keep console prices from climbing too high: themajority of its revenuedoesn’t come from physical console sales. Increasingly, the real moneymakers – for Nintendo and its competitors – are software and online subscriptions, neither of which are subject to tariffs.“In the end, Nintendo wants to sell consoles to get people to buy games and accessories,” Johnson said. “As a result, it may be willing to hold down the price of consoles.”Explore more on these topicsNintendo SwitchTrump tariffsGamesTariffsNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

In remarksreported by the Hollywood Reporterand Screen, Elba said: “There’s a crazy number across the entire continent – less than about 3,000 cinemas, actual cinemas that you and I have grown up with. I would love to be able to tackle some of that, because I believe that the cinema experience that we all have gone through should be experienced by a new generation. I don’t think it should all be on a phone.”Elba added: “How do I do that? Building a model of data that shows that actually people do want to watch films, that they will enjoy the experience of theatre. I’m not going to try and boil the ocean, but it’s going to happen one bit at a time … Yeah man, I want to build the African Odeon.”Elba, who was born in London to a Sierra Leonean father and a Ghanaian mother, has spoken previously about his ambitions to support the film industry in sub-Saharan Africa,saying in October: “It’s really important that we own those stories of our tradition, of our culture, of our languages, of the differences between one language and another.” He is also part of a consortiumdeveloping an “eco city” on Sherbro Island in Sierra Leone.In London, Elba mentioned an AI-powered app called Talking Scripts that turns written material into audio, aiming to help people with reading difficulties such as dyslexia, as well as a digital wallet he had co-founded, called Akuna Wallet, designed to help creatives send money across borders more easily than before.He added: “Any film or piece of music that was made in the 80s was made on equipment less superior than your phone is now. These kids know that. They are making films, they are making songs on these devices. Ultimately, there is a wall when it comes to getting it out there and monetising it, [but] I think the confidence that Afrobeats,Nollywood, has given African creators, young creators, is huge.”Explore more on these topicsFilmIdris ElbaAfricaSXSWFilm industryFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

His return makes him the first film cast member to reprise the role on stage.“Being a part of the Harry Potter films has been one of the greatest honours of my life,” he said. “Joining this production will be a full-circle moment for me.”Felton will join the cast at New York’s Lyric theatre from 11 November for a 19-week run, the production confirmed on Thursday.

Now it’s time they stopped helping advertise banks that support whatIsraelis doing to Palestinians.”More than 300 arts workers and creatives, including the actors Alfred Enoch, Samuel West, Tim Crouch, Harriet Walter and Juliet Stevenson have signed an open letter supporting Churchill’s decision.The project Churchill was working on had not been announced but would have been the first time she had worked with the Donmar since 2020’sFar Away.Barclays sponsorship has led to controversy at a UK arts organisation before.In September 2024, the campaign group Culture Workers Against Genocide released an open letter – backed byMaxine Peake and signed by 1,000 others– aimed at pressuring Sadler’s Wells to cut ties with Barclays.Last year the activist group Bands Boycott Barclays ran a successful campaign to get several music festivals – including Latitude and the Great Escape – todrop the bank as a sponsor.Barclays declined to comment.But the bankstates on its website: “While we provide financial services to these companies, we are not making investments for Barclays and Barclays is not a ‘shareholder’ or ‘investor’ in that sense in relation to these companies.”In June last year, CS Venkatakrishnan, the group chief executive of Barclays,wrote in the Guardianthat the bank did “finance some companies making defence equipment, alongside their civilian products”.He defended the decision, adding: “These companies are supported by our democratically elected governments for their role in protecting the UK and allies in Europe. We will not undermine our own national security by de-banking them.”Culture Workers Against Genocide, which co-organised the open letter, said: “Arts institutions have an ethical duty not to contribute to oppression and injustice. By continuing to accept sponsorship from Barclays, Donmar Warehouse is helping to launder the bank’s reputation as it profits from Israel’s genocide in Palestine.”Donmar Warehouse has been approached for comment.The Donmar receives no Arts Council England funding after losing its£500,000 annual grant in 2022. It seeks private funding from “memberships, philanthropic donations, corporate partnerships, and grants”.In 2022,Churchill was deprived of the lifetime European Drama awardshe had received earlier in the year, due to criticism of her play Seven Jewish Children (which wascalled antisemitic by some critics) and her pro-Palestinian campaigning.Explore more on these topicsCaryl ChurchillDonmar WarehouseBarclaysBankingIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The company plans to “grow BookKind into one of the UK’s leading book retailers while making a meaningful impact by supporting charities that help the most vulnerable people in society and address critical global challenges.”The eight charities readers can donate to, chosen by Monwell team members, are Dementia UK, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity, War Child UK, Read for Good, Surfers Against Sewage, Mental Health Foundation, Runnymede Trust – the race equality think tank – and Maggie’s, a cancer care charity.“The money raised throughout the year will help us offer vital practical and emotional support to people with cancer and their families across the country,” said Adam Feder, head of corporate partnerships at Maggie’s.“We were warmed by the staff selection of War Child following an incredibly difficult 2024 for children, young people and caregivers affected by war globally,” said George Baverstock of War Child UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Writing on Instagram, Stewart complained of “not feeling well”.Now Stewart has cancelled a Thursday concert, too, apologising to fans and explaining: “My doctor ordered a bit more rest while I recover from the flu. Thanks for your love and understanding.” He has not announced whether that concert will be rescheduled.Stewart has had a few health setbacks this year. He cancelled three concerts in January after suffering both strep throat and Covid in the space of a few days, and after a concert in May, he was seen with a sign around his neck reading: “Sorry. Cannot talk. Having vocal rest.”The 80-year-old is currently on his One Last Time tour, which he has said will be his last time doing a “large-scale world tour”. Speaking in November 2024, he added: “I have no desire to retire. I love what I do, and I do what I love … I’d like to move on to a Great American Songbook, Swing Fever tour [in 2026] – smaller venues and more intimacy.”He is set to perform the Sunday teatime “legends” slot at Glastonbury, made even more nostalgic and crowd pleasing this year as it will be followed by Nile Rodgers & Chic. That evening’s music will then be rounded out by Noah Kahan and Olivia Rodrigo.Stewart returned to the top of the charts in 2024 with his album Swing Fever, a collaboration with Jools Holland.Explore more on these topicsRod StewartPop and rockGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025Music festivalsFestivalsLas VegasnewsShareReuse this content"

He described Goold’s Almeida as “a beacon of quality and innovation” and added: “I’m hugely grateful to him and his team to be handed an organisation in such good health. I look forward to building on this legacy and to future adventures in this magical space.”A specialist in musicals, Cooke staged a celebrated revival of Stephen Sondheim’sFollies at the National in 2017and reunited with one of its stars, Imelda Staunton, on an admired revival ofHello, Dolly! at the London Palladium last summer.His production of George Bernard Shaw’sMrs Warren’s Profession, starring Staunton and her daughter Bessie Carter, opened at the Garrick theatre last month. Other West End productions directed by Cooke includeMedea with Sophie OkonedoandGood with David Tennant. During his time at the Royal Court he directed plays by Caryl Churchill,Tarell Alvin McCraneyandBruce Norris. He has also directed two feature films,The Courier(starring Benedict Cumberbatch) andOn Chesil Beach(adapted from Ian McEwan’s novel), as well as three episodes of The Hollow Crown for television.The chair of the Almeida board Tamara Ingram said Cooke is “celebrated around the world and brings a wealth of experience both of running a theatre and as a consistently acclaimed, award-winning artist. We are greatly looking forward to what lies ahead and to seeing how his leadership defines the next chapter of the Almeida.”Goold called it a “wonderful appointment” and said that Cooke’s tenure at the Royal Court brimmed “with confidence and new voices”. He added that Cooke “will bring his many talents to bear on continuing the rich story of our great theatre”.It was announced last year that Goold will leave the Almeida to run the Old Vic,replacing Matthew Warchus. The Almeida’s executive director Denise Wood is also standing down to pursue freelance projects. Recruitment for Wood’s successor will begin shortly.Explore more on these topicsAlmeida theatreTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

I hear people on TikTok are up in arms over a Queensland farmer/Canberra Raiders player/Bachelorstar scoring a book deal. Who is this modern day Renaissance man?Julia, a colleague described Luke Bateman’s four years with the Raiders as the one of an “honest toiler, who always played above his weight”, and to be frank, it’s a fairly apt description for the guy.The Toowoomba countryman grew up as the typical sports-playing boy. On his now famous TikTok account, he has spoken earnestly about reading books in a toilet cubicle as a child so his peers wouldn’t witness his sensitive side.Of course the girls are reading horny fairy books. It’s cheaper than travel and more fun than therapy | Emily MulliganRead moreBut that didn’t stop him from appearing on The Bachelor’s 11th season in 2023 and confessing his love to contestant Ellie Rolfe in the finale (he retired from the Raiders in 2019 after a knee injury).Contrary to the show’s usual success rate, the pair split up months later. But he quickly found a new love to fill his life: #BookTok. He posted his first video in April, speaking passionately from inside a car about his love of books and struggle to “share those things” as a male in “blue collar work”.He now has more than two dozen videos, 178,000 followers, and has landed a book deal.Fans are following him for his book reviews, but they’re also there for his rugged good looks. Inone video, he joked about multiple comments claiming he looked like Shrek after the ogre became a human.“To begin with, I was like, ah, that’s a hard pill to swallow,” he said, donning a large brimmed hat. “But then I went and Googled … and I was like, they make a good point.”So tell me, what kind of book is he going to write? A farming manual? A sport biography? A reality TV tell-all?You’d think so, but guess again. Bateman’s first book, expected to be released in early 2027, will be an “epic fantasy” story about a young boy battling hardships in a magical world. His contract is a two-book deal, so there’s more to come.If you follow his TikTok, this category may not come as a huge surprise. Bateman has filmed several videos about his love of fantasy fiction, including one that runs through his “GOD TIER” fantasy reads and several dedications to giants Robin Hobb and Garth Nix.That said, he’s also delved into “smut” books (or “cliterature”, as his followers call it), posting a detailed review ofthe popular Court of Thorns and Roses series.I didn’t see that one coming. Obviously he has many skills, but has he ever published anything before?No. But he has written poetry. In one video, posted to TikTok this week, Bateman shared prose he had written while going through a breakup (we’ve all been there), titled “When Magic Had a Name”.Publishing has also been a long-held aspiration for Bateman. When announcing the surprise book-deal on social media, he described it as a “childhood dream come true”.“I’ve wanted to be an author my whole life,” he told his audience, teary with joy. “I can’t wait to write this book.”How have people responded to the news?It’s fair to say the feedback has been mixed.Some commenters were quick to congratulate Bateman for his Simon & Schuster deal, but others questioned how he had nabbed the deal.In response to backlash, the publishers said they had assessed the scope of his series including its “magic system” and the “journey of the protagonist” as well as receiving a 10,000 word writing sample, including a synopsis.‘I dropped a C-bomb into Tolstoy’: one man’s quest to translate War and Peace into ‘bogan Australian’Read moreYet the issue has reignited debate about power and privilege in the literary industry, including the weight given to celebrity platforms over more marginalised authors.The inauguralAustralian Publishing Industry Workforce Survey on Diversity and Inclusion, published in 2022, found less than 1% of Australian publishing professionals were First Nations, 8.5% had an Asian cultural identity and about 5% identified living with a disability – well below population parity.In Bateman’s own words, speaking with theentertainment news website Chattr: “Obviously, a lot of these conversations are very new to me … I can wholeheartedly understand how angry and resentful these things would make people.”Explore more on these topicsPublishingExplain it to me quicklyRugby leagueCanberra RaidersAustralian booksShareReuse this content"

The piece is one of the earliest and best examples of the wooden, string-carved sculptures that she became really well known for.”Clayton added: “It’s an incredible opportunity. If we’re successful, it would be pretty much on permanent display to the public, either in Wakefield or we would lend it to important exhibitions around the country.”Sculpture with Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue and Red was made in 1943 after Hepworth had moved her family to St Ives inCornwallwith her then husband, Ben Nicholson, to escape the blitz during the second world war.Hepworth had to obtain a special permit to use wood for her sculptures and the piece was crafted using string, one of the first times she had worked in such a way.“They required a government permanent permit to carve into wood,” said Clayton. “She wrote a lot about the difficulties of actually obtaining seasoned wood that wouldn’t split immediately when she started carving. There’s only a handful of these that are still in existence.”Hepworth once said the strings represented the tension she felt between “myself and the sea, the wind or the hills” in Cornwall. She worked in St Ives up to her death in a fire in 1975.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The work was cherished by Hepworth and the plaster prototype of the sculpture was the only piece she brought with her to Cornwall.Clayton said that the making of the piece was remarkable, not just because of the difficulties related to the war but also the time constraints Hepworth faced due to her domestic workload.“She was juggling childcare and domestic chores,” Clayton said. “She wrote in a letter to a friend and critic how she had to work for 30 minutes, and then she had to cook for the children, and then she’d go back to the studio and carve for another 20 minutes. Then she’d have to go and do some washing. It’s sort of astonishing that it was made within these circumstances and with the threat of war in the background.”The piece was last shown in the UK as part of the Hepworthretrospective at Tate Britain in 2015– one of the rare times it’s been seen in public.That exhibition was the first big UK staging of her work since the late 1960s. For much of her lifetime Hepworth lived in the shadow of Henry Moore – the other great British 20th-century sculptor.”Clayton said Hepworth had expressly wanted her work to be seen in the flesh. “She said you have to see the sculpture in three dimensions – you have to walk around it. You can’t get the sense of it from a picture, you have to see them in person.”This article was amended on 5 June 2025. An earlier version erroneously reported that the artwork that is the subject of the funding drive was “Sculpture with Colour (Deep Blue and Red)”; the text, subheading and image have been changed to correctly refer to Sculpture with Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue and Red, and also to clarify Eleanor Clayton’s role as head of collection and exhibitions at the Hepworth Wakefield.Explore more on these topicsBarbara HepworthSculptureArtCornwallnewsShareReuse this content"

Tonight is about legacy – not just the Grammys and multi-platinum hits which made Richie’s name, but the way that songs such as Truly and the Commodores’ Three Times a Lady have become intertwined with people’s lives. “I’ll just fit myself in best I can,” he booms, laughing.He has joyful chemistry with his band, and together they put plenty of polish on Richie’s trophy cabinet of hits. Dancing on the Ceiling is glittery and buoyant, veering into Van Halen’s Jump before some surprisingly gritty guitar shredding. Brick House is raw and funky, with Richie slinking left to right with the band in tow, like a matured T-Birds. Sometimes the band (and the audience) overpower his glorious, buttery voice, but he ad-libs and riffs and ends every song with a proud, showbizzy “yeah!” – even tender, cinematic ballads such as Endless Love.View image in fullscreenRaw and funky … Richie and his band.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianPerhaps that montage skirted dangerously close to an In Memoriam – lots of dry ice, photos of Richie looking angelic against a night sky – but, at 75, the man himself is larger than life. He puts in a tight five between most songs, riffing on Scotland’s bad weather, and implores the audience to feel empathy for refugees and immigrants: “Those people, they’re us,” he urges. “You would do the same for your family.”This Hits tour shows us Richie on cruise control, but radiant nonetheless. He struts up and down the thrust stage, laser-focused on making the furthest corners of the Hydro feel special, and if anyone’s earned the right to lean on charm, surely it’s Richie. Tonight feels breezy rather than electric, and even a soaring, hip-shaking encore of All Night Long is homely rather than thrilling. A night of few fireworks, perhaps, but full of deep love and mutual appreciation. Such worn-in comfort takes decades to get just right.Lionel Richie’sSay Hello to the Hitstours the UK and Europe until AugustExplore more on these topicsLionel RichiePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Do you see an elephant first or a forest? A butterfly or an apple? Jungjin Lee’s exhibition, called Unseen,is in some ways an elevated version of that. The series of large, black-and-white landscape photographs – all made last year in Iceland – do not tell you anything about the times, or the place. Instead what you see depends on what is buried in you – threatening to open up that scary, unbidden “unseen”.Lee, who lives in New York, is little known in the UK beyond her photobooks. This small show of 10 works is her first solo show in the UK in a 30-year career. Her background is important in deciphering these images. Her first artistic training was in the traditional calligraphic arts, as a child growing up in South Korea. Later she studied ceramics at Hongik University in Seoul, where artists such as Lee Bul were among her peers.View image in fullscreendramatic vistas … Unseen, #83.Photograph: (c) Jungjin Lee, image courtesy Huxley-Parlour, LondonIn the late 1980s, her first photography project followed an old man living on a remote Korean island, documenting his search for wild ginseng. In a decade, he had never found a single plant. But by the time Lee had finished the project, she realised what she had made was more a reflection of her own state of mind, and that she would never be a documentary photographer. She turned her back on the genre for good.After moving to New York, she worked for a time as an assistant to Robert Frank. His attitude, rather than his style, influenced Lee, who was moved by the way he followed his instincts and interests. In the 1990s, she began to travel the US and make portraits of a decaying American landscape and its elements: the barren desert, the unforgiving wind, the endless debris. These clamouring landscapes were, and continue to be, portraits of the artist as rocks, trees, and thrashing waves. They come to be portraits of the viewer, too.This new body of work was all made last year, in Iceland. Many contemporaries of Lee have made work about or with the Icelandic elements: Roni Horn, Ragnar Axelsson, Olafur Eliasson. Lee also responds to this aspect of the place. The specific topographies there provided Lee with what she needed: dramatic vistas capable of carrying the epic literary qualities of her work, the full range of human emotion. They are brooding, fearsome and roar with the supremacy of nature. The landscape, to Lee, is an expression of existential angst and metaphorical musings. Out there is the only subject capable of holding everything that’s in here, in us.View image in fullscreenMother and child? … Unseen, #49.Photograph: (c) Jungjin Lee, image courtesy Huxley-Parlour, LondonWe are placed on an empty road that plunges into a dark abyss on the horizon (#83), or at the frothy seam of the sea and land (#55). You can almost feel the salty air slap your face in a portrait of an imposing rock standing resolute against the choppy water that whips up around it (#76). Its coarse and craggy surface seems to contain the history of the world. A smoky cloud descends on a blackened earth, its symbolism striking.What you see, of course, is subjective. A mournful picture of two rocks (#49) shows them rising like tombstones from the sea, one large, jutting out, one tiny and intrepid, as if heading off into the distance. I make out the tender figures of a mother and child, the child forging ahead, falteringly, off into the unknown. I see Frank’s influence surfacing: the “humanity of the moment.” And the moment is uncertain.You have to be a decent artist – even more so, working with a camera – to make a landscape picture interesting. Part of the brilliance of Lee’s work comes from her technical mastery, which reflects her journey as an artist, from the calligraphy of her childhood and the same raw approach to moulding the earth with her hands, adapted from ceramics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She then brushes the negative with processing emulsion soaked on to delicatehanji, or Korean mulberry paper, and bathes them at a slightly higher temperature than is conventional for fixing. This optimises the mottled, etched textures. These hand-emulsified images are then transformed again, into digital images, at which point she tinkers with the contrasts and prints them again.The brushstrokes to the surface are palpable and are as evocative Korean ink paintings – you can’t help but trace the influence of a pictorialist tradition that seeps unmistakably into Lee’s work. The knockout textures and the charcoal tones are aesthetically closer to drawings. At times the photograph seems to dissolve completely: in #10, a minimalist picture of a sloping mountain is stretched to abstraction, its suggestive black lines merely mimicking what was there.Jungjin Lee: Unseen is atHuxley-Parlour Gallery, London, until 5 JulyExplore more on these topicsArt and designPhotographyExhibitionsArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

That ambition faded in his 20s and 30s as his success as a conductor increased, and it wasn’t until the 1930s, when he was in his late 40s, that Fürtwängler returned to composition, perhaps as an escape from the ever worsening political situation in Germany and Austria, and the pressures that the Nazis placed upon him.From then until his death in 1954, he produced a succession of large-scale works, the most significant of which were three symphonies. The Second Symphony, which Fürtwängler began in January 1945, immediately after taking refuge from the Nazis in Switzerland, is the most massive of them and regarded as his finest achievement; Neeme Järvi’s performance with the Estonian orchestra, which, while recognising the work’s massiveness, never seems unnecessarily slow, lasts 74 minutes.Yet it’s a strange, problematic work, easier to admire than to like, and built from an amalgam of Romantic voices from Schumann to Richard Strauss with Bruckner and Brahms featuring most prominently. From moment to moment the music is pleasant enough, but without ever becoming truly memorable; themes tend to move in predictable, stepwise fashion and developments are worked out at pedantic length.Järvi’s recording joins versions by Barenboim, Jochum and Fürtwängler himself already in the catalogue; if it’s a work that carries real curiosity value, it’s one that few are likely to want to hear very often.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Specifically a rock star of the late 80s and early 90s, when he didn’t have to dress down, à la grunge, or gloss up, à la ozone-depleting poodle metal, and instead slipped on a leather jacket and leaned into the camera as a freight train pulled out behind him.Defiant lands smack bang in the middle of that Peak Barnes Moment and it is no coincidence that while Barnes shared the songwriting with some old hands and near-family, the production is given over to that master of Australiana rock, Kevin Shirley. You’d know his work from early Silverchair, the Screaming Jets, the Angels, Baby Animals, Cold Chisel … and Tina Arena. You’d know his work by the ringing clarity in your ears.It’s in the in-your-face drum sound (that snare snap is sharpened to a point) and forward-facing guitars (you could do your hair in the reflection from the shine on them), and it’s in the careful middle ground of keyboards and a smattering of modern country to show range. You can recognise it in the prominence given to every corrugation of that lived-through voice and the softening agent of rich backing vocals and, in the powered-up ballad Beyond The Riverbend,even in the bagpipes. If this album were any more 1990s, it would come with a Hawkeian cigar and a Rachel haircut.A song like Damned If I Do, Damned If I Don’t has the skinny-arse shaking beat of the Rolling Stones or the Faces, but those drums won’t let you do anything other than stomp. Things are a little lighter in opener That’s What You Do For Love, its “woah-ohs” softening the ground, but the backing vocals of an escalating chorus and a hero-cast guitar solo don’t resist the temptation to go full back-of-the-beerbarn anthemic.If the muscular rock of Nothing Comes For Nothing and the brassy southern soul Sea Of Love, possibly the most satisfying song on the album, gives Barnes a moment to ease back on the throat – but there’s little evidence he was looking for respite. He rips it up in the title track and pushes it to the edges in the husky Never Stop Loving You; even at half-force in Dig Deep he feels powerful, controlled rather than raw against the saloon piano. What heart operation?That operation and its aftermath, however, does play through Barnes’ lyrical focus. Not just in the obvious I-get-knocked-down-I-get-up-again rugged roar of the title track’s “I don’t get tired, I just higher/I stand defiant”, but in the reflections of a man given yet another chance.There are throwbacks to the stories he’s told us in his series of hugely successful memoirs. Of mistakes and repair, like The Long Road’s declaration that “I’m on the long road to perdition”, and of coming through a childhood where “if you showed any weakness, the streets will make you bleed”, as he sings in Dig Deep. And there is Never Stop Loving You’s clear view of the complications and satisfactions of a long love affair that was not only life-saving but life-affirming.It’s true that this makes for an album that could hardly be said to break new ground or reach stellar heights. But it’s also true that it nails the essentials ofJimmy Barnes– and even more so, the Jimmy Barnes that people wanted to hear in the good and the bad times almost half a century ago.Defiant is out now (Mushroom)Explore more on these topicsAustralian musicPop and rockJimmy BarnesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The language that Ligeti invented for himself, which invested tonality with a whole new set of relationships and incorporated elements from a variety of non-western musical traditions, was unveiled in his Horn Trio of 1982, but it was in the two major concertos that followed, for piano in 1988 and violin in 1993, that the full power of his new language was revealed.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harmonia MundiBoth are remarkable works, which seem utterly fresh and original, yet identifiably remain part of the concerto tradition. It’s no surprise that the violin concerto particularly has been taken up by a number of soloists, or thatIsabelle Faustshould have wanted to add her reading to the series she has made for Harmonia Mundi. It is a typical Faust performance, perceptive, technically immaculate, and just a little on the cool side, and it’s paired with an equally accomplished, if a little more mechanical, account of the piano work with Jean-Frédéric Neuburger as soloist. Neuburger also includes Ligeti’s early, Bartókian Concert Românesc, while Faust leads performances of two ofGyörgy Kurtág’sAus der Ferne sequence, as exquisite interludes.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

In the coming months, she suggested, “Turnstile summer” would replace her ubiquitous “Brat summer”. Hedging her bets slightly, she also suggested that 2025 would be the summer of everyone from Addison Rae and PinkPantheress to Kali Uchis to Pulp. Nevertheless, Turnstile’s name stood out: the quintet are, at root, a hardcore punk band, a product of the fertile Baltimore scene that spawned Trapped Under Ice, Ruiner and Stout. For the most part, hardcore exists in its own world of rigid rules and codes, some distance from the mainstream: extant hardcore punk bands seldom get shouted out by huge pop stars.View image in fullscreenTurnstile: Never EnoughThen again, hardcore punk bands don’t tend to receive Grammy nominations or make the US Top 30, as Turnstile have done. Meanwhile, Charli xcx’s endorsement is just another celebrity nod in the band’s direction after backing from Metallica’s James Hetfield, Judas Priest’s Rob Halford, R&B star Miguel and Demi Lovato, who described them as her favourite band. Their tipping point came with the release of2021’s Glow On, on which frontman Brendan Yates moved his shouty vocal style towards singing, and the band expanded their musical remit in unexpected directions. They may be the only act in history to sound like a warp-speed hardcore band in the time-honoured tradition ofMinor Threator the Circle Jerks, and – entirely without irony or satirical intent – like the kind of glossy new-wave 80s pop to which hardcore was once ideologically opposed, on adjacent tracks of the same album.Four years on, Glow On’s stylistic shifts feel like a tentative dry run for Never Enough. Yates has abandoned the raw-throated aspect of his vocals entirely: the album’s lyrics seem to be dealing with relationship trauma in characteristic emo style (“lost my only friend”, “it’s unfair” etc), but something about his voice and melodies now recall Police-era Sting; there’s an occasional hint of AutoTune in the mix, too. Some of the experiments Turnstile conducted on Glow On are repeated – the vaguely Smiths-y jangle of that album’s Underwater Boi gets another airing on I Care, this time around decorated with what sounds like a Syndrum; guestDev Hynes, better known as alt-pop auteur Blood Orange, is engaged once more on Seein’ Stars, this time part of an impressive supporting cast that includesParamore’s Hayley Williams, Wire star Maestro Harrell and singer-songwriterFaye Webster.Turnstile: Look Out for Me – videoBut they’re joined by deeper forays into unexpected territory. Sunshower starts at 100mph, clatters to a halt, then reboots as a wall of proggy synthesiser and a lengthy flute solo, courtesy ofShabaka Hutchings. Dreaming has a curious, vaguely Latin American rhythmic slant, and horns courtesy members of jazzy funk bandBadBadNotGood. Dull, meanwhile, melds beefy nu-metal inspired choruses to glitchy electronic verses, the latter presumably the work of “additional producer” and xcx affiliateAG Cook. Elsewhere, there is neon-hued pop punk bathed in a dreamy swirl of echo (Time Is Happening), riffs borrowed from Black Sabbath (Sweet Leaf, to be specific, on Slowdive), distinctly U2-esque guitar solos and divebombing dubstep bass (Never Enough).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

No matter which direction Turnstile strike out in, it surprises rather than jars, the transitions smoothed out by an unfailing hooky melodicism that applies as much to distorted riffs as it does to pop-facing vocal lines. The synth-forward pop rock of Light Design and the trad hardcore of Sole might be at different ends of the stylistic spectrum, but they’re united by killer tunes. If the album has a problem, it’s not a lack of ideas or songwriting ability, but the occasional sense that Turnstile have ventured so far from their starting point that they’re in danger of losing their USP, or at least their ability to stamp their identity on the results. As songs, there’s nothing wrong with Seein’ Stars, the closing ballad Magic Man or the brief, electric piano-backed Ceiling, but they could be songs by any act within the vast, homogeneous mass of 21st-century music that exists in the grey area between rock and pop.In isolation, moments such as those can give you pause, but as part of the kaleidoscopic whole of Never Enough, they’re easy to overlook. There’s so much else happening, a profusion of ideas so deftly handled that it never feels sprawling or indulgent. If Turnstile’s grounding in hardcore has taught them anything, it’s the value of being concise. However unexpected their rise into the mainstream, it isn’t about to stop.This week Alexis listened toDemise of Love – Strange Little ConsequenceDaniel Avery, Phantasy Sound labelmate Ghost Culture and Working Men’s Club combine to make moody, delightful maximalist electronic pop.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPunkreviewsShareReuse this content"

New Zealand’s prime minister captured the world’s imagination with her empathetic leadership, her desire to prioritise the nation’s happiness rather than just its GDP, and her bold but deeply human approach to the early stages of the pandemic (though her “zero Covid” strategy of sealing borders to keep death rates low came back to bite her). She governed differently, resigned differently – famously saying in 2023 that she just didn’t have “enough in the tank” to fight another election – and has now written a strikingly different kind of political memoir. It opens with her sitting on the toilet clutching a pregnancy test at the height of negotiations over forming a coalition government, wondering how to tell the nation that their probable new prime minister will need maternity leave.Ardern is a disarmingly likable, warm and funny narrator, as gloriously informal on the page as she seems in person. A policeman’s daughter, raised within the Mormon church in a rural community down on its luck, she paints a vivid picture of herself as conscientious, anxious, and never really sure she was good enough for the job. In her telling at least, she became an MP almost by accident and wound up leading her party in her 30s thanks mostly to a “grinding sense of responsibility”. (Since it’s frankly impossible to believe that anyone could float this gently to the top of British politics, presumably New Zealand’s parliament is less piranha infested).Her book feels constructed for an international audience, eschewing domestic political detail for events that resonated globally – like the 2019 terror attack on a Christchurch mosque, after which she led the nation’s mourning with great sensitivity and rushed through gun control laws in a matter of weeks – and for the more universally relatable dramas of her private life.Ardern soldiered through the first crucial weeks in power keeping her pregnancy hiddenAs a young politician, she’d bitten her tongue through years of sniping about whether she was only there for window dressing, plus endless public speculation about whether or not she was pregnant. When a broadcaster suggested, within hours of her becoming leader, that she owed it to the country to reveal whether or not she planned to have children, “all of the times when I had said nothing … suddenly came crashing through to the surface”. On behalf of women everywhere facing intrusive questions from their bosses, Ardern issued apublic rebukethat was already going viral by the time she left the studio.The irony, of course, is that for much of the time she was batting off such questions, she and Clarke Gayford, her then partner, now husband, were privately on the emotional rollercoaster that is fertility treatment, culminating in that surprise eve-of-election conception. What happened next suggests Ardern must be steelier than she’s letting on.The new prime minister soldiered through her first crucial weeks in power keeping the pregnancy hidden, so queasy with morning sickness that she was terrified of vomiting on live TV, lying to her protection officers to cover up visits to her obstetrician. She scheduled a press conference 72 hours after giving birth on the assumption that it would be fine because “Kate Middleton did it” (unsurprisingly, it was not fine). And she was back at work after six weeks, worrying both about being seen as not coping and about being seen as copying too effortlessly, lest she be turned into a stick to beat other working mothers with. As she frequently acknowledges, it took a village – Clarke as stay-at-home dad, her mother as backup, aides who babysat – and even then it wasn’t easy. At one point during the pandemic, she sits down to play with her daughter and all she can see are Covid graphs: “I wasn’t there. Not all of me. And not even most of me.” It’s not hard to understand how she eventually burnt out.But while all this makes for an emotionally rich and candid read, the downside of skipping the political detail is that it’s hard to get a sense of how exactly her astonishing early popularity ebbed away. By the end, with New Zealand experiencing the same painful post-pandemic inflation as the rest of the world and anti-vaxxers camped outside parliament, the mood had turned ugly.Ardern seems largely untroubled by policy regrets, standing by her zero-Covid strategy – which worked at first, (albeit at great cost to New Zealanders stranded abroad when the borders closed) but was overwhelmed by the more infectious variants. She’s also notably keener to dwell on what her tenure says about kindness and empathy being powerful mechanisms for changing lives than she is to engage with the critique that she failed to deliver on some of her more tangible promises around alleviating poverty.Nonetheless, I closed the book feeling a pang of nostalgia for a time when scrapping tax cuts and spending the money on a more generous safety net, or clasping immigrants to a nation’s heart, (as she did after Christchurch) still seemed completely plausible things for a prime minster to advocate. A different kind of power, for what now feels like a sadly different world.A Different Kind of Power by Jacinda Ardern is published by Macmillan (£25).

And from late June, the whole city will go Cezanne mad, as the painter’s atelier, north of the centre, and the family home to the west reopen after an eight-year restoration.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But during Cezanne’s lifetime, and for years after his death in 1906, Aix seemed at pains to ignore the artist later called the “father of modern art”. When his widow, Hortense, offered several paintings to the city’s mainMusée Granet, director Henri Pontier declared that Cezanne paintings would enter the gallery only over his dead body.France mapThis year, however (with Pontier dead almost a century), Aix is making up for its neglect with a blockbusterexhibition at Musée Granetto accompany the unveiling of Cezanne’s studio and the estate bought by the artist’s family in 1859. The retrospective will bring together more than 130 works,including still lifes, portraits and landscapes.The paintings were all made in and around the Bastide du Jas de Bouffan, which was a refuge and inspiration for the painter for 40 years. Cezanne’s banker father acquired the 18th-century mansion with its farm and 15 hectares (37 acres) from a bankrupt client. Disappointed that his only son had no interest in finance, he still let young Paul use the ground floorgrand salonas a workspace.View image in fullscreenBastide du Jas de Bouffan; and, below, Cezanne’s depiction of the family home, painted c1885-7.Photograph: ITVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: National Gallery Prague 2025By 2017, however, the house had fallen into disrepair and was closed for a long renovation. Its grand opening is on 28 June, but we grab a sneak preview. Though now in an Aix suburb (20 minutes from the centre, or a few minutes on bus no 8), it’s a charming place, three serene storeys in five hectares of verdant grounds, its shutters painted in Aix’s signature grey-blue.Inside, projections on the walls of the grand salon recreate the paintings (later chiselled off and sold) young Cezanne made on the walls, including a “four seasons” fresco. His card players series – one of whichset a record in 2011for the highest price ever paid for a work of art – was painted here, as was an 1866 portrait of Cezannepèrereading a newspaper. (The artist and his family never used an accent on the first ‘e’ of their name: Cézanne seems to have been a later, Parisian invention.)The family later made a studio for Paul on the second floor, and its tall window, higher than the roofline, can be seen from the front. The kitchen and Madame Cezanne’s bedroom can also be visited.There’s the chestnut avenue he painted, the farm buildings and, most evocative for me, the square pondDailyguided toursof the interior (available in English) will cost from €9.50, but if these sell out, a ticket just for the grounds is still rewarding. For many fans, Cezanne’s genius lies in his outdoor works, and they come to life in the extensive gardens. There’s the chestnut avenue he painted, the farm buildings and, most evocative for me, the squarebassin(pond) that features in dozens of pictures. I’m excited to spot the lion and dolphin statues seen in several canvases, the lions with their bums in the air. (The majestic plane trees and orangery were added by later owners.)After his father died in 1886 and the estate was sold, Cezanne built his atelier in Les Lauves, then a rural area north of Aix, with views to the mountain that had long been his muse, Mont Sainte-Victoire. The 1,000-metre-high limestone ridge can be viewed from many points, including the roof terrace of our hotel, theEscaletto(doubles from €105) on the edge of the old town.View image in fullscreenA painting by Cezanne of his muse, Mont Sainte-Victoire, with Gardanne in the foreground.Photograph: AlamyIt’s a 15-minute walk from here to the atelier, up a road now called Avenue Paul Cézanne. The traditional-style house sits on rising ground, with kitchen and living areas on the ground floor; the first floor is one huge, high-ceilinged studio, with a full-height, north-facing window. This was his last workplace, where he painted the Bathers series,oneof which is in London’s National Gallery. After further renovations next winter, the lower floor will have displays including the artist’s coat, palette and satchel.If Aix had mixed feelings about its famous son, those seem to have been mutual. Of the 1,000-plus paintings Cezanne left, just one is of the city: a watercolour of the fountain in Place de la Mairie. However, he made hundreds in the countryside around, including over 80 of Mont Sainte-Victoire. So the best way to find Cezanne’s Provence is to get out of Aix.The bus to Bibémus quarry – source of the creamy ochre stone that built Aix – is like a ride through a thousand paintingsBetween the city and the mountain isBibémusquarry, source of the creamy ochre stone that has built Aix since Roman times. The bus trip there (no 6) is like a ride through a thousand paintings. These wooded hills are all protected, and daily tickets (from the tourist office) include a shuttle from the terminus at Les Trois Bons Dieux. What pictures can’t convey is the loud birdsong, southern heat and early summer scents of pine and broom.Cezanne made 27 paintings here, developing his pre-cubist style and trademark palette of blue, green and ochre. Reproductions of paintings around the quarry show the vantage point from which they were made – and their current homes: this one now in New York, others in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Baltimore …skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The atelier would have been demolished for housing had a group of US collectors not saved it in 1952. And an American artist,George Bunker, bought the Bibémus quarry in 1954 and left it to the city when he died in 1991, on condition that the land be protected and open to visitors.Canadian sculptorDavid Campbell, now in his late 80s, with wizard-like white hair, was a friend of Bunker’s and has lived here in a quarryman’s cottage for 40 years. We spy him exercising on the edge of the site and he later shows us some of his fluid works in white limestone, plus masterly recreations of medieval masonry.The Red Rock (c.1895, now in Paris’sMusée de l’Orangerie) is one of the best-known Cezanne quarry paintings, and the small post at the bottom left is still there today. But the site calls to my mindanotherin the National Gallery, with, unusually, a figure in white shirt and blue trousers dwarfed by a wall of orange rock.Visitors can also book a6pm visit to Bibémusto enjoy the setting sun on Mont Sainte-Victoire (€17pp) or a half-day electricbike tourfrom Aix (€90pp including bike hire). The area may close unexpectedly, however, if mistral winds increase the risk of wildfires.View image in fullscreenCezanne’s atelier, which narrowly avoided demolition in the 1950s.Photograph: Sophie SpitériOne town the artist did choose to paint is Gardanne, around seven miles from Aix (eight minutes by train). Here, Cezanne tourism is more informal. A plaque on the main street, Cours Forbin, shows where he lived with his wife and son for a productive year in 1885-6.Nearby Colline des Frères (Brothers’ Hill) was an open-air studio for Cezanne, and a free-to-visit walking route includes reproductions of paintings of his favourite mountain, with Gardanne and its bell tower in the foreground. (Power station cooling towers do detract slightly from today’s view.) Again, these works are almost all now in the US – one even in the White House. The local tourist office doesguided tours(€10, in English) on Fridays in July and August.There are no hotels in Gardanne, but aself-catering letmeant we could make the most of the extensive street market under towering plane trees on Cours Forbin (Weds, Fri and Sun).I’m pleased to learn that the square blobs on the right of at least two of Cezanne’s Gardanne paintings are windmills, which still stand. We climb north up Cativel hill and find three mills, one still with its sails, and the date 1567 over the door. They’re on a gorgeous rolling hillside glowing in Cezanne colours, with interlocking shadows of umbrella pines completing the painterly scene.Aix may be all about Cezanne this year, but closer encounters may well be found off the main tourist trail.Cezanne at Jas de Bouffanopens 28 June and runs until 12 October at Musée Granet.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The best time to visit an English vineyard as a punter is right now(in my opinion, of course, but surely a personal column doesn’t need that caveat every week). Hear me out: in winter, a vineyard is all gnarled wood and hard soil, which is an aesthetic I can get behind (no surprise there), but it’s perhaps not the most evocative for drinkers who want a sense of place. Winter is a good time to visit as trade, mind, because the winemaker actually has time to think about their answers to your questions, rather than panicking about whether they should have waited to bring in the ortega.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Then there’s summer: the grapes are hanging pregnant on the vine, it’s sunny, it’s sublime, but there’s simply too much work to do. As a visitor, you always feel as if you’re standing in the wrong place and you feel a bit guilty asking for a tour. But in late spring and early summer, there’s a gentle hum of anticipation. Things are about to get started.Most British wineries are concentrated down south (sorry, fellow northerners), and one region in particular really pulls in the wine tourists: Sussex. It is, like most regions in the south of England, known for producing sparkling wine, and received a PDO (protected designation of origin) in 2022. To get the PDO, Sussex sparklingmustbe made in the traditional, champagne-style method, and it must also be approved by an accredited organisation that’s part ofthe Food Standards Agency.OK, that’s all good to know and everything, but where can I go to drink the stuff? England’s largest single-estate organic wine producer,Oxney, is one of my favourites to visit. It’s all charred timber buildings and feels a lot more intimate than other, bigger operations nearby, and itssparkling non-vintage roséis a perennial crowdpleaser (as, for that matter, are any of its vintage stuff, if you can get hold of it). There are vineyard cottages for larger group visits and a couple of shepherd’s huts for couples.Rathfinnyis another vineyard with charming rooms, and several places to eat/drink extremely well (it tends to be a bit windy, though, so pack a sensible windbreaker), whileStophamrecently reopened its Saturday tasting tours with the winemaker. And though I haven’t yet been myself, I’ve been told thatArteliumis a real treat, and I really like their wines. Much the same goes forWiston’s lavish sparkling wines, and I definitely need to put faces to the names.Today’s pick features a few Sussex wines to get you in the mood for a late-spring excursion. Yes, they’re a fair bit spennier than my usual recommendations, but I’ve already explained the reasons behind the relative expense of English wine inan earlier column. Besides, things are often cheaper at the cellar door, which gives you one more reason to visit and support these English wineries directly.An introduction to Sussex winesNutbourne Vineyards Sussex Reserve 2022£15.49 Grape Britannia, 12%.

The title is as provocative as the book is fascinating in the way it dismantles the legendary origins and marketing of “typical” products and “traditional” dishes to reveal engrossing histories, often more recent and inextricably bound to exchange and migration (Grandi is a professor of food history and economics at the University of Parma). In fact, far from taking anything away, the book makes a rigorous and constructive contribution to a bigger, more interesting global conversation about the past, present and future of food. It is also very funny.I mention this having picked up the book to re-read the chapter on polenta. Grandi reminds us that it is a category of food (rather than a specific one), with polenta being a cooked mixture (the ancients called itpuls, which is Latin for “a mush”) made from something ground into flour and water. Historically, polentas were made from barley, oats, rye, millet and buckwheat, until the second part of the 18th century, when cornmeal cooked into polenta became a principle source of nutrition for many in the north and central regions of what is now Italy.Grandi’s pragmatic, unsentimental but empathetic writing is welcome in this chapter as he explains the role of polenta right up until the 1980s. He also observes that, when we put our slice of polenta next to the sausages and bacon on the barbecue, “we are not repeating an ancient gesture, we are just demonstrating for the umpteenth time the enormous gap that exists between today’s food variety and the unrelenting monotony of our ancestors’”. I interpreted this as him saying that, by seeing things as they really were, rather than indulging in a misty romanticism, it allows us to understand better and celebrate more.With this in mind, today’s recipe is a polenta biscuit inspired by a combination of three things: the polenta biscuits of Molise in southern Italy; a biscuit from Piedmont calledkrumiri, which is shaped like a moustache (or curve, smile or boomerang), and what I had in the cupboard.The biscuits will be delicate, and especially so when warm, so leave them to cool significantly before lifting them on to a rack to cool completely. While they do firm up, the biscuits retain a melting crumble texture thanks to the granular polenta. I find them irresistible with tea, coffee or alcohol. To serve, dust heavily with icing sugar and, if there are any left over, keep in a tight tin or plastic box.Cornmeal and butter biscuits inspired by krumiriMakesabout 30100g caster sugar140g room-temperature butter2 egg yolks160g cornmeal(instant polenta is fine)100g plain flour, plus extra for dustingPinch of saltIcing sugar,to finishIn a large bowl or a food processor, beat the caster sugar and butter until combined, then add the egg yolks and beat again. Add the cornmeal, flour and a pinch of salt, and bring everything together into a soft ball of dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Working with lightly floured hands, break off handfuls of the dough, roll each piece into a 1cm-thick rope, then cut into 8cm lengths. If the dough cracks as you roll it, simply squeeze it and the warmth of your hand will mould it back into shape. Put the lengths on a tray and, if you want, use a fork gently to imprint the surface. Gently bend each biscuit into a curve.If possible, and if the tray fits, chill in the fridge or put it in the freezer for 30 minutes, then bake for 12 minutes, until the biscuits are lightly golden. Turn off the oven, open the door, and leave the biscuits inside for 20 minutes to finish cooking. Leave to cool completely before lifting on to a rack.To serve, dust heavily with icing sugar, and keep any leftovers in a tight tin or box.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkPolentaBiscuitsBakingEggsSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"
