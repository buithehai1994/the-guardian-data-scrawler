Few wanted to see itPhoebe GreenwoodSun 10 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 08.01 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Aldo Jarillo/The GuardianWhen I moved to Jerusalem in 2010, the foreign correspondents there offered me some unsettling advice: “The first year here you’ll hate the Israeli government, the second year the Palestinian leadership, by the third you’ll hate yourself.”It’s best to leave before four, I was told, in the interest of sanity. I nodded along thinking how sadly cynical they were. I would do better than that, I told myself. I did not.I lasted a little under four years in Israel and Palestine. In that time, I reported onforced displacementand punitive bureaucracy (Israel’s occupation is expanded through denied permits, homedemolitionsand revoked ID cards). I wrote aboutchild killings,war crimesandterrorism(perpetrated by both sides). I tried to explain as best I could the annexation of theWest Bankand thecollective punishmentof two million people in Gaza without using forbidden phrases such asapartheidor war crime. I included the necessary balance of voices and opinions. But still, every report of an atrocity in Palestine was met with highly personalaccusations of bias. Editors were often twitchy, readers disengaged.Why have those of us whose job it was to report the atrocities in Palestine been so spectacularly unable to stop them?After two years of this, a grim reality became clear: people did not want to hear about it. By year three, I had started giving up trying to make them listen and the self-loathing arrived. Cynicism among reporters is a useful cipher for the fear, desperation and impotence that news industry norms do not allow them, but it has a dangerous side-effect: it dulls outrage. Without outrage, crimes such as apartheid, ethnic cleansing and genocide can continue uninterrupted – and they have.Over a decade later, with Gaza’s annihilation playing in my social media feed, I have been finishing my first novel,Vulture, for the past two years. It is the story of a reporter, Sara Byrne, trying to make a name for herself amid a war in Gaza. She is a destructive character steeped in cynicism and self-loathing who emerged, in all her surprising unpleasantness, as I tried to resolve my own experience as a journalist covering Palestine. There were nagging doubts and questions I could not shift, like: why have those of us whose job it was to report the atrocities in Palestine been so spectacularly unable to stop them?Social media images of Gaza cafes can’t hide truth: Israel is starving PalestiniansRead moreThe action in Vulture is fiction but set within the real time frame of the 2012 war in Gaza, which I covered. I was visiting Gaza City when the Hamas leaderAhmed al-Jabariwas assassinated. I arrived at the site of his “liquidation”within an hour, the burned-out frame of his car still smouldering. I noticed the blood splatters reaching the second floor of surrounding buildings in the writing ofmy first front page. Israel had launched its Operation Pillar of Defence.Wars were never surprising in Gaza. Since 2006, when the last general election in Palestine paved the way for Hamas to take power and Israel and Egypt to impose their blockade, there has been a regular exchange of rockets fired by Hamas and bombs dropped by the Israeli military. Every few years, Israeli generals declared a military operation to bomb back Hamas infrastructure. Chatting comfortably off the record, retired military people called it “mowing the grass”.In the2009 war– 1,400 Palestinians killed,11,000 homesdestroyed,white phosphorus shellsdropped on markets and hospitals – Israel had not let foreign journalists into Gaza. In 2012, they did. Most of us stayed at theAl Deira hotel, eating and sleeping next to one another, reporting and filing the same stories. Uniformed staff brought us coffees and french fries as airstrikes threatened their homes and families.View image in fullscreenGaza City’s destroyed Deira Hotel on 22 September 2024.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesEvery day, we visited bombed homes and I made notes:smell of cooking gas, kitchen gonelittle kids playing in rubble find a beetlea crying woman tugging at a buried mattress screamsWe watched a steady stream of dead and injured arrive at al-Shifa hospital missing limbs and heads, dust-covered children mute and shaking having seen their parents killed. Doctors told us of power and drug shortages. I noted them:no disposablesanaesthetics running out, can’t do surgerieslots of women and children with amputated limbs, quite clean, bombs do the job for usWe went to the funerals of whole families and spoke to mourners who asked us: “You see anyone here with a gun?”After 10 daysof Israel’s operation – 167 Palestinians killed, 1,500 targets in Gaza hit, 700 families displaced – a truce was declared. The particular camaraderie you form with your Palestinian colleagues under airstrikes is severed abruptly when they drop you off at the Israeli border; you are thrilled to be driving back to normality, but they are unable to. You’ll see them again when the next flare-up in violence brings you back.But when the next war came in 2014, I was already home in London, an editor on the Guardian foreign desk: 50 days of fighting, 2,104 Palestinians killed, 10,000 wounded. News audiences, we heard, weretuning out. The fighting ended, and I left the foreign desk to return to reporting. People looked at me warily when I brought up Palestineagain. Was I a weird zealot? Or worse, anactivist? I was neither, but outside of activist circles, the “political complexity”of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict left little appetite for anything other than its most violent escalations or worst humanitarian catastrophes. Cynicism, it turns out, is better company than outrage.So I stopped talking about what I knew was going on over there – the daily humiliations of occupationin the West Bank, the threat ofsettler terrorismbacked by an occupation force, the extraordinary trauma of living a day in Gaza – until I sat down to start work on a novel in 2015 and Palestine poured out. I was drawn straight back to the Al Deira hotel, reimagined as The Beach. I found myself telling this huge, indigestible tragedy in small, messy, blackly funny, heartbreaking, angry human stories. It was a relief, describing freely the Gaza I knew.If you care about what’s happening in Gaza, you should amplify Palestinian voicesHossam ShabatBy 7 October 2023, I had left the Guardian. I watched news of the Hamas terror attack devastated and sickened, then gripped with cold dread for what would follow inGaza. Like anyone who had covered the place for any length of time, I had seen what was coming rehearsed for decades. Those nagging questions became urgent: had I done everything I could to warn this was coming? No. Did that make me complicit? Maybe.Israel hasnot allowed foreign pressinto Gaza for this war. Our understanding of what is happening there comes from the Palestinian journalists living it and they are beingkilled in extraordinary numbers(176, a 10% mortality rate), their newsrooms obliterated along with their families and homes. The ones who remainare starving. Their reporting is not balanced, it is personal and outraged.View image in fullscreenMourners attend the funeral of members of the press who were killed in an Israeli strike, at the Al-Awda Hospital at the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza on 26 December 2024.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesA year before Israeli forces killed him on 24 March, local journalistHossam Shabattold his 175,000X followers: “The biggest problem is not Western journalists being unable to enter, but the fact that Western media doesn’t respect and value Palestinian journalists … No one knows Gaza like we do, and no one understands the complexity of the situation like we do. If you care about what’s happening in Gaza, you should amplify Palestinian voices.” His message stung deeply. It clarified the discomfort I had felt as an unnecessary interlocutor between western readers and Gaza’s tragedy, raising more questions about my work there.Western journalists reporting from Palestine did not stop the atrocities because we believed that was not our job, we were there to bear witness. Maintaining our impartiality is crucial if we are to be trusted. But were we not also meant to hold power to account? If we had condemned the US and Europe-backed power we knew was perpetrating these atrocities with the conviction and outrage they deserved, would60,000 people still have been killed in 21 months?a book coverAs Vulture lands on bookshelves in the US, UN experts have confirmed thatfamine is under wayin the Gaza Strip.Starving people are being gunned downat food distribution sites. Itshospitals have been bombed,doctorsandtheir familieskilled.The electricity has been cut off. OurPalestinian colleagues are being murderedin staggering numbers and western journalists say it is not on them toname the genocide. Yetfiction writers do. In the interest of balance,the BBC has decided not to airits documentary about doctors in Gaza. Until this week, when even Donald Trump was forced to acknowledge “real starvation”, a friend working in television news told me a new verb had emerged: to Gaza a story, meaning to downgrade its editorial importance.Finally, it seems the forbidden words are being named –genocide,famine,statehood– andour leaders may act to do somethingabout them. But our outrage has comemuch too late. Why did we wait? Our wary silence abetted the tragedy in Gaza. Our cynicism allowed for the defining horror of a generation.Vulture by Phoebe Greenwood is out 12 August 2025 on Europa Editions"

Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone getting smaller except me?It’s been the year of weight-loss drugs, with celebrities seemingly disappearing before our eyes. For those of us left behind, it’s both a torment and a temptation. Spoiler alert: I tried the jabs, tooRose StokesSun 10 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTShareIt is a balmy evening in early July. I have finally managed to get both of my small children to sleep and I am engaging in what has become a new and unhealthy ritual: scrolling through Instagram and trying to work out which of the people behind accounts I once followed for their body positivity content are now taking weight-loss drugs. I take a break from scrolling to pinch layers of fat between my thumb and middle finger, willing them – as I have since I was a child – to disappear. My fingertips trace the folds of skin that have appeared between my hips and ribs since my youngest son was born last summer, then over the raised red zigzags that have emerged all over my tummy since I first began growing children in 2021.By the time my partner has made his way up to our room, I am sobbing. His face bears the slightly pained but loving expression of someone who has seen this all before. Without a word, he draws me in for a hug before taking the phone from me. “I just … ” I say between sobs. He nods as I finish my sentence “… wish it were me.”You’d be forgiven for finding this melodramatic. But at 37, I can count on one hand the years I have spent free from anxiety about the shape and size of my body – and two of them I spent pregnant. The rest of my time on the planet has involved either outright hating my body or – more recently, in the shadow of the body positivity movement – trying to accept and maybe even love it.But something is changing. Gone are the days when there was a deluge of messaging that told us to love our bodies no matter their size. When brands were falling over themselves in the who-can-shout-self-love-the-loudest Olympics. When Vogue, once a shrine to the skinny, declared three plus-size women werethe new supersand plastered them on the cover. Instead, in a change I’d never have believed possible just two years ago, we have somehow been thrust back into a noughties-­level skinny worship culture that is bringing up the same feelings I’ve been running from since I was a girl.If first there was Hot Girl Summer, then Brat Summer, I reckon we are now living through Shrinking Girl Summer. I say this with no judgment or malice, but simply to hold up a mirror to a pervasive trend. Quietly, everyone seems to have been getting smaller and smaller.ForAlex Light, a Britishbody-positive influencer, things had started to change even before the arrival on the mass market in the UK and US of GLP-1 inhibitor drugs used exclusively, via prescription, for weight loss (before this they were used mainly to treat symptoms of type-2 diabetes, including obesity). “For a while there were subtle signs,” Light says. “Fewer size-inclusive launches, less campaign imagery, more brands quietly reducing size ranges and a shift in which kinds of bodies were getting visibility and praise … but weight-­loss drugs have made this shift impossible to ignore.”The signs are everywhere. Dozens of A-list women who were once (intentionally or not) symbols of what it means to rebel against diet culture are now changing shape dramatically. First Adele. Then Rebel Wilson. Lizzo. Meghan Trainor. Kelly Clarkson. Serena Williams. Mindy Kaling. And although some of these attribute their weight loss to strict diet and exercise, others are openly using the jabs: plenty of once overweight A-listers have been explicit about how much they’ve benefited from using the jabs, withRobbie Williamscalling them a “Christmas miracle” in a 2023 interview. Others, such as Queer Eye’s Jonathan Van Ness and Oprah Winfrey, have spoken openly about their use – not, they say, in the pursuit of skinniness, but to get to what they feel is a healthier, more comfortable weight.For the first time in my life, I was able to believe that, despite my inability to be thin, I was  deserving of loveGiven this is such a personal and emotive subject for many, it is obvious the reasons for using these drugs to slim down aren’t always black and white. But it is also clear there’s a grey area between “feeling fat” and being fat. And with stories of already-slim fashion editors queueing up to microdose the drugs in the run-up to fashion week, and celebrities using them to maintain skinny physiques, it’s almost impossible to find an exit to the moral maze of who should use them and how.What is increasingly evident is that the lessons we’ve been taught in the past 10 years – you can be healthy in a bigger body, and some bodies are genetically meant to be larger – are being replaced with the old-fashioned idea that health equates with thinness. Over on TikTok,the SkinnyTok hashtag– on content praising thinness and starvation in the pursuit of it – was banned in June because of a surge in its popularity and glamorisation of disordered eating. Coupled with a return of a familiar prejudice that fat people are just lazy and greedy – a problem that needs solving, for the sake of the NHS – it feels bleaker than it has for a long time to be overweight.As a perennially plus-size woman, I am happy for anyone who manages to lose weight and keep it off. But, yes, I am also consumed with a furious jealousy, because I wish it were me. And it almost was – because I am not simply anobserverof this sudden collective sprint towards thinness, but someone who actively tried to participate in it. Reader: I took the drugs, too.My experience with being bigger than I ought to be started as a child. I cannot say for sure when I was first made aware of my “problem”, but by the age of 10 I could confidently tell you how many calories were in a slice of Hovis versus Sainsbury’s own bread, and was a whiz at inputting my school dinners into the Weight Watchers calculator I carried around in my pocket.My memory is hazy about precisely when the weight-loss conversation was first opened with me, but I know it has never been closed. The word “conversation” is a stretch, given it has generally travelled in one direction only: towards me. The usual protocol is me receiving opinions about my body from people who, in either a personal or professional capacity, ask if I’ve ever considered losing weight,before gently suggesting I might want to, or demanding I do. This will come with recommendations to trythisonethingthis thin person determines is the reason for their svelte physique, never admitting their genes might have something to do with it. And my role in this little dance has been to swallow the shame I feel about my body, while apologising for the awkwardness my size seems to present for everyone else.And so the explosion of the so-called body positivity movement, on our social media feeds, fashion websites, catwalks and deodorant adverts worldwide, came as a shock to me. Having spent my whole life trying to be or stay thin, its messaging was at odds with my internal programming. While it felt amazing to see someone like Tess Hollidayon the cover of Cosmo, andcurvier mannequinsin Nike’s flagship Oxford Street store, it also felt at times like two steps forward, one step back. I wasn’t surprised to witness fatness become the latest target of the rightwing press’s war on “wokeness”, or explicit fatphobia, normalised by columnists “debating” what they saw as the glorification of ill health. And while I loved the idea of appreciating your body regardless of its shape or size, I also knew deep down that I would probably never be able to do so myself.View image in fullscreenAltered images (from left): Meghan Trainor, Oprah Winfrey, Robbie Williams, Lizzo and Jonathan Van Ness.Composite: Getty ImagesNonetheless, I gave it a good go. I wrote fat-positive pieces, shared posts on Instagram with body positivity hashtags and enjoyed the availability of bigger clothes in brands I had longed to wear:Valentino, D&G, Ganni, Reformation.I fell in love with the fat influencers’ “big is beautiful” message. I loved seeing people celebrating their bodies, especially their perceived flaws. I even wondered whether I had actually managed to love my body in its overweight (and later clinically obese) state, but this illusion of acceptance would always unravel at the merest perceived criticism – from online trolls or well-meaning people in my life trying to help solve something I’d never identified to them as a problem.A few things did change for the better for me. Where once my internalised fatphobia had prevented me from believing fat people could be attractive, now seeing gorgeous curvy women in ads and on catwalks stretched my own definition of beauty to include people in bigger bodies. Another is that I fell in love with exercise, once it stopped being something gatekept by the skinny and muscular–with special admission granted for fat people only if they were explicitly trying to become thin. Instead it became much more common to see women above a size eight enjoy exercise for the sake of exercise – in my case, kickboxing, running and swimming.The last big shift was that, for the first time in my life, I was able to believe that, despite my inability to be thin, I was deserving of real and unconditional love, which allowed me to crack open a little door just enough to let a person enter who would become my husband and the father of my children. I am much more able to accept my body’s appearance than I ever was before I met him.When GLP-1 inhibitors first came along, I instinctively felt afraid. And curious. Afraid because whenMeghan Trainorwas singing about how it’s all about that bass and Lizzo was casting only plus-size dancers for her tours, I had allowed myself to imagine a future in which the issue of weight wouldn’t be such a big deal. Curious because, well … I wondered if the drugs could help me.I was out there spreading the good word of self-acceptance, too, but if I had the chance to be thin, I’d say yes, every timeAfter having my second baby last summer, I gained weight. I was exhausted, moving less, eating more, and I felt out of control. So when articles started appearing around Christmas about how easy the injections were, how much weight you could lose and how few side-effects they produced, an idea started to form in my mind: maybe they could be the thing that slammed the door shut on conversations about my weight once and for all, and cut out the dreaded “food noise” – a near-constant barrage of thoughts about food, even when not physically hungry, that had an obsessive grip on my psyche. The idea of removing that from my life wasn’t just tantalising, but almost unthinkable. Imagine what I could do with all that extra brain space.I took the inhibitors and they worked – almost too well. I lost my entire appetite and about 15kg in a scarily fast time. Simultaneously, I experienced a resurgence of crippling anxiety (a known side-effect of Wegovy), leaving me foggy-headed, sweating profusely, sleepless and unable to think rationally or be fully present with my tiny children. It was truly miserable for me and my partner, who found it heartbreaking to see his formerly happy and engaged wife spiral back into the postnatal obsessive compulsive disorder we had both worked so hard to help me recover from after our first son’s birth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There was only one viable answer: I needed to be well for my children, and if that meant mostly tolerating body dissatisfaction, then better the devil you know, right?View image in fullscreen‘I’ll do all I can to embed in my children’s own programming the notion that their weight really is the least interesting thing about them.’Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianThe online company that had prescribed me the drugs with an eerie lack of checks and balances was stumped when I reported my side-effects, and told me to stop taking them. By this point I was so desperate to feel like myself again that the 3kg I regained pretty quickly, simply by eating more than nothing at all, barely registered. But as I felt more and more like myself, a new, almost grief-like feeling settled in the pit of my stomach; I felt defeated. The life raft on which I had pinned all my hopes of saving myself from a life of body hatred had arrived, and I had fallen spectacularly off it. It confirmed that the chronic lack of self-esteem I knew was likely the underlying cause of my mental health issues wasn’t ever going to be magically solved. And that I would probably never be free of a life spent oscillating wildly between two extremes: happy or thin.You may be wondering where this all leaves me. Like many others, I suspect, it’s extremely complicated. Do I, an obese person, wish I could tolerate the drugs better and lose a phenomenal amount of weight like seemingly everyone else has? Yes! Do I feel foolish for believingthisonethingmight solve all my problems? Absolutely.But there’s another niggling sense, too: a feeling that I have been lied to, tricked into hoping an alternative world could exist in which people were more accepting of each other’s bodies. I felt foolish for not recognising that what I will now refer to as fat-washing had only served one purpose: to make companies more money.I feel disappointed that the same people who told me I was beautiful despite my size have jumped at the first chance to be thin – and it makes me question their past sincerity. As Light says, “When a creator builds a platform based on inclusivity and body acceptance, their followers see that as a safe space. When that same creator’s body visibly changes, it can feel like a betrayal.”This has made me question my own integrity. I was out there spreading the good word of self-acceptance, too. Did I really believe what I was saying? I certainly wanted it to be true, and hoped it would be for others, and maybe that’s the same thing. But I know if I had the opportunity to be thin, even if it meant upsetting others, I’d say yes,every single time, because I’m so bone-achingly tired of the feeling of not-enoughness (or too-muchness) that has lingered since I was a girl.Siobhan Murphy, a plus-size influencer whose @ interiorcurve socials focus on fashion and interiors, knows this predicament well. She was “so nervous” to share her use of Mounjaro, a GLP-1 inhibitor, because she’s “always been a loud and proud advocate” for plus-size women. “I worried people might feel let down or think I’d changed sides,” she says. “But this wasn’t about how I looked – I’ve always loved my body. It was about how I felt in it. My back kept bothering me, my knees were aching, my skin was dull, my eyes puffy … I made the decision to prioritise my health, and I’m glad I did.”Despite her apprehension, Murphy’s followers “have been incredibly kind and understanding. I think many were just happy I was transparent. There’s such secrecy around this topic.”‘I lost so much weight, my husband thought I was terminally ill’: why do people lie about taking Ozempic?Read moreIn an online environment, a lack of trust can quickly morph into something more sinister, encouraging people to look at everyone and wonder if they’re onit, too, in a weird cat-and-mouse game that breathes life into an old habit of commenting on women’s bodies that, as a society, we’ve fought to move on from. And as someone who’s been round the block when it comes to weight gain and loss, body dysmorphia and the rest, I can tell you nothing makes you feel worse about yourself than scrutinising the appearance of others.As I scroll Instagram, seeing Shrinking Girl Summer in full bloom, I can’t help but pine for what could have been: a smaller body and what I assume would be an easier existence than one spent feeling the need to justify and defend myself all the time. But I find reasons to be hopeful when I see new body positivity pioneers pushing back against this fresh era of fatphobia. Women such as Lena Dunham, Meg Stalter, CMAT and Lola Young, who are all having their moment in the sun, without feeling the need to shrink in order to do so.Murphy says she sees the community at a crossroads. “A new wave of medical intervention is changing the conversation and it has raised many questions about what body positivity truly means. For me, it was never just about size – it’s about acceptance and kindness toward yourself and others. Whether you stay the same size, gain weight or lose it, the core message should remain the same: your worth isn’t defined by your body.”I am pretty committed to losing some weight; not a lot, but some. More than anything because I want to feel better in my body. My pursuit of being smaller is not motivated by a belief that being big and being beautiful are mutually exclusive. Maybe it will always be something I can appreciate as being true for others rather than myself, but in the meantime, I’ll do all I can to embed in my children’s own programming the notion that their weight really is the least interesting thing about them.If there’s one thing I’ve learned from having kids, it’s that the best way to teach them something is to embody it. I’ve never felt a stronger urge to step away from the scroll hole and build more solid self-esteem from the inside out. Maybe I’ll never learn to love my body fully, but that doesn’t mean I’ll give up trying.Explore more on these topicsBody imageHealth & wellbeingOprah WinfreyMeghan TrainorHealthRobbie WilliamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Between now and September, there could conceivably be further outbreaks of the kind of violence that rightwing politicians and their media allies have been frantically predicting. But for now, behold a fascinating spectacle: a country quietly refusing to chaotically combust, despite being endlessly encouraged to do so.One word in particular symbolises the gap between hyped-up rhetoric and everyday reality. “Tinderbox” was first used in the mid-16th century, to describe a crude instrument for starting fires: a container that carried a piece of either flint or steel, and a pocketful of the dry, flammable material that gave the device its name. With the invention of matches, the use of such implements fell away, and the word began its passage to how it is used today: as political shorthand for any situation supposedly on the brink of explosion. And here we are: over the past few weeks, “tinderbox” has become an inescapable cliche.At the end of July, the Institute for Public Policy Research publisheda report to mark the first anniversary of 2024’s riots, which claimed that the loss of communities’ shared spaces – pubs, youth clubs, community centres – can create “tinderbox conditions for violence”. At around the same time, the protests and violence outside hotels used for people seeking asylum began to attract the self-same description. “We need an emergency cross-party cabinet to stop tinderbox Britain exploding,” wrote a columnistin the Daily Telegraph. The former home secretarySajid Javid warnedthat the UK is “sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division”. And not long after, his one-time colleague Robert Jenrick – now the shadow justice secretary, and a man on constant manoeuvres – told the Today programme that “the country is like a tinderbox right now”.All this noise is part of a much bigger political development: a ballooning narrative about complete social breakdown. Just as people on the left have been predicting for at least 150 years that capitalism is about to chaotically implode under the weight of its own contradictions, so some of the loudest voices on the post-Brexit right have come up with their own version of a similarly historic meltdown: a vision of the immediate future in which rampant wokery, crime, failed immigration policy, weak policing and general establishment decay and corruption will lead inexorably to whatNigel Farage calls “societal collapse”.The Reform UK leader is now well into his summer of crime campaign,a breakneck run of pronouncementsdispensed from behind a lectern adorned with the slogan “Britain is lawless”. He says that “the social contract between the governed and the government is on the edge of breaking down”. And for months – if not years – helpful mood music has been provided by elements of the rightwing media. Again, the comment section of the Telegraph offers no end of examples: a newspaper that was once a byword for the political stiff upper lip now constantlyoffers such warningsas “Britain is lurching towards civil war, and nobody knows how to stop it”.All this echoes the kind of con trick used by reactionaries and authoritarians down the ages: warning of the country’s supposedly likely collapse in the hope that the rest of us support all the hardline policies they say would stop the rot. In Farage’s case, apocalyptic rhetoric feeds the idea that now things are so bad, the public ought to take a chance on his completely untested party. But also, the warnings of imminent social breakdown from Tory andReform UKpoliticians often sound quietly gleeful, as if they believe that some great moment of rupture is exactly what Britain needs, to wake up from its slumber.View image in fullscreenProtesters demonstrate near the Bell hotel, used to house asylum seekers in Epping, 20 July 2025.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockTheir talk always comes with caveats:Farage, for example, follows“Goodness knows what may happen over the course of the summer” with “We would encourage people to protest quietly and sensibly.” But, like Jenrick, he still sounds like someone with an alarmingly ambivalent view of unrest and chaos. Both of them make hyped-up claims of“two-tier justice”and draw questionable connections between migration and crime, which are much easier to popularise online than the comparatively complexreasons why they are specious. Put simply, they warn of disorder while recklessly rattling the tinderbox.Over the weekend, all this hit a new low. Friday and Saturday saw another spate of hotel protests, in locations including Portsmouth, Bristol,Nuneatonand Norwich. Compared with predictions of massed disorder, not much happened: a much bigger story, in fact, was thearrest of more than 400 peopleat demonstrations against the proscribing of Palestine Action. So, for want of a better story, the Mail on Sunday gave Jenrick – as ever, with the air of a callow opportunist flirting with mob politics – its front-page splash. “I certainly don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing,” he said. The accompanying messaging was less than subtle: an inside spread put a picture of Jenrick and his three daughters at what looked like a middle-English fete, next to an image of smiling young men “aboard a boat in France yesterday”.Just to be clear, the grim scenes that have materialised at those hotels are the signs not just of far-right activism and provocation, but broken policy. No one should underestimate how much thegrooming gangs scandalhas given many people a deep fear about the safety of women and girls, not least in places that have long felt ignored and neglected. But it is perfectly possible to acknowledge those plain facts while also highlighting something equally obvious: that the spectacle of politicians knowingly peddling inflammatory narratives is nauseating – and that, in the absence of the kind of countrywide immolation we were warned about, they are starting to look like desperate people throwing matches on kindling that refuses to ignite. That is a remarkable way for self-styled patriots to behave, and it would be nice to see a few Labour politicians loudly making such an obvious point. But we probably shouldn’t get our hopes up.Targeted by the right, Britain’s asylum hotels are places of fear and disorder. Bad political decisions made it so | Daniel TrillingRead moreOut in the real world, a lot of places suggest a social condition much more complicated than we hear from the prophets of British armageddon. The other week, I spent 36 hours in Pontefract, a classically post-industrial northern town that is part of the constituency represented by Yvette Cooper, the home secretary. Rather than a picture of incipient chaos and seething rage, it presents something much less dramatic: the feeling of a place that remains reluctantly locked into decline, but that also has a palpable and defiant community spirit. Its local council faces an £88m budget deficit over the next five years, and is in the midst of even more cuts; the everyday scene on its main streets suggests a quiet stoicism that the forces responsible for its predicament really don’t deserve.Neither Farage nor Jenrick’s parties offer anything that would assist its renewal and revival. The people who live there, in fact, deserve something a lot better than warnings that they are about to be plunged into civil war and social meltdown – issued, as ever, by the kind of privileged and cynical politicians who follow a time-honoured script: warning of apocalypse while keeping a very safe distance from the places they say are about to go up in flames.John Harris is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Chiara WilkinsonSun 10 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTShareZara, 26We probably have sex less now than when we lived apart, but it’s amazing that when the mood strikes, we can just do itI’ve known Max since I was 10. We were friends at high school and became “lovers” through some steady teenage flirting. Our first sexual experience was after a Halloween party, unplanned. I imagine it was like everyone’s first time: bad. It’s funny looking back, thinking how awkward we were. Being so young, there was a kind of shame associated with sex: it was gossipy and a lot of people were getting called slags. When we started shagging regularly, we were justsohorny and doing it whenever we could – at most, seven times a day. Once we did it in a portable toilet. It was like: “OK, we’re sexually active!”We’ve been together for more than a decade now and are so involved in each other’s lives, sharing the same friends and hobbies. There have been phases over the years when it has been a test, emotionally and physically. At one point, we were living in different time zones and our lives felt very separate. I used to send nudesallthe time. When we moved in together after university, it was exciting to no longer have to shag in our family home or with flatmates next door. We probably have sex less now than when we lived apart, but it’s amazing that when the mood strikes we can just do it: the short and sweet version, or make it a marathon over hours. There’s less pressure to have sex as soon as we see each other.Growing up exploring sex with Max means we are totally comfortable trying whateverNow and then, I’ll buy sex toys. It’s never been a premeditated jazz-up-our-sex-life thing – I used solo toys for a while before, so it felt like a natural progression. Some things work for us and then we integrate them more frequently, like a vibrating butt plug. Though we soon discovered that a vibrating cock ring was not our thing. Having done all these things for the first time together, there’s no weirdness about suggesting stuff.We’ve spoken before about whether we think we’ll ever do stuff with other people. It’s a weird thing to consider, and honestly, the answer is no. I can’t imagine it. Growing up exploring sex with Max means we are totally comfortable trying whatever.

It’s nice she’s thinking about our sex life and taking the reins, but I probably haven’t enjoyed the toys as much as she has. Maybe it’s because there’s some stigma around them for straight men: they’re often considered creepy or sleazy.

I had all these big ideas, but remember thinking it wasn’t as easy as the boys would have you believe. We’ve grown with each other. Living together made us even more comfortable – and much less quiet. At first, we had sex all the time, then it slowed. Now, there’s a nice middle ground.Knowing Zara so well, it’s sometimes a bit odd when she’s submissive in bedWe have three or four positions that we rotate, which makes it sound robotic, but we mix it up with foreplay. I enjoy intense eye contact, and love it when Zara is noticeably more excited than usual. We joke about “wine sex”: if we’re at dinner and get a bottle of wine, we’ll give each other a look, because Zara notoriously gets quite horny after a few glasses. Often, we’ll start by inviting each other to join in the shower, wash each other, then move into the bedroom. Lately, we’ve been having quickies during the work day, usually over lunch when we’re both WFH, which is fun. We’ve also been experimenting more. Knowing Zara so well, it’s sometimes a bit odd when she’s submissive in bed, as she’s quite an assertive person. I’ve learned to play into it, knowing she enjoys it and we have that freedom.I’d be lying if I said I haven’t wondered what it would be like to have sex with someone else, especially in the younger years, but I’ve never felt I was missing out on anything. We’re in love and have dated for so long. We build each other up and tell each other we fancy each other. We always laugh and say there isn’t a single spot on each other’s bodies that hasn’t been touched by the other person.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Open to the public and likely to feature the campaign star Cara Delevingne, it’s the latest evidence to confirm that the beloved high street brand is back.Topshop, once a rite of passage for young women finding their style on the high street, was bought by Asos in 2021 when its parent company, Philip Green’s Arcadia, went into administration. But its flagship store, the 90,000-sq-ft (8,400 sq metres) shopping destination at Oxford Circus in central London, closed later that year and the brand’s relevance diminished. The Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, whobought a 75% stakein the company last year, is hoping to change that.The prospect of Topshop’s return in bricks and mortar has been greeted with glee by shoppers who remember its golden age in the 90s and 00s. Elle’s contributing editor Laura Antonia Jordan says part of this is down to nostalgia for the Oxford Circus store, “going down the escalators and potentially losing hours in there”. The Vogue fashion writer Olivia Allen expresses a similar sentiment. “It was like an immersive amusement park for the teenage girl,” she says. “The closest you could get to living inside a coming-of-age makeover movie.”Allen, who describes herself as “geriatric gen Z”, says the store itself will be central to Topshop cementing its position with a new generation. “It was a meeting point and the unspoken go-to for any trip to London,” she says. “Without this, I’m not sure Topshop will ever have the same cachet.”Topshop to return to high street via other retailers’ storesRead moreMichelle Wilson, the managing director of Asos, has confirmed that standalone stores are coming, tellingDrapersin June: “That’s something that we are working on all the time.”Topshop was founded in 1964 in Sheffield, catering to teenagers. A decade later, the first standalone store opened, and Topman was established in 1978. The Oxford Circus store opened in 1994.Other triumphs included sellout fashion collaborations with designers including JW Anderson and Christopher Kane, as well as Kate Moss from 2007.View image in fullscreenShoppers pass the Oxford Street store in 2015.Photograph: Justin Kase zsixz/AlamyAt its height, Topshop had 300 stores in the UK and 11 in the US. Part of this success was managed by Jane Shepherdson, its brand director from 1997 to 2007, who was often described as the most influential person on the high street.Shepherdson says it was, in large part, down to the creative team behind the brand. “We had a shared vision. What we wanted to do was to completely exceed and blow away our customers’ expectations,” she says. “Give them something that was so much better than they were expecting.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Shein, by contrast, would charge about £18 and £19 respectively.) The brand comes under Asos’s “fashion with integrity” strategy, which monitors supply chains.Catherine Shuttleworth, a retail consultant and the chief executive of Savvy Marketing, says this chimes with how younger customers are thinking. “When they were 12 or 13 they were buying stuff from Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo,” she says. “They’re looking for a brand that reflects the life that they believe in, which is still Instagrammable but with more values, a bit more exclusive.”Nostalgia for Topshop is particularly keenly felt by millennials and older members of gen Z, but the question remains how far this feeling can take the brand. “I guess the dilemma for the new Topshop is: are you appealing to the millennial demographic for whom it was a real rite of passage or are you going after the version of us now?” says Jordan. “I don’t know if it can charm them in the same way because they are spoiled for choice.”Explore more on these topicsTopshopRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The answer could be a state just above total inactivityJoel SnapeSun 10 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 16.42 EDTShareIn our modern, time-squeezed lives, it’s tempting to do everything as fast as possible: listen to podcasts on double speed, work in email-free sprints, or train at lung-bursting intensity in the gaps between your morning meditation and the school run. But evidence is piling up that the last one might not be as beneficial as it seems – and that, in fact, just introducing a lot more ultra-low-intensity movement into your schedule can improve your fitness as well as your quality of life, whether you’re a top-tier athlete or experienced couch-crasher. Welcome to zone zero.In case you’re unfamiliar with the concept, or just need a quick refresher, zone training is a way of structuring workouts based on how high your heart rate gets as a percentage of the fastest it can possibly thump. Lower means slower – and most of us will never hit maximum intensity in our day-to-day lives. Over the decades, the most-recommended zones have shifted as training techniques evolve and knowledge of our biology improves – but zone zero, the state just slightly above total inactivity, where your heart never gets above 50% of its maximum rate, is enjoying a resurgence.One reason? It’s easy. Most zone training requires you to know your maximum heart rate – the British Heart Foundation recommends deducting your age from 220, though more accurate, less pleasant methods exist – and then making sure it doesn’t go too high or low, usually by training with a heart rate monitor. Zone zero, though, doesn’t require any of this. It’s essentially where you spend most of your semi-active life: walking slowly, doing light tidying, or even working at a standing desk. It shouldn’t really feel like exercise at all – but it might help you live longer, run faster, or feel better.“Zone zero is an accessible way to increase daily movement without the need for formal workouts or special equipment,” says Brian Passenti, founder of Altitude Endurance Coaching. “Getting more time in it can be as simple as parking further from the shops to get more steps in, taking a walk break while on a work call, or standing and stretching regularly at your desk. Of course, as you get more used to it, you can walk further or more frequently throughout your day, until you’re spending hours in zone zero rather than on the couch.”To understand why this is beneficial, it helps to know a bit about how your body fuels itself. After a meal or snack, carbohydrates are broken down and released into the bloodstream as glucose (a form of sugar), with any excess stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen. When you stand up or walk around, your muscles start contracting, which uses some of this glucose for fuel. This can have dramatic effects over time – a2022 review of studiesfound that even a little bit of light-intensity walking was enough to “significantly attenuate” post-food glucose levels compared with continued sitting, which almost certainly reduces your risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although there’ssome criticismof the idea that people living in “blue zones”(those regions of the world where life-and-health span might be slightly longer than elsewhere)really differ from other populations, one thing that’s fairly consistent among them is a significant amount of low-level activity, especially after meals – something that the evidence suggests is a pretty good idea.Glucose is also released when you’re stressed, as part of the body’s fight-or-flight response – and managing that process might be one of the reasons that walkingseems to be relatedto reduced stress, improved mood and general happiness. And there’s another key element to the fuelling process – low-intensity exercise uses a higher percentage of fat for fuel than high-intensity exercise, which tends to rely on the quick energy hit provided by glucose. This means that walking for a long time, or walking in a fasted state (like taking the dog out before you have breakfast) tends to pull energy from your body’s fat stores. Total calories burned matter, and so if fat loss is your main goal, adding more high-intensity exercise might get you there faster – but if that’s unpleasant, injurious, or makes you ravenous, it may do more harm than good.“For many of my clients – especially women in midlife or those just beginning their movement journey – zone zero is the bridge between sedentary and sustainable,” says Terry Tateossian, a personal trainer and nutritionist. “It reduces stress, supports mental clarity, can help with improved circulation and better digestion, and it’s a more enjoyable, flexible way to stick with training over time.”It’s also important to note that, in longevity terms, a bit (or a lot) more daily movement can play a huge role. A2022 review of studiesin the Lancet, for instance, found that taking more daily steps – fast or slow – was associated with a progressively lower risk of all-cause mortality, to an upper limit that varied by age. Another study led by the American Cancer Society found that any amount of walking, even at a moderate pace and at levels below the recommended guidelines, was associated with lower mortality risk. Consistency counts.But what about more athletic endeavours? Well, even people who schedule workouts five or six days a week will still probably benefit from adding some extra low-intensity movement to their routine. A few more daily steps can bring all of the benefits mentioned above. But can going (very) slowly actually help you run faster?View image in fullscreenEven regular runners may still benefit from doing more low-intensity movement.Photograph: Posed by model; East Road/Ascent Xmedia/Getty ImagesThis, it turns out, is a contentious area. Marathon data, for instance, shows that faster runners tend to spend a huge amount of time in the low-intensity zone compared with their slower peers – something that has prompted arecent examinationin the European Journal of Applied Physiology. One theory is that faster athletes train a lot morein general– they’re spending more hours on the roads and trails, and so some of those have to be slow so they don’t burnout. This is the first of seven different hypotheses in the new piece, which notes that “complete cardiac recovery from [high intensity] exercises might take over two days, limiting athletes to two to three weekly well-rested HI sessions” – leaving four or five days a week that can be filled with low intensity work.There are also other explanations. Very low-intensity training may trigger training adaptations in a slightly different way to higher-intensity at the molecular level, or through different pathways. It might gradually remodel the structure and function of the heart (particularly the left ventricle), or shift the composition of an athlete’s muscle fibres to the more endurance-focused (and economical) slow-twitch kind. It might also reinforce the effect of more serious training, as suggested bya 2021 studythat found decreasing daily background steps actually blunted the effects of a high-intensity training programme.“There have been studies comparing people doing training and getting 2,000 steps per day versus people doing the same training and doing 5,000 to 7,000 steps per day, and those getting more steps get better training adaptations,” says Brady Holmer, an exercise scientist and the author of VO2 Max Essentials. “We often think it’s best to do your training session and sit on the couch all day, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. You need the high-intensity training to get a faster race time, but zone zero training plays a supportive role.”It has been well established for some time now that “active recovery” – even if you’re barely doing anything – works to mitigate the effects of workouts that would otherwise leave you sore for days, by getting oxygen and nutrients to damaged muscle tissue through better blood flow. “An easy walk around the block is the best way to combat sore muscles,” says Passenti. “My wife is not as active as I am, but an easy after-dinner walk on a summer evening can offer benefits for both of us, and our dog too. While it may not directly improve sprint speed, it supports recovery and endurance development. Every bit of movement counts.”But also, staying in zone zero is just … easy. High-intensity training is horrible almost by design: you might come to “enjoy” it on some level, but it tends to havea negative effect on moodeven in well-trained people. Going for a walk or a gentle yoga session, though, decreases mental fatigue and improves your mood, leaving you psychologically more prepared for the hard stuff.“Zone zero addresses the biggest challenge I see across all levels of athletes: the inability to slow down,” says endurance coach Stephanie Holbrook. “Over 16 years of coaching, I’ve found that most endurance athletes start out too hard and are simply not willing to embrace truly gentle movement. Zone zero – that sweet spot where you’re just slightly active but not actually feeling like you’re exerting yourself – can be revolutionary. For beginners who have never exercised, it removes the intimidation factor and shows that movement doesn’t require suffering. For experienced 5k and marathon runners, it’s often the missing piece that unlocks breakthrough performances because it facilitates genuine recovery without contributing to the body’s stress response.”So where to start? Anywhere you like. The point of zone zero is to stop thinking of your day as a split between workouts (horrible) and inactivity (non-ideal), and try to maximise the amount of very gentle movement you’re doing without ever really worrying about it. In a typical day, that might mean going out for a quick walk before breakfast or getting off the bus to work a couple of stops early, getting up regularly for a stretch while you’re at your desk, and going for a 20-minute wander at lunchtime. It could mean a short amble after dinner or a bit of very gentle yoga while you’re watching Netflix (if you don’t know any, just sit on the floor instead of the sofa, and you’ll find yourself moving naturally). “Start with 10 to 15 intentional minutes of zone zero a day,” says Tateossian. “Add mobility while your coffee brews. Park further away on purpose. These micro-movements add up, and for people who feel intimidated by ‘exercise’, this is the entry point.”It sounds like a hassle, compared with what many of us are used to – but if it pays off with improved mental energy now and a better quality of life later, it will be worth the effort. And, if you’ve never quite cracked the code to enjoying exercise, it could be just what you need. “There can be a psychological breakthrough that comes from learning that sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is almost nothing at all,” says Holbrook. Besides, any form of exercise where you don’t have to wash your gym kit has to be worth a try.Get in the zone! Your on-the-go guide to exercise intensityZone 0: casual strollHeart rate:below 50% of maxSuper-easy. Slow walking, gentle cleaning, or possibly just working at a standing desk. Spend as much time here as possible: it’s where our hunter-gatherer ancestors would have spent most of their days.Zone 1: getting goingHeart rate:50%to 60% of maxStill barely challenging. This is where you’d be during an easy warm-up, walking the dog, or having a kickabout with a toddler. Useful for building work capacity for more challenging stuff.Zone 2:this is fineHeart rate:60% to70% of maxEasyish. You’re breathing a bit harder, but you could still explain the plot of Severance if you really had to. Modern runners spend hours here to build a base without burning out. Can be boring, but very effective.Zone 3:this isn’t fineHeart rate: 70% to80% of maxThis is where tempo runs – a pace that’s right at the edge of your ability for sustained efforts – happen. You could talk, but you’d rather not. A zone that’s fallen a bit out of fashion recently, as many coaches recommend a mix of long, slow training and higher-intensity efforts. Can still be useful, though.Zone 4:can’t talk, lungs hurtingHeart rate: 80% to90% of maxHard. This is what happens when you do intervals or threshold runs, or ill-advisedly sprint up an escalator as fast as you can. In theory, this is what nudges up your lactate threshold – or your body’s ability to deal with lactate buildup in the blood. You can’t sustain it for long, and you probably shouldn’t try.Zone 5:almost unbearableHeart rate: 90% to100% of maxMaximum effort: this is where you’re redlining it because someone’s yelling at you. Honestly, you probably don’t need to be here much.Explore more on these topicsFitnessTraining programmesHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

June was the hottest on record and in general this summer England was an average of 1.58Cabove average temperatures.Hot homes are dangerous for health; cardiovascular and respiratory issues, sleep disturbance, mental health problems and heat exhaustion all correlate with high temperatures in the home. Health risks spike when temperatures inside are above 25C, and there is alink between overheating homes and the risk of death, particularly for elderly people.chart 2An analysis of housing stock by the Resolution Foundation has found nearly half (48%) of the poorest fifth of English households have homes liable to get too hot – three times as many as among the richest fifth (17%).chart 1Owning your own home reduces the risk of overheating; two-thirds of socially renting households face the highest risk of their homes getting too hot compared with 55% of private rented homes and 17% of those that are owner occupied.Additionally, six in 10 of those with young children, and almost half of minority ethnic households also face the highest risk of their homes getting too hot.Overall, the research found a fifth of homes inEnglandoverheat in current summer temperatures, while one-third (32%) have attributes that put them at high risk of overheating in the future.chart 3Small flats, small homes and those that are overcrowded are all at risk of getting too hot, as are those in areas such as London that suffer from an urban heat island effect. More than half (53%) of homes in London are at risk of overheating, compared with 31% of those outside the capital.Experts have called for the government to update its upcoming future homes standard to include provisions for overheating homes. The regulations are due to be published this autumn, to come into force from 2027, but the focus has been mainly onhow to keep draughty homes warm in winter, rather than to keep them cool in summer.“The way we are building new housing is not adequate to the climate change we are already seeing, never mind the even hotter weather that’s coming,” said Simon McWhirter, the chief executive of the UK Green Building Council.Zachary Leather, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “With the sweltering temperatures parts of the UK have seen recently set to become more common, we face a greater risk of overheating at home. But this risk is not spread equally – lower-income families, social renters, those with children and ethnic-minority households are more likely to live in homes at risk of overheating.”The thinktank used data from a government study that placed hundreds of sensors in people’s homes to determine which types of houses were most at risk of overheating. The figures were then combined with the latest data on who lives in these homes – small flats, small homes and overcrowded properties – to identify those at the highest risk of overheating as the UK’s temperature rises.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

One in four UK workers work in occupations where they are at risk of heat stress. There is an inequality aspect to this, too; those in the top third income bracket have a lower than average risk.Older workers are more likely to face heat stress at work; 31% of those in jobs liable to cause heat stress are aged over 50. The research also found that office workers in more deprived areas were less likely to have air conditioning in their workplaces.chart 4The researchers suggested “learning from countries that have long had higher temperatures, including legal rights for maximum workplace temperatures, and better adapted buildings”.Measures that can keep homes cooler in summer includegood ventilation to create through airflow that cools rooms, with well-designed windows and external shutters, andreflective painton roofs or outside surfaces.Street trees are a simple and cost effective way to keep homes cool, the UK Green Building Council has said. It advocates a 3:30:300 approach: you should be able to see three trees from your dwelling; you should have 30% tree canopy cover within your neighbourhood; and you should be no more than 300 metres from a biodiverse green space or park.A government spokesperson said: “We know the importance of keeping homes cool in hot weather. That’s why building regulations require new homes to be built to reduce the risk of overheating and through the future homes standard consultation we are exploring how to further improve protections. This is alongside considering the use of air-air heat pumps to keep existing homes cool under the boiler upgrade scheme.”Explore more on these topicsHousingHot PropertyEnglandUK weatherExtreme heatClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel admitted the strike, claiming he was a Hamas militant, a claim that the UN has said is unsubstantiated.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersCalling al-Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists,” Al Jazeera said the attack was “a desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza.”Last month Israeli IDF spokesperson Avichai Adraee shared a video of al-Sharif on X and accused him of being a member of Hamas’ military wing. At the time the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan,called it “an unsubstantiated claim”and a “blatant assault on journalists”.In July, al-Sharif told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) that he lived with the “feeling that I could be bombed and martyred at any moment”.After the attack, the CPJ said it was “appalled” to learn of the journalists’ deaths.“Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” said CPJ regional director Sara Qudah.“Journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable.”The Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate condemned what it described as a “bloody crime” of assassination.In January this year, after a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, al-Sharif drew widespread attention when, during a live broadcast, he removed his body armour while surrounded by dozens of Gaza residents celebrating the temporary halt in hostilities.A few minutes before his death, al-Sharif posted on X: “Breaking: Intense, concentrated Israeli bombardment using ‘fire belts’ is hitting the eastern and southern areas of Gaza City.”In a final message, which Al Jazeera said had been written on 6 April and which was posted to al-Sharif’s X account after his death, the reporter said that he had “lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification.”“Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year and a half,” he continued.The 28-year-old leaves behind a wife and two small children. His father was killed by an Israeli strike on the family home in Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza City in December 2023. At the time al-Sharif said he would continue to report and refused to leave northern Gaza.Another Al Jazeera journalist in Gaza, Hani Mahmoud, said: “This is perhaps the hardest thing I’m reporting about the past 22 months. I’m not far from al-Shifa hospital, just one block away, and I could hear the massive explosion that took place in the past half an hour or so, near al-Shifa hospital.“I could see it when it lit up the sky and, within moments, the news circulated that it was the journalist camp at the main gate of the al-Shifa hospital.”Al-Sharif and his colleagues have been reporting from Gaza since the beginning of the conflict.“It’s important to highlight that this attack is just a week after an Israeli military official directly accused Anas and directly ran a campaign of incitement on Al Jazeera and correspondents on the ground because of their work, because of their relentless reporting on the starvation and the famine and the malnutrition,” Mahmoud added.Israel has killed multiple Al Jazeera journalists and members of their families,including Hossam Shabat, who was killed in March, andIsmail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed in August.Chief correspondent Wael al Dahdouh’s wife, son, daughter and grandsonwere killed in October 2023and he himself was injured in an attack weeks later thatkilled Al Jazeera cameramanSamer Abu Daqqa.Israel, which does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza and whichhas targeted local reporters, has killed 237 journalists since the war started on 7 October 2023, according to Gaza’s government media office. The Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 186 journalists have been killed in the Gaza conflict.

The US has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously.

But Vance said he did not think it would be productive for the Russian president to meet his Ukrainian counterpart before speaking with Trump.“We’re at a point now where we’re trying to figure out, frankly, scheduling and things like that, around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end to this conflict,” he told Fox News.As the diplomacy ramped up, there was no let-up in hostilities.

Two others died after a Russian drone struck their car in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to the regional governor.On Saturday night, European leaders issued a coordinated statement that said the “path to peace” in Ukraine could not be decided without Kyiv. Welcoming Trump’s attempts to end the war, leaders from the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland and Finland, along with the president of the European Commission,Ursula von der Leyen, emphasised that negotiations could only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities.It added: “Only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed.”MapOn Sunday, Zelenskyy welcomed the support, saying on X: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people today for the sake of peace in Ukraine, which is defending the vital security interests of our European nations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was often linked to employers’ gloomy outlook, and increased pressure on recruitment budgets.The report showed the steepest reduction in vacancies since April, while availability of staff rose at a rate that was among the fastest since the survey began in 1997.This has hit pay growth, with starting salaries rising at the weakest rate in almost four and a half years, it said.Demand for permanent staff was said to be down across all 10 employment categories apart from engineering. Retail remained at the bottom of the table with “a rapid fall in vacancies”, while the smallest decline happened in the construction sector.“With starting salaries and temp pay rising only modestly, it was right to cut interest rates last week,” said Kate Shoesmith, the REC deputy chief executive.“More action like this, to stabilise the business cost-base, is what will support growth and boost the jobs market this year. That is what the chancellor should be keeping firmly in mind when preparing this year’s autumn budget.”On Thursday, the Bank of Englandcut interest rates for the fifth timein a year as it warned that rising food prices could drive inflation to 4%, amid mounting concerns about the strength of the UK economy.Shoesmith noted that construction, a key economic bellwether, “has seen a rise in temp vacancies – an early sign of confidence returning”, adding: “Demand for blue-collar temp roles and permanent engineering jobs also remains steady, offering another glimmer of optimism.”Thehospitalityand care sectors, and organisations that hire young people, had been hit the hardest by mounting employment costs, the CIPD said. About 37% of employers that hired people under 21 reported that the NICs changes had increased their employment costs to a large extent, compared with 23% of employers that do not hire young people, despite under-21s being exempt from employer NICs.The organisation is urging the government to step up efforts to support the employment and training of young people and ensure that proposed changes to the employment rights bill do not act as a further barrier to their recruitment.James Cockett, the senior labour market economist at the CIPD, said: “Business confidence is faltering further under rising employment costs.”Meanwhile, weak GDP growth and high labour and energy costs coupled with continued uncertainty around Donald Trump’s global tariffs continue to weigh on confidence, the business advisory firm BDO’s latest monthly snapshot showed.Scott Knight, the head of growth at BDO,said: “There are signs of recovery but they are fragile … Business leaders are stuck in limbo, waiting for clearer signals from the government that further investment will be worth the gamble.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsKPMGnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the first annual decline since August 2020, during the height of the Covid pandemic – although this national figure masks wide regional variations.Rents have risen in recent years owing toa combination of factors. These include demand for rental properties outstripping supply, the pandemic and its fallout affecting how many people live and work, and buy-to-let landlords passing on increases in their costs caused by higher interest rates.Afterfive interest rate cuts over the past year, the mortgage costs for some landlords have fallen, reducing the need to pass on further costs. Meanwhile, lower mortgage rates are also making it easier for some tenants to begin looking to buy their first home, thereby reducing demand.The figures are based on data from Connells, one of the UK’s biggest estate agency groups. While they represent a sliver of good news for tenants, many of whom have had to grapple with sizeable increases to their housing costs, these rent falls are not yet widespread, Hamptons said.Greater London continues to record the steepest declines, with rents falling by 3% year on year in July – the seventh consecutive month of decline and the biggest annual drop since May 2021. The falls in Greater London, as well as a sharp slowdown in the north ofEnglandover the past year, helped push the national figure into negative territory.Rents inWalesfell on an annual basis for the third month in a row in July, while there were also falls in north-east England and Yorkshire and the Humber.However, rents are still rising in seven out of 11 regions, with the East Midlands (3.4%), West Midlands (2.7%) and south-west England (2.6%) leading the way.Despite the small annual decline, the average monthly rent for a new let of £1,373 remains £350 – or 34% – higher than in August 2020.For sitting tenants it is a different story. Average rents on renewed tenancies continued to rise: up 4.5% year on year in July.“After five years of relentless rent rises, the market has paused for breath,” said Aneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons. “[But] renewal rents continue to climb.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of this was attributed to improvements in the balance between supply and demand, with the number of available properties to rent said to be 15% higher than at the same time last year.This month, Barclays said that, typically, housing accounts for close to a third (30.8%) of renters’ take-home pay, whereas homeowners report spending just over a quarter (26.6%) of their earnings on their mortgage.Hamptons also issued data that showed one in five (20%) buy-to-let companies set up in Britain so far this year were owned by non-UK national shareholders. The proportion was up from 13% in 2016. Indian investors made up the largest group of non-UK shareholders, followed by Nigerians, Poles, Irish nationals and Italians. Meanwhile, Brexit has contributed to the share of non-UK shareholders coming from the EU falling from 65% in 2016 to 49% in 2025, the company said.Explore more on these topicsRenting propertyPropertyScotlandEnglandWalesMortgage ratesMortgagesnewsShareReuse this content"

You come to Britain, you’re not going to get punished. You’re thinking: the worst that happens to me is I’m released immediately and put on a plane.”He added: “You’ve got to have a measure of justice so if you come to our country and commit a crime, you expect punishment. I would urge parliament to scrutinise this extremely carefully”.Robert Buckland, another former justice secretary, said Chalk was right to express concerns. “Many victims of these crimes want justice to be served here first before deportation. Has the government taken the views of victims into consideration in all of this?”The Ministry of Justice confirmed to the Guardian that foreign offenders deported under the expansion of the “deport first, appeal later” scheme would not necessarily face prison in their home country.After alegal challenge, the supreme court ruled in 2007 that the“deport first, appeal later” system was unlawfulbecause it infringed on people’s right to give live evidence to their appeal.The government dealt with the court’s concerns by setting up agreements with several countries for foreign criminals to give live evidence to their appeal hearings using a video link. The scheme was restarted in 2023.Met police to more than double use of live facial recognitionRead moreYvette Cooper, the home secretary, said that “for far too long, foreign criminals have been exploiting our immigration system, remaining in the UK for months or even years while their appeals drag on. That has to end.“Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced.”David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said ministers were in talks with several countries about extending the scheme.Foreign offenders make up about 12% of the prison population in England and Wales, with each prison place costing an average of £54,000 each year, according to the government.Of the new countries covered by the scheme, only Indians are in the top nationalities in the prison population.Officials said that in the year since Labour came to power in July 2024, 5,179 foreign nationals who had been convicted of crimes had been deported, a 14% increase on the year before.Explore more on these topicsCrimeShabana MahmoodDavid LammyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

As designer handbags sell for record prices at auction – with the late singerJane Birkin’s Hermès bagfetching €8.6m (£7.4m) this summer – prices are rising in boutiques and secondhand bags are gaining value as collectors’ items.View image in fullscreenThe original Birkin bag created by Hermès for Jane Birkin was sold at auction in July.Photograph: Michel Euler/APJérôme Lalande, an expert on leather goods at the Paris appeals court, said demand for designer handbags was so high that the secondhand market was flourishing, making bags very easy to sell on. “There’s a lot of money to be made,” he said. “Handbags have come to represent social status.”Last month, the Paris showroom of Houlux, a broker of secondhand designer bags that sells by appointment only, was robbed in a dawn raid. Burglars climbed up to a fourth-floor balcony and in less than 20 minutes took more than 100 luxury bags by brands includingHermès, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Chanel, estimated to be worth a total of €1m.A few days later, the offices of the luxury brandLouis Vuittonin central Paris were broken into shortly after midnight by two masked men who broke down an inside door and took a large number of bags, reported to have been worth more than €1m.In May, a large number of handbags were stolen from a Louis Vuitton boutique on Paris’s Boulevard Saint-Germain after a car was ram-raided into the shopfront in the early hours of the morning, allowing the robbers to enter the store and clear the shelves. It was the third such ram-raid on the boutique in only nine months. In November, neighbours had filmed a car drive into the same shop in the early hours of the morning as robbers dressed in black calmly loaded up scores of luxury bags before speeding off.Pascal Carreau, the head of the organised crime unit of Paris’s judicial police, said handbags were one of the last remaining high-value objects that gangs can target in Paris. “Historically, before the explosion of drugs, French criminals, and particularly Parisian criminals, carried out armed robberies of banks, which in the 1970s had almost no protection at all.”But now, with banks well-secured and less cash in circulation, patterns have changed. He said: “The teams of criminals who have not moved on to cybercrime are looking to target physical objects of value on the market. And all that is left are jewels or luxury leather goods.”View image in fullscreenParis’s luxury shopping districts have been targeted by ram-raid attacks in the past year.Photograph: Thomas Padilla/APIn January, an employee carrying out a stock inventory in central Paris for LVMH, the conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton and many other luxury brands, discovered 50 handbags by the labelLoewe, worth about €100,000, were missing. Examination of CCTV footage showed two suspects had entered the building one night before Christmas and exited carrying six large sacks believed to contain the bags.Last year, aChanelshop on Avenue Montaigne in central Paris was ram-raided by a car and robbers escaped with bags worth between €500,000 and €1m. In 2024, the home of an influencer who specialised in luxury handbags and posted photographs of herself posing with her bags in Paris locations, was targeted by thieves who stole items including bags worth between €20,000 and €30,000.Earlier this year, Paris criminality returned to global headlines when a group of men who in 2016 robbed the US reality TV star Kim Kardashian of her jewellery, including a £3m 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring from her then husband Kanye West, werefound guilty after a high-profile trial.But Carreau saidjewellery heistsin Paris had dropped significantly to one or two each year because high-value jewellery pieces, which were often unique “works of art”, were hard to resell on the black market. He said luxury bags, on the other hand, were easier to sell on. “The resale is happening on secondhand sales sites. Some of the bags are transported abroad and sold the same way across Europe,” he said.This was fuelled by the growing trend for acquiring luxury bags spreading across different levels of society and becoming much more commonplace, Carreau said. “Forty years ago these bags were marginal, now the fashion for luxury is much more widespread.”The first six months of 2025 showed a marked drop in crime in general in Paris compared with the previous year: armed robberies were down by more than 9%, burglaries by 15% and theft of cars and motorbikes by 14%.Be more ‘squee’: the big business of tiny accessoriesRead moreCarreau said raids on expensive handbag boutiques were not a daily occurrence in Paris but they had a spectacular impact because sometimes videos by onlookers who witnessed events had circulated on social media.Lalande, the appeals court expert, said: “A classicChanelbag that was €5,000 in a boutique five years ago can now cost €10,000 in a boutique. So alongside those shop prices, the secondhand prices have also risen … There is a global demand – from Beijing to Dubai, New York to Paris and London.”Lalande said bags were relatively easy to re-sell because they couldn’t be traced as easily as watches or jewels.He had seen a shift in criminals’ focus on bags over the past 25 years. “Twenty years ago, I was contacted because a [Hermès] crocodile Kelly bag was stolen from a woman in Paris. The bag was later found in a bin with her wallet that had been emptied. Years ago, a bag would be stolen for its contents. Today the target is the bag itself.”Explore more on these topicsParisFranceLuxury goods sectorEuropeDiorChanelHandbagsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Could she make an appearance in person or by videolink?“I’m taking advice from Hugo Keith KC, who’s advising me on what my next steps are,” she says. “I’m yet to see an official summons … I mean, I’m supposedly days away from a showcase trial in a foreign country, and I still don’t know what the charges are against me. I feel a bit like I’m trapped in this Kafkaesque nightmare where I’ve been put on trial and I genuinely haven’t found out what the allegations are and what the trial is about.”The Bangladeshi authorities have said that they will try Siddiq in absentia if necessary. The position on extradition between Bangladesh and the UK may yet be tested if there is a conviction.For a few months last year, after Labour’s victory in the July general election, Siddiq, a veteran of the party who was a councillor before becoming an MP, was in her element.Appointed by Starmer – a friend whose constituency neighbours her own – as economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister, she got stuck into a review of the financial services. “I loved it, and I was good at it,” she says.Five thousand miles away, after 15 years in power, her aunt’s regime was falling apart in the face of student-led protests.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators filled the streets in Dhaka to protest against Sheikh Hasina’s regime.Photograph: Fatima Tuj Johora/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockAfter an outcry over the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people demonstrating against what they said was an increasingly autocratic and cruel administration, Hasina and Siddiq’s mother, Sheikh Rehana, who was in the country at the time, fled the Bangladeshi capital in a military helicopter to India.It was, Siddiq admits, a scary time. Hasina’s entire family, apart from her husband, children and sister, were murdered during the 15 August 1975 Bangladeshi coup d’état in which Siddiq’s grandfather, the first president of Bangladesh, was assassinated.But, in the summer of 2025, life for Siddiq and her husband, Chris Percy, a strategic consultant, and their two children carried on as normal. “I’m not here to defend my aunt,” she says. “I know there’s an investigation going on about how her term in government ended. And I really hope the people of Bangladesh get the closure that they want.”It was only at the end of last year, with a new government established in Dhaka underMuhammad Yunus, an economist and the bitterest of rivals to Hasina, that what Siddiq describes as the “dirty politics” of Bangladesh turned her life on its head.View image in fullscreenMohammad Yunus, a bitter rival to Sheikh Hasina, succeeded her as prime minister of Bangladesh. Siddiq says the ‘dirty politics’ of his regime turned her life on its head.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianStories started to appear on obscure websites accusing her of embezzling $5bn from a deal made by her aunt with a Russian company to build the Rooppur nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.A photograph from 2013 of a smiling Siddiq with her aunt and Vladimir Putin in Moscow offered a fresh whiff of impropriety.“My aunt went on a state visit to Russia, and my sister and I decided to travel from London to go see her in Russia,” she says. “I was not involved in any sort of political discussions. We were sightseeing, and we were having a good time, just going to restaurants, shopping. Then on the last day, all the politicians who were there, their families were invited to a tea and reception, and a photo was taken. I met Putin for two minutes.”View image in fullscreenA photograph from 2013 of Siddiq with her aunt and Vladimir Putin resurfaced last year as stories started to appear that accused Siddiq of embezzling $5bn.Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/APA new story emerged that Siddiq had been gifted a flat in King’s Cross in 2004 by “an associate of people linked” to her aunt’s political party, the Awami League.The flat’s former owner, her godfather, was not political or known to her aunt and “much to my dismay, he’s never voted”, she says.The problem for her was that two years previously she had told an enquiring newspaper that her parents had bought the flat for her.It was a mistake, grounded in the failing memory of her elderly parents, who separated a quarter of a century ago, she says.New questions were then raised as to why she was living in a house owned by a Bangladeshi-heritage property developer who she says she met through the Labour party, when she owns a home in Cricklewood.View image in fullscreenSheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh with her sister, Siddiq’s mother, for India, after an outcry at the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of protesters.Photograph: Monirul Alam/EPAIt was because she had been warned of a security threat, she says. A man being held on terrorism charges had suggested that Siddiq was the reason for his plight.It was the year the Tory MP David Amess had been murdered at work. She had been advised to move out and had relied on someone she knew due to the suddenness of it all.She was paying full market rent but mud was flying, often thrown from the authorities in Bangladesh. Some of it was starting to stick. Siddiq referred herself to Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministerial standards.After two weeks of “intense” daily meetings going through Siddiq’s finances, Magnus cleared her of breaking the ministerial code.He added that it was “regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks” that arose from her familial ties and her government role.The line is evidently irritating to her. “I can’t help who my aunt is at the end of the day,” she says. “It is a strange line because it is a bit like saying you should have been aware of your birth and how you were born.”She resigned in order to stop the story from being a distraction for the government despite Starmer’s continued support, she says.View image in fullscreenSiddiq resigned from Keir Starmer’s government to stop herself being a distraction as allegations continued to be made against her.Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PAHe made it clear that she could return one day. “He did make a joke and say, ‘In the previous administration, even people who had broken the ministerial code still stayed on, you know that?’”But allegations have continued to fly and Siddiq’s lawyers’ attempts to get clarity have not been rewarded, she says.There is certainly scant evidence of a renewed Bangladesh since Hasina’s regime fell. The promised elections are yet to happen. Lawyers at Doughty chambers have been compiling evidence of abuses for the international criminal court, including “unprovoked and violent attacks against journalists, police officers, minorities and those connected with the former government party, the Awami League”.Siddiq tried to meet Yunus during his visit to the UKthis year. He dismissed it, saying it would prejudice the judicial process. Meanwhile,the UK’s serious and organised crime agency has frozen almost £90m of London property belonging to two men linked to Hasina, including one property in which Siddiq’s mother lived and still has possessions. Nothing to do with her, Siddiq says.“The truth is that I’m collateral damage, because of this feud between Muhammad Yunus and my aunt,” she says. “These are wider forces that I’m battling against … There’s no doubt people have done wrong things in Bangladesh, and they should be punished for it. It’s just I’m not one of them.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Senior commanders including Aharon Haliva, Yaron Finkelman, Oded Basyuk and Eliezer Toledano have also stepped down, alongside top figures in military intelligence and the Shin Bet.Since its founding in 1948, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been more than a military organisation; it has been woven into the country’s national identity, hailed as a near-sacred institution, the ultimate guarantor of the state’s survival and a living symbol of the collective spirit that forged the nation.The Israeli public has long been united in its support of the army.A clash between the military leadership and the government, analysts warn, could have irreparable consequences for public support for the Israeli administration.A dispute between the army leadership and the government“could intensify public protest, fuelled both by concern for the hostages and by the fact that, until now, the military had provided legitimacy for continuing the war,” said Levy.According to Yedioth Ahronoth, one of Israel’s largest newspapers, the military’s divisions run not only between the government and the IDF’s senior command, but also within the army’s own upper echelons.The discontent also appears to be spreading to the rank and file. An increasing number of Israeli soldiers are refusing to return to Gaza, shaken by the heavy toll of Palestinian civilian deaths during the military offensive.Last June, in a letter addressed toNetanyahu, the defence minister, Israel Katz, and the head of the military, a group of 41 officers and reservists said thegovernment was waging an “unnecessary, eternal war”in Gaza and announced they would no longer participate in combat operations in the territory.According toIsrael’s national broadcaster, Kan, only 60% of soldiers are showing up to reserve duty. The number includes the so-called “grey refusals” – those who cite medical conditions, invoke family obligations, or quietly leave the country during the call-up period and “forget” to check their emails.The IDF has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuanalysisShareReuse this content"

Brisbane’s Circa are so confident in the breadth of their skills and invention that right off the bat they bring out a guy who can hold the weight of six other people all balanced in a tower on top of him. It’s quite an opening statement.Edinburgh fringe is awash with acrobatics and there are plenty of people trying to do what Circa do – stylish circus with choreographic sensibility; athletic and atmospheric – but this troupe has been at it for 20 years and director Yaron Lifschitz has really got it down.Wolf is a very entertaining hour that embraces animal instincts. It’s down with politeness, up with prowling, snarling, shows of sheer strength and seriously sexy posturing (complete with red lipstick). Designer Libby McDonnell’s sleek costumes in fawn and black stripes make their own optical effects, too.View image in fullscreenSuper-slick … Circa: Wolf at Underbelly Circus Hub on the Meadows.There might be a touch of the feral, but this show is also super-slick. Bodies fly, hurl, flip, swing, teeter, strain and splat (deliberately) flat on the floor. They toss each other across the stage, from one human tower to another, and test gravity’s limits in shape-shifting balances of three, four, five, six people. The fluid interactions are well drilled but still utterly live in the moment.Dance People review – join Edinburgh festival’s promenade of protest and playRead moreSome highlights: the woman who balances two men on her shoulders – take that, gender norms! A funny set piece with two men in a tight embrace thwarting other performers’ increasingly desperate attempts to infiltrate their hug. And the edgy energy of an aerial straps routine where the performer is like a trapped insect, spiky limbs attacking or struggling to get free, rather than the usual silken grace you get from aerialists.There’s no great message here, bar “Look at how awesome these performers are”. They are enjoying every minute, and displaying human instincts as much as animal ones. The charged atmosphere plateaus a little way before the end – a more expansive soundtrack could have helped with the arc – but Circa show they are the masters at what they do.AtUnderbelly Circus Hub on the Meadows, Edinburgh, until 23 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025CircusEdinburgh festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jen Pawol, a 48-year-old former art teacher, made US sporting history at the weekend when she becamethe first female umpire of a Major League Baseball gameduring the regular season.Pawol, whose debut came on Saturday in a game between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves, was given a standing ovation as she arrived on the pitch. Supporters held up signs reading “Pawol making HERstory” and “the time has come for one and all to play ball” – a nostalgic reference to A League of Their Own, the classic sports film about a women’s baseball league during the second world war.Pawol told reporters: “Wow, just incredible, the dream came true … the dream actually came true today.” She added: “It was pretty amazing when we took the field, and it seemed like quite a few people started clapping and saying my name, so that was pretty intense and very emotional.”View image in fullscreenThe crowd at Truist Park gave Pawol a warm welcome.Photograph: Brett Davis/Getty ImagesAlthough MLB has had female coaches and general managers, there had, until this weekend, never been a female umpire in a regular season game. “I’m aware of the gravity. I’m aware of the magnitude,” she said, as quoted by MLB.com.Growing up in Long Island, New York, where baseball was always on the television, Pawol said she had always known she wanted that to change. “I had it [umpiring] in my DNA,” she has said.Pawol “begged” her parents to let her play baseball when she was a child. But at the time, girls played softball, and so she did that instead, according to a profile inThe Athleticin 2023.Her first experience as a softball umpire came in 1990 when a friend asked her to work a game with her. Pawol also got a master’s degree in painting from Hunter College in New York and, alongside sport, worked as an art teacher.She had been umpiring softball for about 10 years before being invited in 2015 to attend a one-day MLB umpiring camp in Cincinnati. That was when she realised her dream of becoming a major league umpire was within reach, she said on Saturday.“I made a point to get there as soon as I could, to give it my best shot,” Pawol added. After that, she won a scholarship to MLB’s umpire academy, saying: “When I realised I could be a major leaguer, I just went for it.”View image in fullscreenJen Pawol turned pro back in 2016 and has worked her way through minor league baseball.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAIn an interview withMLB.comin 2022, Pawol said she was encouraged to attend the one-day camp after someone told her how welcoming the MLB umpire camps were for women. “As soon as I heard that, I went and checked it out for myself, and they were right,” she said. “I think more women need to know that it’s a safe environment, it’s welcoming, it’s incredible. I went in 2015 … I had an amazing time, I felt like it was going to be a great day, and it turned out to be amazing and it was going to change my life, actually.”Despite the progress, in an interview withMLB.comin 2016, the year Pawol became professional, she said she was well aware of the additional scrutiny on her.“I can control my hustle, my calls, my professionalism. But gender and colour and things like that, no one can control those,” she said. “I can see why people are talking about it, asking those questions, because of the rarity of women being involved.”But the trailblazer steadily rose through the ranks and in 2023 became the first female umpire to reach Triple-A: the highest level of play in US minor league baseball.After the game on Saturday, Pawol donated the hat she wore to the NationalBaseballHall of Fame and Museum, which she visited as a child.She returns to the field on Sunday, when she will stand behind home plate in the last match of a three-game series.Explore more on these topicsBaseballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then she walked through the door with blue hair, which was rather amusing! She was lovely from the outset – friendly and interesting. We started with some shredded prawn rolls and deep-fried lotus root.CushlaWe were both a little wary. I decided to set him at ease by saying: “Don’t worry, my partner voted for Brexit.” He said: “Why are you here, then? You dine across the divide every evening!” I was expecting a grumpy old man. You can create a two-dimensional stereotype in your brain, and Martin wasn’t that. The place was lovely.View image in fullscreenThe big beefMartinI have seen a significant change in crime and general disorder even in the last couple of years – people jumping the barriers in the tube, shoplifting, phone-snatching, seemingly without repercussions. To get a grip on crime, you need to start tackling it at the lower level, otherwise people start thinking they can get away with it.Dining across the divide: ‘A 31-month sentence for the Tory councillor’s wife seems a bit harsh’Read moreCushlaMartin is training to become a magistrate and talked about his experience of watching people come in and out of court. I think he’s far more in favour of imprisonment. I countered by saying: let’s look at doing more restorative justice – giving offenders the chance to really encounter the impact of their crimes.MartinSome people who break the law, generally more white-collar criminals, are not best served by prison. But for severe crimes – violent, sexual – I think people should be kept in a lot longer than they are, away from society. It requires more cross-party planning, though. Investing in a prison is a 10- or 15-year project; governments don’t want to put money into that because they’ll be out of power by the time the prison is built.CushlaI think I would be a different kind of magistrate, but I say that from a position of hopeful naivety. I know the justice system is broken, that there is insufficient money.View image in fullscreenSharing plateMartinWe shared how much we despised the Tory government after 14 years of incompetence and were incredulous that the Labour party think the way to make things better is to cut disability payments and not revoke the two-child benefit cap.CushlaIt surprised me that we agreed that the cap should be removed. When you’re poor, you’re poor, and the early stages are when the most good – and most damage – can be done.View image in fullscreenFor aftersMartinGovernments across all political parties have consistently promised to tackle illegal immigration and completely failed to do so. It’s a cliche, but you’re letting people into your house without knowing who they are. I’d favour some kind of holding and assessment system – more like the solution Australia came up with where they housed everyone on an island while they processed their applications and determined who should be let in and who shouldn’t.CushlaI’m frustrated by the tag “illegal”. People are not born “illegal”; we’re creating the conditions for them to become so. I came here on an ancestry visa so I am “legal” by an accident of birth. What makes my accident of birth any better or worse than someone else’s? And given the UK’s history in the world, the UK does actually have a very particular moral obligation, whether it likes it or not.View image in fullscreenTakeawaysMartinIt was great to meet someone with different views but also to be able to have a conversation, rather than just throw opinions at each other. I think it’s society that demands we take extreme positions, and really, we’re not far away from each other in what we think.CushlaWhen people think differently you don’t tend to hear why or get the opportunity to actually challenge your own thinking. What this has taught me is you have to listen to rather than talk.View image in fullscreenAdditional reporting: Kitty DrakeCushla and Martin ate atXi Home Dumplings Bayin London E1Want to meet someone from across the divide?Find out how to take partExplore more on these topicsLife and styleDining across the divideSocial trendsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Alice Theobald at Arlington Artists using Rhug Wild Beauty and Stila. Archive photograph: courtesy of Tim MinchinBorn in 1975 in Northampton and raised in Perth, Australia, Tim Minchin is a musician, comedian, actor, writer and director. Starting out in musical theatre, he turned to comedy in 2003, winning the 2005 Perrier best newcomer at the fringe. In 2008, the Royal Shakespeare Company commissioned him to write music and lyrics for a stage adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Matilda – it has since won seven Olivier awards and four Tonys. He is married with two children and lives in Sydney. His new album,Tim MinchinTime Machine, is out now. Matilda the Musical is playing in the UK and Ireland.As photos were so rare in the 80s, compared with now, there’s a formality to my physicality here. I look proud, but as I didn’t like primary school, I would have been unhappy that it was time to go to class. I found the whole school experience very scary.I was a sickly kid. Not in a Dickensian way – I didn’t have consumption – but I wasn’t very hardy. I had asthma and allergies and I was quite deaf for a lot of my childhood. Because of that, I’d get in trouble for not listening in lessons, when in reality I couldn’t hear what the teacher had said.Tim Minchin: Songs the World Will Never Hear review – a bumper night with the marvellous misfitRead morePhysical ailments aside, I was a gentle, sensitive child. So much so that my mum was surprised about what happened to me professionally. She’d say: “But you were my little cuddly one!” As well as having loving parents, I was lucky with my siblings. I grew up with an older brother who’s also a soft guy – we wrestled and played outside, but he wasn’t a big frightening presence that I had to develop armour to survive.After primary school, I went to an all-boys’ school where I was a soprano, and pretty good at theatre, too, although I didn’t get the lead roles. I loved sport and was really good at hockey, and always in the top teams. I wasn’t a prefect, and I sometimes got in trouble for being cheeky. I had a privileged education and received the sort of confidence you get with that, but I don’t think I’m a monster. It wasn’t Eton. Anyway, I think how you turn out has much more to do with what’s happening at home, and my family was totally plugged in: disciplined but attentive.There was a fair bit ofVon Trappstuffgoing on around the house, too – a piano, some intergenerational harmonising. But that drive to become an entertainer truly came from a fundamental need for affirmation. I wanted people to like me, and I wanted to show that I was clever. Maybe it’s also because I am a second child with an outstanding older brother, but mostly it’s in the wiring. Not many people admit it: actors, musicians, writers, they all talk about how they want to change the world, or that they are a storyteller. But, essentially, we just like being clapped.I haven’t read a single review for years – no articles, no Google. When I do, the fragility is patheticAs a teenager I was compulsively meta-cognitive, which might make me appear self-important or smug, but it took me years to realise that not everyone is always thinking about their thoughts. Despite that, I wasn’t very navel-gazing. I wasn’t particularly cool or uncool. I didn’t fit into any cultural tribe and I was definitely not a rebel. I think it’s a family thing: I never felt like I was the black sheep or had the instinct to kick against or pull away from them, like: “Fuck my middle-class parents! Fuck my really nice, kind, hard-working dad! Fuck my slightly bonkers but incredibly passionate mother!”I never really had a dream,either,but I definitely had a defiance – I was sure I was going to keep writing. I started doing musical theatre at 18, and I noticed that people cried at my songs. I realised I could do something that not everyone around me could do. Because I was in Perth, I thought: “Well, if I’m good in Perth, when I move to Melbourne, there’ll be 100 other guys like me.” Then I moved and, while there were lots of talented people, I kept waiting to find people who were much better than me at whatever the fuck it is I do – an act I’ve since defined as a science-obsessed rhymey pianist singer-satirist wanker – but they weren’t in Melbourne, either.When I was in my 20s, I met Eddie Perfect, a rising star in Melbourne cabaret. I would play piano for him, and in between songs, my instinct would be to make people laugh, just by being self-deprecating. So then I could bill myself as the piano and comedy guy. At the end of 2004, I decided to change my appearance – I looked like a mad genius with the big hair and makeup, and everything clicked into place. It also helped that I was talking about science and we were in a post‑9/11, new atheism world. My shows were super-nerdy, data-driven, pointing out logical fallacies, while also being sentimental and loving and musical. I had a worldview and a look – and people liked it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Then Sarah, my wife, got pregnant and we lost the pregnancy. This was hard, grown-up stuff, but it became the greatest gift. Being a little older, I had the tools to make smart choices. I never suddenly fucked other people or took drugs. Having a partner who’s not sucked into the industry also made it easier. Sarah has an unflinching ability to not really give a fuck about the celebrity side. She looks hot in a dress, but red carpets are not her thing. Because of that, I never had a real wobble with fame.Standup Susie McCabe looks back: ‘I knew very early on that I was different from other girls. Everyone else did, too’’Read moreWhat I mainly struggled withwas the concept of being perceived. Of wanting to be seen your whole life, and then being properly seen and then told what you are. My act’s been called both “genius” and “bullshit that only dumb people find funny”. Because of this, I haven’t read a single review for years, no articles, no Google. If I do, there’s a psychic repositioning that takes place, and it takes years, maybe for ever, to realign. I got a phone call yesterday from an agent saying: “You had two absolutely amazing Matilda reviews today.” I replied: “Don’t say that, because now I want to read it, and there will be one sentence that says, ‘In the second act, it lags a bit’, and that will ruin my day.” Tomorrow, instead of being engaged with the audience, I’ll be thinking about a reviewer. The fragility is pathetic.Matilda arrived in 2008, right at the height of my comedy fame. I worked quickly, as Sarah was pregnant with Casper – six weeks to write 10 songs. The show’s success gave me money to make braver creative choices, which in turn have been successful. But it all comes with constant anxiety. Four weeks ago, at the start of the latest Matilda tour, I was unrecognisable. Heavy and sick, because of the stress of selling 100,000 tickets to a show that you have to will into existence. Now the show is up and going, and I am running every day, eating properly – I feel as good as I’ve felt in my life.As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realised the motive is not to be revered and applauded, but to spend a life trying to put human feelings into song and poems and text, TV scripts and performances. To confront and seduce, to make an audience laugh and think and cry. That’s what the art is for.Explore more on these topicsTim MinchinFlashbackFamilyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was getting married, and needed a bra to go under my wedding dress. To my surprise and delight, my fitter was the same woman: Margaret, whose strong South African accent jogged my memory.I told Margaret how amazing she was to me that day six years ago – and she remembered me! We were both a bit tearful, hugged again and once again she helped me find a bra. It felt like coming full circle. I later wrote to the store to tell them what a wonderful employee they have. With no drama and no fuss, Margaret had known exactly how to soothe me in my moment of distress.Of course, Margaret had been absolutely right all those years ago – everything was, eventually, OK. The mastectomy got rid of all the cancer, sparing me the need for any radiation or chemotherapy. My partner and I got married last month and it was a wonderful celebration of how great life can be. And the bra Margaret helped me pick out for the big day was just perfect.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The one thing that made all of that tolerable was magazines and, more particularly, teen magazine big summer quizzes. I, for one, loved them. Agonising over my answers, totting up my points using an unnecessarily complex scoring system, then reading earnestly what my “summer style” or “party personality” was or whether I was a “great best friend” was as good as it got.And so, in honour of the magazines loved and gone, I’ve justwastedspent hours crafting my own summer quiz, which I’m calling “What’s your 2025 vibe?” Apologies to aficionados – it’s insufficiently granular for a proper 90s girls’ mag quiz (true masters could craft 20 psychologically probing questions to tease out what swimsuit style you should try).

Her reply opened my eyesMichaela MakushaMy mother’s own dedication to parenthood has always floored me, but I realised I hadn’t understood where it came fromSun 10 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 09.50 EDTShareTo me, my mother is Mummy and Mum; the fount of all knowledge and the source of love; the keeper of the rulebook and the holder of the cheerleader’s pompoms. She’s all of those things, but she is also a madwoman, who on her first night out in England from Zimbabwe was shocked by how cold it was after leaving her flat in a short skirt and heels, no jacket. She was pushed into hockey, literally, by her friend, who shoved her out of the line when the coach asked for a volunteer. I am named after that friend. My mother is both a protester and a nurturer; she has been teargassed at least twice (that I know of) while protesting in the name of human rights. Her life is a series of near misses and question marks, which I enjoy learning about and am sometimes horrified by.Given the obvious richness of her experience, I have asked her many times why she decided to have children. I couldn’t figure out why somebody who had such a full life would want to risk changing it for anything. When I was a teenager, she jokingly responded that she was bored. But as I get older, my curiosity has only grown. Because of her difficulties with endometriosis, the chances of her having children were slim. Becoming an older, black mother sounded even harder, with the risks associated with so-called geriatric pregnancies andsystemic racism within maternal health settings.One day, we were having a conversation at home, laughing about one of those interior design shows in which the couple had a child on the way and another running around, when I asked her again why she decided to have children when everything about it sounds so stressful and tiring. “I wanted to be a mother on my own terms. Not anyone else’s,” she told me. And then she went on: “Everyone has this magical idea of a baby. But those babies don’t stay babies.” By this, I understood that she never felt any pressure to have children because she had always looked at children as separate beings – not as possessions or boxes to tick or part of a life plan. What it said about her attitude to life – the determination to raise a person rather than be a mother for the sake of it – really floored me.Everyone asks me about my plans for having children. A nest of noisy miner birds has taught me how to respond | Joseph EarpRead more“What about getting married?” I asked her, and she answered with an indescribable look that I have yet to capture on camera. She told me she had never wanted to be a wife. Not that she thought marriage was a bad thing; in fact, her own parents had a long, happy marriage. But her father once told her that marriage and giving birth were not exactly achievements. Living a life worth talking about, where you made a difference, big or small, caring for other people – that is what mattered. That was the example she should give to children she might have. And that’s what she tried to do.And so, in her mid-30s, she decided she was ready to pass on what she had experienced and learned to a new generation.I told her: “I don’t think I’ll ever have children.” I had said so on many occasions, usually after babysitting a younger cousin or friend’s child – the best form of birth control. However, I wondered, did my mother wish to be a grandmother? My early childhood is filled with fond memories and pictures of her mother, my Gogo. She was excited to be a grandmother, for her daughter to have daughters.But she shrugged and said: “Good. You could change your mind, but someone who realises early on that they don’t want children is someone who recognises the immense responsibility it is.” If children were meaningful to me, that was good. If not, still good. She had a life before, during and after me. She has her bookcases full of novels, a rack full of good wine and holidays planned for herself in business class. We were her joy – but not the only thing in life that brought her joy. Her approach has always been: live a good life, do something meaningful. Basically, just don’t kill anyone.I do not have children. Maybe that will change; it is highly likely it will not. But I am always comforted to know that whether I raise dogs, alpacas, cats or even children, my mother will be fine with my choices.Michaela Makusha is a freelance journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why have WhatsApp groups become so stressful?Polly HudsonThere is the initial group. Then the side group. Then another splinter group. Suddenly, in your bones, you know the wrong message is going to end up with the wrong person …Sun 10 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 12.26 EDTShareIt’s the new last taboo. Officially added to the list of topics you absolutely must not discuss, along with politics, money and religion: theWhatsAppside group. Apparently nobody told Melanie C from the Spice Girls though, because she has just revealed far too much about theirs.“There are subgroups within the group,” she told the Sydney Morning Herald’sSunday Lifemagazine. “I definitely know there is a chat group that doesn’t contain me, but somewhere else we keep Ginger or Posh out.”Staying up to date with your side chats – not least ensuring each message you send doesn’t go on the wrong thread – is the most anxiety-ridden full-time job most of us have ever had. A friend of mine has a group with five mums from her daughter’s class, and another whittled down to four of them, then more with three, two and one. How she keeps track without the use of a murder investigation board with red strings pinned to photographs is genuinely a mystery.The latest data tells us what we already knew: WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world with more than3 billionmonthly active users. I think at this point I’m in a group with all of them. There’s no faster, easier, more convenient way of staying in touch and making arrangements – and that’s the problem. It’s so quick and simple to set up a group that any social situation including more than two participants seems to result in one being formed. Often the conversation goes on, whether out of desire or politeness, long after the event has passed. This method of interacting can lead you down some ludicrous avenues, such as the recent debate I found myself in about whether “hearting” an invitation means you’re simply thanking the person for their kind offer or formally accepting it in a legally binding manner. (For the record, it’s the former,right?)Complicating matters further is that we’re not only in groups with our mates, but also those we know only barely, or sometimes not at all. I’m on a local WhatsApp group, formed to support quarantining neighbours in 2020, that’s now a forum for questions that could have been Googled, passive-aggressive comments, and generous offers of free furniture people can’t be bothered to take to the tip. It’s filled with characters I’ve mostly never met but feel intimately acquainted with, and I have several side groups with friends on my road discussing the more controversial posts. Even the profile picture is divisive – one member’s cat, Daisy, who half the street love and enjoy sharing sightings of, and the other half (secretly) hate because she defecates on their doorsteps. Recently a newcomer who’d left his back door open in the hot weather reported that Daisy had strolled into his house and started eating his dinner, with photographs to prove it. My phone got so hot through side-chat action I was worried it might explode. Worth it.It’s fast becoming second nature to double check that each message is being put on the correct thread before posting, like the modern equivalent of the adage “measure twice because you can only cut once”. Deleting, even if you’re so lightning quick nobody had yet read it, leaves a notification that’s such a clear admission of guilt you may as well have not bothered. Imagine what everyone would be saying in the side chats about you then!Gen Z has brought us the 6pm dinner – and I am not ready for it | Polly HudsonRead moreI took a vow of silence on our school chat when a fellow mum’s husband read ours over her shoulder and observed sagely: “No one comes out of this looking good, do they?” Legend has it that another class has a note pinned to the top of their group with the rules that must be abided by within, including, “No LOLs.” The author’s ears must have been warmer than my phone the day she typed that.And anyway, there’s only one real law when it comes to WhatsApp groups and subgroups – muting the thread is fine, but actually exiting is not the done thing. Whatever you preface your farewell with, those you leave behind will get the message “*Your name* has left the group”, with all the hair flicking and flouncing out that implies. Etiquette-wise, it’s a no.You’ve made/been added without consent to your WhatsApp bed, and now you will lie in it for the rest of your life. A la the Hotel California, you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionWhatsAppSocial etiquetteFriendshipcommentShareReuse this content"

To say that the cost of everything from a pint of milk to a loaf of bread has changed beyond recognition in only a few years is an understatement. But it could still get worse.Thewarning from the Bank of England last weekthat food prices are stirring the inflation beast that has stalked Britain for the past four years shows that the cost of living crisis is far from over. The headline rate of inflation is expected to hit 4% by September, in a reawakening fed by the soaring cost of things such as butter, chocolate and beef.Keeping inflation in check is a high-stakes job. Successive governments have foundered on the promise of putting more money in people’s pockets, only for voters to find that their hard-earned cash barely covers the rising cost of bills, food and other essentials.For Rishi Sunak, it was clearly a mistake to gamble the last election on a bet that a halving in the headline rate of inflation would help households forget the previous 14 years of pain. Real living standards went backwards in the Tory years. ForKeir Starmer, the same could be true if the change Labour promised does not begin to materialise soon.UK food inflation: why your barbecue meat is becoming more expensiveRead moreLast week, the prime minister used the promise of putting more pounds in your pocket to deflect rumours of an autumn budget laden with tax increases. “The focus [at the budget] will very much be on living standards and making sure people feel better off,” he said.However, Threadneedle Street’s dire forecasts showed Labour has added to the problems of high inflation, as food producers and retailers pass on the higher costs of employment triggered by Rachel Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions.Despite a global rise in food price inflation, the Bank warned that Britain was still an outlier, with an annual rate 1.5% higher than in the euro area. “Higher labour costs are contributing to food price inflation in the UK,” it added.For the government, this is worrying stuff. Particularly as inflation driven by rising food prices is felt most by the poorest households in society – at a time whenLabourhas a job to prove that tackling poverty remains a top priority.Food price inflation hits those on low incomes most because they spend disproportionately more of their monthly budgets on the essentials of life compared with the wealthiest, who have more room to cut discretionary spending. While thepoorest fifth spend 14.4% on food and drink, the figure is 8.5% for the richest.For Labour’s political opponents, and for Nigel Farage and Reform in particular, this is a gift. Starmer actively making the problems Labour sets out to fix worse, with the poor paying the price, is already the message Reform is using totarget working-class voterson the doorstep.Starmer and Reeves should be mindful that an autumn budget that fails to acknowledge the renewed inflationary pain for hard-pressed households will only make defeating Farage harder.However, despite the bad news from the Bank last week, its grim inflation forecast also gave Labour evidence to show voters why Farage would have all the wrong answers.For some time economists have been warning that Britain is exposed to growing dangers from “climateflation” – when extreme weather, droughts and floods drive up living costs. To some, including Farage, this might sound like an abstract risk more likely to afflict countries far from our cold, wet shores.However, the Bank showed that the danger has already moved from risk to reality, highlighting how worsening climate conditions are adding to this latest inflationary burst.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The other half – from global heating – is only going to get worse.Most of the food Britain consumes – about 58% – is domestically produced. But international food prices still have a material impact. That is because many food items are globally traded goods, with prices determined by world markets.Erecting Brexit barriers with the EU – the source of 24% of food supplies – has not helped. Meanwhile, only 33 countries worldwide account for 90% of imported supply, raising the fragility of the UK supply chain by concentrating the risks in certain countries.Throughout history climate conditions and wars have influenced the economy, including theGreat Frost of 1709leaving England with the worst recession – until the Covid pandemic – for three centuries, and the Great Famine forcing a quarter of Ireland’s population to emigrate in the 19th century.But the pace of climate change hasincreased dramatically– the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and proceeding at a rate not seen in millennia. Add on top of that mounting geopolitical tensions, conflicts and a breakdown in global trade amid Donald Trump’s tariff war, and the picture is bleak.Labour can show clearly that Farage’s pledge to scrap net zero is more than counterproductive. Failure to limit global heating, in which Britain can play a leading international role, would hurt the poorest households most.Explore more on these topicsUK cost of living crisisEconomics viewpointInflationNigel FarageFood & drink industryKeir StarmerRachel ReevesLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

It travels “like a meteorite” at 10 times the speed of sound and can reach any city in Europe, Putin boasted – which, if true, is a clear INF violation. Moscow blames its decision to ditch the treaty on hostile Nato actions. Yet it has long bypassed it in practice, notably bybasing missilesin Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic sea, and Belarus.That said, Russia has a point about Nato. Donald Trump firstreneged on the INF treatyway back in 2018. The subsequent huge buildup of mainly US-produced nuclear-capable missiles, launchers, planes and bombs in European Nato states has understandably alarmed Moscow. It should alarm Europeans, too. In the 1980s, deployments of US Pershing and cruise missilessparked passionate protestsacross the continent. In contrast, today’s ominous tick-tocking of theDoomsday Clock, closer than ever to catastrophe at 89 seconds to midnight, is mostly accompanied by eerie silence.Trump’s melodramatic claim last week to have moved US nuclear submarines closer to Russia came in response to crude threats from the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, a notorious Putin stooge. It was another chilling moment. But this puerile standoff will have served a useful purpose if it alerts slumbering European public opinion to the growing risk of nuclear confrontation. Maybe people have grown complacent; maybe they have too many other worries. Maybe governments such as Britain’s,suspected of secretly stashingUS nuclear gravity bombs at an East Anglian airbase, are again failing to tell the truth. (The UK government refuses to say whether or not American nukes are now at RAF Lakenheath.)Whatever the reason, it falls to the children of the cold war – to thedaughters of Greenham Common, to the heirs of ban-the-bomb protesters, to CND’s indefatigable campaigners – to more loudly warn: this way lies extinction. Yet why is it that they alone sound the tocsin? It’s all happening again, only this time it’s worse, and everyone’s a target. If unchecked, today’s vastly more powerful nukes could turn the planet into a universal killing field. Last week’s ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings should beseen as a warningas well as a reminder.The nuclear weapons buildup in Europe proceeds apace. The US already stores nuclear bombs in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey. Now the UK, too, has offered facilities – and isbuying nuclear-capablefighter jets. Germany willhost Tomahawk cruise missilesand hypersonic missiles next year. The US is expanding missile bases inPolandandRomania. Nato countries such asDenmarkandNorwayhave joined missile exercises aimed, for example, at establishing “control” of the Baltic.All this is justified in the name of self-defence, principally against Putin’s Russia. Likewise, Nato’s decision in June to raise national defence budgets to5% of GDP. The global picture is no less disturbing. The nine nuclear-armed states – Britain, China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia and the US –spent $100.2bn, or $3,169 a second, on nuclear weapons last year, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) reported. That’s up 11% on 2023.I changed my mind on banning the bomb, but the threat of nuclear war is growing – and so is complacency | Polly ToynbeeRead moreUnder Trump’s proposed 2026 budget plan, the US, already by far the biggest spender, willincrease fundingfor its nuclear forces, including the new Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile, by 26% to $87bn. Doing its bit for global insecurity, China hasmore than doubledits nuclear stockpile since 2020, to 500 warheads.Who can doubt where all this is leading? For the first time since the cold war, Europe, Asia and the Middle East are being transformed into potential nuclear battlegrounds, with the difference, now, that atomic bombs and missiles are viewed not as deterrents but as offensive, war-winning weapons. The proliferation of lower-yield, tactical warheads supposedly makes “limited” nuclear warfare possible. Once that red line is crossed, an unstoppable chain reaction may ensue.The collapse of arms-control agreements – the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start) will benext to lapsein February 2026 – is destroying safety nets. Signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty are bound “in good faith” to gradually disarm; instead, they are rapidly rearming. Dehumanised AI systems may raise the risk of accidental Armageddon. Rogue states such as Israel and North Korea constantly push the boundaries. Trump’s impetuosity and Putin’s psychosis increase the sense of living in a global shooting gallery.It might have been very different. In June 1945, a group of University of Chicago nuclear physicists led by James Franck told President Harry Truman that an unannounced atomic bomb attack on Japan was “inadvisable”. Detonating the new weapon would trigger an uncontrollable worldwide arms race, they predicted. Their warnings were rejected, their report suppressed. Now, the UN is trying again. In line with the 2021 treatyoutlawing nuclear weapons, a high-powered, international scientific panel was tasked last monthwith examining“the physical effects and societal consequences” of nuclear war “on a local, regional and planetary scale”.The challenge is formidable, the outcome uncertain. But someone, somehow, somewhere must call a halt to the madness. It is still just possible to hope that, unlike in 1945, wiser counsels will prevail.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionRussiaProtestcommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s why that’s importantGwen PearsonYes, they can be hard to spot – but this find highlights how little we know about creatures crucial to our ecosystemGwen Pearson is adjunct professor at Michigan State University Department of EntomologySun 10 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 16.35 EDTShareScientists recently announced they had found anenormous new stick insectin Australia. At 41cm in length and weighing 44g, the main question I heard was: “Why didn’t scientists notice something that big before now?”The short answer is: it’s a stick. Stick insects spent over 100m years perfecting their cosplay as leaves, branches and moss. They are diabolically difficult to spot, even with fairly acute human vision. If you disturb a stick insect, its usual response is to fall to the ground and lie still. So now you are looking for a stick lying on the ground … among all the other sticks.Scientists were alerted to the presence of this new insect,Acrophylla alta,by a photo posted on iNaturalist, the community science sharing site. Based on that image, they spent several nights tramping through a rainforest with headlamps and flashlights, hoping for a glimpse of this rare new beast. They eventually located and knocked the stick insect off of its perch, which can be 30 metres up in the tree canopy, with a long (actual) stick.Phasmids (stick and leaf insects) are an incredible example of natural selection at work. As herbivores quietly munching leaves, stick insects are a delicious snack for many other animals. Evolution shaped the 3,500-plus described species of phasmids into stunning examples of camouflage, usually by pretending to be objects that are irrelevant to predators: sticks, bark and leaves. They solved the problem of hiding in plain sight through a variety of forms most beautiful and wonderful; their bodies range from long skinny tubes to wide and flattened leaf shapes.Stick insects are grouped into delightful categories with names like broad prickly sticks, winged bark huggers, stout crawlers, narrow leaf mimics andtree lobsters. The last is a group best described as insects that gave up on the whole delicate leaf and twig act to become heavily armoured, spiny tanks – determined to make a predator profoundly regret ever trying to eat them.As a former keeper of stick and leaf insects in a bug zoo, I can attest to just how good these animals are at being invisible. Even when you knew there were exactly 10 leaf insects in a cage, finding numbers 9 and 10 always involved a long manual search of every single branch and leaf, sometimes requiring multiple people. Jungle nymphs (Heteropteryx dilatata) are 17cm lime-green spiky monsters that somehow manage to disappear into foliage despite their size. Often you only discovered one by getting a painful kick from a spiny leg.The recently described Australian stick insect also lives in a rainforest tree canopy, so it’s not surprising it remained hidden for so long. Insects and their relatives are the animals science knows the least about, despite being some of the most abundant organisms on Earth. After almost three centuries of taxonomic research, scientists have only described andnamed about 1m insect species; thousands of new species are added to that total yearly.View image in fullscreenThisAcrophylla altais 41cm long and weighs 44g.Photograph: Professor Angus Emmott, James Cook University/ReutersThe question is not why weird new insects keep getting described by science, but why there aren’t more strange insects, spiders and other relatives with extra legs being discovered daily. Research suggests that at least 5m insect species exist, and insects and their relatives (arthropods) make up 85% of all known animal species. To put that in context, there are as many species ofjust ladybirdsas there are of all mammals combined.The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species is a good benchmark to get a sense of how little we know. IUCN is the primary information source on the global conservation status of animal species, but its database lists only 1.3% of known insect species for evaluation. For the entire category of insects, the most species-rich animals on our planet, IUCN’s data table simply says “insufficient coverage”. It simply doesn’t have enough data toestimate the percentageof threatened insect species.Naming and describing is just the first step of understanding and preserving our biological diversity. For many species, we have no idea where they live, what they eat, or what their lives are like. Of the insects listed in the IUCN database, 26% are listed as “data deficient”. This adorable littlewillowherb leafcutter beeis extinct in the UK, and we don’t know enough about it to say much more than that.By focusing on large, charismatic animals, we miss understanding the little animals that run our world and provide essential ecosystem services. It’s little invertebrates that pollinate plants, feed birds and other animals, and keep soils healthy. They deserve to be studied as much, or more, than their bigger vertebrate kin. Concentrating on common threats to animals, big and small, can help us make better choices about prioritising research and conservation.Gwen Pearson is adjunct faculty at Michigan State University Department of Entomology.

Widespread anxiety about basic freedoms is a feature of more repressive regimes.Many people will only have heard of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) in the context of the last Conservative government’sfailed attemptsto dispatch asylum seekers to Rwanda, or in a handful of incidents where convicted criminals or terrorist suspects have avoided deportation to jurisdictions where they might face inhumane treatment. Such cases are amplified by politicians who are hostile to the whole apparatus of human rights law. The Strasbourg court that adjudicates on breaches of the ECHR is denounced as an enemy of British sovereignty.Those attacks will continue for as long as asylum, and small-boats traffic on the Channel in particular, are salient political issues – for the foreseeable future, in other words.Labour’s new “one-in, one-out” scheme for returning seaborne refugees is more robust in legal and humanitarian terms than the failed Tory method. France is a safe country. That won’t stop critics accusing the government of failing to control the border and citing international human rights conventions as the main impediment to the restoration of law and order.Nigel Farage has said he would “get rid of the ECHR” as a day-one priority should Reform UK ever form a government. Kemi Badenoch is drifting to the same position, albeit with circumspection. The Conservative leader acknowledges that peremptory rupture is not straightforward, especially for Northern Ireland since European convention rights are woven into the Good Friday agreement. Mrs Badenoch hascommissioned a reportto consider how an ECHR exit might be achieved but expressed her personal view that Britain “will likely need to leave” because human rights are wielded as a “sword … to attack democratic decisions and common sense.”The core argument, for both Mrs Badenoch and Mr Farage, is that voters want politicians to expel undesirable elements from society but the popular will is being thwarted by unelected judges.Human rights, in this conception, are a loophole through which criminals and foreign interlopers evade justice.Ideas codified after the second world war as foundational principles of a new democratic settlement forEuropeare recast as attacks on the law-abiding majority. This rhetorical subterfuge gets a purchase on public discourse through channels previously opened by Brexit. The ECHR is not an EU institution, but the fact of it being European in name stirs suspicion that it is an alien imposition.Dispensing with human rights obligations would be a necessary step for any government seeking to emulateDonald Trump’s programmeof detaining and deporting migrants without regard for due process. It is not far-fetched to envisage a Reform government recreating that model, given Mr Farage’srecord of admirationfor Mr Trump.ECHR rulings are not infallible. A 71-year-old institution can reasonably be scrutinised with a view to reform. But that is not what its noisiest UK antagonists have in mind. They target the convention not because it is a big part of public life, but because it is a minor one and poorly understood. It is a soft target in a longer campaign to undermine judicial independence, discredit liberal principle and, ultimately, degrade the rule of law to the benefit of unaccountable executive power.Explore more on these topicsHuman rightsOpinionHuman Rights ActEuropeFranceeditorialsShareReuse this content"

A change in political climate has revealed their weaknessesSun 10 Aug 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 16.40 EDTShareEarlier this month, as Nordic countries were hit with anunprecedented heatwaveand wildfires in the US began spurting“fire clouds”, Barclays pulled out of the net zero banking alliance. Thestorymay have seemed less alarming than extreme weather, but it has existential implications, as the finance sector quietly surrenders its former climate commitments.The initiative forms part of the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a voluntary network of banks thatMark Carney, formerly the UN’s special envoy on climate action and now Canada’s prime minister, launched in 2021. At the time, the alliance, which encourages banks and asset managers to work towards the goals of the Paris agreement, seemed like an optimistic step in the right direction. Mr Carney described it as a “breakthrough”.But times change. The election of Donald Trump, whose advisers have waged war on “climate fanaticism” and “woke” capitalism, has created an environment of impunity where businesses no longer need to even pay lip service to progress. Fossil fuel companiesdonated $19mto Mr Trump’s inauguration fund. So far, their investment has paid off. Mr Trump haswithdrawnfrom the Paris agreement, used an“invented”energy emergency to justify the expansion of fossil fuels, openedpublic landsto drilling, and plans tocut fundingfor renewable energy.With America reneging on climate action, businesses may feel they can relax. Barclays is the second British bank to leave the net zero alliance afterHSBCquit earlier this year. Six of the largest US banks quitjust weeksbefore Mr Trump’s inauguration. Some institutions have come under direct pressure from the right: BlackRock left the net zero asset managers initiative, another GFANZ group, after it was sued byRepublicanswho claimed its promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals had cut coal production. In each of his annual investor letters from 2020 to 2024, BlackRock’s chair, Larry Fink, namechecked climate change. His2025 lettermade no mention of it.The deterioration of GFANZ reveals the weaknesses in relying on businesses to do the right thing. Its goals were always fuzzy: instead of calling for hard limits on the financing of fossil fuels, GFANZ encouraged banks to invest in low-carbon sectors. It has since drifted further from its mission,expanding its membershipto companies without net zero commitments. Though it was never supposed to be a substitute for government action, inactive governments welcomed it. Boris Johnson, prime minister at the time of its creation, promised the alliance would help to“build back greener”.Many green finance initiatives have less to do with preventing climate breakdown than minimising investors’ exposure to the risks this creates, such as carbon taxes or curbs on fossil fuels. “Green ethical investing”,writesAdrienne Buller, is a way of betting “on the likelihood of a greener economy, rather than contribute to bringing that economy into being”. When the risk of regulation wanes, as it has under Trump, so too does the impetus for this style of investing.The lesson is that government action (and inaction) will determine the severity of the climate crisis. Governments need to prohibit fossil fuel extraction, reduce profits throughprogressive carbon taxes, support renewables and confront powerful interests. The myth that businesses are capable of self-policing has led to a dangerous delay.Explore more on these topicsGreen economyOpinionMark CarneyClimate crisisBarclaysBankingDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

I asked my husband to check all the taps – upstairs bathroom, downstairs toilet, the kitchen. He assured me there were no dripping taps. He refused to check again. We argued. I checked. I desperately wanted to find the source of the noise. Nothing. What was that sound? Where was it coming from? I tried to ignore it. Then I was told.My husband, a GP, explained – calmly, with all the understanding he could muster – that I had tinnitus, like Lara Williams (A moment that changed me: on the day of my first book deal, a mysterious hum overcame me, 6 August). How did I get it? Where had it come from? He couldn’t tell me. “It just comes,” he said. I hated him. I didn’t sleep at all that night, nor the night after. The noise was unbearable.On the third night, I remember standing on the landing, crying. I was filled with rage. Then my son, David, came to the rescue. He put his headphones on my head, and a beautiful sound replaced the racket in my ears. It was How Deep Is Your Love by the Bee Gees. Tears still streamed down, but I began to feel a sense of calm. I stopped hearing the awful noise. I listened to the Bee Gees, Puccini and Chopin.I listened myself to sleep. I taught myself relaxation techniques. But when the noise becomes unbearable, then I need all my techniques – music, poetry etc – to calm down and ignore the falling bombs, the dripping tap, the loud drums. It’s hard. But I can do it. And I want to tell people who suffer from this terrible condition: accept it. Forget the anger. Don’t ask why. Don’t think you’ve been punished. You haven’t. Just learn to cope with it as best as you can.Maria Ursi AmesburyBristolI have suffered with tinnitus for nearly 10 years, following an incident of uncontrolled loud music in a badly run venue. The resulting damage ended my musical performance and teaching career, and left me in a state of grief that will be with me until the day I die. While it is true to say that habituation does occur in time, it is no substitute for not damaging one’s hearing in the first place. Even though I am as habituated as I can ever expect to be, the tinnitus still dominates my life and activities. It impairs my sleep, and makes socialising difficult and listening to or making music impossible. I urge gig-goers, venues and musicians to take great care, because to wake up one day and realise that irreparable damage has been done to such a precious part of being human is devastating yet avoidable. I also encourage anyone affected to visit theTinnitus UKwebsite.Sue ParishLancasterWhy has there been virtually no progress on “fixing” tinnitus? Lara Williams elucidates the desperation we all go through when acute tinnitus sets in. Her “acceptance” of the sensory handicap as the only path to coping with the condition mirrors my experience. However, that doesn’t always work. Other anxieties can derail our blocking. Then we have to build up the resilience all over again. It can be an exhausting process.Paul WoodinHitchin, HertfordshireTinnitus is exhausting, painful and isolating. At my first self‑help group, a gentle old lady told me she heard it as the angels urging her to carry on. Mine sounded more like a wasp trapped in a tin mug – but perhaps Lara Williams might find the angels version comforting?Ian GarnerOxenhope, West YorkshireI read with empathy Lara Williams’ article describing the onset of tinnitus. Sudden onset in adulthood must be very distressing. In my case it has been lifelong (I’m 76), and I only gradually became aware of it in my youth. She describes hearing something between an electronic hiss and the roar of the ocean; my symptoms are similar. I don’t remember a specific onset, except that in adolescence I once or twice asked if anyone else heard high-pitched sounds from the TV and no one did.I didn’t have access to the kind of professional help Williams consulted, but seemingly came to the same conclusion. It’s there, part of me that isn’t going away; fighting against myself is futile. Letting go of the idea that this is something that shouldn’t be happening works better. Should and shouldn’t have nothing to do with it. It just is. Williams’ analogy to snowfall is beautiful and illuminating. Paying full attention to the moment or engaging fully in activity helps to simply not notice the tinnitus, or at least not as much, depending on the perceived volume at the time. Or maybe, sometimes, it’s just forgetting to hear the tinnitus while listening to the silence.Bryan T DavisCedar Rapids, IowaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As someone who spent time in prison in 2017, and having now worked for a prison charity for four years, I have witnessed first-hand the “permacrisis” she describes.The reviewcontains many revelations as to the state of the system. The worst in my eyes is the testimony of prison staff who said that, rather than “developing relationships with prisoners to help them progress … they were in the office, checking and re-checking release dates”. This perfectly sums up the problem: when capacity pressures force us to treat people as mere numbers to be shuffled around the system, we abandon any pretence of rehabilitation.But the review shows there is hope. The 90% reduction in youth custody over two decades proves that community-based prevention works. The youth justice system’s multi-agency approach, involving health, education, social services and families, has achieved what our adult system cannot: actually reducing offending.Prison reform campaigners are often accused of being “soft on crime”. But there is nothing soft about wanting a system that actually works – one that makes communities safer rather than simply warehousing problems. The current system fails victims, fails offenders, and fails taxpayers. Dame Anne has given us a roadmap out of this crisis. The question is whether our political leaders have the courage to follow it.James StoddartCoordinator, The Oswin ProjectHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Sunbeds and extreme tanning cause skin cancer. My son, aged 23, discovered a mole on his back. It took quite a bit of persuasion for him to go to his GP. Seemed quite simple: cut it out, end of. The mole became more moles, more operations. It then became his arms, then his lungs, and then two brain tumours. Two years from his diagnosis, he died.

That left Rose two off the pace with Tommy Fleetwood, the world No 1 Scottie Scheffler and Spaun ahead of him.But four birdies from the 14th catapulted Rose to the top of the leaderboard and he just missed a 13-foot putt at the last to win outright. He produced two more birdies in three playoff holes, one a clutch effort after Spaun had holed from distance, with the second from 14ft after Spaun was half that distance away proving decisive as his opponent’s attempt to extend the contest raced past.View image in fullscreenJustin Rose pulls off a fine approach from the edge of the water during his playoff against JJ Spaun.Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty Images“That was an amazing last 90 minutes.

I also think form fluctuates so much on the day. You can lose two and one [6-2, 6-1] one day, you can win or you can make it close the next day, and it can be down to a few points. So I’m excited.”Raducanu begins Roig partnership with victory against Danilovic in CincinnatiRead moreIt will be Raducanu’s first ­significant match since ­starting workwith her new coach, Francisco Roig,last week in Cincinnati.Last monthshe played one of her best matchesagainst a top player in making life difficult for Sabalenka at Wimbledon in two tight sets. After serving for the first set and then later holding a set point against the ­Belarusian, Raducanu led 4-1 in the second set before losing 7-6 (6), 6-4.“She played incredible tennis,” Sabalenka said of the British player after her straight-sets win against Marketa Vondrousova on Saturday night. “I’m super happy to see her mentally and physically back, and definitely gonna be back in the top 10 very soon. She challenged me that much, and I like to accept tough ­challenges, so I’m super excited about facing her on the hard courts.”Raducanu gave an honest response when asked if she left Centre Court at Wimbledon determined to have another crack at Sabalenka as soon as possible.“I would say I thought I’d love to have another crack at that on grass, like tomorrow,” she said, ­laughing. “But I know, and I’m honestly reasonable enough, and, I guess, honest enough in myself to know that different surfaces favour different people and where my game is at in comparison. I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage but we’ll see how it goes.”Raducanu has enjoyed a positive run of form in recent months while training and competing consistently on the tour and she could be seeded for the US Open. However, while she has ­performed well in the matches she has been favoured to win, the lessons from most of her previous encounters against the top players have been that her general level has simply not been good enough.In their first few days working together, Raducanu and Roig will at least get a clear ­understanding of exactly where she stands in ­comparison to the very best.On Sunday, Cameron Norrie struggled badly in 33C (91F) heat and humid conditions as he lost 6-4, 6-3 against Roberto Bautista Agut in the second round.After trailing the 37-year-old Spaniard by an early break, Norrie had appeared to be finding his way when he suddenly began to feel sick. Despite fighting hard until the end, he spent the rest of the match clutching his chest and barely able to move on the court: “[In the] 5-4 game I started to feel like I wanted to throw up,” said Norrie. “Maybe it’s the heat, I don’t know. I went to the bathroom and threw everything up after the first set and I was still not feeling good. And I had no energy in the second set.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norrie had hoped to maintain his momentum on the North American hard courts, his favourite surface, but he has instead struggled in each tournament. Norrie’s physicality is usually one of his biggest strengths, which has made these results even more frustrating.“At this point, I don’t know what to say,” said Norrie. “We’re trying everything. We’re using the ice. We’re changing shirts and changing grips all the time. I don’t think it’s that hot, like it’s hot but it’s not crazy. I’m just not sure why my body is not letting me play. It must be mental too, because I’m really good in the heat, and I have such high expectations for myself to do well in the heat. So I guess maybe I need to lower those expectations now.”In his first match since losing in the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner last month, the men’s No 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz held firm in the decisive moments against Damir Dzumhur despite a turbulent performance to reach the third round in Cincinnati with a 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 win.

A late header from his substitute Wout Faes completed a comeback victory but for much of a testing opening game against Henrik Pedersen’s Sheffield Wednesday, who took a first-half lead amid fan protestsagainst the club’s ownership, that looked an unlikely outcome. There will be no illusions over how difficult an immediate return to the Premier League will be for Leicester.“The Championship is a ruthless league,” said Cifuentes,who succeeded Ruud van Nistelrooythis summer. “It was a good lesson for everyone to understand that we cannot take anything for granted.”Leicester v Sheffield Wednesday: Championship – as it happenedRead moreFor Wednesday, it was an achievement to even be here. Placed under a transfer embargo by the Football League because of late payments, they have only 15 senior first-teamers on the books. The players and staff were paid their outstanding July wages on Friday after solidarity payments from the Premier League came in.Pedersen stepped in to be head coach after thedeparture of Danny Röhlat the end of July and the Dane’s tone at full-time here was largely positive. “Very proud feeling from the performance,” he said. “It’s been some tough, tough weeks. To keep the discipline, to keep the motivation … it was a fantastic picture for how you can do this.”The sold-out away section was sparsely populated at kick-off, the vast majority of Wednesday supporters staying outside for the first five minutes in protest against the Thai owner, Dejphon Chansiri, who is yet to receive an offer for the club that matches his valuation. A banner reading “SWFC for sale – enough is enough” was left on the empty seats.When Wednesday’s fans arrived, Nathaniel Chalobah almost gave them something to cheer about straight away, chesting the ball down at a corner and sending a bobbling shot across goal that came off the foot of a post. The away end, so quiet for those first five minutes, erupted midway through the first half when Chalobah met Yan Valery’s cut-back and had a low shot deflected into the roof of the net by Oliver Skipp. Chalobah and his teammates set off towards the far side of the stadium, where the noise – a mixture of joy and defiance, of pent-up frustration being let out – only grew as they approached. The celebrations were a picture.View image in fullscreenSheffield Wednesday fans stayed out of the stand en masse in the first five minutes in protest at their owner, Dejphon Chansiri.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“Our fans are a big, big inspiration for our players,” Pedersen said. “The togetherness with the fans … of course they will go to the fans. They are so thankful for the support they are giving.” The discontent among the home supporters too was evident from the outset. Charged by the Premier League for breaches of profitability and sustainability rules in the 2023-24 campaign, Leicester are still waiting to find outif they will be handeda points deduction this season. Important members of the first team, including the goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, have been sold to raise funds.But will there be more outgoings at a club that are yet to spend any money in the transfer market? “If I could predict the future, trust me, I would be much richer than what I am,” Cifuentes said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen. It’s clear it’s a work in progress.”In terms of quality on the ball, Leicester were a cut above. Bilal El Khannouss, who impressed in the Premier League last season and who could still leave before the window shuts, was a constant threat. The introduction of Harry Winks at the break added control in midfield, where Wednesday were struggling to cope after Chalobah was withdrawn injured.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The momentum was then on Leicester’s side, Stephy Mavididi almost giving them the lead when, after evading a couple of defenders, his shot was blocked at close quarters by Charles.Wednesday’s task became even tougher when their 35-year-old captain, Barry Bannan, who has just signed a new contract after training with the team after his previous one expired in June, received a second yellow card for a rash follow‑through on Winks.An inspired Charles then kept out Patson Daka’s header but, in the end, the visitors could hold out no longer. El Khannouss’s corner was butted in by Faes to complete a turnaround that denied Wednesday a draw after their supporters had made their own point in the first five minutes.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipLeicester CitySheffield Wednesdaymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Could they defy the growing expectation that, these days, promoted teams will be restricted to one-season top-tier stays? Daniel Farke is certainly behaving like a man on a mission to avoid immediate relegation and seven summer signings have added much-needed height and aggression to last term’s technical but slightly diminutive squad. Yet while the arrivals of Lucas Perri, Jaka Bijol, Sebastiaan Bornouw, Gabriel Gudmundsson, Sean Longstaff and Anton Stach have fortified the goalkeeping, defensive and midfield departments, Lukas Nmecha remains the sole attacking signing. Given Patrick Bamford has been told he will be sold and Mateo Joseph and Joe Gelhardt have left on season-long loans Leeds are racing against time to rebuild the front end of the team.“We are not naive,” Farke said after the 1-1 friendly against Villarreal. “We know that in the offence we are not ready for Premier League level. We know that even in comparison to our Championship offence you could say that we are not much improved.“I can’t guarantee that for the first game everything will be ready and we are fully equipped but we definitely have to make sure that, latest, after the first international break in September, we have a really competitive squad for the Premier League. We’re not anxious but we are fully aware we need to do something.”In the interim, Joël Piroe, last season’s Championship golden boot winner, has a chance to show he is a top-tier striker.If the imports look sound – and the Slovenia centre-half Bijol, a £15m buy from Udinese, seems a particularly shrewd purchase – an awful lot hinges on how swiftly they adapt. Leeds fans must hope the team’s framework is sufficiently robust to showcase the talents of last season’s stars, most notably the Wales winger Dan James and the Japan midfielder Ao Tanaka.Chart of Leeds’ finishing positionsThe managerToo many managerial media addresses are anodyne, but the amiable Farke, almost always interesting and evidently emotionally intelligent, is a welcome exception to the rule. The one-time economics student with the look of a former heavy metal star has achieved three promotions to the Premier League, the first two with financially challenged Norwich sides. The 48-year-old German remained dignified in the face of intense speculationregarding his Elland Road future last May. The Leeds chair, Paraag Marathe, ended it by declaring“he’s my man,but the task is undeniably formidable. As Farke says: “In the past 21 years, Leeds have spent three seasons in the Premier League but that’s where this club belongs. My job is to keep us here.”Off-field pictureRunning Leeds has always been challenging, but the San Francisco-based 49er Enterprises is faced with the tricky task of staying on the right side of profitability and sustainability rules while remaining competitive on the pitch. This balancing act is only complicated by the reality that promotion has coincided with a major redevelopment project intended to expand Elland Road’s capacity to 53,000. With a formal planning application now submitted to the city council, building work could start before Christmas. While Robbie Evans, an analytics expert, is the club’s new managing director and replaces the former CEO Angus Kinnear, who is now at Everton, the long-serving Adam Underwood has been promoted to sporting director.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only the excellence of Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães and Joelinton kept the cricket-loving Tynesider out of Eddie Howe’s first XI, but he is too good not to be playing regularly. With 171 Premier League appearances behind him, Longstaff brings invaluable experience and is an excellent character off the field, always ready to support and encourage teammates. Games are often won and lost in midfield and with Longstaff, Stach, Ethan Ampadu, Tanaka and Illia Gruev competing for places, the engine room appears well staffed.View image in fullscreenSean Longstaff will bring much-needed Premier League experience to their midfield.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesStepping upHarry Gray, the grandson of Frank Gray and great nephew of Eddie from the Leeds sides of the 1970s, and the younger brother of Tottenham’s Archie Gray, is a poised, two-footed striker, equally adept as a No 9 or a No 10. The England Under-17 international has made one first-team appearance last season and does not turn 17 until October, but his cool, incisive finishing, precocious technique and advanced ability to read the game dictates he is the subject of considerable excitement at the club. Leeds are anxious not to rush Gray’s development, but Premier League defenders are unlikely to relish being introduced to his precocious skill set.A big season for …“I probably have something to prove in the Premier League,” said Wilfried Gnonto this summer. It is important to remember that his exquisite dribbling skills and extraordinary change of pace belong to a winger who does not turn 22 until November. Gnonto has 13 Italy caps, but his challenge is to establish hitherto elusive consistency and nail down a regular place in the starting XI. Few top-tier defenders will welcome the experience of him running at themand the time has come for Gnonto to eliminate erraticism from his game.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Leeds UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The champions eased to victory atAberdeenthanks to goals in each half from the midfielders Benjamin Nygren and Reo Hatate, but Idah struggled to make an impact in the centre-forward position.The 24-year-old was expected to kick on after Kyogo Furuhashi left in January, but Daizen Maeda took on the mantle of Celtic’s main goalscorer after moving inside from a wide position, although the Irishman still finished on 20 goals.Given Celtic have since lost Jota to a long-term injury and sold Nicolas Kühn, Maeda has been needed out wide, while Idah has been handed a chance to seize the No 9 role.Scottish roundup: Martin warns Rangers fans there is ‘no quick fix’ after Dundee drawRead more“There’s no doubt that we need to reinforce the top line,” Rodgers said.“I’m really pleased with where we are structurally in defensive numbers. We’ve got a squad from our back line to midfield that can cope domestically and cope in the European competition. So I’m really pleased with that aspect. But I think we need competition at the top end of the field.“For Adam, he’s a big, honest boy. He was at his best here when was really challenging with Kyogo for the position and that’s something that is important for us to get. But in the meantime, he will work hard and he’ll always be that reference for us.”Asked if Idah needed a goal, Rodgers said: “Listen, you’re a striker at Celtic, you have to be strong mentally, you’ve got to score goals, of course. But I’ve a lot of faith in him. He really needs that real competition beside him. And I think that’s when you then get the most out of him.“He didn’t quite score, but he worked very hard and he’s given his all and it will get better as the season goes on.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Nygren opens the scoring for Celtic against Aberdeen.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PACeltic’s three goals this season have all come from midfielders, with Luke McCowan’s late winner against St Mirren followed by Nygren getting off the mark for the club.The 24-year-old netted 15 goals for Nordsjaelland in the Danish top flight last season as well as scoring twice in his first four internationals for Sweden.Rodgers said: “He’s a player that can play as an eight, a 10, he can also play off the side. But his intuition is to get in the box and score goals and that’s why we’ve brought him in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To come and play with that authority and personality in the game, that was pleasing.”Aberdeen made a bright start, but Celtic took full control before Nygren’s 27th-minute opener.The Dons manager, Jimmy Thelin, said: “The way we defended in the first half and how we created the transitions was okay.“The problem we have right now is the last pass and last decision when we arrive in an attacking position. And we are not arriving there enough to really hurt them.”Thelin would not comment on reports that Aberdeen are closing in on a deal to sign the 21-year-old Milan striker Marko Lazetic on a free transfer. But he added: “Everybody’s working really hard to find the right player and bring him to Aberdeen so let’s see what’s going to happen.”Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipAberdeenCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

All but 10 were under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act for displaying supportive placards or signs.An age breakdown released by the Metropolitan police on Sunday revealed that nearly 100 of those detained were in their 70s and 15 were in their 80s. Of the 519 arrested people with confirmed dates of birth, 49.9% were 60 or older.Hundreds attended the event in Parliament Square organised by Defend Our Juries, which asked participants to hold up signs saying: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”Among those arrested was Sir Jonathon Porritt, 75, a former government adviser who said he had long been concerned about the erosion of civil liberties under successive governments. He was arrested under Section 13and bailed until 23 OctoberHe described the proscription of Palestine Action as “a measure of the government’s desperation” and “entirely inappropriate”.“I thought this was overreach by the home secretary, trying to eliminate the voices of those who are deeply concerned about what is happening in Gaza,” he said.“This was an absolutely clear case of a government using its powers to crush dissenting voices when it is the government itself that is most reprehensible for what continues to be an absolute horror story in the world.“What we are seeing now in Gaza has just utterly shocked people and it’s completely abhorrent that we are living through a genocide on our TV screens.”Porritt said he had no complaints about how he had been treated, describing officers as courteous. Some, however, said older people who had been arrested were denied access to water and were kept waiting for long periods in the sun to be processed.In a statement on X posted on Sunday evening, Defend Our Juries said everyone arrested at the march had been released from police custody and no one had been charged.The Met said it had taken precautions before Saturday’s operation on the basis of its duty of care and because of the age of those who had been arrested at previous protests. It also said the decision to turn out was a question of “personal responsibility”.“There was water available at the prisoner processing points and access to toilets. We had police medics on hand as part of the policing operation and we processed people as quickly as possible to ensure nobody was waiting an unreasonably long time,” the force said.“Notwithstanding that, a degree of personal responsibility is required on the part of those who chose to come and break the law. They knew they were very likely to be arrested which is a decision that will inevitably have consequences.”Others arrested include Chris Romberg, 75, a former British army officer colonel and military attache at UK embassies in Egypt and Jordan, and the son of a Holocaust survivor. Like Porritt, he was arrested under Section 13 and bailed.He said: “This is a serious assault on our freedoms.“When I protested against the US war in Vietnam, we were able to chant ‘victory to the NLF’ without being criminalised. Now a statement of support for a non-violent direct action group is prosecuted under anti-terrorism legislation.”He had no complaints about police treatment.Alice Oswald, 58, an award-winning poet, said she had urged police who detained her to write to the home secretary about the position they had been put in.“Clearly there were some police officers who were really struggling with what they had to do,” she said. “You could see the slightly shifty look in their faces, too. When I was speaking to them in the police van I did say: ‘Write to Yvette Cooper and tell her that this is making your life impossible.’”Oswald, who won the TS Eliot prize in 2002 and was professor of poetry at the University of Oxford, said her motivation for taking part included the very personal experience of giving online poetry classes regularly to young people and children in Gaza.She said she had been arrested under Section 12 of the Terrorism Act, which relates to inviting support for a proscribed organisation.Met police arrests in Parliament Square by age range graphicOf the 532 arrests, six people were detained for allegedly assaulting police officers after large numbers protesters gathered in central London for a separate march organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and others.One arrest was for obstructing a constable in the execution of his or her duty, two were for breaching Section 14 Public Order Act conditions, and one for a racially aggravated public order offence. Eighteen people were still in custody by 1pm on Sunday but were expected to be released hours later.In the age breakdown of arrests, the Met said the dates of birth of 13 people awaited clarification and were not included.On that basis, the average age of those arrested was 54. Males accounted for 263 of those detained, females 261 and eight either defined themselves as non-binary or did not disclose their gender.Ten people have been charged across the UK for suspected offences under the Terrorism Act since the proscription of Palestine Action, authorities said last week.The home secretaryproscribed Palestine Action last monthafter activists caused an estimated £7m of damage to jets at the RAF Brize Norton military base in Oxfordshire.Cooper has said the decision was based on strong security advice and followed what she described as “disturbing information referencing planning for further attacks,” the details of which cannot yet be publicly reported because of ongoing legal proceedings.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

All options remain on the table; whether that be starting a new charity or working to support pre-existing charities operating in the same sector in the region.”Earlier this week, a source said the row had been “emotionally absolutely devastating” for the prince, and described Chandauka’s comments as “nothing short of a hostile takeover”.The Charity Commission, which cannot investigate individual allegations of bullying, said it found no evidence of systemic bullying or harassment at the charity, including misogyny or misogynoir, but acknowledged “the strong perception of ill treatment” felt by some involved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This would include individual allegations of bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir etc.“As a result, the commission has not investigated any individual allegations and therefore has not made any findings in relation to individuals, including Prince Harry.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryCharitiesVoluntary sectorLesothoBotswanaAfricaAids and HIVnewsShareReuse this content"

He could not comment on the man’s background ahead of further investigations, he said.In January, a 40-year-old Hungarian man survived clinging to a German high-speed train for 32km, likewise after it set off before he had finished a cigarette.Explore more on these topicsAustriaRail transportEuropeSmokingnewsShareReuse this content"

What beautiful wildlife spectacle awaits?Weaving across carpets of bird’s foot trefoil, we reach our destination: a vast, barren circle of asphalt, 70 metres across – the ruins of an uncompleted oil refinery.“You’ll find rare bees and reptiles around the edge and you’ve got these lovely stonecrops and lichens,” enthuses Outten, a naturalist and RSPB’s site manager for Canvey Wick nature reserve. The derelict asphalt pad is buzzing with rare nature.View image in fullscreenOutten on an asphalt pad, many of which have been left by the abandoned oil project.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThis “ruined” landscape – where disused street lamps poke up above rampant scrub – resembles some kind of post-apocalyptic London. But in its ruination, this brownfield site beside the Thames inEssexhas become one of the most nature-rich places in Britain, home to 3,200 species including endangered shrill carder bees, pantaloon bees, water vole, cuckoos and long-eared owls.Canvey Wick is celebrating its 20th anniversary as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) as conservationists warn many similarly wildlife-rich brownfield sites are threatened by development, particularly in the Thames Gateway.Tilbury ash fields, home to 185 invertebrate species of conservation concern including thegreat sneak-spider, isimperilled by plans to expand the port of Tilbury. Meanwhile, a Google datacentre is proposed on a local wildlife site close to Lakeside that is home to nightingales, rare plants and scarce invertebrates such as the brown-banded carder bee.View image in fullscreenThe site has attracted rare bees and wildflowers.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianCanvey Wick shows what can happen when a brownfield site is protected. Since it was bought bythe Land Trustand managed by the RSPB in partnership with Buglife, an astonishing range of rare species have made their home on its 93 hectares (230 acres): 11.7% of its 3,200 species are classified as rare, scarce, threatened or near threatened.Eight years ago, there were nonightingaleson Canvey Wick. Today there are 21 nightingale territories in the thickets of blackthorn, hawthorn and bramble – a vital new stronghold for the much-loved but endangered songbird.Air pollution filters help scientists produce first UK wildlife survey using eDNARead more“People assume that brownfield sites are very low value for biodiversity – until they see what a brownfield site can really do,” said Outten, on a tour of the site during which we find pantaloon bees, spectacular Jersey tiger moths and increasingly rare wall brown butterflies. “If brownfield sites are left to sit around for a while, they develop into really rich habitats. This would’ve been a very desolate space full of sand, concrete and tarmac and now we’ve got this wonderful nature reserve. There’s so much structural diversity and the more structural diversity you have, the more biodiversity you have – that’s what makes this place so special.”Canvey Wick was green grazing marshes until humans ruined them – and inadvertently made one of the most nature-rich places in Britain.View image in fullscreenA Jersey tiger moth in among the shrubbery.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAn oil refinery was planned for Canvey Wick in the early 1970s. The ground was raised with dredging from the Thames: sands, shingle and even seashells. Concrete roads and street lamps were built. Thirty two and a half circular asphalt pads were constructed as bases for vast oil storage containers. And then the 1973 oil price shock halted work. The refinery was abandoned.Over the next 50 years, nature raced in. The unusual diversity of soil types and hot microclimates attracted an unusual range of invertebrates: there are 250 species of bee, wasp and ant on the site, including the brown-banded carder bee, five-banded weevil-wasp and carrot mining bee. They feed on an unconventional mix of native and non-native flowers including bristly oxtongue and everlasting pea.As the human ruins subside beneath greenery, conservationists must manage the rapidly changing site to balance the competing needs of different rare species. What’s great for nightingales – more scrub – will cause many heat-loving invertebrates to disappear. When the site was first designated an SSSI in 2005, there was just 15% scrub and tree cover.

A lot of this is cutting-edge stuff. ‘Restoring’ brownfield is not something many organisations have got into.”A three-year project at Canvey has cut back some scrub, and created new scrapes of bare sand required by rare invertebrates and species such as adders. The cut-and-scraped areas are now burgeoning with wildflowers and insects again, while cleared ditches are home to scarce emerald damselflies andblue-eyed hawkerdragonflies.Conservationists hope it will inspire the creation of more brownfield nature reserves. “Canvey Wick demonstrates how brownfield sites can be transformed into vibrant green spaces that serve the community and provide important habitats for wildlife,” says Alan Carter, the chief executive of the Land Trust. “We are extremely proud of the regeneration efforts carried out since taking on the ownership of the site in 2012. The site is now one of the top locations in Britain for endangered invertebrates, an impressive achievement.”View image in fullscreenSome of the vibrant plants that have been able to grow on the brownfield site.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAlthough important parts of Swanscombe peninsula weresaved from development threatswhen Natural England designated it an SSSI in 2021, Buglife is calling on the government’s wildlife watchdog to urgently give more sites the same protection, including Tilbury ash fields. Natural England has “Thames estuary invertebrates” in Essex and Kentlisted in its SSSI designation “pipeline”but the watchdog has been criticised forfailing to designate many endangered placesin recent years.Carl Bunnage, head of nature policy at RSPB, said: “Brownfield sites are not always just dead, ugly and abandoned spaces. Indeed, as Canvey Wick shows, they can provide specialist habitats and be havens for nature – full of life of all kinds. With the government currently driving reforms to the planning system inEngland, and prioritising the re-development of brownfield sites, it is vital that the nature-value of sites is properly assessed before planning decisions are taken.”View image in fullscreenOutten and Barkham take a closer look at a body of water on the site, which is near the Thames estuary.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianConservationists hope Canvey Wick can also inspire smaller ways of attracting rare wildlife: depositing piles of sand or crushed concrete on a place may not look conventionally pretty but it will create soils and microclimates where myriad wildflowers and invertebrates can thrive.Outten, who was raised in the area, hopes Canvey will inspire the creation of other similar nature reserves so there is a network for rare species, which can be enjoyed by the local community as well.“People feel passionately about it. We want to strike the balance between giving people a place where they can access green space but also protect the species that the site is important for. It’s a unique place. There’s nowhere else like it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsConservationRSPBBiodiversityNatural EnglandWildlifeEssexEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For many Americans who live where fireflies do, their flashing lights at dusk are a tangible rite of summer – though one that may now be under threat.While Vogel did not notice their absence out west, once “you’re back on the east coast and you see them, you’re like, that’s so crazy”, Vogel said. “It’s like a shooting star that just is surprising and gives you the childlike wonder of how you felt when you first saw fireflies in your yard.”Monarch butterflies’ mass die-off in 2024 caused by pesticide exposure – studyRead moreEven in areas of the US where there are typically fireflies, people are especially excited to see them this year because there appear to be more this summer after asteady declinein recent years, according to scientists.Despite that welcome news, researchers caution that it does not necessarily signal a reversal of the downward trend. They remain concerned about the long-term viability of the firefly family, which includes more than 2,000 species, some of which are at risk of extinction due to factors such as light pollution and climate change.“It’s been really uplifting to hear all of the reports of huge increases in fireflies,” said Candace Fallon, senior endangered species conservation biologist for the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. “But they are also insects, and insects are notorious for having populations that bounce up and down each year, and so it’s hard to say that their populations are increasing from a single year of data.”Fireflies, also known as lightning bugs, are beetles that come out at night during summer and produce a bioluminescent gleam, primarily to attract a mate.Cultures around the world treasure the bugs, including in Japan, where theyare symbolsoflove and fallen soldiers.Sinceancienttimes, people have also collected them, venturing out with receptacles on hot, sticky nights. In addition to providing a source of entertainment, people have also collected them forscientificpurposes andprofit.“Catching fireflies is a relatively harmless thing that you can do that really connects you to your natural world,” said Matt Schlesinger, chief zoologist with the New York Natural Heritage Program, which is participating in aproject to identifywhich firefly species occur in state parks.Scientists in the US andCanadado not have baseline data on firefly species, which makes it difficult to quantify how much the population has decreased, and they must instead rely on anecdotal reports and documented habitat loss, which point to a downward trajectory, Fallon said.She and other researchersconducted a studypublished in the journal PLOS One which found that 18 species in North America are threatened with extinction. But the scientists also did not have enough data on more than half of the assessed species to determine their extinction risks, which means that more of the beetles could be in danger, Fallon said.The primary factor behind fireflies’ decline is habitat loss and degradation, according to theXerces Society. That includes land being disrupted by development, light pollution and pesticide use.Artificial lighting at night makes it hard for the bugs to communicate and mate, Fallon said.Climate change, including an increase in droughts and rising sea levels, also affect firefly populations, she said.Still, there are some firefly species that appear to be doing “just fine”, Schlesinger said.The kinds that specialize in particular habitats, like the big dipper firefly often found in suburban back yards, are the ones struggling, Schlesinger said.Scientists say the lightning bugs’ apparent revival is probably due toincreased rainfallthis year.“If they can still have a big year, at least those species are probably doing fine and have the potential to recover,” Schlesinger said. That said, “any single year doesn’t tell you about the long-term trajectory of firefly populations, just like any particular year that is colder doesn’t mean that global warming isn’t happening.”Riley Witzl, five, was still able to find some in a St Louis suburb.“It was fun,” said Riley, who is entering kindergarten. “I liked chasing them and holding them.”Kids should continue the tradition of venturing out with jars in the summer but should then release the bugs rather than collecting them, Schlesinger said.Other ways to help fireflies survive include: not using pesticides, reducing artificial lighting at night, and allowing the grass to grow long and theleaves to pile upin your yard.“A lot of fireflies pupate in leaves, and so when we rake those and put them in bags, we’re destroying their habitat at a very small scale,” Schlesinger said.Despite the concerns about extinction, Fallon is encouraged bymaster gardenersin Arkansas who created a firefly sanctuary, and by lawmakers in Maryland whoapproved legislationearlier this year which introduces new regulations on what type of lighting can be bought with state funds.She thinks people are more aware of and concerned about the firefly population decline.“Charisma is a big part of it; people connect with fireflies,” Fallon said, of why people care about their survival. “I think we have enough time to make a difference. Even small pockets of habitat can be really crucial for these species. But I think we definitely need to assess our priorities and decide: are we going to take action?”Explore more on these topicsInsectsAnimalsClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He adored me and was devoted to me.”Little is known about B other than her age and the fact she is a medical professional working in Europe. She claims Mercury entrusted her with 17 journals that cover the final years of his life, which Jones says are “the closest thing to a Freddie Mercury autobiography that the world will ever know”.The claims, whichfirst emerged in Mayand were apparently common knowledge among Mercury’s inner circle, have been met with mounting pushback from some people who knew the singer best.When asked about B, the Queen guitarist Brian May said he wanted to remain “neutral”. However, his wife, the former EastEnders star Anita Dobson,dismissed the claimsas “fake news”. Mary Austin, a close friend of the singer, also doubted whether Mercury would have kept the fact he had a daughter secret from his inner circle.“Freddie had a glorious openness, and I cannot imagine he would have wanted to, or been able to, keep such a joyful event a secret, either from me or other people closest to him,” Austintold the Sunday Times.Austin inherited about half of an estimated £9m estate that Mercury left after the singer, who was diagnosed with Aids in 1987, diedaged 45of bronchial pneumonia in 1991.Mercury had relationships with men and women (including Austin) and described himself as bisexual.“The truth is that I am simply not the guardian of such a secret,” said Austin. “I’ve never known of any child, or of any diaries. If Freddie had indeed had a child without me knowing anything about it, that would be astonishing to me.”The woman referred to as B responded by saying she was “devastated” by Austin’s comments.Bob Geldof told Freddie Mercury ‘don’t get clever’ before 1985 Live Aid setRead moreJones – whose book Love, Freddie will be published next month – defended the validity of the claimswhen they first emerged, saying that a DNA test had been conducted that supported the version of events presented in her Mercury biography.She also pointed to the lack of a vocal rejection of the claims by the remaining members of Queen as further evidence that the details in her book were true.“What I would say is that the real inner circle – the other members of Queen and Freddie’s sister – would have denied this if they could, weeks ago, when the story broke,” Jones said. “They cannot because, as Freddie’s daughter says, they know that it is true.”Jones, who has written a series of books about music’s biggest names, has been talking up more revelations that appear in Love, Freddie – claiming she has been “crafting a narrative that will overturn everything we thought we knew about him and his legacy”.Explore more on these topicsFreddie MercuryQueennewsShareReuse this content"

Their goal is said to have been gathering information on the agency’s activities, identifying its sources and gaining “leverage”.Revealed: spies for hire used ‘Big Brother’ tactics on salmon farm activistsRead moreBacked with billions from Vladimir Putin’s regime, the oligarchs were at the time waging an aggressive counterattack against anSFO investigationinto suspected corruption and fraud, a major case the agency ultimately dropped.Andy Slaughter, a Labour MP who chairs parliament’s justice committee, said: “It is deeply troubling that individuals with knowledge of serious fraud inquiries should be surveilled by the very organisations they have been investigating.” He added: “The hunter has become the hunted.”The surveillance began in 2019. It is unclear when, or if, it finished. As the law enforcement agency that takes on the toughest white-collar crime cases against multinational corporations and billionaires, the SFO often faces fightbacks by well-funded law firms and even cyber-attacks. But this is believed to be the first time surveillance of former SFO prosecutors has been revealed.Lawyers for the oligarchs’ mining company did not dispute that the surveillance took place. But they said any “investigations” into the targets were lawful, undertaken in preparation for lawsuits it brought against the SFO.‘We’re not fair game’On Saturday 7 March 2020, the spies pulled up in a car outside the home of former senior SFO prosecutor Tom Martin. At 10.39am, the target emerged from his front door wearing jeans and a Wolverhampton Wanderers hoodie. It was a momentous day: Martin was taking his young son to the football for the first time.View image in fullscreenTom Martin, a former senior prosecutor at the Serious Fraud Office, in a surveillance picture taken in 2020.Martin had run complex, transnational bribery investigations at the SFO. Although he never worked on the oligarchs’ case, he felt he would have been an attractive target for anyone seeking intelligence on the agency.Known to his colleagues as a charismatic leader, Martin had brought anemployment tribunal claimover his 2018 dismissal during a power struggle with American prosecutors – a claim he would win. It was apparent from press coverage that he knew the SFO’s inner workings and had fallen out badly with its management.Over years of pursuing powerful suspects, Martin had sometimes thought he was being watched. But none of his fears were confirmed. He said he was “absolutely appalled” when the Guardian showed him surveillance images of his home taken by oligarchs’ spies. “I’m there with my lad,” he said. “We’re not fair game.”View image in fullscreenMartin called the surveillance ‘an attack on the rule of law’.Photograph: SuppliedMartin said that if operatives were seeking “kompromat”, the Russian term for compromising material that can be used to apply pressure, there was nothing to find, except perhaps his passion for model trains.“It’s an attack on the rule of law,” he said. “You’re not trying to defend yourself in a court, you’re trying to shift the odds in your favour.”‘The most upright lawyer you could ever meet’The surveillance stretched across the country.In a rural village, the oligarchs’ operatives spied on Mike Walsh, a former Metropolitan police officer. After leaving the force in the late 1990s, Walsh switched to the private intelligence industry. One client had been in a fight with the oligarchs’ corporation over some African mines. In May 2019, the spies traced Walsh, who was by then retired, to his home and photographed him as he put the bins out.View image in fullscreenA surveillance image of the former Met police officer Mike Walsh.Other targets had held senior positions in UK law enforcement much more recently, as members of the very SFO team investigating the oligarchs’ affairs.James Coussey was awarded an OBE in 2010 after decades trying to convict the perpetrators of financial crimes. Three years later, he was recruited to the SFO for one last assignment:investigating suspected fraud and bribery at a mining company that had been among the most valuable listed on the London Stock Exchange.Three oligarchs, known as the Trio, were the founders and largest shareholders of the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC). It owned mines from Kazakhstan to Congo extracting coal, chrome and cobalt. Every few days it made revenues bigger than the SFO’s annual budget.The team Coussey joined followed money trails between Swiss banks, African kleptocracies, ex-Soviet dictatorships and the Mayfair property market. In 2018, after five years on the case, Coussey called an end to his career. “I don’t think he really wanted to retire,” said Martin, his SFO colleague and fellow surveillance target. “He loved his job and he did it in a really calm and classy way.”By then, the ENRC case had become one of thehighest-stakes investigationsin the SFO’s history. It seemed that criminal charges were close. The SFO’s prosecutors had interviewed one of the oligarchs, plus the son-in-law of another.View image in fullscreenJames Coussey in a surveillance image with a time-stamp after his retirement from the SFO.The oligarchs and their company denied wrongdoing. ENRC’s lawyers were on the counterattack. As part of a high court claim against the SFO, they alleged that Coussey had negligently mishandled evidence. A judge would find no “knowing or reckless breach of duty”. But the legal action had revealed Coussey’s identity as a member of the investigation team and put him on the oligarchs’ radar.In retirement, Coussey fell into ill-health. The spies’ surveillance images of him are time-stamped: a Monday morning in February 2020. They show an elderly man outside his home, bald and bespectacled in a jersey and bodywarmer, pottering between the garage and a blue hatchback.Coussey has since died. Martin called him one of the prosecutors of his generation. He was “the most upright lawyer you could ever meet”, albeit with a fondness for rude jokes. “He’s given his country immense service.”‘All about leverage’Entrusted with powers to seize evidence, SFO prosecutors undergo security vetting. During his years at the agency, Martin was aware of “near constant” cyber-attacks.So sensitive was the oligarchs’ case that Coussey and the rest of the investigating team worked from a restricted area of the SFO’s headquarters off Trafalgar Square.Sons of the Soviet Union’s central Asian provinces, the Trio’s path to riches began when two of them worked at a KGB business venture in Moscow during the fall of communism. They have used an assortment of private intelligence companies since arriving in London in the mid-2000s.There were the former agents of Mossad and other Israeli intelligence and military services who set up Black Cube and Diligence, run by alumni of MI5 and UK special forces. These operativestargeted Neil Gerrard, a former ENRC lawyer who, a judge would later find, leaked to the SFO as he milked the oligarchs for fees. Both firms say they played no part in the surveillance of former SFO prosecutors.That surveillance began in 2019, directed by Dmitry Vozianov, a Russian consultant who handles “special situations” for oligarchs. Vozianov fends off threats to his clients’ business interests, overseeing lawyers, spies and public relations experts. Faced with an SFO investigation, the Trio hired him.For this covert surveillance operation, Vozianov deployed a decorated veteran of the parachute regiment.Damian Ozenbrookserved in Afghanistan, Northern Ireland and the Balkans. After leaving the military, he set up his private intelligence company , Blue Square Global.Do you have information about this story?

For the most secure communications see theguardian.com/tipsThe goals of the surveillance Vozianov assigned to Ozenbrook were “to know what was going on in the SFO”, said a source with knowledge of the operation, and to find out “what, if any, informants the SFO were using”. The source believes it was “all about leverage”.Vozianov did not respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for Ozenbrook’s firm did not dispute that his operatives spied on former SFO prosecutors on Vozianov’s instructions – though they said there had been no surveillance of serving SFO personnel.How oligarchs took on the UK fraud squad – and wonRead moreThe oligarchs’ operatives also watched John Gibson, a barrister who had run the SFO’s ENRC investigation for four years. Gibson left the SFO for a law firm in 2018. A letter he received two years later from ENRC’s lawyers at the US firm Quinn Emanuel stated that he had been seen meeting a journalist in the National Theatre’s underground car park in September 2020.An SFO spokesperson said: “We have been aware of the risk of surveillance for many years and our first priority is always the safety and wellbeing of our colleagues. We note that this report relates to surveillance of former colleagues following their departure from the SFO.”In 2023, after a high court judge found the SFO had been wrong to accept leaked material from ENRC’s lawyer at the outset of its investigation, the agency dropped the case. There was, it said, “insufficient admissible evidence” to bring charges.Two of the oligarchs have died during the long struggle with UK law enforcement, their stakes passing to their heirs. The Russian state banks that backed them are now under sanctions. Nonetheless,their corporation is due to receive millions from the public purse as damages.While surveillance by state agencies is highly regulated – the SFO would have needed a warrant to conduct an operation like the oligarchs’ – surveillance by private firms is not. Slaughter, the MP, said: “Everything about this rings alarm bells, from the Russia links to the involvement of ex-security force operatives.” He said it raised “wider issues for the government as to how it regulates private investigators”.Explore more on these topicsSurveillanceSerious Fraud OfficeEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

It found that people were intimidated when their examiner did not make any pleasantries.The research was based on interviews with learner drivers, people who had recently passed their test, instructors and examiners.Among the interviewees, one successful candidate said their examiner had been “very down to business” with “no pleasantries”, which made them “feel just a little bit more intimidated”.But an instructor said a “really chatty examiner” could end up “distracting the student”. Another instructor said having a conversation with a candidate could “slightly distract” the learner when they wanted to be “100% concentrating”.In the report’s recommendations about how to reduce “potential inequalities around gender”, it noted that examiners’ communication approaches could be interpreted in various ways by different candidates.It said: “Examiners could ask candidates at the beginning of the test what kind of communication (‘formal’, ‘chatty’) would put them in the best frame of mind for driving to the best of their ability.“Such a change would enable examiners to remain focused on ability and outcomes but do so in such a way that does not introduce potential anxiety that is unrelated to driving competence in candidates.”Emma Bush, the managing director of AA Driving School, told the PA Media agency: “It is probably asking a lot of examiners to act ‘formal’ or ‘chatty’ on demand. Candidates probably don’t want a sergeant major nor a comedian examining them.“What all candidates want is a reassuring voice and presence, combined with a fair and professional approach to the test.”The study found no evidence that the gender of examiners had a direct impact on the candidates’ test experience.It noted that female candidates were more likely than their male counterparts to pass the driving theory test, which it attributed to women generally doing more preparation.A spokesperson for the DVSA said it was “committed to equality, diversity and inclusion” and wanted all candidates to “receive the highest level of customer experience”.They added: “This is an important piece of research by TRL and we’re now reviewing the considerations put forward to reduce inequality in driver testing in Great Britain, and help us further develop the guidance available to learner drivers as they prepare for their tests.”The average waiting time for a driving test in Great Britain as of the end of June was 22.3 weeks.Explore more on these topicsRoad transportMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

Directed by Ron Howard and earning Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, the film depicted the failed lunar mission that nearly cost Lovell and his crew their lives in 1970.Apollo 13 was intended to beNasa’s third crewed moon landing. But during the US space agency’s mission, manned by Lovell and fellow astronauts John Swigert and Fred Haise, an oxygen tank in the service module exploded roughly 200,000 miles (322,000km) from Earth.Lovell famously informed mission control, “Houston, we’ve had a problem.” Hanks later immortalized the line in the film, which slightly altered the phrase to, “Houston, we have a problem.”With their power and life-support systems crippled, the crew was forced to abandon their lunar landing and use several engine burns to slingshot around the far side of the moon, setting a course back to Earth. About three days after the explosion, they splashed down safely in the South Pacific, concluding what became known as the Apollo program’s “successful failure”.“His many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive,” Hanks wrote on Friday of Lovell. “And who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages.”“On this night of a full Moon, he passes on – to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell,” reads the end of the tribute.Lovell died on Thursday at age 97 in Lake Forest, Illinois,Nasasaid. The cause of death was not immediately released.He made a brief cameo in Apollo 13 as the captain of the USS Iwo Jima, the Navy ship that recovered the crew after splashdown. The film was nominated for a total of nine Oscars, including best picture.Hanks starred in Apollo 13 alongside actors Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan and the late Bill Paxton.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTom HanksNasaSpaceRon HowardnewsShareReuse this content"

It said vaccine misinformation had put scientists at risk.The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, added that the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHH) – headed by Trump administration appointee and avowed vaccine safety skepticRobert F Kennedy Jr– must provide a “clear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation”.Such a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release.“Their leadership is critical in reinforcing public trust and ensuring that accurate, science-based information prevails,” the union said.Patrick Joseph White was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, when he attacked, said an official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.White’s gunfire hit at least four CDC buildings, agency director Susan Monarez said on X.DeKalb county police officer David Rose was mortally wounded while responding. Rose, 33, a former US marine who served in Afghanistan, had graduated from the police academy in March.White was found on the second floor of a building across the street from the CDC campus and died at the scene,Atlantapolice chief Darin Schierbaum said. He added that “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted”.The Georgia bureau of investigations said the crime scene was “complex”. The agency added that the investigation into the violence would take “an extended period of time”.Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off CDC employees, has said Kennedy Jr is directly responsible for the villainization of the CDC’s workforce through “his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust”.Kennedy Jr reached out to staff Saturday. The DHH secretary said “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others”.Dr Jerome Adams, who served as the US surgeon general during Donald Trump’s first presidency, said Kennedy’s response to Friday’s shooting was “tepid”, late and amounted to a “failed … test” of his leadership.“That’s not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has actually contributed to a lot of what’s been going on,” Adams said on Sunday on CBS’s Face the Nation.Adams said the mRNA-based vaccine technology that helped end the Covid-19 pandemic saved more than 2 million lives “by the most conservative estimates”. His comments came days after Kennedy moved tocancel $500m in mRNA vaccine research.Thousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the attacked campus. The union said some staff were huddled in various buildings until late at night. More than 90 young children were locked down inside the CDC’s Clifton school.The union said CDC staff should not be required to immediately return to work after experiencing such a traumatic event. In its statement Saturday, it said windows and buildings should first be fixed and made “completely secure”.“Staff should not be required to work next to bullet holes,” the union said. “Forcing a return under these conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of the horrific shooting they endured.”The union also called for “perimeter security on all campuses” until the investigation is fully completed and shared with staff.White’s father contacted police and identified his son as the possible shooter. He said White had been upset over the death of his dog and also had become fixated on the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the law enforcement official who spoke to the AP anonymously.A neighbor of White told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “seemed like a good guy” but spoke with her multiple times about distrusting Covid-19 vaccines in unrelated conversations.“He was very unsettled, and he very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people,” Nancy Hoalst told the Atlanta newspaper. “He emphatically believed that.”But Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: “I had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC.”Explore more on these topicsAtlantaVaccines and immunisationCoronavirusUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

Two of the images showed a total of 10 tents pitched on the grassalong a highway on-rampjust over a mile from the White House. The third image showed a single person sleeping on the steps of the American Institute of Pharmacy Buildingon Constitution Avenue. The fourth image showed the line of vehicles that whisk Trump to his golf course passing a small amount of roadside litteron the E Street Expressway, near the Kennedy Center.Trump’s post promoted a previously announced news conference on Monday, which he has promised, “will, essentially, stop violent crime” in the capital district, without explaining how. In a subsequent post, he said that the news conference at 10am Monday, “will not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation’s Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness”.The Free DC movement, which advocates for self-determination, immediately scheduleda proteston Monday to coincide with Trump’s news conference.Despite Trump’s claims, there is no epidemic of homelessness or violent crime in the capital.According to the Community Partnership, which works to prevent homelessness in Washington DC,on any given nightthere are about 800 unsheltered persons sleeping outdoors in the city of about 700,000 people. A further 3,275 people use emergency shelters in Washington, and 1,065 people are in transitional housing facilities.Trump’s repeated claims that it might be necessary to federalize law enforcement in the city to make it safe also ignores data collected by the Metropolitan police department,released in Januaryby the federal government, which showed that violent crime in Washington DC in 2024 was down 35% from 2023 and was at the lowest level in over 30 years.“We are not experiencing a crime spike,” Washington DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser,told MSNBCon Sunday. “We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low.” She added that Washington DC police statistics show that violent crime is down a further 26% so far this year.“Federal law enforcement is always on the street in DC, and we always work cooperatively with them” Bowser said, adding the the Washington DC national guard, which Trump has threatened to deploy, is under the control of the president.Earlier this week, Trump ordereda surge of federal officersfrom a variety of agencies to increase patrols in Washington DC, pointing to the assault on a young federal worker who came to Washington to work with Elon Musk as evidence that the city’s police force was failing to combat violent crime. Washington DC police, however, hadstopped the assaultTrump focused attention on, and arrested two 15-year-old suspects at the scene.Asked by Reuters, the White House declined to explain what legal authority Trump would use to evict people from Washington.

Though they were resident in the UK, it is understood they were not British nationals, according to Sky News.In a statement, the municipal council of Mourão confirmed the deaths and declared two days of mourning. “It is with great regret that the municipality announces this information, offering its condolences to the families and friends of the victims,” it said.“In the car there were four occupants, of Mouranese nature, and a young woman with affinity to the family. Residents in England, [they] follow from Faro to Mourão, for the usual and deserved vacation.”The council announced the cancellation of all municipal activities and events across the weekend as a mark of respect.Tributes have been paid to the family by non-league Thetford Town Football Club, where the twins had played for the under-18s team.In a post shared on social media, the club said: “Thetford Town Football Club would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the Serrano family and the local Portuguese community after the recent tragedy while on holiday.“Afonso and Domingo’s were both an integral part of our U18’s team in recent years, both brothers sadly passed away in Portugal with their parents and friends in a tragic car accident. The loss of this lovely family will leave a massive void in the local community.”“Partiram, mas nunca serao esquecidos,” the club said, which translates to: “They are gone, but they will never be forgotten.”An investigation into the cause of the crash is under way.Explore more on these topicsUK newsPortugalEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Director and co-writer Ashutosh Gowariker and leading man and producer Aamir Khan created a film that revels in specifically Indian storytelling. There are joyous, colourful song and dance sequences (music by AR Rahman), an aching love triangle, a strong mother figure and a key life lesson:sach aur saahas hai jiske man main ant mein jeet usiki rahe(ultimately, the person who has truth and courage in his heart wins).Lagaan – also only the third Indian film ever to be nominated for an Oscar – runs for three hours 44 mins. It is not for the timid. This is big, brilliant, blissful entertainment with a throbbing heart.Anupama ChopraMexicoCanoa: A Shameful Memory (1976)View image in fullscreenCanoa: A Shameful Memory.Photograph: IMCINE CollectionWhen asked to name a film that represents Mexican cinema, the go-to choice is to turn to films from the Golden Age of the 1930s to 1950s, which offered idealised, picturesque visions of the country. Canoa breaks with that image entirely, yet it stands as one of the most essential films in the country’s history.Directed by Felipe Cazals and shot in faux-documentary style, Canoa is based on real events: it reconstructs the 1968 lynching of five university employees who were mistaken for communist agitators in a remote village. The village priest, claiming to defend God but intent on preserving his own power, becomes the engine of hysteria, warning of “communists” with flags “red as hellfire and black as sin”. The outcome is revealed early: corpses on the ground, the violence already done.Canoa’s ominous setting and unreliable narrators would be enough to make it a masterclass in suspense. But its force lies in how those tools expose a deeper national unease. Cazals, once a maverick for refusing to idealise or folklorise Mexico, is now seen as one of its most vital directors. Canoa not only broke with cinematic tradition; it anticipated present-day Mexican cinema, which increasingly turns toward the violence overtaking the country, the impunity surrounding it and the sense of vulnerability among its citizens.Fernanda SolórzanoFranceLa Bataille de Solférino (Age of Panic; 2013)View image in fullscreenLa Bataille de Solférino (Age of Panic).Photograph: Ecce FilmsAlthough her 30-minute film Two Ships won best European short at the 2012 Berlinale, the director Justine Triet was not nominated for any of the major prize categories at Cannes the following year for her first full-length feature Age of Panic.Anatomy of a Fall director Justine Triet: ‘I didn’t feel that French cinema wanted me around’Read moreAnd yet, to just watch the film – to really watch it – is to feel that cinema itself was coming off its hinges. This story of a separated couple racing around Paris with their young children wrenched the French psychological drama away from its standard tropes of bourgeois arguments in flats or picturesque cafes. Set against the unpredictable backdrop of a tense national election night, the film is carried along by stressful waves of crisis-ridden energy in overspilling crowds. The intimate and the political constantly bump up against each other through sudden and sublime crescendos.What followed – Victoria,Sibyland the Palme d’Or-winningAnatomy of a Fall– blasted Triet into the spotlight. She is among a new generation of women film-makers – alongsideCéline Sciamma,Rebecca Zlotowski, Valérie Donzelli andAlice Diop– who have in their own way renewed the French cultural imagination. It is now much less tentative or narrowly naturalistic in outlook, and less indebted to the New Wave.With only 36,000 tickets sold in France, Age of Panic was a commercial flop. Still, if you were going to write an official counter-history of the films capturing a “French touch”, it would be an inarguable milestone.Didier PéronThe PhilippinesKakabakaba Ka Ba? (Will Your Heart Beat Faster?; 1980)Tell any Filipino the title of this film and chances are, they’ll let out a chuckle. It’s a play on the rhythmic repetition of “kaba” (worry): the title’s rapid-fire syllables mimic the fast beats of an anxious heart. It’s a linguistic joke that simply vanishes with translation.As such, Mike de Leon’s rock opera comedy can be considered an inside joke. Music, drugs, the Chinese mafia and the Japanese yakuza converge around a quartet of teenagers led by Filipino acting legend Christopher de Leon after his character unwittingly smuggles opium in a cassette tape.The laughs come from deliriously over-the-top villains who represent the foreign forces shaping and manipulating the Philippine economy, all vying to retrieve the contraband. It revels in meta moments, from subtitle manipulation and dubbing shenanigans to a scene in which nuns in fishnet stockings sing about bread. It takes jabs at imperialism, satirises the Catholic church, and promotes the idea that stoned teenagers can save the day. Garnering the ire of real-life priests, nuns and the board of censors at the time of its release, this film didn’t just stretch the boundaries of the second golden age of Philippine cinema – it gleefully obliterated them.Ryan OquizaKenyaNusu Maisha Ya Nairobi (Nairobi Half Life; 2012)View image in fullscreenNusu Maisha Ya Nairobi (Nairobi Half Life).Photograph: Jim ChuchuIn Nairobi Half Life, by Kenyan film-maker David “Tosh” Gitonga, a young movie seller and aspiring actor leaves his rural home for the capital to pursue an acting career. He is robbed of his possessions on his first day and ends up getting entangled in crime to survive. He starts living a double life: stealing and mugging as a gang member, and rehearsing a play as he chases his acting dream.The film is a gritty portrayal of life in the city and how crime, corruption and class divisions affect society. It showcases the spirited energy of urban life in Kenya and powerfully captures the dreams of young people and the struggles they face to succeed. The film is rooted in Kenya’s cinematic tradition of storytelling, which often focuses on local stories that explore social themes. With its depth and authenticity, it was the country’s first submission to the best international film Oscar, and was a distinct addition to Kenya’s crime dramas, a prevalent genre in the country’s cinema.Carlos MureithiArgentinaRelatos Salvajes (Wild Tales; 2014)View image in fullscreenRelatos Salvajes (Wild Tales).Photograph: Juan Salvarredy/Corner Producciones/El Deseo/Incaa/Icaa/Telefe/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockThere’s fizz and froth inDamián Szifron’s six tales of revenge, which capture the danger of a nation teetering on the edge of a breakdown. Martín Rejtman’s The Magic Gloves may have captured the chaos of Argentina’s 2001 financial crisis with a slyer absurdism, but Szifron’s compact sketches – which range from the poisoning of a loan shark to a wedding from hell – expose a plethora of ills across Argentinian society in both urban and rural landscapes. Class inequalities, labyrinthine bureaucracy, institutional corruption and toxic masculinity all rear their ugly heads in a film where characters are trapped in a violent cycle of repetition, evoking the tangled narratives of Jorge Luis Borges.A top-notch cast, including the Argentinian everyman Ricardo Darín – the face of many of the best homegrown films of the 21st century, from the newly remasteredNine Queensto the Oscar-winningThe Secret in Their Eyes– shape a motley crew of characters whose lines have become unlikely catchphrases in Argentina, where the film broke box office records.Realised in an in-your-face colour palette, the film may not have the subtlety of compatriot Lucrecia Martel’sThe Headless Woman– a film Szifron ingeniously references – or the narrative ambition of Mariano Llinás’sLa Flor, but its exuberance and dark humour are rooted in a playful Argentinian storytelling tradition where nothing can be taken at surface level.Maria DelgadoTurkeyUmut (Hope;1970)View image in fullscreenOne of Those Days When Hemme Dies, a film influenced by Umut.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyA man, a cart, a dry tree. Decades later,Umutremains urgent. It’s the story of a poor coachman called Cabbar chasing a lost treasure. Desperation turns into madness: the film pushes us deeper into magical thinking, from harsh reality to myth.Written, directed and acted by Yilmaz Güney, the film’s fierce rejection of individual salvation and neorealist lens transforms everyday visuals – a dusty landscape, boys on rented bicycles, faces of workers – into political statements. Shot in black and white, the film’s single dry tree becomes a haunting symbol, a promise that never comes true. The system keeps failing to protect the vulnerable, leaving helpless people praying to stones and begging healers for redemption.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The men in Ceylan’s Once Upon a Time in Anatolia dig for a buried corpse in order to find a truth, while the vast landscape similarly resonates the inner emptiness and existential dread. In the wonderful debut by Murat Firatoglu, One of Those Days When Hemme Dies, Turkey’s Oscar entry this year, a red tomato plain is a site of desperation and a power struggle.Esin KucuktepepinarChinaTie Xi Qu (West of the Tracks;2002)View image in fullscreenTie Xi Qu (West of the Tracks).Photograph: Wang BingWang Bing’s nine-hour epic offers a sweeping perspective on the collapse of a vast industrial community in north-east China at the turn of the century. The film lays bare the turmoil and disruption of that era: for China, it was a pivotal historical moment.Despite its epic nature, West of the Tracks is a deeply personal work. In 1999, Wang Bing, alone with a Panasonic EZ1 camera, immersed himself in this industrial landscape. Over the next year and a half, he roamed the site, accumulating 300 hours of footage that would coalesce into this major social and historical work. This was an entirely individual initiative, conducted outside China’s film censorship system. And so the film has never been integrated into the official narrative of cinematic history.Yet its significance was quickly recognised in the west, celebrated not for only its scale and story but also its realistic aesthetic. The film confronts and reshapes China’s dominant cinematic tradition of ideological film, and ushers it on to the global stage. Wang Bing worked under extraordinarily harsh conditions. When asked what sustained him, he has said: “I don’t know, truly, I don’t know.”Zhang YaxuanNigeriaSaworoide (Brass Bells; 1999)Tunde Kelani is a Nigerian film-maker who can make a legitimate claim to auteur status. Active before the Nollywood era kicked off around 1992, Kelani worked as a cinematographer before building an impressive oeuvre as a director and producer. His films embrace indigenous Yoruba literature and philosophy while making scathing sociopolitical commentary. His pièce de résistance has to be Saworoide, a political fable about the corruption of absolute power that resonates to this day.The world on screen: the best movies from Africa, Asia and Latin AmericaRead moreReleased in 1999, the same year that marked Nigeria’s return to democratic rule following a brutal military dictatorship, Saworoide’s precise and devastating reading of leadership and turmoil in the fictional Jogbo community is an obvious allegory for the Nigerian condition. A corrupt monarch ascends to the throne and, bolstered by the complicity of self-serving lackeys, begins a reign of terror that is matched only by his incompetence. He rejects the customary checks and balances on his power and soon meets his Waterloo. But as the people find out, things can get even worse.Saworoide straddles elements that have come to define Nigerian cinema across the decades. Much like the output from Nollywood’s influential home video era, Saworoide is dialogue- and plot-heavy. It also contains nods to the travelling Yoruba theatre, popular in the 1970s. Kelani’s concise vision keeps the film visually dynamic and it plays very well on the big screen.Wilfred OkicheFinlandTulitikkutehtaan Tyttö (The Match Factory Girl; 1990)View image in fullscreenTulitikkutehtaan Tyttö (The Match Factory Girl).Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyNo film-maker has done more for the picture of Finnishness than Aki Kaurismäki. The minimalist melodrama The Match Factory Girl was the final, best and most bleak entry in his Proletariat Trilogy, until he returned in 2023 with the lovelyFallen Leaves– a fairytale compared with this one.Iris (Kati Outinen, queen of deadpan acting) is a timid factory worker who still lives with her mum and stepdad, whom she supports on her meagre earnings. She dreams of romance but nobody asks her to dance. Her life is all Finnish gloom: hard work, few words, low expectations, loneliness and shame. Every time she tries to break out she is crushed, yet she fights back. Miraculously, the film is both tragic and darkly funny.Kaurismäki’s visual style is as instantly recognisable as Wes Anderson’s, but only he could bring out the beauty in these unexceptional settings and his protagonists, who are ordinary workers with laconic wit, grit and dignity. They can’t express their feelings in gestures or words, but Kaurismäki’s unsparing gaze never abandons them: this egalitarian respect for every person’s integrity is very Finnish. As for Iris, the smallest of sparrows: her stoic endurance of humiliation and cruelty makes one root for murder.Sara Ehnholm HielmItalyLa Grande Guerra (The Great War; 1959)View image in fullscreenLa Grande Guerra (The Great War).Photograph: ScreenProd/Photononstop/AlamyThe Great War speaks to the Italian character after the second world war and the end of the fascist regime, and what it still is today.It’s the story of two cowards trying to pass themselves off as model soldiers. Their refusal to act as soldiers doesn’t come out of a moral or political stance but an individual one: why should I risk my life? Let someone else do the job. It’s individualism, the Italian way.The film was born out of director Mario Monicelli’s spite for the regime’s propaganda, which lionised the myth of Italy’s brave and bold heroism during the first world war. Monicelli’s film demolishes this story through comedy: it was revolutionary in 1959 and very bold. Like everything in Italian cinema from the end of the second world war until the early 60s, it was a step in the building of a new identity, and comedy is how Italians engage in the most serious affairs.In the film, the soldiers – who deceive and bicker with each other – are captured by Austrians and face a sudden, moving change of heart. Although they have information that might save their lives, they decide to accept their fate and not betray their comrades. It’s a decision that both represents and inspires the Italian spirit: one of unconditional care for each other that compensates for a lack of collective consciousness.Gabriele NiolaIranBad Ma Ra Khahad Bord(The Wind Will Carry Us; 1999)View image in fullscreenBad Ma Ra Khahad Bord (The Wind Will Carry Us).Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyEmerging from a moment shaped by Islamic modernism and Ayatollah Khomeini’s criticism of modern media – with its imperialist ways of seeing – Abbas Kiarostami’s The Wind Will Carry Us proposes a different way of looking. Eleven of the film’s main characters remain off screen, and the depths of the Earth – the dark caverns of the village of Siah Darreh – give voice to long-shrouded desires. Here, green hay moves as if of its own accord. In a rural village, time passes as if yesterday were a month ago, and an old villager lives to be 100 or so. As an urban film-maker and his crew wait for the elder’s passing so they can film their documentary on local funeral rites, a fabulated world appears on screen.Film scholar Christian Keathley once wrote that: “Many viewers who watched the first films of the Lumière brothers were delighted less by the scenes being staged for their amusement than by the fact that, in the background, the leaves were fluttering in the wind.” This freedom of the eye to roam, away from the rigid coordinates of western commercial cinema, is the hallmark of Iranian cinema after the 1979 revolution. The Wind Will Carry Us teaches the eye to see differently: to look with wonder at things that lie elsewhere, beyond our lived reality.Negar MottahedehExplore more on these topicsWorld cinemaBollywoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hood 2 Farm sees him trying to learn the skills, and turning his wild, slapstick journey into hilarious TVShaad D'SouzaSun 10 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 03.01 EDTShareIn Hood 2 Farm, a 76-year-old shepherd is explaining his daily routine. “There’s only my wife and I, and when she gets out of bed, I get in, and when I get out of bed, she gets in,” he says. The south London rapper Fekky pauses, before saying: “If you don’t mind me asking, if she’s getting out of bed, you’re getting in bed, when are you …hugging up, man?” The farmer laughs and replies: “It’s not happening, chap!” to Fekky’s clear horror.This kind of interaction is common on Hood 2 Farm, a unique and genuinely inspired YouTube series about the rapper’s attempt to become the steward of his own farm. Across eight 30-minute episodes, he meets farmers from around the UK and learns basics such as milking cows, shearing sheep and driving tractors.The resulting show wraps genuine insight about agricultural practice in the screwball energy of classic British comedy, thanks to Fekky’s perpetual fish-out-of-water spirit – he is fond of wearing a Gucci cap on the farm – and clear passion for nature. With some episodes netting well over 100,000 views, the unconventional series has been a hit, and Fekky says he plans to continue with future seasons.Fekky, 38, says the idea began before lockdown, when he went on holiday to Thailand to decompress from the pressures of life in the music industry. As a rapper, Fekky has played to crowds of thousands, appearedalongside Dizzee Rascal,collaborated with Skeptaand started his own label, F Music, but has often talked about his struggles with alcohol use and anxiety. “After my long music career, I just decided to have a break – a lot of it gets very busy and gets wild,” he says over a video call. “I just fell in love with nature in Thailand.”I said to myself that I should learn farming but show everyone, especially the youth, what I’m doing – so as I learn, they learnWhen he got home, London was plunged into lockdown, and he began gardening as a way to pass the time, documenting his progress on social media. “I realised there were a lot of people that were engaged and loved seeing me doing it, I think because I was a fish out of water,” he says. He decided he “wanted to live in nature full time”, so he bought a plot of land – which he has dubbed F Manor – and decided to leave London for good, while continuing to post farm content. “I just said to myself that I should basically learn farming but show everyone that’s watching, especially the youth, what I’m doing – so as I’m learning, they can learn,” he says.The posts were a runaway success, and people began messaging him asking when his next piece of farm content would go live, “so it made sense for me to do a show about farming”. The only problem, of course, was that he “didn’t know nothing” about farming, and had never set foot on a farm until he bought one. His family back in Nigeria are farmers, he says, “so I knew it must be something in the family, but I had no idea”.View image in fullscreen‘You’re stepping into the unknown every time’ … Fekky in Hood 2 Farm.When he decided to visit other farms, he was shocked by how little he knew about where our food comes from. “A pig farm is like … I thought pigs weresmall, like that” – he holds his hands about 10 inches apart – “I didn’t realise pigs were, like,massive,” he says, still astounded. “You see food on a plate, but you never think about where it’s coming from. The first thing I learned about having chickens was like … it’s weird to think you’re eating chicken … but then Ilovemy chickens, if that makes sense.”You can see Fekky experiencing all this in real time onHood 2 Farm, which rivals some sitcoms in its laughs-per-minute ratio. It’s amazing to see how game Fekky is to puncture his own tough-guy rapper image. In the first episode, he gets hit in the face by a cow’s tail while attempting to milk it, admits he previously thought a cow’s teats were “willies”, and asks a farmer whether milk is actually just semen – to her dumbstruck confusion. In Fekky’s mind, there hasn’t been a single wildest moment of learning to farm – the entire process has been totally shocking.“A cow tried to hit me!” he says. “Even sheep, I was trying to herd sheep, and it was just crazy – they’re going everywhere! And I never thought I would have 10,000 bees all over me. You’re just walking straight into that craziness. Just being comfortable around animals was the hardest part – all the animals are big, and if you run into something where you don’t know what it can do, there’s a danger element. But it didn’t end up being dangerous, you just feel a bit, like, out of your depth.”The feeling of being around the animals, he says, isn’t so dissimilar to being on stage. “You’re stepping into the unknown every time,” he says. “The similarity is the adrenaline rush you get when performing on stage or when I’m with animals – because, like I said, it feels dangerous – but then after that, it’s like, it’s all right.”We live a very wild lifestyle as rappers; hotel to hotel, show to show. Nature gives you the balanceSince making the pivot to farm life, Fekky has found that his friends and family have been more than supportive – “a lot of my rapper friends all want to come to the farm” – and have been amazed to find that growing your own food can come with benefits on multiple levels. “When I give my eggs, which I get from my chickens, to my friends, they say they taste so much better than from any shop,” he says. “I think I’ve opened people’s eyes to eating food that you’re growing yourself. Something about it just tastes real.”The greatest benefit for him personally, he says, is on his overall mental health and wellbeing. “I think nature in general is very healing, and we live a very wild lifestyle as rappers; hotel to hotel, show to show,” he says. “Going into farming gives you the balance. We shouldn’t pigeonhole ourselves to one thing in our careers. After a while, you should start thinking about how diverse you can be, and what else can you do in life? Even if it’s just a hobby.”That’s the lesson he wants to impart to black British kids who might be watching. “I just hope the youth understand that where you start in life is not where you finish. You have to explore the world and open your thoughts. I think when we grow up, you see people like myself being rappers or footballers, and these are the most cliche careers that people think you have to go into to make it. I want you to understand that you can be you, you can explore, you can do farming, and you’ll be accepted and find happiness.”Hood 2 Farmis on YouTubeExplore more on these topicsTelevisionGrimeSkeptaDizzee RascalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In addition, there have been a rash of documentaries, produced in various countries around the world, as well as a dramatic depiction of him played by actor Penn Badgley in a movie whose title alludes to his musical father,Greetings from Tim Buckley. Collectively, that places him in the realm of other departed stars, including Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis and Eva Cassidy, whose catalogues have been mined for every ounce of gold they can possibly produce.‘There just aren’t words to explain’: Jeff Buckley documentary brings tears to SundanceRead moreIn that context, the title of the new Jeff Buckley documentary,It’s Never Over, could easily read like a threat. Luckily, nothing could be further from the truth. The film winds up giving a largely familiar story a holistic reach like no project before it. However picked over the bones of Buckley’s story may be, director Amy Berg has found fresh flesh by emphasizing the crucial role women played in his life starting with his mother, Mary Guibert, and fanning out to various girlfriends, most of whom are fellow artists who sometimes doubled as spiritual collaborators. Together, they show how a female spirit not only shaped Buckley’s early life, it also provided a foundational part of his art. The earliest songs he sang as a kid were voiced by women, from Diana Ross’s yearning reading of Ain’t No Mountain High Enough to Judy Garland’s self-immolating take on The Man Who Got Away. “I wanted to be a chanteuse,” Buckley says in a vintage audio interview used in the film. “Secretly, I think I wanted to be Nina Simone.”You can hear the connection in the intensity, range and sustain of his quaver, which also drew from the qawwali chants of the Pakistani devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. In the film, Buckley refers to Khan as “my Elvis”. At the same time, he drew profound inspiration from classically macho sources, initially through the scorched earth whomp of Led Zeppelin and, later, via the chest-beating yowls of Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell. The breadth of those gender identifications allowed Buckley to idealize the Jungian concept of anima, which asserts that men have to recognize their feminine side in order to fully embrace their humanity, as well as to truly understand the role of women in their lives. In one vintage quote in the film, Buckley says, “I decided to make a woman of music and give myself to her. At another point, I decided to make a man of music and give myself to him,” adding for good measure: “Music was my mother. It was my father. It was the best thing in my life.”That last line can’t be easy to hear for his actual mother, who co-produced the film and who guards his estate like a sentry, deciding who from his life can speak for him and who cannot. To her credit, Guibert allowed director Berg to cast Jeff’s early years with her in a far from soft light. She was just a teenager when he was born, the product of a fleeting relationship with the visionary cult singer Tim Buckley. At the time, he was on the rise (or at least seemed to be), and, in his ambition, he ignored both her and the coming child. Five months into her pregnancy, Guibert recalls in the film, “I knew I was never going to see Tim again.”While Tim Buckley ran off to pursue his dreams, her ambitions of being an actor and musician withered under the responsibility of raising the child. She’s honest in the film about her own immaturity at the time, which meant that Jeff had to mother her in ways that came to haunt and anger him. The only time he saw his father was during several days they spent together when Jeff was a boy. His later attempts to reach his dad were ignored, then made impossible when Tim died of a heroin overdose at age 28 in 1975. Jeff harbored dark feelings afterwards, complicated further by the fact that music – his savior and muse – bound him inescapably to the man who abandoned him.View image in fullscreenJeff Buckley in 1994.Photograph: Dave Tonge/Getty ImagesJeff’s path to a career in music has been chronicled endlessly elsewhere and it’s dutifully recalled in the film. Yet seldom, if ever, has the story had as caring a context as the one provided by the friends and lovers who spoke to Berg. They paint a portrait of someone whose insecurities and neurosis ran in tandem with his talent and daring. When Grace appeared and artists of the order of David Bowie and Robert Plant fell over themselves to praise him in interviews, Buckley buckled under the expectations of their awe. He was just as itchy about his anointment by People magazine as one of the “most beautiful” men alive. A girlfriend in the film recalls him buying every copy of the magazine he could get his hands on so he could throw them in the trash.Stark as the contrast may have been between his often ugly view of himself and the beauty of his outward appearance, there’s no denying the part it played in his myth. Like Jackson Browne, Buckley’s soulful brand of handsomeness ideally mirrored the sensitivity and refinement of his art.The man behind that face is presented here as someone simultaneously confused and playful, sweet and lost. For a fresh insight, friends tell Berg they think he may have been manic depressive, a term given little airing back in the 90s, when Buckley died by accidentally drowning in the Mississippi River. Another coup for the film is the inclusion of voicemails he left for his mother, including one in which he excoriates her for her deficiencies and another in which he honors her perseverance and unwavering love for him. Despite that support, friends say Buckley had no idea how to grow into a mature man. As deeply as that vexed him, his melding of genders in his art allowed him to live his short life with the androgynous freedom of a child.Today Buckley would be 58, an unimaginable age for someone whom fate has forced us to see as forever young. Now he exists solely on a plane he might well appreciate, where he’s less a person than a sound, a soul captured wholly in song.It’s Never Over:Jeff Buckleyis out now in US cinemasExplore more on these topicsJeff BuckleyDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Never fear: there are plenty of other experiences out there for anyone looking to get immersed on a budget, or to try something a bit different. But what? We had a look at a few we could imagine happily queueing for. Book now, while places remain.White Lotus LiveThis former grain storage and processing facility, a short coach ride from central Birmingham, has been transformed into a luxury resort for the month of August, where you won’t just see how the other half lives – you’ll live how the other half lives, until one of you dies horribly (see our T&Cs). Experience the spiritual hollowness at the core of extreme privilege first-hand, while sipping luxury cocktails on the sands of our artificial beach (if you choose to swim, please be aware that the lifeguards are actors), while events around you move inexorably towards tragedy. Nightly shows begin at 7.30pm, but the bar opens at midday.Once Removed: Tribute Band Summer Festival ExperienceThe closest thing to watching your favourite band being impersonated live: a big-screen surround-sound festival evening featuring AI renderings of up to a dozen of Britain’s finest rock and pop tribute acts, including Phoney M, Not the Hoople, Re:Prince, Sham Sham 69 and Proxy Music. The only difference between this show and the real thing (not therealthing; see our FAQs) is the ticket prices, which start at a fiver for cash (dynamic pricing applies).Mickey 17: the Live MusicalThe live rights to this big-budget Robert Pattinson vehicle were acquired long before the film proved to be the box office flop of 2025. That’s why there is still availability throughout August, at prices to beat any outdoor immersive experience. State-of-the-art projection technology will make you think you’re part of the crazy world of Mickey 17. Or it would do if you’d seen it.MasterChef in the ParkEver wonder what it’s like to present a BBC cooking contest? This is your chance! The chefs are all professionals, the cooking happens in real time, the tense music is provided by a live band and you are one of the judges. MasterChef in the Park is more than a free admission immersive experience – it’s an open audition, and we’re in a bit of a hurry, so delete your social media account, get some headshots done and come on down.View image in fullscreenWould you go in search of a realistic recreation of a bus-sized agglomeration of cooking fat and baby wipes?Photograph: Thames Water/PAFatberg Subterranean ChallengeLucky ticket-holders are directed to a secret location in central London, where they’ll don hazmat suits before descending into a stunningly realistic recreation of an overburdened Victorian sewer. The journey is almost a kilometre long, with the only exit blocked by a bus-sized agglomeration of cooking fat and baby wipes.Can you dig your way free (spades provided) in time for light refreshments (not included in ticket price) at the far end? Rumours that this immersive experience is just a cheap way of addressing an acute manpower shortage have been denied by the production company (see FAQs). Either way, you’ll never put bacon grease down the sink again.Explore more on these topicsCultureImmersive theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The weight of each character’s footsteps become recognisable.Welcome to the Blind Theater from Brazil, where every scent is a prop, and an actor’s breathing and tread are their character’s signatures.Before their Edinburgh fringe show begins, the blind actor Edgar Jacques briefs the audience on what to expect when they enter the entirely darkened space. It is a fringe first and will be an unusual, perhaps unsettling experience, he warns the sighted.Sitting in pitch dark will “reach your other senses, and use your other senses. You will listen to things, you will smell things and maybe things will touch you, like the wind or maybe the rain.”Before audiences line up single file, one hand resting on the shoulder of the person in front, everyone is cautioned to switch off their mobile phones and smartwatches, and to avoid stretching their legs in the small auditorium, where production staff taped out light leaking under the theatre door.Although well established in São Paulo, the Blind Theater (Teatro Cego) production of Another Sight is one of several shows designed for visually impaired audiences being staged by the venue group Zoo for the first time at this year’s festival.Anothertheatre company,Extant, has teamed up with the charity Sight Scotland and artists’ collective Visually Impaired Creators Scotland to put on three “enhanced” performances, which include touch tours of the shows and live audio description over headphones.One semi-autobiographical Extant production, I Dream in Colour, was written by a fully blind writer Jasmin Thein. It recounts the trauma of a blind woman forced to weigh up losing her remaining eye owing to a tumour or risking cancer.Another Sight, played by blind and sighted actors, examines Brazil’s class system and the politics of disability. It explores the tensions between a wealthy woman, Grace, confronting a cancer diagnosis, when her maid, Maria, returns to work as Grace’s domestic while she completes her own treatment for cancer.Anxious to work again despite being clearly fragile and diminished by her chemotherapy, her presence triggers a powerful reaction from her employer. Their respective husbands, including Jacques, act as peace-makers.For Jacques, the darkness offers him an equality that conventional theatre productions do not. Unlike on a fully lit stage, he is no longer defined by his disability or his physical movements and posture which, as a blind person, can be different from the sighted.“We open this universe for blind actors to play not just blind characters, but the good guy, the bad guy, the princess, the frog, everybody. So in the darkness, a blind person can be like anybody else,” he told the audience earlier this week.For Ana Righi, a fully sighted actor who played Grace, that means she has to emphasise the sound of her feet and voice far more deliberately. Facial expressions, makeup and physical movement are irrelevant. Speaking through a translator, Righi said that changes “a lot of elements … especially using breathing to express emotions”.Actors move through the audience, which sits close to the small stage in a semi-circle, adding a spatial dimension by working in different parts of the room. Grace has “a very stiff, secure step, whereas the maid has a very timid step, like a person who’s always afraid”.Please do touch: sculpture exhibition curated by blind people to feature tactile worksRead moreAnother Sight is part of a series showcasing theatre, dance and clowning from São Paulo supported by the state government, the Brazilian consulate in Edinburgh and the local arts association Associação Paulista dos Amigos da Arte.Paulo Palado, the show’s director, said blind actors were normally expected to play only blind characters. The approach taken in Another Sight lifted that restriction. The company realised the power of that only during their first show 13 years ago; they now have seven plays in that format.Sensory perceptions are essential, Palado said. Those can include fans to provide a breeze or, in some shows, rain. It can be a special experience for unsighted audiences, too, who normally have audio description telling them what is happening in conventional theatre.In this show blind and sighted people “are all in exactly the same situation. We have the same information. In this case audio description is not necessary because that language is for all.”Another Sight runs at Playground 2 atZoo Playgroundfrom 1-24 AugustExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalTheatreBlindness and visual impairmentFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Windblown,Karine Polwartcommemorates an Edinburgh institution of similar longevity. And she does it exquisitely.Her focus isthe sabal palmthat stood in the Royal Botanic Garden for more than 200 years and, even before that, grew in the original gardens at the top of Leith Walk. It outgrew the original glass house within decades and towered over generations of visitors until, in 2021, this oldest living specimen in the collection had to be chopped down.You might have expected a protectionist response from Polwart, but she does not question the necessity of the renovations to the Victorian palm houses that are now under way as part of theEdinburgh Biomesproject, designed to secure the future of the collection’s 13,500 plant species. Rather, her tone is elegiac, not least because this is also a lockdown-era story, haunted by loss and the need for reflection.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianFollowing the format of her equally sublimeWind Resistance, she blends songs, poetry and spoken word, all delivered in soothing, honeyed tones, to celebrate the wondrous natural beauty of the tree and to praise the generations of keepers who ensured its survival. With co-composer Pippa Murphy, Polwart was artist in residence at the Botanics, and in Windblown she draws on conversations with staff whose dedication to the plants is as personal as it is professional.One observes that on the day his dog was due to be put down, he still gave it a treat in the morning. The palm commands similar dedication and respect until the very end. “For the time is nearly over,” goes Polwart’s repeated refrain, set to an appropriately timeless folk melody.Accompanied by Dave Milligan on grand piano, she stands beneath a wild feathery arrangement of fronds designed by Neil Haynes and lit in ever-changing colours by Lizzie Powell, as Jamie Wardrop’s sparkling watery video projections suggest the epic journey from Bermuda (and its colonialist implications). Through it all, Polwart attributes to generations ofEdinburghcitizens an enterprise of everyday love, care and attention.AtQueen’s Hall, Edinburgh, until 13 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalKarine PolwartTheatreEdinburghreviewsShareReuse this content"

Featuring scenes of rape and violence in a Sikh gurdwara, the ambitious state-of-the-nation work stirredhuge controversyamong religious communities when it premiered, and had its run at the Birmingham Rep cancelled following violent protests.Bhatti has since gone on to create similarly confronting work, including her recent touring play about prison motherhood, Scenes from Lost Mothers, as well as penning a coercive control storyline for The Archers. But those theatregoers expecting a continuation of this challenging storytelling may be disappointed by her latest work, Choir. Set during rehearsal sessions for a community choir who are preparing for a potential big break on TV, the play is more comic than visceral; more sitcom than Sarah Kane.The eight-person ensemble cast are tight-knit and lively, tackling musical numbers such as Queen’s Somebody to Love and the Eagles’ Hotel California with harmonic aplomb, while director Hannah Joss’s slick musical scene transitions add pace and rhythm to the script. But the characterisations are disappointingly clunky, giving us the likes of kooky pensioner Sheila, lonely divorcee Ken, diva-like former star Paul and troubled but promising upstart Freddie.View image in fullscreenKooky … Annie Wensak and Timothy Speyer as Sheila and KenPhotograph: Helen MurrayGroup dynamics play out predictably in the first half, as newcomer Freddie steals the spotlight from usual soloist Paul, and the stress caused by the TV crew’s imminent arrival leads choir founder Morgan (an energetic and engaging Laura Checkley) to make a compromising decision.Secrets abound and slapstick gags lead to panto laughs. Thankfully though, as the play’s final acts arrive, a series of emotional denouements elevate it. Danusia Samal as happy-go-lucky Anna delivers a beautifully muted monologue that reveals the sadness behind her plastered-on smile, while a standout scene between Keenan Munn-Francis’s shy Freddie and James Gillan’s acerbic Paul produces a moving rendition of Sinead O’Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U.Revelations come quickly and the show’s finale lands with a heartwarming flutter. It’s perhaps too little too late, but ultimately still a welcome foray into fresh, feelgood territory for Bhatti.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 30 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreGurpreet Kaur BhattiChichester Festival theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for theThe Entombmentby Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even just for a coffee and a cake atBar Giorgio, which is really just a coffee stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli’s chantilly cream-filled brioche buns for £7 a pop.Locatelli’s new arty venture is in partnership with the catering companySearcys, which controls the dining offering at a number of large, unwieldy venues – the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power station, to name just a few – as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall, Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots.View image in fullscreen‘One of the highlights of lunch’: Locatelli at the National Gallery’s roast aubergine with soy ‘ricotta’, cherry tomatoes, roast hazelnuts and basil pesto.The National Gallery, especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli’s much-famed, Michelin-starred restaurantLocanda Locatelli, where small portions of pricey pasta, drilled service and twinkly lightingcreateda charming ambience. So charming, in fact, that after yourlinguineall’asticeorstrozzapreti al pomodoro, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome.Locatelli’s skill at creating ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment, when school’s out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that’s packed with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be anywhere else but staring atThe Ambassadorsby Holbein the Younger, and are probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and panzanella antipasti.But here’s the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National Gallerya lot. Head chefImma Savinelliand general managerCostanzo Cappella, who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours,adonisesand breakfast martinis.View image in fullscreen‘Punchy’: Locatelli at the National Gallery’s calamarata with sea bream.What’s more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping hotfritto misto, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or calamarata with sea bream.Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil for dipping, which we ate with a bowl ofgiardiniera(pickled vegetables), including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with a very good soy “ricotta”, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil pesto.From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast chicken with polenta, both of them served with potatoarrosto, should one see fit. Thecontornisection, however, is a bit limited – there’s just those spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad – and I chose badly from the dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream buns.View image in fullscreenLocatelli at the National Gallery’s ‘cute’ dessert trolley.Service throughout felt as if everyone involved cared a great deal about your experience and was trying incredibly hard, even if it was the first time they’d ever worked in a restaurant, which in the current era of hospitality is really about as good as it gets. I’ll take my service pleasant, well-meaning and unpolished any day.Overall, then, there’s a lot to love about Locatelli at the National Gallery. Sure, it’s not a patch on a night out at Locanda Locatelli; it’s just a once-round-the-Botticellis followed by a bowl of fresh tagliatelle kind of gig. Not a masterpiece, but not bad.

The story we like to tell, culturally, about romantic love is straightforward: that there is just one person out there for everyone, and that, once you have found that person, you will be happy every day until one of you is dead. So what about people who rack up multiple marriages? The famous stories tend to have a whiff of madness and glamour about them. There is Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times (twice to Richard Burton). The other, bloodier, example that springs to mind is Henry VIII.To be married and divorced multiple times requires a strange mixture of romanticism and practicality about love. Saying “until death do us part” again, with four ex-husbands still living, suggests that you believe the right marriage might save you. But also that deep down you know it won’t. I started looking for stories of serial spouses in the aftermath of a breakup with a man I had wanted to marry, and there was a part of me that hoped that speaking to these people might loosen the hold that marriage has over my own imagination. Why do so many of us aspire to an institution with a 58% success rate, at best? And why do I feel like a failure because I haven’t achieved it? Serial brides and grooms might find the idea of marriage especially seductive – but I suspected that they might also be clear-eyed about love, and its limits, in a way that most of us are not.The dream of the perfect wedding, and the perfect marriage, can be particularly hard to resist if you are a woman. At first I was surprised to find so many serial brides on internet message boards. I had a stereotype in my head of the man who cycles through women, trading in each new wife for a younger model. But when I actually connected with interviewees, it began to make sense to me. Anita, who has been married six times, told me that she walked down the aisle for the first time at 18 because she was frightened people would think there was something wrong with her if she wasn’t chosen by a man. When her first marriage broke down, Anita kept getting remarried, because to be a divorced woman in the European town in which she grew up was to be a kind of social outcast. A2019 book by the behavioural scientist Paul Dolandrew on data suggesting that women who don’t marry or have children are happier and healthier than those who do, but there is still a perception that single women are broken or unfulfilled. For men, a solid relationship is one of a number of ingredients that make for a good life, but many of the women I interviewed for this piece were raised – like me – to view marriage as their crowning achievement.Marriage is seductive for irrational, emotional reasons – but it is also incentivised by the state. In the UK, married couples are eligible for tax breaks and, in the US, married couples are allowed to use their spouse’s medical insurance, so a marriage certificate can mean access to life-saving medical care. Carys, a 73-year-old American divorce attorney who has herself been divorced seven times, was transparent with me about the fact that marriage, for her, is partly a financial proposition. When she first got married, in 1972, marriage put women at a disadvantage: marital rape was still legal in most US states, and women generally lost any claim to shared property in the event of a divorce. Speaking to me via video link from her home office, Carys explained that she kept remarrying because she wanted to prove to herself that she had value, and that she could find love but she was also insistent that a marriage should be about something more tangible than romance. “If you’re a divorce lawyer you’re not really so into the ‘until death do us part’ bit of marriage,” she explained. “It’s more something you do to make yourself financially and emotionally safe in the event that things go south.” Carys has filed six out of seven of her own divorces, and used to keep the paperwork sitting in a file on her desk until needed, like a kind of security blanket. “As an attorney who’d handled divorces for hundreds of other people, I always felt able to quickly and painlessly escape.”Carys is happily married to husband number eight. She spoke to me anonymously, and doesn’t always disclose her marital history to clients. Similarly, Anita, who lives in Scotland, keeps her multiple divorces a secret – Anita is not her real name. Other than her sixth husband, the only person who knows the full story of her past is her priest. Even the people who did agree to be photographed in these pages expressed anxiety about being judged. Serial brides and grooms are cast as unstable and morally weak, which is strange – because the people I spoke to struck me as being unusually courageous. Many of us grit our teeth and struggle on through a bad relationship, or numb ourselves to our own unhappiness, because we are afraid of being alone. People who marry multiple times aren’t willing to remain in a bad relationship for the sake of propriety. They seem less afraid to change and to admit defeat than the rest of us are.The serial spouses I interviewed also seemed unusually hopeful. Recovering from any breakup requires a certain amount of resilience. You put yourself back together and try to believe in love all over again. But buying a wedding dress, sending out invitations and saying “I do” in front of everyone you know – for the fifth or sixth time – requires an extraordinary amount of hope. Many of the people who share their experiences below are currently happily married – so what follows is really a series of offbeat, non‑traditional love stories. They are a testament to the value of the pursuit of love, rather than its attainment – and a reminder that a wedding is never really a happy ending. It’s only a beginning.‘My sixth and cheapest wedding was happier than all the others put together’View image in fullscreenLacey and Jonathan.Photograph: Jeremy M Lange/The GuardianLacey, 39 (married six times)Fairytale weddings do not always make for good marriages. I’ve been married six times and that is one thing I have had to learn the hard way. I’ve done his’n’hers matching wedding outfits. I’ve done exotic-location weddings. I’ve done the big-white-dress wedding, three times. Sometimes I think I actually used the wedding planning as a way of escaping from the fact that I was marrying the wrong person.The first time I got married I was only 18, and I wore the same white dress I’d put on six weeks earlier for my high-school graduation. I knew even on our wedding day that I didn’t truly love my husband. I’m almost certain he knew he didn’t truly love me. But I was thrilled by the idea of having a husband and being someone’s wife. I have never been religious, but I had this ingrained idea that the marriage ceremony would magically bind us together. I had spent my childhood feeling lonely, and I was frightened of remaining alone.Of course, it didn’t work out like I’d dreamed. Husband No 1 cheated on me, which I truly don’t blame him for – considering he was 20 years old and we were both clueless kids. My mother went to high school with a top divorce attorney, so I ended up getting a payout. That attorney taught me a lesson that stood me in good stead for all my subsequent divorces: the partner who files for divorce first wins the case. It means you have your ducks in a row and you’ve snapped up the best attorney. That sounds a little heartless, but you can’t get around the fact that, in America, marriage is unavoidably about money.By my 27th birthday, I had been married and divorced three times and I was engaged again. My fourth husband’s family paid for that wedding, which was my biggest yet. It was on a yacht and it cost $40,000. I was wearing a gorgeous corset-backed dress with a mermaid skirt, but I remember feeling sick because I knew that even though my husband and I looked picture-perfect we were already falling apart. It had become clear that I didn’t really know him, and he was growing colder and more withdrawn, but I felt like I had to go through with the marriage because the invitations had been sent out, and people were sending me gifts. I filed for divorce after only a year.By the time I was organising my fifth wedding my parents were getting tired of my constant marriages. They just said, “OK, you’re getting married again. We’re not going to come to this one.” That marriage still wasn’t a success, but at least the wedding day was more low‑key. It was a courthouse ceremony, with only his parents in attendance. I was pregnant, which was the only reason I went through with it. I had grown up over the course of my previous four marriages. I no longer had any faith that the ceremony was going to transform us into a perfect couple – but I wanted to at least give our kid a chance at a traditional mother-father setup. That marriage lasted less than a year.At 29, I started dating again, but I decided it was time to be brutally honest. I wrote on my dating profile that any boyfriend would have to come second to my daughter, and that I didn’t have much time to spare. I matched with Jonathan, and I remember promising myself that I wasn’t going to put on any kind of front. I think I told him I’d been married five times previously over text, before we even met in person. He reacted with such openness. He had this beautiful, soft expression in his teddy bear-brown eyes, and he listened. Jonathan was so curious about me – which felt amazing, because I’d shown him something true.I married Jonathan one and a half years after our first date, and we both wore jeans and T-shirts. The whole thing cost $120. We bought our rings from Amazon for $20, paid the magistrate $40, and filed the paperwork for $60. It was my sixth and cheapest wedding, and happier than all the others put together. I used to dread the everydayness of being in a couple: the bills and laundry. But even bills and laundry can be kind of wonderful, when you’re with the right person. It just took me six attempts to find him.Jonathan, 44 (married twice)The first thing that struck me about Lacey is that she wears her heart on her sleeve. When she told me she had five marriages behind her, I was a little taken aback, but I was more disarmed by her ability to just say something like that to a stranger. She seemed courageous, but also had a vulnerability to her. She had no wall up whatsoever, and she wasn’t interested in playing games. I used to find it difficult to tell the truth all the time, about every little thing that goes through my head, but Lacey makes it feel possible because she started us off that way.I had been married once before, when I was 21. It was a very beautiful, elaborate wedding in an imposing building in Virginia, in the middle of these immaculate grounds, but even when I think about that day now I feel anxious. The richness felt superficial to me. My ex-wife and I were always more like roommates than real lovers. I wanted to escape from my home town, and so did she, and we were marrying to give us both a kind of alibi to present to our respective parents. My ex and I had a Catholic ceremony, and there was a moment in the middle where we both had to light a candle. I tried to light mine about five times but it wouldn’t work. I remember thinking: it’s a sign!When I married Lacey, at 36, there was no fuss. She didn’t even wear a dress. My T-shirt said “I’m her Jack” and hers said “I’m his Sally”, because we’re both massive Nightmare Before Christmas fans. Standing in front of the justice of the peace in T-shirts felt so much more meaningful to me than all the fanfare of my previous wedding, because what we had together was real. I didn’t feel nervous at all. I had this amazing sense of calm.Lacey may have been married five times before she met me, but all five of her marriages add up to about 11 years in total, which is roughly the same length of time as my first marriage. So to my mind we’re even. Sometimes I think about how easy it would have been for Lacey and I to have never met, and it frightens me. We grew up in different states, and if we hadn’t happened to have logged into the same dating site at the same time, I never would have known that she existed. If anything, I feel strangely grateful for her five previous marriages, because they led her to me.‘She is slow and steady with her love, whereas I am an incurable romantic’View image in fullscreenJoseph and Emily.Photograph: Derek Shapton/The GuardianJoseph, 85 (married five times)My friends used to crack jokes about the fact that I was the man who couldn’t stop getting married. I’ve been divorced four times, and there was a perception that there must be something very wrong with me, to have failed to make so many marriages work. I don’t think the comments were entirely fair. There were undoubtedly things wrong with me, but I was a work in progress. I’ve been happily married to my fifth wife, Emily, for decades, and, while I attribute the success of our marriage to the fact that Emily and I are such a good fit, I also think I have age to thank for it. I met Emily when I was 55 and I knew myself in a way you simply can’t at 25.I was 29 when I left my first wife. During our five‑year marriage our life looked like a 1950s vision of the American dream. The problem was that it wasn’t 1950, it was 1968, and the culture was changing. I was working as a cab driver in San Francisco, and I was fascinated by the hippies I saw out on the streets. People were protesting over the brutality of Vietnam, and reeling from the death of Martin Luther King. I didn’t want to live my traditional American life any more. So I became a hippy and joined the movement.My first wife was deeply shocked by the way I wanted to live. We argued about it intensely. Looking back, I see the way I handled that divorce as one of my failures. I wish I had been kinder, but I wanted so badly to remake my life. My second marriage was the polar opposite of my first. My wife and I lived with 40 other hippies in a house with no running water. Politically we were opposed to marriage, and we only went through with it for financial reasons.The marriage lasted for five years, and there were many wonderful things about it – but ultimately we fell apart. Drugs were a part of our lifestyle, and they intensified a propensity I had within me from childhood to feel hard done by. My second wife left me because she couldn’t cope with my anger, and I don’t blame her. I stopped experimenting with drugs, and distanced myself from the hippy lifestyle – but I was in a state of mourning for my second marriage for many years. When I started dating again, my goal was to remarry. Even though I had tried to reject the 1950s values instilled in me by my parents, it was deeply ingrained in me that marriage was the right way to do a long‑term relationship. So I tried again, twice more, between the ages of 43 and 50. My fourth wedding was a big hoopla because my wife-to-be wanted a huge shindig. I think my family’s misgivings about my ability to make a relationship work really peaked when that marriage failed.I met Emily when I was 55, and I asked her to marry me several times in our first years together. She always said no. She is slow and steady with her love, whereas I am an incurable romantic. Finally, out of the blue one day, Emily said she would marry me – and I couldn’t set the date fast enough. Emily and I don’t try to change one another, and I think that is because we met as middle-aged people, rather than as inexperienced 20-year-olds. We celebrate our 30th anniversary next year, so my friends certainly aren’t laughing at me any more.Emily, 76 (married once)I was 46 when I met Joseph, and I had never been married, because to my mind a wedding wasn’t something to aspire to. My mother always told me that if she could do it all over again, she would have remained single. My father was an upright man, but marriage had transformed her life into endless drudgery. I also came of age in the 1970s feminist movement, so it didn’t seem safe to me to emotionally involve myself with a man, and lose myself in a relationship.I had deep relationships in my 20s and 30s, but I also enjoyed the excitement of the sexual revolution. We had the pill. We felt so wonderfully free. But, around the time I met Joseph, I was looking for something more long-term and stable. So I put a little ad in my local paper, seeking a man who was “kind”, “gainfully employed” and “under 6ft tall” – because I didn’t want to have to stretch too much to kiss him. Joseph sent me a letter via the newspaper, and I remember liking his writing style. He also was – and still is – very good-looking. I found out later that Joseph had Xeroxed that very same letter and sent it out to a number of different women who had posted newspaper ads, but by that time he had won me over.It was surprising to me that Joseph had been married four times previously. I would have been less shocked if he had had 1,000 ex-lovers, because exploration of that nature was more familiar to me. The ex-wives seemed weirder, in a way, because they suggested that he believed in marriage – which I did not. But as I heard the full story of every marriage, Joseph’s history began to make more sense to me. He is intensely romantic, whereas I would describe myself as a “careful romantic”. I want to make sure everything is safe before I throw myself in.After a few years I thought: why not? I was convinced by that time that I would be spending my life with him, and I knew it would make him happy. We are deeply affectionate with one another, and cuddle and kiss all the time, even after 29 years together. But, still, falling in love wasn’t a mad, emotional rush for me. I was practical and thoughtful about it. Joseph’s romanticism is offset by my clear-headedness, and it works. We balance one another out.‘All my marriages ended because I underwent some kind of personal change’View image in fullscreenGary and Jan.Photograph: Andri Tambunan/The GuardianJan, 70 (married five times)I ended up getting married five times, a fact that was so shocking to my mother that she simply never mentioned it. My parents never had much money, but they were proud of their morals. I got married for the first time partly because I wanted to escape all that morality. At 18 I ran away to Las Vegas with a boyfriend I had known for five months. I had no money for a dress, so I wore jeans and hiking boots.By the time I turned 34, I had been married three times and divorced twice. I lived in a little town in the foothills of Yosemite, and at one point, all three of my husbands lived within a 10-mile radius. It was an unconventional little community, and we were hippies – but, even in that relaxed environment, I felt ashamed of the way I had racked up multiple marriages. My relationships with all three husbands were meaningful, but I could have simply dated them. I had grown up uncomfortable in my skin, so the moment a man said “I want to marry you” it felt like the ultimate expression of the love I was craving.Perhaps initially, I kept getting remarried because there was a part of me that wanted to appease my parents. They sent me money for my first divorce, because they were so horrified by the news that I was living with a new boyfriend while still married to my first husband. My third wedding was the last my parents attended. I didn’t want to deal with their disapproval, so I didn’t bother to invite them to the fourth and fifth.View image in fullscreenJan with her four previous husbands, in chronological order. Courtesy of JanBy the time my fourth divorce came through, I was 45 and I had become a professor. I’d put myself through college in my 30s waiting tables. I drifted apart from my fourth husband because I had begun to grow out of the insecure girl I had been. All my marriages ended because I underwent some kind of personal change, or we outgrew each other. Sometimes I berate myself for what I did. In hindsight, I was like a little tornado going through these men’s lives. But I’m also glad that I didn’t force myself to stay still.I really didn’t think I would get married for a fifth time. I was teaching, living alone in a beautiful little apartment in Tahoe, and I was happy. But then I met Gary in a bar and I was smitten. I remember the first time he told me he loved me, I just said, “You can’t! You can’t!” I was trying so hard to be rational, for once in my life.My friends and family thought I was heading for another mistake. But Gary and I have been together for 10 years now, so they have to accept it’s working out. In fact, we probably wouldn’t have married at all were it not for the fact that Gary needed to use my medical insurance for a knee operation. I have always felt secure with Gary, so I wasn’t desperate for the affirmation of marriage with him. We moved in together after one week, though – so I wasn’t very practical and rational about that.Gary, 68 (married three times)At first, Jan kept her four previous marriages a secret from me. She was terrified I’d see it as a huge red flag, but it didn’t bother me. I was 60 and I had two ex-wives myself. By the time she let it slip, I was already completely enamoured. I’d met this beautiful woman and we were having all these adventures together. I wasn’t going to let being No 5 change my feelings.Jan really hates it when I call myself No 5. She says it makes her feel like Henry VIII. But having multiple marriages sounds worse than it really is: I’ve been married three times but I’ve only ever been in three serious relationships. The first lasted 10 years, the next 15, and now I’m with Jan. Jan’s marriages have all been quite long, too. If you put it like that, we’re not so bad at marriage.The ceremony itself was very understated. I didn’t feel like saying to everyone I know, “Hey! I’m getting married – again!” I could just imagine the eyerolls from family members. So Jan and I went to Reno, alone. It was actually lovely, because there was a young gay couple ahead of us in line to the courthouse, who were marrying for the first time. Those two women were so full of joy. We asked them to be our witnesses, so some of their first-timer excitement rubbed off on us.We don’t celebrate the day we got married. The anniversary of the day we met has more meaning to us. I think if there’s something we’ve learned, with eight marriages between us, it’s that a wedding certificate is certainly not going to keep you together. It’s the daily interactions that count. I try to tell Jan I love her every day. Jan jokes about us marrying for the sake of my knees, but she doesn’t like it when I make the same joke. She says she wants to feel like I chose her out of all the people in the world. Honestly, I did.‘I still don’t believe in marriage’View image in fullscreenBev and Mike.Photograph: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianBev, 75 (married four times)The first time I walked down the aisle, it was a marriage of convenience. I shared a flat with a friend who was a foreign national during university, and he was in danger of being deported – so I proposed to him. We were married for three years but our relationship was entirely platonic. My boyfriend at the time actually married my flatmate’s Austrian girlfriend on the same day, to keep her in the country. It was a double wedding of convenience. There are two photographs of the four of us standing outside the register office together. At the top of the steps we’re in our “fake” couples, but by the bottom step we’ve swapped and I’m holding my boyfriend’s hand.It was an act of rebellion, I suppose. I grew up in a conservative Jewish community. My own parents couldn’t stand the sight of each other, but they stayed together their entire lives for the sake of propriety. I was determined that the institution of marriage would be absolutely meaningless to me. I wanted to remain in control, and treat marriage like a game.I married my boyfriend a few years later and while I did love him, that was for practical reasons, too. It was at a register office in Cumbria, and the whole thing was done and dusted in 20 minutes. I had a child by then, and my parents were so horrified by the idea of my having a child out of wedlock I decided that, as it meant nothing to me, I might as well placate them. My second husband and I were together for 23 years, and we had two wonderful children, but things deteriorated. He was drinking too much, and we stopped having anything to say to one another. I’d grown up in the painful silence of my parents’ unhappiness and wasn’t prepared to suffer through it in my own marriage, so I filed for divorce.View image in fullscreenBev at her first wedding (on left). Courtesy of BevThere was another problem in my second marriage: I was falling in love with Mike, one of our closest friends. Mike and I would spend Christmases together with our families, and there was always something unspoken between us. I remember one night, New Year’s Eve 1988, when we were alone together in the kitchen. Mike lifted me into his arms to wish me a happy new year. He’s a very tall man, so there’s a solid foot between us. As he set me gently back on the ground, he whispered in my ear, “When we’re 90, we’re going to have a passionate affair.” I remember thinking: do we have to wait until we are 90? But Mike was one of those men who believed in the whole “till death do us part” thing.Single for the first time in my life, at 43, I discovered that I wasn’t a person who can enjoy living alone. I find this hard to admit, because I hadn’t wanted relationships to define my life. The man I really loved – Mike – wasn’t available. So I got married for a third time, on my 50th birthday. That was the closest I ever came to a traditional wedding: there was a cake, and I wore a dress, and I even invited my family. I invited Mike, too, but he sent a bunch of flowers and an excuse about a “work commitment”.I did have deep feelings for my third husband, but we were always doomed to fail. One evening, I met up with Mike, and he told me his wife was leaving him. We spent the night together, and from that moment on we were an item. Twenty-one years later, it is still vibrant and intuitive between us. I married Mike on the beach in Tobago when I was 56. It was a romantic day, but I only really did it for practical reasons. This time it was to placate our accountant, because we would get tax breaks as a married couple.It sounds absurd to say I’ve been married four times but still don’t believe in marriage. It does, however, make sense in my mind: if someone tells me I can save money and pay less tax by getting a marriage certificate, I just ask them where I should sign.Mike, 70 (married twice)I met Bev for the first time when I was a very shy 17-year-old and she was a glamorous older woman of 22. Bev was an exotic creature in County Durham, and every inch the hippy. I never imagined I would have a chance with her – not least because she was spoken for. I was more at ease around Bev when I got a girlfriend, and grew up a bit. We became close friends, and our children grew up together. We became family, in a way. But I never stopped having an inconvenient crush on her.View image in fullscreenBev and Mike on their wedding day 21 years ago. Courtesy of BevMy first marriage wasn’t perfect, but I was determined to make it work for the sake of our children. Politically I didn’t really see the point of marriage, but on a more emotional level the vows did mean a lot to me. I hadn’t been happy with my wife for several years, but I couldn’t bear the idea of upsetting the kids’ childhoods by pulling my family apart. My relationship with Bev had always been flirtatious, but even when I was feeling at my most romantic I didn’t dare hope it could be serious. When I got the invitation to Bev’s third wedding, I felt very sad and I sent my regrets.In the end, my wife left me. When I look back, I realise that prioritising trying to keep my family intact was misguided. I went through a disastrous divorce, anyway, and I don’t think I made anyone in my family happier. I wish I’d just declared my love for Bev 20 years earlier. When we finally got together, it was romantic, but in equal parts terrifying. There had been 30 years of buildup to our first kiss. We decided to keep kissing, over and over again, until it stopped feeling so terrifying and started feeling wonderful.You can’t always get what you want without hurting people. I wish I’d spent less of my life afraid of that hurt.‘I never felt the overwhelming love Ihad seen in films’View image in fullscreenYasminYasmin(married four times)I grew up in a very strict Muslim culture, but I lived in a western country and came of age in the 90s. I spent my teens watching Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Sleepless in Seattle on repeat, so I was completely sheltered, and I knew nothing about boys. But I also longed to fall in love and live out my own movie. Islam plus chick flicks makes for an odd but powerful combination. I think that is partly to blame for the fact that I have been married and divorced four times.In my culture, it is impossible to “date”. Boyfriends simply do not exist. There are only fathers, brothers and husbands. I got married for the first time at 23, after being proposed to by a boy who had never kissed me. But, being intensely romantic, I convinced myself I was in love with him. Shortly after our wedding day, things became strained between us, because when I was alone with him I withdrew into myself. I didn’t realise at the time, but I was experiencing depression. My first husband was a trustworthy and gentle man, but we were both essentially children. He had no idea how to cope with this stranger in his home who was suddenly his wife. One year after our wedding day, he asked for a divorce.In Muslim culture, divorce is not taboo. The Qur’an treats it as something that isn’t ideal, but is nevertheless permitted. Still in the fog of depression, I became engaged again – just eight months after being legally separated – to a man I met through my Islamic studies group. The leader of the group told me that remaining unmarried would cut me off from God, and that as a darker-skinned woman I would be lucky to find another husband, so I said yes to the first man who asked. He was already married, so I was engaged to be his second wife – in some sects of Islam it is usual to have multiple wives. But his first wife objected to our marriage, and he became so overcome by guilt during our wedding that he packed up all of his belongings immediately after the ceremony and left. I spent the night at my grandmother’s home, frozen and mute, and so shocked I was almost unable to process what had happened to me. We never consummated the marriage.I moved back in full-time with my grandmother and tried to start my life again. Despite my continuing struggles with my mental health, I was able to build a career. From an outsider’s perspective, I was a successful and independent person, but I had so little confidence. I had this movie vision of romantic love as a transformative force. I met my third husband through the mosque. Again, I married him without ever having been alone with him. That ended up being my longest marriage; we had children together and a solid, nurturing relationship. But I never felt the overwhelming love I had seen in films.After nine years together, I filed for my third divorce. My husband was becoming increasingly controlling, so it was the right decision. At 40 I got my first-ever boyfriend. We went on dates, and spent time alone, although we stopped short of having sex out of wedlock. He was highly creative in a way that made him different from any other man I had known. I promised my family that I wouldn’t rush into marrying him. My parents hadn’t even attended my second wedding because they disapproved of the way I was jumping from husband to husband. But when my boyfriend proposed after three months I found the prospect of one more shot at the Hollywood ending too hard to resist. Of course, he didn’t turn out to be the man I had built him up to be, either. We divorced after only six months together. I’ve kept that last marriage a secret from work, because it just feels like a blip.I’ve been alone for the last five years. For the most part I’ve lost that longing to find life-changing love, although I sometimes miss the impulsivity of my younger years. My life is more boring now, but I’m also a lot happier. I’m going to try my very best to resist getting married again.Yasmin is a pseudonymExplore more on these topicsMarriageRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s good for your physical and mental health, offers a carbon-free way of getting from A to B, and can often be the quickest and most cost-effective form of transport – particularly if you live in a city.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Once you’re hooked, there are a few bits of kit that will improve your experience immeasurably, whether that’s comfortable clothing to curtail chaffing, or a water bottle to help you hydrate without stopping. In summer, the longer days and generally favourable conditions mean you can forgo additional accessories such asbike lights, mudguards and head-to-toe waterproofs – although they can’t be avoided forever if you become a year-round, all-weather rider.Another bit of good news is that while cycling has a reputation for being an expensive pursuit, it doesn’t have to be, and many of my favourite bits of kit have more affordable price tags.In the almost three decades since I set off stabiliser-free for the first time, I’ve dabbled in all types of cycling – from a teenage fling with BMXing to inner-city commuting and ultra-distance off-road escapades. In that time, I’ve tested all manner of clothing, tools and accessories, pushing them to the limit during races, events, training rides and the daily grind. Here’s my favourite gear that I reach for before setting off on a summer ride.Summer cycling essentialsJerseyAlthough it performs a similar function to a generic sports base layer, a jersey is the first “proper” bit of cycling gear worth investing in because of the additional comfort it offers. Made from a lightweight, breathable fabric, a jersey will wick away moisture from hotspots, while a full-length zip means you can “ventilate” on the go. Three rear pockets store essentials such as food, tools and a phone, and unlike a running or gym top, the cut is slightly longer at the back for extra coverage when riding leant forward.My favourites, which perform well without breaking the bank, are Italian-designed Sportful SRK, which includes an extra zipped compartment for keys; the 100% recycled Rapha Core; the DHB Blok and its women-specific range, Moda; and the sub-£40 Madison Flux, which comes with a lifetime guarantee.View image in fullscreenRapha Core women’s jerseyFrom £55 at RaphaView image in fullscreenSportful men’s SRK jersey£48.75 at SportfulView image in fullscreenDHB Moda women’s short-sleeve jersey 2.0£55 at Sports DirectView image in fullscreenDHB Blok men’s classic short-sleeve jersey£55 at Sports DirectFrom £109.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenMadison Flux men’s short-sleeve jersey£33.99 at Fawkes Cycles£35.99 at Cycle StoreShortsBib shorts might seem like an indulgent (and expensive) purchase, but you get what you pay for – and your nether regions will let it be known if you’ve skimped. Fitted with a saddle-shaped section of foam in the crotch (known as a chamois), the shorts add an extra layer of padding beneath your perineum that keeps the area dry and cushioned on long rides. Just don’t wear underwear, as this can negate the benefits. The straps may make the item resemble a wrestler’s singlet, but they keep the shorts in place more comfortably than a waistband, which can dig in over time. As the male and female anatomy are quite different down there, it’s worth opting for a gender-specific set.Albion’s ABR1 are my go-to for ultra-distance exploits, arriving with handy pockets on each thigh and one at the rear for extra storage. The Gregarius Essential from Q36.5, meanwhile, are soft and supportive against the skin, and breathable too.And for women, “Petrichor Projects’ PP002 offer unbeatable comfort, with a cargo pocket, easy-pee design and sleek aesthetics,” says Katherine Moore, author ofGravel Rides South West England, who also recommends Velocio’s Luxe line for all-day epics. “They’re made from a super-soft, compressive material with a built-in base layer front and lovely raw-finish leg hem. A thicker-style chamois pad is the go-to for longer rides.”View image in fullscreenAlbion ABR1men’s pocket bib shorts£185 at Condor CyclesView image in fullscreenQ36.5Gregarius Essential bib shorts£140 at Q36.5View image in fullscreenPetrichor Projects PP002 women’s bib shorts£169 at Petrichor ProjectsView image in fullscreenVelocio women’s Luxe bib shorts£217 at VelocioUndershortsIf you’d rather cover your modesty with a normal set of shorts, then opt for a pair of undershorts instead. Secured at the waist, rather than the shoulders, this padded set from Endura will soften the sting of any terrain (as I found out when mountain biking in Colorado), while the stretchy mesh fabric minimises the buildup of sweat, even when worn under non-technical clothing.View image in fullscreenEndura men’s padded Clickfast liner shorts£24.99 at Tredz£32.99 at EnduraEndura women’s padded Clickfast liner shorts£21.99 at Merlin Cycles£29.99 at EnduraCapCotton caps were originally designed to protect bare heads from the sun, although today’s peloton professionals will rarely wear one. Since you’re unlikely to be chasing every watt on your commute, though, a cycling cap under your helmet is a good way to shield from the sun or take off the chill on cooler mornings, all while adding a splash of colour to your riding wardrobe. Prendas specialises in vintage cotton caps, with the Mapei design of the 90s and early 00s team one of the loudest around. The Giro d’Italia-inspired cap from the General Classification is a bit more subtle but oozes style.View image in fullscreenMapei retro cotton cycling cap£11.99 at Condor Cycles£18.55 at AmazonView image in fullscreenTour of Italycotton cycling cap£19.95 at the General ClassificationHelmetHelmets are a source of contentious debate, but if you want a model that goes above and beyond the EN1078 European standard (which every cycling helmet sold is required to pass by law), the ARO3 Endurance by Oakley is a good choice. It includes an internal Mips (multi-directional impact protection system) layer, which can move independently of the outer shell in the event of a crash, helping to protect the brain. Its 19 vents keep the air flowing even on the warmest days, and the antimicrobial liner minimises odour, ride after ride.View image in fullscreenOakley AR03 EnduranceMips helmetFrom £78.99 at TredzFrom £73.99 at AmazonSocksAlthough your feet are fairly static when riding a bike, all of those revolutions will soon have you working up a sweat inside your shoes. Any sports sock will do the job, but a cycling-specific pair will be much more comfortable, providing ventilation on the tops of your feet and padded toes to support every pedal stroke. Like caps, socks can enable you to add a splash of personality, and the fluoro finish of Aussie brand Maap’s training sock is sure to get nods of approval at the traffic lights.View image in fullscreenMaap training sock£18 at Cycle Project Store£15 at All4cycling‘The last thing you want is sweaty feet’: the best moisture-wicking underwear, socks and base layersRead moreSunglassesOversized sports sunglasses are a must-have fashion accessory this summer, but if you’re more interested in conquering hills than the catwalk, you should prioritise a set that provides good coverage against sun, rain and unsuspecting insects – as well as ventilation to prevent you from fogging up.Decathlon’s Van Rysel brand is renowned for its premium products, and its RoadR 900 shades can stand up to models from Oakley for a fraction of the cost. This pair comes with a photochromic, UV-filtering nylon lens that automatically adjusts depending on the sun’s intensity, meaning no need to swap between lenses and cover them in grubby fingerprints in the process. The lens has also undergone an oil-repelling treatment that helps rain and road spray run from its surface.View image in fullscreenDecathlon Van Rysel RoadR 900 Perfsunglasses£74.99 at DecathlonInsulated water bottleMost riders will need to drink at least 500ml of fluids an hour when cycling, and even more if it’s hot. You can use any water bottle, but a bidon comes with an easy-to-open valve that allows you to refresh as you ride, so you don’t need to stop to unscrew any lids. The Camelbak Podium is a time-honoured design that can carry up to 710ml, allowing you to ride for longer without running dry, and its insulated version keeps contents cold.View image in fullscreenCamelbak Podium water bottle£9.49 at Tredz£10.99 at HalfordsSports-specific sunscreenRoad cyclists take pride in their tan lines, but protecting your skin is more important than chasing a golden glow. A sports-specific sunscreen will handle sweat better than an everyday cream, and Ultrasun’sSports Geldoes the job without leaving any greasy marks on your clothes. The fast-absorbing gel is easier to apply than a spray, and means you can quickly see whether you’ve covered all your exposed skin before setting off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Far easier to pull off than a pie, but more impressive than a crumble, cobblers are a great way to use a bargain tray of overripe or bruised fruit, should you be lucky to come across such a thing.The fruitView image in fullscreenAmerica’s Test Kitchen peels the fruit, to remove ‘any unpleasantly leathery bits of skin’ from its cobbler. All thumbnail photographs by Felicity Cloake.Peaches, obviously – but peaches in the UK will not usually be as fresh as those in the American south, which means we have to adjust our expectations accordingly. A couple of recipes call explicitly for “ripe but firm” fruit, which does not mean those cannonballs sold as ready-to-eat in many British retailers; I speak from bitter experience when I assure you that a peach that is crunchy when raw will still be al dente once baked. Though not squashy, the fruit ought to give a little under your fingertips (a good fruit vendor should be happy to pick some out for you, though sadly our supermarkets do not offer that service, so you’ll have to take it on trust or do some discreet andgentlesqueezing).That said, even in the south, there’s a delightfully bitchy hierarchy of peaches, with Villas instructing the reader ofThe Glory of Southern Cookingto “forget most of what you’ve heard about Georgia peaches. Yes, Georgia peaches are certainly far superior to the pulpy, bitter peaches they grow in California, but where I go for sweet peach perfection is to the South Carolina Piedmont region, intersected by Interstate 77 and, more specifically, to the Peach Tree and other orchards in and around Filbert. Peach fanatics from as far away as Pennsylvania and Kentucky flock to the Peach Tree every summer to see and smell and taste the luscious early belles, white ladies, lorings and indian red clings”. Meanwhile, I head to the greengrocers.Controversially, I will not be peeling the fruit. Everyone peels the fruit, I know, because they seem to have an aversion to what America’s Test Kitchen (ATK) terms“any unpleasantly leatherybits of skin”, but, as with apples, tomatoes and even potatoes, I happen to like a bit of chew – a skinless peach feels like a tinned peach to me, and though tinned peaches have their place (a hotel breakfast buffet), it’s not what I’m after here. Plus, a ripe peach is a pain to peel. (I can almost hear the southerners murderously murmuring: “Bless her heart”).The juicesRipe peaches are a very wet fruit, which proves a problem in recipes such as the one inMcDonald’s bookDeep South, where they’re used raw – this proves the first clue to perhaps the most important lesson I learn about peach cobbler: the dish should always be placed on a rimmed baking sheet, because if it can bubble over, you can bet your bottom dollar it will. Cutting the fruit into chunky wedges, as he suggests, rather than slices, is a good start; too thin, and they have a tendency to dissolve into perfumed mush in the oven.View image in fullscreenEmily Meggett’s peach cobbler swaps the top crust in favour of a buttery sponge batter.Like ATK , McDonald uses cornflour to thicken those juices (Edna Lewis prefers plain flour) but, to my mind, more muscular action is required to stem the tide. While this shouldn’t be a dry dish, equally, too much juice will make the topping soggy.Chef Joe Randall’s recipe in the book he co-authored with Toni Tipton-Martin, A Taste of Heritage, marinates his peaches with sugar, flour and spices to draw out the juices, then simmers them until those juices start to thicken – yet with similarly liquid results. I’m beginning to suspect that ATK’s claim that “most of the juices are not released until the peaches are almost fully cooked” is correct.My multi-prong solution, like ATK’s, is to drain off some of the liquid produced by mixing peaches with sugar and leaving them to sit, then to thicken that with cornflour and to pre-bake the fruit before adding the topping, to give that liquid more time to evaporate, as well as to leave enough gaps in said topping to encourage further evaporation.The flavouringEveryone uses sugar, naturally, and some in quantities that are a little too much for those not weaned on sweet tea. Randall’s dark brown sugar feels a little too treacly for this fresh fruit, but I like the idea of a lighter brown sugar with peaches – it just feels apt somehow. Almost everyone adds butter to their filling – I want to say it’s too much, but I’m afraid it does help make the syrup deliciously rich, so omit it at your own risk.View image in fullscreenBrad McDonald mixes his peaches with raspberries, ‘which, personally, I don’t care for when cooked’.Lewis, or Miss Lewis as she was properly called and is always referred to in her book with Scott Peacock, The Gift of Southern Cooking, also adds a pinch of salt, which, like the lemon juice in Meggett’s, Randall’s and the ATK recipes, helps to make the peaches taste … peachier somehow. If you happen to have some knocking around, I’d also highly recommend a dash of the almond essence in Villas’ recipe – not so much as to make the filling taste nutty, but just enough to enhance the flavour of the almond’s close cousin, the peach.McDonald mixes the peaches with raspberries – which, personally, I don’t care for when cooked (they break down completely in the peach juice, but if you like the idea, stick a handful in). She also adds vanilla and cinnamon, which we all like less than Miss Lewis and Randall’s nutmeg; peaches and sugar are sweet enough, after all, without enhancing that with cloyingly sweet spices. Randall’s ground cloves prove a surprise hit, but one spice feels like quite enough in a place where peaches hardly grow on trees.The toppingI thought I knew what a cobbler was until I started the research for this dish and found myself rolling out a lovely, delicately crumbly pastry for Randall’s double-crust version. Peacock helpfully explains that “in the US south, the term ‘cobbler’ is applied to a host of baked fruit desserts. To Miss Lewis, ‘cobbler’ meant a kind of deep-dish pie with fruit baked between a bottom and top layer of pastry … to other southern bakers, a cobbler might have only a top pastry crust. In Alabama, we called anything a cobbler that had fruit covered by a baked topping.” (He goes on to reminisce about “one of the more distinctive cobblers of my childhood”, from a local barbecue joint, that involved “canned peaches covered with a box of Duncan Hines Yellow Cake mix – dry – with melted butter poured over the top”.)View image in fullscreenJoe Randall’s ‘dark brown sugar feels a little too treacly for this fresh fruit’.The most distinctive cobbler I trycomes from Meggett’s book, Gullah Geechee Home Cooking, co-authored with Kayla Stewart and Trelani Michelle, on the Lowcountry cuisine of coastal South Carolina, and particularly her lifelong home, Edisto Island. Instead of a top crust, the dish is filled with a buttery sponge batter topped with peaches – it’s light, fluffy and very quick to make, though, good as all the recipes are, I like the scone-like toppings in McDonald and the ATK recipes best; if I’m serving up something called a cobbler, I don’t want it to feel like a pie or an upside-down cake, but something distinctively different, as well as emphatically American.Both recipes use fluffy drop biscuits, rather than the flakier rolled kind – for a British audience, these are more like dumplings thanrowies/butteries– which makes sense, because they’re better suited to soaking up juice (and, in keeping with the spirit of the cobbler, much quicker and easier to make). The method is similar to scones, but uses a wetter dough, moistened with McDonald’s tangy buttermilk, which my testers prefer to the more neutral but richer yoghurt in the ATK recipe. But we all agree some raising agent is required; an unleavened dough, though tasty, does have tendency to sit heavy as a stone upon the fruit. Adding it to a filling that’s already hot helps it to cook through in time, and though the biscuit itself shouldn’t be too sweet, in contrast to what lies beneath, a final topping of granulated sugar adds a delightful crunch.The accompanimentsView image in fullscreenEdna Lewis served her peach cobbler with ‘an unusual’ (but very tasty) nutmeg syrup.Miss Lewis served her peach cobbler with “an unusual” (but very tasty) nutmeg syrup, but more common pairings are vanilla ice-cream (McDonald and Randall), whipped cream (ATK) and even, non-canonically, creme fraiche or yoghurt. But ice-cream is, in my opinion, the American dream.(Note that this is good served warm as well as well as hot, but not chilled, because that makes the topping turn a little doughy. You could marinate the peaches in advance, but don’t make the biscuit dough until just before baking.)Perfect peach cobblerPrep10 minMarinate30 min+Cook45 min+Rest15 minServes6About 800g ripe but fairly firm peaches(about 4-5 medium-sized ones)2 tbsp soft light brown or demerara sugar, or white sugar if preferredA pinch of salt15g butter, diced, plus extra for greasing1½ tsp cornflour1 tbsp lemon juice¼tsp almond extract(optional)½ tsp freshly grated nutmegIce-cream, to serveFor the topping100g cold butter175g plain flour2 tbsp caster sugar¼tsp fine salt1 tsp baking powder150ml buttermilk, or 145ml milk mixed with 1 tsp lemon juice or vinegar1 tbsp demerara sugarView image in fullscreenCut the peaches into chunky wedges, scatter with the sugar and salt, then leave to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7, and grease a baking dish just large enough to hold all the fruit in a single layer.View image in fullscreenGrate or dice the 100g butter for the topping and put it in the freezer.

What can I do?You can’t fix him, or anyone else. You have to look after yourself first, and you may want to start by asking if this is a healthy relationshipEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriSun 10 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareI’m15, and in a six-month relationship with my boyfriend who has a very toxic home life.This hasgiven him significant mental health issues.He gets upsetbylittle things,and struggles to move on,catastrophisingsmall disagreements, thinking I hate him and saying he’ll self-harm. He has a really strong sense of self:he hates people being better than himat anything hecares about, and is obsessed with looks.The real issue for meis thatI often feel I’m walking on eggshells: I can’t tell him aboutachievements or he’ll get upset; Isoften any viewpoint I’m worried he won’t like; I can’t tell him he upset me without him getting extremely defensive.I do not want to lose him. He’sreally thoughtful, caring,beautiful and profound. He alwayschecks for consent before doing anything sexual (nothing muchas we’re both underage); he cares for meif I’m upset, gives me advice, makes me feelconfident in myselfand happy.But I’m worriedabout the coming weeks,as I’m goingon holiday and Iknow I’llhave to reassure him I love him every two days, feeling guilty for just having a nice time.I feel so strongly in love, anddon’t want to break up with him.I’d really likesome strategies tohelp him feel better,be less sensitive, and avoid triggers without it being exhausting.It’s never too early or late in life to start asking the right questions and here, as my specialist this week, the UKCP-registered child and adolescent psychotherapist Sara Anton says, the questions you might want to ask are: “What does a healthy relationship looks like? Is this a healthy relationship, and if not why not? If you are looking after your boyfriend’s needs all the time, how can you take care of your needs? And how does it feel to do so much caretaking at this point in your life?”You sound incredibly mature, astute and sensitive, but the flipside is that you will attract people who look to you to fulfil things lacking in themselves. It’s also never too early or late to learn about boundaries.From what you say, this relationship is more intense than is healthy and it’s taking a toll on you. Aspects of it sound coerciveI hear that you are really in love; as Anton points out: “At 15 it’s really usual – and developmentally appropriate [as we have to learn to separate from our parents] – to have these intense relationships.” But, and it is a significant but, this relationship raises concerns for us. No relationship should mean you are radically changing your behaviour – as you are – to appease someone else. I’m sorry for your boyfriend’s home life, the details of which you asked me to withhold, but you are not responsible for his happiness or anyone else’s.“At this age,” says Anton, “you are starting to find out who you are, what you like and don’t like, how to be with others, what your boundaries are, and how to take care of your own emotions. From what you say, this relationship is more intense than is healthy and it’s taking a toll on you. It will be hard to build a sense of who you are as a young person when you are so entwined.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’m sure you’ve covered this in PSHE lessons, but it can be hard to see when this is happening to us. Not being able to share or having to water down good news for fear of him not liking it, him threatening to self-harm, feeling like you’re constantly treading on eggshells: these are not what a healthy relationship is based on.Your boyfriend doesn’t sound like he has a strong sense of self, quite the opposite; it sounds like he’s outsourcing his self-esteem to you. This is not something you can delegate.I would really urge you to talk to an adult you trust. You’ve taken a really big step towards this by writing to me.If you are constantly keeping the peace with your boyfriend, you will get no peace yourself. You can’t fix him, or anyone else. That’s not your job. Your job is to look after yourself first and foremost. That’s not selfish but self-aware and self-protective, and that lesson can never be learned too young.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

The decline is partly due to SUVs becoming a popular choice for people in Britain with many favouring bulkier vehicles with higher seating positions and more boot space.From scenic drives to leaking hoods, four people share their memories of their convertible and why they love them.‘It’s quite an indulgence’View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t get it to be looked at but I get quite a few looks when I’m out,’ says Fiat Barchetta driver Susan Laborde.Photograph: Susan Laborde/Guardian Community“My friend had a 20-year-old Fiat Barchetta for a few years and I had always admired it,” said 80-year-old Susan Laborde. Five years ago, she was given first refusal when her friend wanted to get rid of the car. She never thought about owning a convertible before but it was “so beautiful” she “scraped the money for it” and has never looked back.Laborde, who lives in a village in the south-west of France, loves driving her “little boat” on local trips. “I feel 20 years younger in it. I didn’t get it to be looked at but I get quite a few looks when I’m out,” she says.Her grandchildren call her “cool nanna” but the only person who doesn’t enjoy the car is Laborde’s 82-year-old husband, Max. “He has difficulty climbing out of it now and feels every bump. It’s quite uncomfortable for him.”She has thought about giving it up but the joy she gets from it makes her want to keep it a bit longer. “I love it but I don’t really need it – it’s quite an indulgence. There’s something about driving close to the ground and being close to the earth that makes you feel like you’re flying.”‘It added to the spirit of adventure for us as kids’View image in fullscreenPaul and his siblings in the family’s Sunbeam Rapier in Monmouth. L-R: Helen, Roger, Paul (wearing the cap) and Phil.Photograph: Paul Nicholls/Guardian CommunityFor Paul Nickells in Appleby, Cumbria, convertible cars were an “indelible” part of his childhood. Growing up in Monmouth in south Wales with his parents and three siblings, the family didn’t need a car day-to-day but every summer Nickells’s dad would take out his 1961 Hillman Minx convertible for their annual family camping holiday.“All six of us would be crammed in, three in the front and three in the back, and the boot would be roped down,” said Nickells, who is a retired IT consultant in his 60s. “Travelling to Tenby or the Gower, there were many breakdowns on these holidays and the Welsh weather meant the roof wasn’t down very often, but being in a convertible added to the spirit of adventure for us young kids.”One of his favourite memories was a three-week camping holiday in the Lake District in their Sunbeam Rapier. “The roof remained up most of the time but the car was spectacularly unreliable – we got to one campsite so late we had to pitch the tent using its headlights.”Despite this, Nickells and his siblings feel these experiences fostered a love of the great outdoors and he and his two brothers still own and love their convertibles. “My sister has seen sense but the Sunbeam still remains in the family.”‘Even when it’s raining, I’ll still drive with the top down wearing a scarf and a big hat’View image in fullscreenJasmine, when she was 19, with her grandma in her Triumph Spitfire.Photograph: Jasmine/Guardian Community“My first car was a red Triumph Spitfire which was older than me,” said Jasmine, who is in her 40s and works as a barrister. She bought it when she was 19 and at university and enjoyed driving it with the “tattered roof” down and “jumping in and out, Dukes of Hazzard style”.Most of the time, Jasmine has enjoyed driving convertibles but had one near-miss experience in Belgium. “We were following a very large and slow agricultural vehicle and as it turned right into a lane there was a twang and scrape along our car. The large vehicle had caught a metal cable suspended high above the lane, broken it and it rebounded over the top of our car. Fortunately we had just put the roof up!”Living in London, she still enjoys open-top driving and for the last nine years has had an Audi TT. “I adore it because it’s so much fun. Like the Spitfire it has a huge boot, but unlike the Spitfire it can go faster than 50mph.“There’s a feeling of freedom. It’s not great on a motorway but you can hear the birds and it puts a smile on your face. Even when it’s raining, I’ll still drive with the top down wearing a scarf and a big hat. If you scoot down lower the rain just blows over the top.”‘It’s about taking away the frame of the car and being in your surroundings’View image in fullscreenMartin with his uncle Colin in the 1967 MGB roadster.Photograph: Martin Hopley/Guardian CommunityMartin Hopley, 65, has always had an interest in classic cars, buying them and doing them up, and it was no different when he went to a car show near Carmarthen in 1991 and saw a 1967 MGB roadster for sale. “I spent about 12-18 months taking it down to its bare bones and getting it looking nice,” said the retired psychiatric nurse from Hopley, Gainsborough. “I used it for a few years before selling it to put money towards a house move. I miss it quite a lot.”One of Hopley’s favourite memories was spending a “glorious” summer’s afternoon touring the back roads of the Black Mountains with his uncle, Colin. “There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and it was hot enough to drive in a T-shirt. The roads were empty and quiet and the views were stunning. We got a bit lost but it added to the day.”Colin was an engineer who worked abroad. “He had more money than we ever had as our family were all coalminers, so he always treated us growing up,” says Hopley. Colin retired in the 90s and was diagnosed with colon cancer. “He died recently after a long and torturous fight and the photo from that day reminds me of him and is a treasured memory.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They are not all fake, but in among the real Rovers are some faux furry friends.The main scam involves advertising a pet that doesn’t exist. You pay the deposit – maybe after a conversation with the “seller” or even a video call – and then nothing. You may have been given details of a collection point, but if you turn up, you will be disappointed.Kate Margolis, from the Cotswolds, England, was scammed when she was looking for a golden retriever puppy.Fake savings ads: ‘One of the most sophisticated scams we have seen’Read more“I didn’t know much at the time, so I simply Googled ‘golden retriever breeder’ and found what looked like a really polished website, full of glowing testimonials, professional-looking photos, and even what seemed like credentials and assurances around licensing,” she says.“I filled out a form on the site, and the breeder called me almost immediately. They sounded knowledgable and walked me through the whole process using all the right terminology, which I didn’t understand at the time, but it helped build trust. They told me the litter was due at Christmas and the puppies would be ready to collect in February, but I’d need to put down a deposit to reserve one.”View image in fullscreenA reverse-search shows this photograph from a puppy sale site appears in various other places online.Photograph: FacebookShe paid £500 by bank transfer, then the seller went quiet. “When I eventually chased them, they told me the puppy I had reserved had ‘eaten plastic and died’. After that, they vanished. I was left with no puppy, no answers and no refund,” she says.“Since then, I discovered my story’s not unusual … scammers create fake listings with stolen puppy photos, make up heart-tugging backstories, and use every trick in the book to get you to send money fast.”Margolis has since set up an app calledPetproov, which UK sellers and buyers can use to verify ID and paperwork.What the scam looks likeThe advert appears genuine – there’s a description of the animal and a photo. The seller may say that there is only one of a litter of pups left, to make you feel like you need to act urgently.You may be supplied with all of the answers to your questions, and may even get to “meet” the animal online in a video call. When the time to pay comes, you will be asked to do so with a bank transfer.What to doUse reputable adoption/rehoming charities and breeders – in the UK the Kennel Club has ended its Approved Breeder programme, so you will need to do your own research.View image in fullscreenLabrador retriever puppies are an adorable, and popular pet, hence the scams.Photograph: Juniors Bildarchiv GmbH/AlamyAsk lots of questions.In the UK, the Kennel Club has lots of informationabout what to ask and what paperwork you should be able to see. So doesthe RSPCA– it says a good breeder should be happy to complete aPuppy Contractgiving full details of the animal you are buying.Check if the photo has been used before. Scammers often steal pictures from other websites to use in their adverts, and a reverse image search on Google will reveal if your prospective pooch’s portrait has been used elsewhere.Arrange to visit the puppy in person and with its mother before you commit to anything. Do not be panicked into paying in order to secure a visit.“Phrases like ‘Can you pay now to hold the puppy?’ are a common red flag,” says Margolis. “Trust your instincts. If something feels off, it probably is.”Ask for ID and check it, says Margolis. “A legit breeder should be happy to show ID, vet records, and proof that the pup has been microchipped,” she says.Explore more on these topicsMoneyScam watchConsumer affairsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I was overwhelmed by complex public ferry timetables to dozens of places ending in the letter “ö” (the Swedish word for island) and uninterested in pricey cruise boats packed with tour groups.Then a former flatmate recommended Nynäshamn, which is on the mainland but embodies much of the nature and spirit of Stockholm’s archipelago. It’s home to a tasteful waterfront of colourfully painted bars and restaurants and a harbour packed with boats every summer, from simple dinghies to luxury yachts. Beyond, you can look across a clean, calm stretch of Baltic Sea, towards the island of Bedarön, flanked by pine trees and a smattering of dark red detached houses.View image in fullscreenMention Nynäshamn to Stockholmers and most will probably describe it as the port you pass through to catch the four-hour ferry to Gotland – Sweden’s largest island – or an overnight cruise to Gdańsk in Poland. But for international tourists (or new Swedish residents, as I was), it is an entry-level coastal destination where you can get a taste of the city’s island life without the complex logistics.Nynäshamn is on the commuter rail line from central Stockholm, and reachable in an hour. A one-way journey costs 43 kroner (£3.30), or it’s free if you have a valid monthly or weekly pass for the capital’s public transport system. For a little more adventure, it takes a further 30 minutes to reach Nåttarö, the closest island accessible by a public ferry service (£8 each way).View image in fullscreenNynäshamn’s pleasures are just an hour by train from Stockholm.Photograph: Zoonar/AlamyMy first destination in Nynäshamn is Trehörningen,an island suburb accessible by bridge, and just a 30-minute stroll from the train station. The route takes in a mishmash of glassy new-build apartments, low-rise 1960s rent-controlled flats and mansions with manicured gardens. Nynäshamn doesn’t have the swagger of swankier seaside towns in the region, such as Sandhamn or Saltsjöbaden, but it offers a slice of real-life small town Sweden far removed from the well-trodden tourist itineraries that typically lead to Stockholm’s medieval Old Town or isolated rural retreats.“It’s very good for my health,” says Hans “Hasse” Larsson, a smiley 73-year-old former truck driver who moved to Nynäshamn from Stockholm 16 years ago. He enjoys the clean air and quiet lifestyle, and describes a stronger sense of community compared with the somewhat stiffer Swedish capital. “Even if you don’t know people very well, you’ll say ‘hej’!” he laughs.Sweden isn’t a budget destination, but thanks to a favourable exchange rate, prices aren’t extortionateSweden isn’t a budget destination, but thanks to a favourable exchange rate, prices aren’t extortionate compared with those in popular British seaside destinations I’ve visited, such as Brighton or St Ives. On Trehörningen island, it costs from just over £100 a night to rent a compact wooden cottage for two fromOskarsgatan 12 B&B. A breakfast buffet and spa entry package at the nearbyNynäs Havsbad hotelworks out at around £45. The spa’s pavilion is a reconstruction of an art nouveau-inspired resort built in 1906, complete with an outdoor hot tub, a sauna and panoramic views. The hotel complex includes original buildings from the early 20th century, when it was a base for sailors during the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games.From here, it’s a short walk to Strandvägen, a French riviera-inspired waterfront road built for spectators of sailing. As locals will proudly tell you, it is the only place in the Stockholm archipelago region where you can see the horizon from the mainland. The scenic route winds towards Lövhagen, a wooded area offering shady trails and picnic tables. There are rocky swimming coves too – although, with average outdoor temperatures of 18C in July and August, the chilly waters won’t be to everyone’s taste.View image in fullscreenThe spa pavilion of the Nynäs Havsbad hotel is a reconstruction of a 1906 art nouveau-inspired resortFor walkers, Nynäshamn is also a gateway toSörmlandsleden, a system of hiking trails covering around 620 miles in total and clearly marked with orange arrows and painted tree markers. Section 5:1 from Nynäshamn passes through mossy forests and grassy farmland to the village of Osmö, where you can catch a train back to Nynäshamn or continue another nine miles to Hemfosa, snaking past Lake Muskan’s glistening waters.Back at Nynäshamn’s main harbour, the restaurants are filling up with tourists hungry for lunch. The most famous spot isNynäs Rökeri, a smokehouse dating back almost 40 years, where a platter of smoked salmon, seafood and potato salad costs less than £20. The adjacent delicatessen stocks fresh fish and classic Swedish treats, from cheesyvästerbottenpie to crispbreads and lingonberry jam. A nearby courtyard is shared with customers visiting the ice-cream storeLejonet & Björnen, a small cafe and a gift shop.The sweet smell of cinnamon wafts in the air and I spot the familiar logo ofSkeppsbro Bageri, an award-winning Stockholm bakery that has a food truck parked on the waterfront, packed with fresh bread, buns and pastries. “I like it here,” says Emelie Elison, the 24-year-old student who is working in the van for her third summer in a row. “There are a lot of people and there’s always something happening.”View image in fullscreenEmelie Elison in the Skeppsbro bakery truck.Photograph: Maddy SavageSweden’s cities empty out in July, as locals flock to the coast to spend the summer in wooden holiday cottages. There are more than 600,000 of these holiday homes, known asfritidshus, which are often passed down through generations; almost half of children with at least one Swedish parent have access to one. They also have plenty of time to enjoy them – most Swedish employees are entitled to four consecutive weeks off each summer.After a grey morning, the sun comes out as I join the ferry queue for Nåttarö. Many around me are armed with bags of groceries, backpacks and even suitcases, intending to stay at least a week. But one sporty-looking couple, carrying only tiny running backpacks, tell me they are fellow day-trippers from Stockholm, planning to run a six-mile loop oftheStockholm Archipelago Trail, a newly marked hiking and trail-running route stretching 167 miles across 20 islands.Most tourists visiting Nåttarö take things at a slower pace. It’s a small, car-free island with just one convenience store and two restaurantsMost tourists visiting Nåttarö take things at a slower pace. It’s a small, car-free island with one simple convenience store and two restaurants by the harbour. The main draws are the pine-lined walking trails, rocky clifftops and sandy beaches. There are50 wooden cabins for hire(sleeping up to six people, £90 a night). The campsite is priced at less than £5 a night, including access to pristine showers, compost toilets and dishwashing facilities. Wild camping is allowed too, thanks toallemansrätten,Sweden’s right to roam policy.Where Swedes holiday in Sweden: five locals’ favouritesRead moreI take a 1¼-mile trail to Skarsand, a small beach in the north-east of the island. I have fond memories of celebrating a friend’s 40th birthday here a couple of years ago, when we camped with friends and their kids, cooking dinner on the beach’s public grill. Today, despite being peak holiday season, I have it all to myself, save for some passing hikers.The sunny afternoon passes quickly, and a couple of hours later I’m back on the ferry for Nynäshamn. The Stockholm pair have made it too, having successfully completed their run. They are eagerly awaiting a pizza reward atMaggan’s, another popular restaurant in Nynäshamn’s harbour, and tell me they’ve squeezed clean T-shirts into their backpacks to change into. I’m planning a sunny evening drink on the waterfront too. Tomorrow I’ll be at my desk, catching up on emails – and researching my next coastal adventure.Explore more on these topicsSweden holidaysStockholm holidaysScandinavia holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The full quote is: “Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, but the highest form of intelligence.”FfesterrSarcasm is quite complex and can facilitate exceptional sophistication in humour.

Lily Phillips (notthatone, she assures us, getting good mileage from her porn star namesake) thought she was well informed. She’d gone through a long process of IVF to get there, attended NCT classes, and, when labour started, she was ready for the if not serene then empowering birthing experience and magical moment of immediate love that would follow.Instead, she discovered that “birth is barbaric and early motherhood is brutal”. Yet even her NCT WhatsApp group, where she turned after a harrowing hospital experience, requested “no negative birth stories, please”. Crying does a lot to redress the balance and cuts through the “toxic positivity” surrounding childbirth that left Phillips feeling alone.Phillips is an assured yet irreverent host, breezing through anecdotes of medical examinations, unspeakable pain, and struggles to have her concerns acknowledged by those looking after her. She takes us to the depths of her three-day labour with amusing vignettes of arrogant consultants and undignified poos, and the “hell” of sleep deprivation that descended into postnatal depression. Most of all, she tells us, there was anger.We feel the righteousness of that, yet Phillips also withholds the raw emotion. She keeps it light, cushioning pain with exasperation that any of this has been normalised. Some of the routines stick to documenting her experience rather than wringing out their full comic potential, and interesting questions aboutwhythe expectations from Instagram and antenatal classes don’t match most women’s reality are raised but not probed.She’s not the only show at this festival to note the persisting gender gap in parenting within heterosexual relationships, but she does it with aplomb. Despite a couple’s best intentions, “the baby doesn’t give a shit about him”, she quips – to the newborn, she’s Beyoncé, he’s Alan Titchmarsh.Phillips says she never wanted to write a show about her baby, but audiences will be glad she did.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 12 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)FestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, who co-founded Sentebale alongside Harry in honour of Diana, Princess of Wales, also stepped down as patron.It has been suggested by allies close to Harry that he is keen to “continue to support the children ofLesothoand Botswana” and that he is examining his options over the nature of that support.A source close to the prince told the Telegraph: “He may well choose to just support existing charities operating in the same space in the region or he may choose to set up something new completely.”On Sunday, Harry’s official spokesperson said the prince remained “absolutely committed to continuing the work he started, supporting the children and young people of Lesotho and Botswana, nearly 20 years ago”.The spokesperson added: “In what form that support takes – no decisions have been made. All options remain on the table; whether that be starting a new charity or working to support pre-existing charities operating in the same sector in the region.”Earlier this week, a source said the row had been “emotionally absolutely devastating” for the prince, and described Chandauka’s comments as “nothing short of a hostile takeover”.The Charity Commission, which cannot investigate individual allegations of bullying, said it found no evidence of systemic bullying or harassment at the charity, including misogyny or misogynoir, but acknowledged “the strong perception of ill treatment” felt by some involved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pace accelerated during the late 2010s and there are now about 450,000 troops.North Korea is believed to have an active-duty military of about 1.2 million, according to the latest estimate by the defence ministry in 2022.The population of 20-year-old men in South Korea declined between 2019 and 2025 by 30% to 230,000, according to government data. Twenty is the age when most men who pass a physical exam enlist for military service.South Korea is one of the world’s fastest ageing societies and has the lowest fertility rate in the world at 0.75 in 2024, which signifies the average number of babies a woman is expected to have during her reproductive life.Its population, which hit a peak of 51.8 million in 2020, is expected to shrink to 36.2 million by 2072, according to a government projection.The country’s armed forces have cited improved capabilities as a key reason for shortening service periods, made possible by a military alliance with the US and the development of a defence industry that has become a big exporter of arms.Able-bodied men served 36 months in 1953 when the Korean war ended in an armistice.South Korea’s defence budget, at more than 61tn won (£33bn) in 2025, is larger than the estimated size of the North’s economy.Still, the country’s military is 50,000 troops short of the number deemed adequate for maintaining defence readiness, the ministry said. About 21,000 of the shortfall is in the non-commissioned officer ranks, it said.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificNorth KoreaPopulationnewsShareReuse this content"

The South Korean military said the North stopped its broadcasts in June too.A week ago,South Korea then began dismantling its own speakers, which blast a mix of world news and information about democratic and capitalist society alongside K-pop music. The sound is believed to travel more than 20km (12.4 miles) into North Korea.Previously, South Korean border residents had complained that North Korean speakers blasted irritating sounds, including howling animals and pounding gongs, in a tit-for-tat response to South Korean propaganda broadcasts.North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong-un, didn’t immediately confirm it was taking down its speakers.South Korea’s previous conservative government resumed daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year, following a years-long pause, in retaliation for North Korea flying rubbish-filled balloons toward the South.President Lee has taken further measures to improve ties with Pyongyang, urging civic groups to suspend distribution of leaflets criticising the North, and delaying some annual joint military drills with the US taking place in the coming weeks as part of the Ulchi Freedom Shield exercises.The two Koreas remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean war ended only in a truce, and relations have deteriorated in the past few years.With Reuters and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsNorth KoreaSouth KoreaLee Jae MyungAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

I think you would do it, at least what we’re doing, probably maybe not as efficiently and as precisely as we’re doing it.”The Liberal senator Dave Sharma, a former Australian ambassador to Israel, said the issue of recognising Palestine should be “quite separate” to growing global outrage about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, raising concerns about Australia making such a move.“I think what has happened as a result of many nations making these moves towards recognition is it’s strengthened Hamas’s international position, it’s made Hamas less likely to reach a ceasefire,” Sharma claimed on Radio National.“It’s made Hamas be able to portray itself as making political progress because of its military actions, and that is actually pushing back the resolution of this conflict, which I think has been a deeply unfortunate consequence, which is why I think those two issues should not be linked.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsIsraelPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

Three of the nine voted in favour of a cut.Inflation is down but prices remain high: when will the cost-of-living crisis end?Read moreThe majority, however, did not see the need to rush rate cuts and wanted to see confirmation that inflation was tracking as expected through the three months to June.That confirmation duly came, with the latest quarterly consumer price report showing inflation sinking to as low as 2.1% – at the bottom of the bank’s 2% to 3% target range – while the RBA officials’ preferred underlying measure of price growth also fell, to 2.7%.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAndrew Hauser, the deputy governor, has since described the inflation figures as “very welcome”.Given these developments, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, Phil O’Donaghoe, said he expected the monetary policy board’s decision on Tuesday would be a unanimous vote in favour of a cut.If the RBA does cut rates for the third time this year, then homeowners with a variable mortgage should not be paying interest of more than 5.5%, said Sally Tindall, the data insights director at Canstar, an online comparison site.“In fact, if the majority of banks pass the cut on in full, which they should absolutely do, then there should be over 30 lenders offering at least one variable rate under 5.25%, while CBA and Westpac’s lowest rates could hit 5.34%,” Tindall said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He could not comment on the man’s background ahead of further investigations, he said.In January, a 40-year-old Hungarian man survived clinging to a German high-speed train for 32km, likewise after it set off before he had finished a cigarette.Explore more on these topicsAustriaRail transportEuropeSmokingnewsShareReuse this content"

Two others died after a Russian drone struck their car in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to the regional governor.On Saturday night, European leaders issued a coordinated statement that said the “path to peace” in Ukraine could not be decided without Kyiv. Welcoming Trump’s attempts to end the war, leaders from the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland and Finland, along with the president of the European Commission,Ursula von der Leyen, emphasised that negotiations could only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities.It added: “Only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed.”MapOn Sunday, Zelenskyy welcomed the support, saying on X: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people today for the sake of peace in Ukraine, which is defending the vital security interests of our European nations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putin appears to have made no major concessions during the three-hour Kremlin meeting, and in return was rewarded not with debilitating sanctions but with aninvitation to meet Trump in Alaska. The offer to thrash out a Ukrainian peace deal at a bilateral summit with Trump represents exactly the sort of great-power deal-making Putin has always craved. It will be his first trip to the US since 2007, with the exception of visits to the UN.Exactly how the Alaska summit will look is still unclear, with a particularly Trumpian kind of confusion and chaos accompanying its announcement. Kyiv, European capitals and even Trump’s own staff have been trying to understand what exactly was agreed in the Kremlin.The first announcements from the White House suggested Putin would meet Trump, followed by a three-way meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy. This was swiftly denied by Putin. As he put it, “we are still far from creating the conditions” for a meeting with Zelenskyy. An aide denied that the Russian side had ever agreed to a three-way meeting.A White House source told the New York Post on Thursday that if Putin did not agree to meet Zelenskyy, the meeting with Trump would not go ahead. But a few hours later, Trump denied that: he was happy to meet Putin anyway. The back-and-forth gave the distinct impression, not for the first time, that in the relationship between Trump and Putin, it is the Russian president who calls the shots.View image in fullscreenUkraine has worked hard to reverse the damage from the notorious meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump and JD Vance in the Oval Office in February.Photograph: Mystyslav Chernov/APSome administration officials later briefed US media outlets that they may invite Zelenskyy anyway, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a Sunday interview he “hopes and assumes” that Zelenskyy will take part. For now, this does not seem likely. A senior White House official told NBC that Trump was “open” to a trilateral summit, but was “focusing on planning the bilateral meeting requested by president Putin”.As worrying for Kyiv as the planned format of the talks is the apparent Russian deal now on the table. The plan, as it has been reported after filtering through the Trump administration and then to European capitals, is that the Ukrainian army should unilaterally withdraw from the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk it still controls, which would presumably include the fortified military stronghold of Kramatorsk. In exchange, the Kremlin would agree to freeze the lines in other places.“Ukrainians will not give their land to occupiers,” Zelenskyy said over the weekend, adding that handing over land to Russia would violate the Ukrainian constitution. He said any deal done withoutUkrainewas destined to be “stillborn”.Zelenskyy’s public posture that Ukraine will never cede land is true up to a point. Kyiv is unlikely to renounce legal claims to its own territory, but the Ukrainian elite and much of Ukrainian society is increasingly ready for a deal that would recognise Russian de facto control, perhaps for a set period of time, in exchange for ending the fighting.The main problem with such a deal has always been what kind of guarantees Ukraine would receive that Russia would not simply use a ceasefire as time to regroup before attacking again. Brief discussions earlier this year about a European peacekeeping force to police a ceasefire were quickly scaled back to a “reassurance force” stationed far from the frontlines. Ukrainians would therefore have not much to rely on but Putin’s word, which they have learned from experience not to trust.Even still, there is a significant camp in the Ukrainian political and military elite who believe that, after more than three years of war, the situation has become so dire that the country is obliged to take such a deal, simply to allow for a pause in the fighting.The problem for Kyiv is the deal Putin apparently pitched to Witkoff is significantly worse than simply freezing the lines. “As things stand, Ukraine and Europe are on the verge of being confronted with exactly the kind of Faustian deal they feared would emerge back in February,” Sam Greene, a professor at King’s College London, wrote on X.Over the past few days, Zelenskyy and his team have been rallying support among European leaders and trying to put together an alternative, European plan. Unfortunately for Kyiv, previous experience suggests Trump is unwilling or unable to exert real pressure on Putin.“If Putin and Trump reach an agreement directly, Europe will be faced with a fait accompli. Kyiv – even more so,” said Roman Alekhin, a Russian war blogger, on Sunday. It is exactly that prospect Ukraine’s leadership will be doing their utmost to prevent in the days before Friday’s summit.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUkraineUS politicsEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It can take Ofgem up to nine months to assess an application.The business is expected to be brandedTeslaElectric and could focus on supplying electricity to consumers who own Tesla products such as cars or batteries.However, it would not work for households on dual-fuel contracts because the company is only applying for an electricity licence.Tesla Energy Ventures, the company’s Manchester-based energy subsidiary, made the application last month, and the move was first reported by the Sunday Telegraph. The application was signed by Andrew Payne, who has worked for Tesla since 2016 and runs the company’s energy business inEurope, with responsibility for a team of 60-plus.The move comes at a time when Tesla’s electric car sales across Europe have been falling. Sales of Teslas in the UK more than halved last month, according to data from the main industry body. Only 987 new Teslas were registered in the UK in July – down almost 60% on the 2,462 registered in July 2024. This means Tesla’s UK market share shrank to 0.7% in July, from 1.67% a year ago.For 2025 to date, Tesla sales in the UK were 7% lower. This is a period during which Musk has faced heavy criticism for his relationship with Donald Trump, which hasnow soured, and his interference in politics in Germany, France and the UK.Tesla has sold many home storage batteries called Powerwalls that can be charged by solar power or from the grid at off-peak times to UK households.

Israel admitted the strike, claiming he was a Hamas militant, a claim that the UN has said is unsubstantiated.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersCalling al-Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists,” Al Jazeera said the attack was “a desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza.”Last month Israeli IDF spokesperson Avichai Adraee shared a video of al-Sharif on X and accused him of being a member of Hamas’ military wing. At the time the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan,called it “an unsubstantiated claim”and a “blatant assault on journalists”.In July, al-Sharif told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) that he lived with the “feeling that I could be bombed and martyred at any moment”.After the attack, the CPJ said it was “appalled” to learn of the journalists’ deaths.“Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” said CPJ regional director Sara Qudah.“Journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable.”The Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate condemned what it described as a “bloody crime” of assassination.In January this year, after a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, al-Sharif drew widespread attention when, during a live broadcast, he removed his body armour while surrounded by dozens of Gaza residents celebrating the temporary halt in hostilities.A few minutes before his death, al-Sharif posted on X: “Breaking: Intense, concentrated Israeli bombardment using ‘fire belts’ is hitting the eastern and southern areas of Gaza City.”In a final message, which Al Jazeera said had been written on 6 April and which was posted to al-Sharif’s X account after his death, the reporter said that he had “lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification.”“Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year and a half,” he continued.The 28-year-old leaves behind a wife and two small children. His father was killed by an Israeli strike on the family home in Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza City in December 2023. At the time al-Sharif said he would continue to report and refused to leave northern Gaza.Another Al Jazeera journalist in Gaza, Hani Mahmoud, said: “This is perhaps the hardest thing I’m reporting about the past 22 months. I’m not far from al-Shifa hospital, just one block away, and I could hear the massive explosion that took place in the past half an hour or so, near al-Shifa hospital.“I could see it when it lit up the sky and, within moments, the news circulated that it was the journalist camp at the main gate of the al-Shifa hospital.”Al-Sharif and his colleagues have been reporting from Gaza since the beginning of the conflict.“It’s important to highlight that this attack is just a week after an Israeli military official directly accused Anas and directly ran a campaign of incitement on Al Jazeera and correspondents on the ground because of their work, because of their relentless reporting on the starvation and the famine and the malnutrition,” Mahmoud added.Israel has killed multiple Al Jazeera journalists and members of their families,including Hossam Shabat, who was killed in March, andIsmail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed in August.Chief correspondent Wael al Dahdouh’s wife, son, daughter and grandsonwere killed in October 2023and he himself was injured in an attack weeks later thatkilled Al Jazeera cameramanSamer Abu Daqqa.Israel, which does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza and whichhas targeted local reporters, has killed 237 journalists since the war started on 7 October 2023, according to Gaza’s government media office. The Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 186 journalists have been killed in the Gaza conflict.

Including adults, the total death toll from malnutrition stands at 217, the ministry says.Ramesh Rajasingham, Ocha’s coordination director, told the security council meeting: “This is no longer a looming hunger crisis – this is starvation, pure and simple.”View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the UN headquarters in New York as the security council held an emergency meeting on the situation in Gaza on Sunday.Photograph: John Lamparski/AFP/Getty ImagesIsrael has imposed a blockade and restrictions on aid entering the territory, but in his press conference Netanyahu said it was “completely false” that his government was pursuing a “starvation policy”. He acknowledged hunger, and problems with the food distribution system run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), but accused the media of “lies” about the scale of the problem.A few hours before he spoke, at least 26 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. They included 15 killed while waiting for aid trucks close to the newly built Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital.‘A deadly scheme’: Palestinians face indiscriminate gunfire at food sitesRead moreA further six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza’s health ministry and Shifa hospital in Gaza City.According to the UN, more than 1,370 Palestinians have been killed since 27 May while seeking food. Netanyahu did not take responsibility for the killings and said, without providing evidence, that “a lot of the firing was done by Hamas”. The Israeli military has repeatedly claimed Hamas is stealing aid, despite the European Commission findingno reportsof this.Except on organised and controlled “embeds” of a few hours alongside Israeli soldiers, international journalists have not been allowed into Gaza since the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, were killed and more than 250 people were taken hostage.Families of the remaining hostages have also criticised the plan, and many were among tens of thousands of people whomarched on Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Avivon Saturday. The plan has also opened a rift between Netanyahu and the IDF leadership, but has not been opposed by the Trump administration, Israel’s most important backer.Israel says Gaza City and nearby areas are home to two remaining Hamas strongholds.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tel Aviv on Saturday demonstrating against the expansion of the war in Gaza.Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images“We have about 70 to 75% of Gaza under Israeli control, military control. But we have two remaining strongholds. These are Gaza City and the central camps in Al Mawasi,” Netanyahu told reporters.“Given Hamas’s refusal to lay down its arms, Israel has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas”, Netanyahu said, adding he expected the operation to begin “fairly quickly”.Hamas says it will not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is established.Netanyahu pushed back against what he called a “global campaign of lies”. “We will win the war, with or without the support of others,” he added.Britain, a close ally of Israel which nonetheless pushed along with others for the emergency meeting, warned in New York that Netanyahu’s plan risked prolonging the conflict.Starmer calls Gaza City takeover plan wrong and urges Israel to reconsiderRead more“It will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This is not a path to resolution. It is a path to more bloodshed,” said British deputy ambassador to the UN, James Kariuki.Algeria’s ambassador, Amar Bendjama, called for sanctions on Israel in response to its Gaza City plan. “The hour has come to impose sanctions on the enemy of humanity,” he said. The Palestinian envoy, Riyad Mansour, said: “If it was another country, you would have been imposing sanctions a long time ago.”However, the US, a veto-wielding permanent member of the security council, offered support for Israel and accused those nations who supported Sunday’s meeting of “actively prolonging the war by spreading lies about Israel”.“Israel has a right to decide what is necessary for its security and what measure measures are appropriate to end the threat posed by Hamas,” said the US envoy to the UN, Dorothy Shea.Israel’s military offensive has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, most of them civilians. The figuredoes not include the thousands believed to be buried under rubbleor the thousands killed indirectly as a consequence of the war.Israel’s deputy ambassador to the UN, Jonathan Miller, said: “Pressure should not be placed on Israel, who suffered the most horrific attack against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, but on Hamas.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK’s most senior rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, addressed the march close to Downing Street.Mirvis said: “To our government we turn and we say: ‘How would you ever be able to live with the fact that you would have recognised a Palestinian state, at the head of which is a terrorist organisation, with a stated intention of destroying the state of Israel and harming Jews right around the world and all this at a time when the hostages are still languishing in the tunnels ofGaza?’“The Labour party, both in opposition and now in government, has had a mantra, they have continuously been saying ‘don’t judge us by our words, judge us by our deeds’.“And to our government we say right now: this is the time for responsible action, it is not too late.”He added: “We will continue to do whatever we can for the sake of each and every one of the hostages.”Keir Starmer has pledged to recognise a Palestinian state in September unless the Israeli government meets a series of conditions towards ending the conflict in Gaza. The Jewish-led direct action group Stop the Hate said protesters were urging the prime minister to prioritise the release of 50 remaining Israeli hostages, 20 of them whom are thought to be alive, before any recognition of a Palestinian state.They marched to Downing Street, where Noga Guttman, the cousin ofkidnapped 24-year-old Evyatar David, gave a speech. Other speakers includedAyelet Svatitzky, whose brothers Roi and Nadav Popplewell were, respectively, murdered anddied in captivity, andAdam Ma’anit.Ma’anit, whose cousin Tsachi Idan saw his eldest daughter’s murder before he himself was later killed, said that he was at the protest as he did not want others to lose loved ones.Ma’anit said: “I think that the government got it wrong with its foreign policy, that it’s time for it to correct and refocus on the hostages, and also to understand that by bringing the hostages, freeing the hostages, and helping to bring that about will also help us to unlock new pathways for solving the crisis in the Middle East.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Attenders demanded an immediate end to the military campaign and for the release of hostages.1:11'We will pursue you everywhere': hostage families warn Netanyahu against Gaza offensive – video“This isn’t just a military decision. It could be a death sentence for the people we love most,” Lishay Miran Lavi, the wife of hostage Omri Miran, told the rally, pleading Donald Trump to intervene to immediately end the war.Public opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Israelis favour an immediate end to the war to secure the release of the remaining 50 hostages held by militants in Gaza. Israeli officials believe about 20 hostages are still alive.The Israeli government has faced sharp criticism at home and abroad, including from some of its closest European allies, over the announcement that the military would expand the war. The full cabinet is expected to give its approval as soon as Sunday.‘A deadly scheme’: Palestinians face indiscriminate gunfire at food sitesRead moreMost of the hostages who have been freed emerged as a result of diplomatic negotiations. Talks toward a ceasefire that could have seen more hostages released collapsed in July.“They (the government) are fanatic. They are doing things against the interests of the country,” said Rami Dar, 69-year-old retiree, who travelled from a nearby suburb outside Tel Aviv, echoing calls for Trump to force a deal for the hostages.Tel Aviv has seen frequent rallies urging the government to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, which ignited the war with their October 2023 attack.“Frankly, I’m not an expert or anything, but I feel that after two years of fighting there has been no success,” said Yana, 45, who attended the rally with her husband and two children. “I wonder whether additional lives for both sides, not just the Israelis but also Gazans, will make any difference.“View image in fullscreenOpinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Israelis favour an end to the war to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by militants in Gaza.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersAbout 1,200, mostly Israelis, were killed and 251 were taken into Gaza during Hamas’ attack on Israel on 7 October, 2023.

Others held signs directing anger at the government or urging Trump to take action to stop Netanyahu from moving forward with plans to escalate the war.

This was often linked to employers’ gloomy outlook, and increased pressure on recruitment budgets.The report showed the steepest reduction in vacancies since April, while availability of staff rose at a rate that was among the fastest since the survey began in 1997.This has hit pay growth, with starting salaries rising at the weakest rate in almost four and a half years, it said.Demand for permanent staff was said to be down across all 10 employment categories apart from engineering. Retail remained at the bottom of the table with “a rapid fall in vacancies”, while the smallest decline happened in the construction sector.“With starting salaries and temp pay rising only modestly, it was right to cut interest rates last week,” said Kate Shoesmith, the REC deputy chief executive.“More action like this, to stabilise the business cost-base, is what will support growth and boost the jobs market this year. That is what the chancellor should be keeping firmly in mind when preparing this year’s autumn budget.”On Thursday, the Bank of Englandcut interest rates for the fifth timein a year as it warned that rising food prices could drive inflation to 4%, amid mounting concerns about the strength of the UK economy.Shoesmith noted that construction, a key economic bellwether, “has seen a rise in temp vacancies – an early sign of confidence returning”, adding: “Demand for blue-collar temp roles and permanent engineering jobs also remains steady, offering another glimmer of optimism.”Thehospitalityand care sectors, and organisations that hire young people, had been hit the hardest by mounting employment costs, the CIPD said. About 37% of employers that hired people under 21 reported that the NICs changes had increased their employment costs to a large extent, compared with 23% of employers that do not hire young people, despite under-21s being exempt from employer NICs.The organisation is urging the government to step up efforts to support the employment and training of young people and ensure that proposed changes to the employment rights bill do not act as a further barrier to their recruitment.James Cockett, the senior labour market economist at the CIPD, said: “Business confidence is faltering further under rising employment costs.”Meanwhile, weak GDP growth and high labour and energy costs coupled with continued uncertainty around Donald Trump’s global tariffs continue to weigh on confidence, the business advisory firm BDO’s latest monthly snapshot showed.Scott Knight, the head of growth at BDO,said: “There are signs of recovery but they are fragile … Business leaders are stuck in limbo, waiting for clearer signals from the government that further investment will be worth the gamble.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsKPMGnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the first annual decline since August 2020, during the height of the Covid pandemic – although this national figure masks wide regional variations.Rents have risen in recent years owing toa combination of factors. These include demand for rental properties outstripping supply, the pandemic and its fallout affecting how many people live and work, and buy-to-let landlords passing on increases in their costs caused by higher interest rates.Afterfive interest rate cuts over the past year, the mortgage costs for some landlords have fallen, reducing the need to pass on further costs. Meanwhile, lower mortgage rates are also making it easier for some tenants to begin looking to buy their first home, thereby reducing demand.The figures are based on data from Connells, one of the UK’s biggest estate agency groups. While they represent a sliver of good news for tenants, many of whom have had to grapple with sizeable increases to their housing costs, these rent falls are not yet widespread, Hamptons said.Greater London continues to record the steepest declines, with rents falling by 3% year on year in July – the seventh consecutive month of decline and the biggest annual drop since May 2021. The falls in Greater London, as well as a sharp slowdown in the north ofEnglandover the past year, helped push the national figure into negative territory.Rents inWalesfell on an annual basis for the third month in a row in July, while there were also falls in north-east England and Yorkshire and the Humber.However, rents are still rising in seven out of 11 regions, with the East Midlands (3.4%), West Midlands (2.7%) and south-west England (2.6%) leading the way.Despite the small annual decline, the average monthly rent for a new let of £1,373 remains £350 – or 34% – higher than in August 2020.For sitting tenants it is a different story. Average rents on renewed tenancies continued to rise: up 4.5% year on year in July.“After five years of relentless rent rises, the market has paused for breath,” said Aneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons. “[But] renewal rents continue to climb.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of this was attributed to improvements in the balance between supply and demand, with the number of available properties to rent said to be 15% higher than at the same time last year.This month, Barclays said that, typically, housing accounts for close to a third (30.8%) of renters’ take-home pay, whereas homeowners report spending just over a quarter (26.6%) of their earnings on their mortgage.Hamptons also issued data that showed one in five (20%) buy-to-let companies set up in Britain so far this year were owned by non-UK national shareholders. The proportion was up from 13% in 2016. Indian investors made up the largest group of non-UK shareholders, followed by Nigerians, Poles, Irish nationals and Italians. Meanwhile, Brexit has contributed to the share of non-UK shareholders coming from the EU falling from 65% in 2016 to 49% in 2025, the company said.Explore more on these topicsRenting propertyPropertyScotlandEnglandWalesMortgage ratesMortgagesnewsShareReuse this content"

He accused Joe Biden of doing “absolutely nothing” about the scandal when he was in the White House.“And now President Trump has demanded full transparency from this. And yet somehow the Democrats are attacking him and not the Biden administration, which did nothing for four years,”he said. Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,was convictedof conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse multiple minor girlsand sentencedto 20 years in federal prison during the Biden administration.Trump officials reportedly met at White House to discuss strategy around Epstein filesRead moreIf Vance’s attempt to switch public blame onto Democrats was the big idea to emerge from his strategy meeting with attorney generalPam Bondiand FBI director Kash Patel, whichaccording to CNNhe convened at the White House last week, then their labours appear to have backfired. (Vance denied to Fox that they had discussed Epstein at all, though he did acknowledge the meeting took place.)Within minutes of the Fox News interview being broadcast, social media began to hum with renewed cries of “release the files!”Clips of Vanc smearing Democrats quickly began to circulate on X. “We know that Jeffrey Epstein had a lot of connections with leftwing politicians and leftwing billionaires … Democrat billionaires and Democrat political leaders went to Epstein island all the time. Who knows what they did,” he said. Vance also repeated Trump’spreviously debunked claimthat Bill Clinton had visited Epstein’s private island dozens of times. Clinton has acknowledged using Epstein’s jet, butdeniedever visiting his island.“Fine. Release all the files,” wasthe ripostefrom Bill Kristol, the prominent conservative Never Trumper who urged the documents to be made public with “no redactions of clients, enablers, and see-no-evil associates”.Jon Favreau, Barack Obama’s former head speechwriter,replied: “Release the names! Democrats, Republicans, billionaires, or not. What are you afraid of, JD Vance?”Favreau added that Trump’s name “is in the Epstein files”. That was an apparent reference toa reportin the Wall Street Journal last month that a justice department review of the documents conducted under Bondi had found that the president’s name did appear “multiple times”.Other social media users used the Fox News interview as an excuse to re-run video of Trump in thehosting Epstein and Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago.Archival video of Donald Trump, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in 1992.Epstein died in August 2019, during Trump’s first presidency, while the financier and socialite was awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail; the death was ruled a suicide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision triggered an immediate and ongoing uproar that crossed the partisan political divide.Among the most viral clips in the aftermath of that reversal wasvideo of Vance himselftelling the podcaster Theo Von, two weeks before the election: “Seriously, we need to release the Epstein list, that is an important thing.”In his Fox News interview Vance alsowarnedthat “you’re going to see a lot of people get indicted” after Trump accused Obama of “treason” and called for his predecessor to be prosecuted.The director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has passed documents to the justice department that she claims show that the Obama administration maliciously tried to hurt Trump by linking Russian interference in the 2016 election to him.Obama has dismissed Trump’s call for his prosecution asweak and ridiculous.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJD VanceUS politicsJeffrey EpsteinGhislaine MaxwellDemocratsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Two of the images showed a total of 10 tents pitched on the grassalong a highway on-rampjust over a mile from the White House. The third image showed a single person sleeping on the steps of the American Institute of Pharmacy Buildingon Constitution Avenue. The fourth image showed the line of vehicles that whisk Trump to his golf course passing a small amount of roadside litteron the E Street Expressway, near the Kennedy Center.Trump’s post promoted a previously announced news conference on Monday, which he has promised, “will, essentially, stop violent crime” in the capital district, without explaining how. In a subsequent post, he said that the news conference at 10am Monday, “will not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation’s Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness”.The Free DC movement, which advocates for self-determination, immediately scheduleda proteston Monday to coincide with Trump’s news conference.Despite Trump’s claims, there is no epidemic of homelessness or violent crime in the capital.According to the Community Partnership, which works to prevent homelessness in Washington DC,on any given nightthere are about 800 unsheltered persons sleeping outdoors in the city of about 700,000 people. A further 3,275 people use emergency shelters in Washington, and 1,065 people are in transitional housing facilities.Trump’s repeated claims that it might be necessary to federalize law enforcement in the city to make it safe also ignores data collected by the Metropolitan police department,released in Januaryby the federal government, which showed that violent crime in Washington DC in 2024 was down 35% from 2023 and was at the lowest level in over 30 years.“We are not experiencing a crime spike,” Washington DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser,told MSNBCon Sunday. “We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low.” She added that Washington DC police statistics show that violent crime is down a further 26% so far this year.“Federal law enforcement is always on the street in DC, and we always work cooperatively with them” Bowser said, adding the the Washington DC national guard, which Trump has threatened to deploy, is under the control of the president.Earlier this week, Trump ordereda surge of federal officersfrom a variety of agencies to increase patrols in Washington DC, pointing to the assault on a young federal worker who came to Washington to work with Elon Musk as evidence that the city’s police force was failing to combat violent crime. Washington DC police, however, hadstopped the assaultTrump focused attention on, and arrested two 15-year-old suspects at the scene.Asked by Reuters, the White House declined to explain what legal authority Trump would use to evict people from Washington.

It said vaccine misinformation had put scientists at risk.The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, added that the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHH) – headed by Trump administration appointee and avowed vaccine safety skepticRobert F Kennedy Jr– must provide a “clear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation”.Such a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release.“Their leadership is critical in reinforcing public trust and ensuring that accurate, science-based information prevails,” the union said.Patrick Joseph White was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, when he attacked, said an official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.White’s gunfire hit at least four CDC buildings, agency director Susan Monarez said on X.DeKalb county police officer David Rose was mortally wounded while responding. Rose, 33, a former US marine who served in Afghanistan, had graduated from the police academy in March.White was found on the second floor of a building across the street from the CDC campus and died at the scene,Atlantapolice chief Darin Schierbaum said. He added that “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted”.The Georgia bureau of investigations said the crime scene was “complex”. The agency added that the investigation into the violence would take “an extended period of time”.Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off CDC employees, has said Kennedy Jr is directly responsible for the villainization of the CDC’s workforce through “his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust”.Kennedy Jr reached out to staff Saturday. The DHH secretary said “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others”.Dr Jerome Adams, who served as the US surgeon general during Donald Trump’s first presidency, said Kennedy’s response to Friday’s shooting was “tepid”, late and amounted to a “failed … test” of his leadership.“That’s not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has actually contributed to a lot of what’s been going on,” Adams said on Sunday on CBS’s Face the Nation.Adams said the mRNA-based vaccine technology that helped end the Covid-19 pandemic saved more than 2 million lives “by the most conservative estimates”. His comments came days after Kennedy moved tocancel $500m in mRNA vaccine research.Thousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the attacked campus. The union said some staff were huddled in various buildings until late at night. More than 90 young children were locked down inside the CDC’s Clifton school.The union said CDC staff should not be required to immediately return to work after experiencing such a traumatic event. In its statement Saturday, it said windows and buildings should first be fixed and made “completely secure”.“Staff should not be required to work next to bullet holes,” the union said. “Forcing a return under these conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of the horrific shooting they endured.”The union also called for “perimeter security on all campuses” until the investigation is fully completed and shared with staff.White’s father contacted police and identified his son as the possible shooter. He said White had been upset over the death of his dog and also had become fixated on the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the law enforcement official who spoke to the AP anonymously.A neighbor of White told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “seemed like a good guy” but spoke with her multiple times about distrusting Covid-19 vaccines in unrelated conversations.“He was very unsettled, and he very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people,” Nancy Hoalst told the Atlanta newspaper. “He emphatically believed that.”But Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: “I had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC.”Explore more on these topicsAtlantaVaccines and immunisationCoronavirusUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

It ended up posing questions of the team asked to defend the Premier League title.Alexander Isakmay becomea Liverpool player. That will be decided soon enough by the transfer market; a game of charades is being played before money eventually dictates its conclusion.Crystal Palace sink Liverpool on penalties to claim Community ShieldRead moreModern football’s eternal melodramas fade into insignificance when considering the player Isak could replace as a Liverpool centre‑forward. The club plays under the shadow of theloss of Diogo Jota, his death alongside his brother André Silva on a Spanish highway– its shattering of family and friends – a reminder that football is played by real people with real lives. Liverpool’s pre‑match lineup did not feature a No 20, Jota’s number retired.The season ahead will be played in memory of a popular, skilled yet understated professional – 12 months ago at Ipswich he was the scorer of the first Premier League goal of Arne Slot’s reign. Jota died a champion, a beloved teammate. Before kick-off, Wembley was supposed to observe a minute’s silence, only for an idiot fringe of Crystal Palace’s fans toshame themselves by chanting– a tiny number, though enough for a booed response from Liverpool fans with the referee, Chris Kavanagh, blowing his whistle quickly. What should have been a moment of perspective was sullied. Football’s ability to crack on blithely in the face of tragedy is one of its worst qualities.The Palace contingent, 99% of whom had been observant, wanted to get their own message across. “Uefa mafia” declared a banner, highlighted by burning pyro. Palace’s summer of FA Cup celebration is still overshadowed by the legal wrangle over their European participation – the outcome of the club’s appeal due to be announced on Monday – while Uefa and the Nottingham Forest principal Evangelos Marinakis had their names taken in vain in a lengthy chorus of disdain.The show rolled inexorably on, Wembley offering a snapshot of a newLiverpool. Whether Jota would have been part of the sporting director Richard Hughes’s plans to overhaul the squad Jürgen Klopp left last year for Slot is for the birds but it was Hugo Ekitiké, part of the overhaul, who scored first.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah performed below the high standard which has come to be expected of him.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAAs a central striker, Ekitiké looked much like the real deal should Isak not arrive. A player denied a chance to shine at Paris Saint-Germain – who turned to galacticos – put his mark down, though rued a couple of misses. Florian Wirtz added grace and magic, all drops of the shoulder and acceleration, sometimes strolling, sometimes darting, carrying the haughty, aristocratic air of the very best German footballers.Liverpool became champions last season by their consistency, patiently taking the steam from opponents. Pre-season and Wembley suggest a more open‑house approach, with attendant vulnerabilities. Amid the sound and fury of an occasion played at near full pelt by both teams, the problems of Liverpool turning the dial up to 11 on attack were soon apparent.Jeremie Frimpong is not Trent Alexander‑Arnold as an attacking full-back, breaking behind the lines rather than passing beyond them. His goal was almost certainly inadvertent, but showed the dimensions he might add. That he scored on 20min 20sec, as Liverpool fans remembered Jota, showed perfect timing, too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThat Eberechi Eze, drifting inside left, had Frimpong’s defensive measure was just one problem. Liverpool’s other Dutch defender, Virgil van Dijk, was unusually clumsy in bringing down Ismaïla Sarr for a penalty, flat-footed on other occasions. The return of another Dutchman, Ryan Gravenberch, who was on paternity leave, or Alexis Mac Allister, short of fitness to start, may solve such issues but there was top-heaviness and imbalance. Opposing scouts will have noticed the lack of cover Mohamed Salah provided to Frimpong, as was often the case for Alexander-Arnold. The Egyptian king’s creative partnership with Wirtz needs working on, too. There was a fault on the line between them, Salah reduced to one effort on goal – sometimes enough but not here, and dragged into Dean Henderson’s hands. The less said about his shootout penalty the better.If Milos Kerkez was ever keen to overlap, Sarr’s running showed he can be exposed defensively, and the out-of-position Hungarian was at fault as his tormentor scored Palace’s second equaliser. Perhaps a £150m forward is not the answer Slot is looking for. Marc Guéhi, a central defender Liverpool are linked with but may be beyond their spending limits should Isak actually arrive, showed typical cool as Palace assumed control in the second half. Adam Wharton, a midfielder the elite should covet, found his forwards with his passing range. Oliver Glasner hasbarely been able to addto his squad during the summer’s limbo but the Austrian’s golden touch continued as Palace edged a nerve-filled shootout to celebrate another trophy win.For Liverpool, losing theCommunity Shieldcannot come remotely close to the genuine, human loss of the friend and teammate without whom their squad must play on. Wembley suggested reclaiming the glory enjoyed when Jota was among them may not be as easy as a summer of transfer fantasy had made it seem.Explore more on these topicsCommunity ShieldCrystal PalaceLiverpoolanalysisShareReuse this content"

The official was tracking the play while he ran, and he didn’t see Lamb before he knocked down the wideout with a big hit to the back.CeeDee Lamb 👀pic.twitter.com/bzxJqIgHka— Jon Machota (@jonmachota)August 10, 2025Lamb got up with no apparent ill effects, laughing about the collision with his teammates. Dallas was still whistled for unsportsmanlike conduct, which took 15 yards off the Cowboys’ 51-yard gain for Los Angeles defensive back Shaun Jolly’s pass interference on Mingo.“It’s a sideline interference,” referee Alex Moore said after the game. “CeeDee Lamb was standing in the restricted white border area, which is our area to officiate the game. The official on the play was focused solely on doing his job and he ran into CeeDee Lamb, who was standing in that restricted area. That’s what happened. And with that contact, it’s an automatic foul.”Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer wasn’t thrilled about Lamb’s mistake, even though it was accidental.“Just like the pre-snap penalties, that penalty, we’ve got to be better with discipline,” Schottenheimer said. “I hope the guy’s OK. I think he’s OK, the official that he ran into, but we have to be better than that. CeeDee knows better.

Holder Logan Cooke lifted both arms shortly after the ball took flight. Little leaned forward a little and then raised an arm when “Logan’s eyes got really big” and it was obviously official. Cooke pushed Little to start the party, and thenrookie star Travis Huntergreeted Little on the field with a midair body-bump.“I don’t think we’re necessarily going to be kicking 70-yarders in the first quarter or anything like that,” Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence said. “But unbelievable to see him make that. That’s huge, especially in those two-minute drills. If you can get him near the 50, you got a really good shot.

His long was 59 yards, which tied Josh Scobee’s franchise record. Scobee, who retired in 2017, was at Saturday’s game but told Little he missed it because he went to the bathroom.Little still hadn’t even seen a replay of the kick even a half hour after the game ended. His phone was blowing up with congratulatory messages and voicemails, so many that was already apologizing for not being able to respond to them all.He already had one response ready – for anyone asking for the ball.

Could they defy the growing expectation that, these days, promoted teams will be restricted to one-season top-tier stays? Daniel Farke is certainly behaving like a man on a mission to avoid immediate relegation and seven summer signings have added much-needed height and aggression to last term’s technical but slightly diminutive squad. Yet while the arrivals of Lucas Perri, Jaka Bijol, Sebastiaan Bornouw, Gabriel Gudmundsson, Sean Longstaff and Anton Stach have fortified the goalkeeping, defensive and midfield departments, Lukas Nmecha remains the sole attacking signing. Given Patrick Bamford has been told he will be sold and Mateo Joseph and Joe Gelhardt have left on season-long loans Leeds are racing against time to rebuild the front end of the team.“We are not naive,” Farke said after the 1-1 friendly against Villarreal. “We know that in the offence we are not ready for Premier League level. We know that even in comparison to our Championship offence you could say that we are not much improved.“I can’t guarantee that for the first game everything will be ready and we are fully equipped but we definitely have to make sure that, latest, after the first international break in September, we have a really competitive squad for the Premier League. We’re not anxious but we are fully aware we need to do something.”In the interim, Joël Piroe, last season’s Championship golden boot winner, has a chance to show he is a top-tier striker.If the imports look sound – and the Slovenia centre-half Bijol, a £15m buy from Udinese, seems a particularly shrewd purchase – an awful lot hinges on how swiftly they adapt. Leeds fans must hope the team’s framework is sufficiently robust to showcase the talents of last season’s stars, most notably the Wales winger Dan James and the Japan midfielder Ao Tanaka.Chart of Leeds’ finishing positionsThe managerToo many managerial media addresses are anodyne, but the amiable Farke, almost always interesting and evidently emotionally intelligent, is a welcome exception to the rule. The one-time economics student with the look of a former heavy metal star has achieved three promotions to the Premier League, the first two with financially challenged Norwich sides. The 48-year-old German remained dignified in the face of intense speculationregarding his Elland Road future last May. The Leeds chair, Paraag Marathe, ended it by declaring“he’s my man,but the task is undeniably formidable. As Farke says: “In the past 21 years, Leeds have spent three seasons in the Premier League but that’s where this club belongs. My job is to keep us here.”Off-field pictureRunning Leeds has always been challenging, but the San Francisco-based 49er Enterprises is faced with the tricky task of staying on the right side of profitability and sustainability rules while remaining competitive on the pitch. This balancing act is only complicated by the reality that promotion has coincided with a major redevelopment project intended to expand Elland Road’s capacity to 53,000. With a formal planning application now submitted to the city council, building work could start before Christmas. While Robbie Evans, an analytics expert, is the club’s new managing director and replaces the former CEO Angus Kinnear, who is now at Everton, the long-serving Adam Underwood has been promoted to sporting director.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only the excellence of Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães and Joelinton kept the cricket-loving Tynesider out of Eddie Howe’s first XI, but he is too good not to be playing regularly. With 171 Premier League appearances behind him, Longstaff brings invaluable experience and is an excellent character off the field, always ready to support and encourage teammates. Games are often won and lost in midfield and with Longstaff, Stach, Ethan Ampadu, Tanaka and Illia Gruev competing for places, the engine room appears well staffed.View image in fullscreenSean Longstaff will bring much-needed Premier League experience to their midfield.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesStepping upHarry Gray, the grandson of Frank Gray and great nephew of Eddie from the Leeds sides of the 1970s, and the younger brother of Tottenham’s Archie Gray, is a poised, two-footed striker, equally adept as a No 9 or a No 10. The England Under-17 international has made one first-team appearance last season and does not turn 17 until October, but his cool, incisive finishing, precocious technique and advanced ability to read the game dictates he is the subject of considerable excitement at the club. Leeds are anxious not to rush Gray’s development, but Premier League defenders are unlikely to relish being introduced to his precocious skill set.A big season for …“I probably have something to prove in the Premier League,” said Wilfried Gnonto this summer. It is important to remember that his exquisite dribbling skills and extraordinary change of pace belong to a winger who does not turn 22 until November. Gnonto has 13 Italy caps, but his challenge is to establish hitherto elusive consistency and nail down a regular place in the starting XI. Few top-tier defenders will welcome the experience of him running at themand the time has come for Gnonto to eliminate erraticism from his game.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Leeds UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A late header from his substitute Wout Faes completed a comeback victory but for much of a testing opening game against Henrik Pedersen’s Sheffield Wednesday, who took a first-half lead amid fan protestsagainst the club’s ownership, that looked an unlikely outcome. There will be no illusions over how difficult an immediate return to the Premier League will be for Leicester.“The Championship is a ruthless league,” said Cifuentes,who succeeded Ruud van Nistelrooythis summer. “It was a good lesson for everyone to understand that we cannot take anything for granted.”Leicester v Sheffield Wednesday: Championship – as it happenedRead moreFor Wednesday, it was an achievement to even be here. Placed under a transfer embargo by the Football League because of late payments, they have only 15 senior first-teamers on the books. The players and staff were paid their outstanding July wages on Friday after solidarity payments from the Premier League came in.Pedersen stepped in to be head coach after thedeparture of Danny Röhlat the end of July and the Dane’s tone at full-time here was largely positive. “Very proud feeling from the performance,” he said. “It’s been some tough, tough weeks. To keep the discipline, to keep the motivation … it was a fantastic picture for how you can do this.”The sold-out away section was sparsely populated at kick-off, the vast majority of Wednesday supporters staying outside for the first five minutes in protest against the Thai owner, Dejphon Chansiri, who is yet to receive an offer for the club that matches his valuation. A banner reading “SWFC for sale – enough is enough” was left on the empty seats.When Wednesday’s fans arrived, Nathaniel Chalobah almost gave them something to cheer about straight away, chesting the ball down at a corner and sending a bobbling shot across goal that came off the foot of a post. The away end, so quiet for those first five minutes, erupted midway through the first half when Chalobah met Yan Valery’s cut-back and had a low shot deflected into the roof of the net by Oliver Skipp. Chalobah and his teammates set off towards the far side of the stadium, where the noise – a mixture of joy and defiance, of pent-up frustration being let out – only grew as they approached. The celebrations were a picture.View image in fullscreenSheffield Wednesday fans stayed out of the stand en masse in the first five minutes in protest at their owner, Dejphon Chansiri.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“Our fans are a big, big inspiration for our players,” Pedersen said. “The togetherness with the fans … of course they will go to the fans. They are so thankful for the support they are giving.” The discontent among the home supporters too was evident from the outset. Charged by the Premier League for breaches of profitability and sustainability rules in the 2023-24 campaign, Leicester are still waiting to find outif they will be handeda points deduction this season. Important members of the first team, including the goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, have been sold to raise funds.But will there be more outgoings at a club that are yet to spend any money in the transfer market? “If I could predict the future, trust me, I would be much richer than what I am,” Cifuentes said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen. It’s clear it’s a work in progress.”In terms of quality on the ball, Leicester were a cut above. Bilal El Khannouss, who impressed in the Premier League last season and who could still leave before the window shuts, was a constant threat. The introduction of Harry Winks at the break added control in midfield, where Wednesday were struggling to cope after Chalobah was withdrawn injured.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The momentum was then on Leicester’s side, Stephy Mavididi almost giving them the lead when, after evading a couple of defenders, his shot was blocked at close quarters by Charles.Wednesday’s task became even tougher when their 35-year-old captain, Barry Bannan, who has just signed a new contract after training with the team after his previous one expired in June, received a second yellow card for a rash follow‑through on Winks.An inspired Charles then kept out Patson Daka’s header but, in the end, the visitors could hold out no longer. El Khannouss’s corner was butted in by Faes to complete a turnaround that denied Wednesday a draw after their supporters had made their own point in the first five minutes.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipLeicester CitySheffield Wednesdaymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Simons joined Leipzig from Paris Saint-Germain in January for €50m (£43m) after two successful loan spells and had been expected to cost about €70m (£61m) but Chelsea are now pushing to include Nkunku, who they believe to be valued at £40m, as part of the deal.Nicolas Jackson tells Chelsea he wants to leave as Newcastle circleRead moreNegotiations are ongoing, withChelsealikely to have to pay a sizeable fee on top for the 22-year-old, who can play in a number of attacking positions.

He is understood to have trained alone on Fridayafter informing Chelseathat he would like to move, with Milan also linked with the 24-year-old.Chelsea had valued Jackson at £80m but are likely to accept a reduced fee of around £65m as they attempt to reshape their attacking options.

We’ve got a squad from our back line to midfield that can cope domestically and cope in the European competition. So I’m really pleased with that aspect. But I think we need competition at the top end of the field.“For Adam, he’s a big, honest boy. He was at his best here when was really challenging with Kyogo for the position and that’s something that is important for us to get. But in the meantime, he will work hard and he’ll always be that reference for us.”Asked if Idah needed a goal, Rodgers said: “Listen, you’re a striker at Celtic, you have to be strong mentally, you’ve got to score goals, of course. But I’ve a lot of faith in him. He really needs that real competition beside him.

I had some doubts about Arteta’s ability to keep motivating this group, but this summer’s heavy spend should fix that, reinvigorating the squad. Only time will tell whether the new faces can gel and develop chemistry, but it’s a relief to have the clamour for a centre-forward answered at last. Hopefully come May we’ll be lauding Victor’sveni, vidi, viciPremier Leaguetriumph.Key players/weak links?Keeping our star turns fit – Gabriel, Rice and Saka – remains crucial. Beyond that there are lots of unknowns. Can Ødegaard rekindle his role as our creator-in-chief, or will Nwaneri force his way in? Can Zubimendi form an effective partnership with Declan Rice and impose himself as our midfield fulcrum? Will Martinelli, Trossard and Madueke chip in with the 10‑15 goals required to alleviate our reliance on Saka, thereby reducing the burden on Gyökeres? And how much will we see of our 15-year-old prodigy Max Dowman?We still need to sign …Nobody will complain if the spending stops here, after half a dozen new arrivals already. But there would also be few arguments if the club managed to land an Eze-like bonus too.Our headline-maker is …Gyökeres: guaranteed to be the subject of intense media scrutiny. Our days of speculating about what might have been if only we’d signed a striker sooner are over. Now it’s time to find out.Happy with the new kit?I’m a traditionalist; I think our kits should always be red and white and yellow and blue. This season there’s an all-blue away kit and a white third. Marvellous fashion items, maybe, but if we don’t win in them, they’ll fast lose their allure.We will finish …1st. Based on the law of averages, I’ll be right one of these days.Top four1. Arsenal; 2.

With the rules making it nigh-on impossible for the “disruptors” to make sustained progress, clubs like ours can do nothing but Bark at the Moon. Sixth to eighth is probably our range, but those that find that prospect dull really should be more balanced. We are playing European football, we’ll have a chance in the cups and we’ve got a Wizard of a manager.Key players/weak links?The wellbeing of the spine of Konsa, Tielemans, Rogers and Watkins, all of whom made 50+ appearances last year, will be fundamental – and Kamara’s fitness will be crucial too. Also worth keeping an eye on Onana and Maatsen, who could have statement seasons. Weaknesses? Whisper it quietly but Martínez had a less-than-convincing 2024‑25. But you’d always back such a character to shake that off.We still need to sign …I’d expect one more (net) arrival by window-shut. We need cover at right-back as Cash is injury-prone. As for attacking threat, I made the classic mistake of falling in love with a loan player (Rashford) last year, so I’m hoping new boy Evann Guessand will step Into the Void.Our headline-maker is…Martínez isn’t a Hellraiser but his “housery” and his shot-stopping are on different trajectories at the moment and he’s worth 50p to be the first keeper to be sent off for general insubordination. Still wouldn’t swap him, though!Happy with the new kit?I can’t see much difference between this year’s and last’s. But it’s claret and blue in the right proportions so yes, I’m happy I guess.

Progress off the pitch will be marked by the much-needed expansion of the stadium and the recruitment of key players to fill gaps left by big departures. On it, I can’t really see us hitting a top-10 finish. Mid-table and 50 points would feel like a huge win when you look at where we are currently. A cup semi-final would be a bonus.Key players/weak links?Key will be Antoine Semenyo, Justin Kluivert, Evanilson and the returning-from-injury Ryan Christie. The sales of Kerkez and Huijsen and likely exit of Zabarnyi will leave gaping holes in our defence that need filling. We’re all looking forward to seeing Eli Junior Kroupi make his debut for the team after joining from Lorient, and this could be a breakthrough season for James Hill, a defensive utility man who will likely have much more game time compared with 2024-25.We still need to sign …Defenders. Lille’s Bafodé Diakité and Seville’s Loïc Badé are both potential options being explored – but not only byBournemouth. Fingers crossed we can get one or both done. Every team knows we need new recruits at the back, so high-quality bargains aren’t easy to find. In our recruitment team we trust, but the pressure is definitely on them to deliver.Our headline-maker is …It could be fitness coach Pablo de la Torre, booked several times last season. Could he build on those performances and get in a proper fight with an official this season?Happy with this season’s new kit?Yes. The subtle wave to the red and black stripes pays a nice homage to our seaside roots. And the black and blue stripes of the away kit are already a firm fan’s favourite, harking back to past seasons, most recently 2011-12.We will finish …12th.Top four1. Liverpool; 2.

OK, losing your manager, backroom staff, top scorer and captain and seeing your star striker do as his job title suggests – go on strike – doesn’t look good on paper, but I see this as an exciting new horizon. Employing set-piece coach Keith Andrews looks a safe move to me, not a risky one. The club knows him well and would rather employ someone who understands theBrentfordway. We knew Mbeumo was going, we have the funds to replace him, so now it’s up to the club to deliver. We’re backed by many to go down; I’ll be more than happy with a finish anywhere above 14th in what is a massive transitional season for us.Key players/weak links?There is a lot of pressure on Kevin Schade and Igor Thiago to deliver, with Mbeumo and, probably, Wissa gone. Fabio Carvalho and Keane Lewis-Potter, back in his original role on the wing after filling in at left-back for the best part of two seasons, are still to show they have the attacking flare out wide displayed by their predecessors. The one new player causing much excitement is 20-year-old Antoni Milambo. He’s got some dancing feet on him. And it’s great to see Aaron Hickey and Rico Henry back to tighten up our defence; with the experienced Jordan Henderson sitting in front of them, I expect us to keep things tight at the back with some great distribution to our forward line, which is still a work in progress.We still need to sign …Replacements for Mbeumo and Wissa. Ipswich’s Omari Hutchinson and Bournemouth’s Dango Ouattara are among those linked.Our headline-maker is …He’s been with us for a year and has hardly kicked a ball, but Igor Thiago looks like a right character. He seems to be loving life in London.Happy with this season’s new kit?I quite like the new home kit, bar the strange grandad neck. Our new away kit is a chocolate brown colour.

It’s Fabian Hürzeler’s second season and we’ve made more exciting additions to the squad. It’s gutting to see João Pedro become the latest Brighton player to succumb to theChelseanonsense but no one can wait to see what the Greek youngsters Stefanos Tzimas and Charalampos Kostoulas can bring. Our transfer business was mostly done early in the window so Hürzeler’s had a great pre-season without a draining overseas tour. With our new Dutch goalkeeping coach, Jelle ten Rouwelaar, we’ll hopefully start saving some penalties, and we can say goodbye to our old wobbly defence now we’ve got Maxim De Cuyper, Olivier Boscagli and Diego Coppola.Key players/weak links?With João Pedro gone, Danny Welbeck will be key, while Brajan Gruda really started to show his quality at the end of last season. Charlie Tasker, who has been at the club since he was eight, was in a few matchday squads and has had a decent pre-season so watch out for him, too. Weak links? We’ve got Tony Bloom, so we don’t have any.We still need to sign …We don’t need anyone else. If we did Uncle Tony would have got them already.Our headline-maker is …Now Hürzeler has grown up a bit and is nearly 32 and a half, he might not get shown the red card so often. So maybe it’ll be the ridiculously flamboyant Georginio drawing focus with all his Pokémon cards, racehorses and excited babbles to camera.Happy with this season’s new kit?Football shirts are far too expensive and glamorous for me but I do love our iconic blue and white stripes.

Scott Parker is a far more pragmatic coach than Vincent Kompany and we should be a lot harder to score against. The signings, on paper, look to be good – a mix of the very experienced (Kyle Walker) and some younger talent to get the fans excited. It’s not going to be easy – we know how big the gap is – but signing someone like Walker at least gives you a chance of building the right culture to stay up.Key players/weak links?Maxime Estève is key. The lad is a Rolls-Royce of a footballer and if we’re to stay up he’ll play a key role in the heart of the defence. The weak link is probably up top – do we have enough goals to survive? The jury is definitely still out.We still need to sign …The obvious areas at the start of the window were a goalkeeper, a strong central midfielder and a striker, and that’s probably the top of the shopping list. There’s been plenty of links and it looks like we will have one in each of those positions – Martin Dubravka, Lesley Ugochukwu and Armando Broja.Our headline-maker is …It’s got to be Hannibal. I described him a few times as a “busy idiot” in the opening weeks of last season but after serving a ban for a stupid stamp on a Sunderland player he came back and was magnificent. He’s the kind of player who gets the opposition riled up and he’s the player away fans will love to hate I’m sure. Aside from that, we’ve still got Ashley Barnes who lives for a wind-up, so keep an eye on him on the touchline warming up.Happy with the new kit?Yeah on the whole, two very nice kits so far.

The players should be on a high after the Club World Cup, and hopefully Maresca will expand on his tactics and give us the exciting football we all want. This side is totally capable of delivering it. A strong finish to last season should enable us to push on; top four is the minimum expectation, plus a strong showing in the Champions League.Key players/weak links?Key again will be James, Cucurella, Caicedo, Enzo and Palmer, with a lot of rotation among the rest of the squad. I don’t think we’ll get the 30-goal-a-season striker our support craves but João Pedro and Delap should be entertaining, while the stand-out player among the promising youngsters is Estêvão. Weaknesses? While Robert Sánchez had a good end to the season in goal I still see him as an issue.We still need to sign …I wouldn’t be surprised to see Mike Maignan join us. And Fofana’s ongoing injury concerns may mean we dip in to the market again. But realistically the rest of the window is more about who leaves: Sterling, Chilwell, Disasi and Nkunku are among a long list looking for exits. Maresca’s biggest challenge will again be keeping everyone happy and he won’t have the luxury of the Conference League to give squad players opportunities.Our headline-maker is …Cole Palmer is becoming the side’s biggest personality, whether that’s intentional or not. His pre- and post-match interviews are gold compared to the usual media-trained Q&As. His double act with Tosin will hopefully encourage others to come out of their shells.Happy with the new kit?It’s a decent blue.

So it’s been uneventful, but that’s been a positive in some ways: Marc Guéhi still being here is a welcome surprise, we’ve lost no other key players (yet) and we’ve actually strengthened in a couple of key positions through the signing of Walter Benítez as a back-up keeper and Borna Sosa as competition for Tyrick Mitchell at left-wing back. The target will be to improve on last season’s points tally and go deep in the cup competitions once again.Key players/weak linksEberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta have looked imperious in pre-season, and they, along with Daniel Muñoz, Adam Wharton and Ismaïla Sarr, will be key to our success. Academy centre-back Mofe Jemide has been given minutes already and forward Hindolo Mustapha may feature. By far the most important person, though, is Oliver Glasner; the journey he has taken this club on in such a short period of time is incredible and it is imperative that he agrees a new contract soon or there will be a lot of noise on his future as the season advances.We still need to sign …Glasner wants another centre-back, a central midfielder and an attacker. We’ve been heavily linked with defenders Yann Bisseck at Inter and Sporting’s Ousmane Diomande – and Nice attacker Evann Guessand was mentioned before he went to Villa. I wouldn’t rule out a loan from the Chelsea player lake, either.Our headline-maker is …We all hope Mateta will keep smiling and kicking corner flags.Happy with the new kit?Not bad, though the white stripes on the shoulders are too wide.

I have great faith in Moyes’ ability to get the best of what is available. I expect us to be hugely difficult to play against away from home. We won’t score too many but defensively we will be very strong. How quickly we can settle into the new stadium is a considerable unknown – one thing for sure is the immense atmosphere it will create. Target has to be Europa League or Conference League qualificationKey players/weak links?Pickford, Branthwaite, Tarkowski and O’Brien are key. Weaknesses: right wing, left back, proven scorers and creative midfielders. Bringing Alcaraz back is a plus and Thierno Barry from Villarreal is a huge prospect. And watch out for 18-year-old midfielder Harrison Armstrong, who has been at the club since age of five.We still need to sign …Five or six at a minimum given our squad has only 19 current members including Chermiti and Séamus Coleman … Dewsbury-Hall could blossom under Moyes’ tutelage. Controversially, I think Grealish might be the spark we need. Our new recruitment team/committee has much to do. Thankfully funding is not the issue it was.Our headline-maker is …On the pitch it’s Pickford, still a great character despite his now obvious maturity. Off it, I’m backing Moyes to take on the elder statesman role among top-flight managers. Don’t be shy, David!Happy with this season’s new kit?Being a grumpy old man, I think the new Castore kit is atrocious.

He’s continued to forge a squad full of drive, quality, togetherness and belief – but, as last season proved, it needs bolstering or there’s every chance we’ll run out of steam once again. The cosseted mega-wealthy clubs have scoured the globe and splashed millions on fresh talent, whereas our lot’s vision has seemed limited to SW6 and the local pier. New contracts for Kenny Tete, Josh King, Harry Wilson, Tom Cairney and co (OK, plus a cross-channel sortie to nab back-up keeper Benjamin Lecomte) were great business and a sign of stability, but where’s the smattering of new blood to provide fresh competition for places, that extra edge and to give the supporters a lift?Key players/weak links?Curious that the ever-improving Rodrigo Muniz is being linked with other clubs when he should be established as the club’s main striker for years to come. Despite varied and indifferent service (or the fact that he’s often sat on the bench!), the 24-year-old’s goals return is impressive. And maybe King’s new long-term contract means he’ll get more game time too; hope so.We still need to sign …The much-mooted return of Reiss Nelson hasn’t happened yet, while another winger, Raheem Sterling on the huge surplus pile at Chelsea, has also been linked. Either way, I’m counting on Emile Smith-Rowe making a much greater impression having arrived late in the day this time last year with precious little pre-season training or time to fully integrate.Our headline-maker is …There’s big Calvin Bassey, of course, plus Roadrunner Robinson meep-meeping back and forth down the left, but Marco’s the main man at the local football club.Happy with this season’s new kit?Oh it’s smart, no question; it’s sleek; but it’s all white.

History provides an ever-present tension at Leeds and survival is never seen as enough. On top of all the expected pressure of the Premier League will be a strong internal need for more, for better, for properly reasserting ourselves – after 25 years – back where we belong. I think we probably will stay up. I think it probably will be fraught.Key players/weak links?Summer transfers have concentrated on six-footers in their mid-20s, so the spirit of Tony Pulis could have a big part to play. After years of froth around Illan Meslier, it’ll help if big-punching new goalie Lucas Perri convinces as No 1. Wilf Gnonto, still only 21, is a lively winger who wants headlines, while we’re hoping for some sensations from the next of the Gray line, 16-year-old striker Harry, before inevitably selling him to Spurs.We still need to sign …Forwards. Transfer business has beefed up the back but after missing out on Igor Paixão, telling Pat Bamford he can go and hearing Mateo Joseph has asked to, new attackers are necessary.Our headline-maker is …I’m a big enjoyer of Big Joe Rodon.

Our target is clear then: to finish top again and go further in Europe. And we must try without one of our stars, Diogo Jota, whose loss is immeasurable, of course to his family first and foremost. What he meant to the boss, the team, each individual player and the supporters has been evident in the outpourings of love and respect shown in these past weeks. We won’t forget him and in doing all we can to succeed we will honour his memory.Key players/weak links?The new signings and how quickly they settle will be vital, but I imagine the influence of Alisson, Van Dijk, Salah and Mac Allister will continue to make the team tick. Weak links can only be in defence if multiple injuries hit at once. The 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha has dazzled in pre-season and I expect he will play a some part, albeit sporadically, and Trey Nyoni continues to look the real deal.We still need to sign …Isak has four goals in six games against us. It would be good to see him score in a red shirt. We definitely need support at the back, too. We’re supposedly monitoring Guéhi at Palace, who is in his last year of his contract, and Parma’s Giovanni Leoni, 18 – one for seasons to come.Our headline-maker is …Arne Slot.

Liverpool have obviously done eye-catching business and from a position of strength, too. But City have filled some key holes (such as left-back, central midfield) and bolstered the squad in terms of depth, which was a big problem last season. The target has to be a serious and sustained challenge for the title, plus going deep in the Champions League.Key players/weak links?Rodri’s fitness will be fundamental. We’re better placed to cope without him this campaign, but he is obviously brilliant and makes an enormous difference to how we play. We need more from Haaland this season, both in terms of performances and output (as mad as that may sound!). And I’m hopeful that Oscar Bobb should have the breakthrough season injury robbed him of in 2024-25.We still need to sign …The big hole is undoubtedly right-back. Kyle Walker has moved on and we haven’t replaced him. Tino Livramento was the top target, but it sounds like (potentially for diplomatic/political reasons between the ownership groups) City have opted out of a deal. It seems as if we’re deferring solving that problem until next summer. The big talking point for fans now is who leaves from Akanji/Stones/Kovacic/Gündogan, if anyone.Our headline-maker is …With Grealish in the departure lounge, it’ll be Guardiola. Last season was unquestionably his worst at City, his idiosyncrasies coming to the fore. But hopefully he’ll be lifted by the new coaching setup around him.

Our new front three scored more league goals between them last season than our entire team managed. But we do still need to replace the keeper and a central midfielder. Amorim has been ruthless in removing players and the negativity that has been hanging over the team, and preseason performances have been promising. I think a top-six finish is achievable. But where we are in the table after the tough opening 10 games will show us whether this group of players have the minerals to dig in and build momentum.

Onana still feels like a disaster waiting to happen, though: his positional play is poor, he is indecisive and the distribution ability that he was bought for seems nonexistent. Amorin continues to play three at the back and Dalot remains poor as a wing back. On the bright side, Diego León, our 18-year-old left-back, looks like a mini Hulk. I expect him to become a regular.We still need to sign …If we can get rid of Garnacho, Antony and Sancho to stay onside with PSR, I’d love to see us go for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand and PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.Our headline-maker is …Bruno Fernandes.

But the Isak saga has cast a shadow over the summer – and we’ve grown increasingly frustrated by losing out to rivals for transfer targets. A strategy of courting established stars has failed and going into the summer with no director of football, and an outgoing chief executive, couldn’t have helped. It’s astonishing that on the eve of a four-competition season we have ended up with more goalkeepers than senior midfielders. Yet the ace in the pack, Eddie Howe, is still here. We trust him implicitly. As long as we secure reinforcements, a Champions League spot is the aim.Key players/weak links?Joelinton, Bruno and Sandro Tonali could go toe-to-toe with anyone in Europe – we’ll need all of their strength, guile and passion to progress. We’re also blessed with two sensational full-backs in Tino Livramento and Lewis Hall, while Lewis Miley remains our brightest young hope. But central defence is a concern. Dan Burn and Fabian Schär have legendary status, but they’re not getting any faster, while the injury-blighted Sven Botman is yet to get back to his best.We still need to sign …We’ve needed a new striker for at least two seasons (where was the succession plan for Callum Wilson?) and that remains a priority, as does a pacey, younger centre-half: Brighton’s Jan Paul van Hecke could fit that bill.

Last season showed that we had a decent first XI but not so much strength in depth when it was needed, so with a European campaign coming up (it would be nice to know which competition, though), we will need good reserves for a solid season.Key players/weak links?Keeping MGW was a massive statement. Many Forest supporters also love that it cemented our owner and club as Top Six Disruptors™, and lots of journos and fans of rivals don’t like it… The future looks good, too: we have a proud record of always having an academy product in the squad since the 1940s, so Zach Abbott and maybe Jimmy Sinclair could make appearances in Europe and the Carabao Cup.We still need to sign …A goalie, full-back(s) and a central defensive midfielder.

We’ve been away from the Premier League for a long time and it’s a completely different beast now. The difference this time is that we have invested properly, we are stable off the pitch, and Le Bris looks like he is building something. Staying up is the obvious target; if we can survive and put down a foundation, anything beyond that is a bonus.Key players/weak links?The player I’m most excited to watch is Chris Rigg. Since breaking into the first team he has only improved, becoming our youngest league scorer. He’s a huge prospect and I think he’ll thrive on this stage. Signing Xhaka is massive as well, not just for his quality but for his leadership. With such a young squad, his voice in the dressing room and on the pitch will be priceless.We still need to sign …Defensive cover: someone to replace Chris Mepham following the end of his loan and also to provide depth in that area. Our back line carries the biggest injury risks, so I expect a couple of late loans when other clubs finalise their squads. That said, we’ve not just been waiting around for scraps this summer, so there’s no telling who might come in.Our headline-maker is …Luke O’Nien has become a cult hero, someone who genuinely understands what it means to love Sunderland.

The target is to avoid a debacle by playing decent football, a sense of that mystical evolution and the avoidance of 22 league defeats. Frankly, I think we’ll be fine.Key players/weak links?Cuti Romero is likely to be named captain, meaning it’s a case of collective accountability throughout the squad to galvanise a side that will be having to cope without the legend Son.

Cheeky bid for Gibbs-White next summer?First manager sackedGraham Potter.SpookyOriginalThe Fighting CockpodcasterView image in fullscreenMo Kudus: former Hammer.Photograph: Harry Langer/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockWest HamDespite the sale of Mohammed Kudus I’m fairly optimistic now Potter has had a full pre-season with the squad and a successful US tour. It was always difficult fitting Bowen and Kudus in the same team; hopefully there’s now space for “Jimmy” Summerville to get going. Niclas Füllkrug looks fit and sharp which might make all the difference. If we’re playing wingbacks then much will depend on new signing Diouf, who can certainly whip in a cross, and the excellent Wan-Bissaka.Key players/weak links?Paquetá being found innocent of spot-fixing means we might have back the player of two years ago, while Bowen will, as ever, be crucial. We’ve got to hope that a lot of last season’s signings will improve or stay fit in their second season, such as Füllkrug, Summerville, Kilman and Todibo. The return of Aguerd (he should never have been loaned out) will help at the back. The weak link will be a one-paced central midfield. Potter has a reputation for giving youngsters a chance and Luis Guilherme, Freddie Potts, Callum Marshall, George Earthy and Ollie Scarles might all get games.We still need to sign …Walker-Peters is a good squad signing but we need more speed and dynamism in midfield as Soucek, Álvarez and Ward-Prowse are not too mobile. Douglas Luiz and Villa’s Rogers have been mentioned, but seem unlikely. We also need a young striker to compete with Füllkrug. The injury-prone Callum Wilson is a great finisher to have on the bench, but at 33 is a short-term gamble.Our headline-maker is …Jarrod Bowen is Mr West Ham (and now Mr Dani Dyer), though if you want angry outbursts then Füllkrug has form. I’ll bet on Paquetá doing something exciting too.Happy with this season’s new kit?Not sure why we’re sponsored by Susan Boyle Sports. The home kit is OK but should have blue arms. I prefer a white away kit to the new ecru one, but I like the navy third kit with the giant hammers on it.We will finish …10th.Top four1. Liverpool; 2. Manchester City; 3. Chelsea; 4.

Significant funds were generated early in the window, raising hopes of a rapid overhaul, but recruitment has come at a trickle so far. Attacking midfielder Fer López has clear potential, wingback David Møller Wolfe can hopefully fill the void left by Aït-Nouri and, by all accounts, forward Jhon Arias is a potential Premier League star in the making. But the squad still looks short in several areas. Survival should be the minimum requirement in what’s now our eighth consecutive top-flight season, but it still feels like the main objective with no meaningful signs of ambition.Key players/weak links?We’ve lost a lot of craft, so it’s important we’re solid at the back to compensate. We need Emmanuel Agbadou to continue his fine form from last season and those around him (Toti Gomes, João Gomes and André) to keep the team compact. Further forward, Jorgen Strand Larsen has to fire again and Jhon Arias can hopefully compensate for Cunha’s departure. England u18s winger Mateus Mane made his Premier League debut last season and didn’t look out of place in that brief cameo. He could feature again, especially if the club fails to bulk out the dwindling wide attacking areas.We still need to sign …I’d like four players – a right wingback, a central midfielder and at least two who can operate across the front three positions. Nearly all of our recruitment comes from Europe and South America so I’ll be surprised if we move for any domestic players. Still, someone like James McAtee or Harvey Elliott would tick a lot of boxes.Our headline-maker is …The manager has become the identity of the team with his “first the points, then the pints” mantra. On the pitch, Yerson Mosquera is a stellar wind-up merchant, so if he gets minutes expect some shenanigans.Happy with this season’s new kit?Yes, I will give the club credit for a smart home kit. Probably still a bit yellow for some people’s liking, but the collar is a nice change of pace and I like the understated pattern.We will finish …16th.Top four1. Arsenal; 2. Liverpool; 3.

The former Atalanta playmaker Alejandro “Papu” Gómez loves a dance (his hit singleDance Like the Papu went viral in 2017) and Padua is an absolutely gorgeous city in northern Italy, so this Saturday Night Fever-inspired transfer announcement video for the Argentinian that showcases both works a charm. In what feels like a high-quality production, the 2022 World Cup winner struts around the city in 1970s clobber: a leather jacket, an enormously lappelled shirt and a vintage pair of Copa Mundials, all to the sound of the Bee Gees’ Stayin’ Alive. The context of this transfer to the Serie B side is that Gómez is finishinga two-year doping banafter taking a banned substance, which the now 37-year-old claimed came from his son’s cough medicine. Gómez, fifth on the all-time list of Serie A assists, continues to train independently but can start training with his new Padova teammates on 19 August.Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford to Manchester UnitedA slightly different one in that this was not an announcement video but a farewell, as Bryan Mbeumo issued an Interstellar-themed message to Brentford supporters before his move to Manchester United. This could have gone badly wrong (and the thought of another Interstellar-themed video in the future where Mbeumo is shouting“Don’t let me leave, Brentford”to himself is a tempting one) but the Cameroon forward pitches it perfectly here, as herecreates the incredible scenewhere Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, looks back over years of messages left by his children. There are some heartfelt moments in Mbeumo’s video: his first Brentford goal, his special relationship with supporters and teammates and his memories of Brentford’s promotion to the Premier League. “6 years that felt like 6 minutes,” reads the accompanying caption to the video. “It’s time to take off and to leave the Bees Planet. But before I go, I want to thank all of you. It was an incredible journey full of emotion, smile, laugh and you made every moment very special. You’ll always have my heart. We’ll meet again in this dimension and in the others.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

The image might also be a veiled nod to the call that Saúl received from his former Atlético Madrid teammate Filipe Luís, now head coach atFlamengo. Saúl was on the verge of signing for Trabzonspor after verbally agreeing a deal with the Turkish club but backed out at the last minute, citing “personal stuff”, leading to a furious statement from Trabzonspor’s head coach Fatih Tekke: “Let those who don’t want Trabzon have their fun.

Pogba’s announcement video,entitled La Renaissance, is more pensive but still slick, with his unmistakeable energy and confidence on show. “Like a kid all excited for his first day of school,” narrates the Frenchman. But a secondary video showing a tearful Pogba actually signing his contract has far more impact. In contrast to the first choreographed video, Pogba’s raw emotion comes to the fore here as his doping ban, injuries andlegal casesseem to melt away with the resumption of his career. “I’m sorry – thank you for your trust,” blurts out Pogba to Monaco’s sporting director, Thiago Scuro, with the midfielder barely able to get the words out. “It is very rare to see me cry like that, so I hope you enjoyed it,” Pogba later reflected. “There were so many images that came into my mind. We know the doping story, my injury. Everything came back to me during the signing and I couldn’t hold back.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

In an age when journalists and fans are seemingly privy to transfer detail, De Jong’s deal was a complete secret, and the idea of Porto’s president, André Villas-Boas. With a baseball cap pulled over his head, the 6ft 2in De Jong was lucky not to be seen at Porto airport when he arrived on Sunday, but was smuggled into a taxi without anyone noticing. Even De Jong’s medical was booked as a new player for Porto’s handball team (De Jong’s parents were both professional volleyball players) as the club scrambled to keep his arrival from leaking. After meeting his new teammates in the dressing room before the match, the Dutch striker walked out of the tunnel around 6pmto shock the fans.And the worst one …Burnley have carved out a niche in creating unique transfer announcements in the recent past but theirLionel Richie-themed one for Kyle Walkerthis summer is quite something.

He departed as Tottenham’s fifth-highest goalscorer of all time with 173 goals in 454 appearances.Son’s first chance to play in front of home fans in Los Angeles will come against Western Conference leaders San Diego on 31 August. Son’s move is expected to resonate with Los Angeles’ sizeable Korean community. The team’s stadium is just south of Koreatown.But plenty of his jerseys, South Korean flags and signs welcoming him to MLS were dotted around the Fire’s SeatGeek Stadium on Saturday, and cheers greeted his entry in place of David Martinez in the 61st minute with the teams level at 1-1.“I really enjoyed it. You never had this coming from away games,” said Son. “I used to play in the Premier League. When I played at away grounds they were always booing me and always booing the players. But it was nice to see people were celebrating, people were enjoying the football.”Jonathan Bamba put Chicago up 2-1 in the 70th minute. Teran had opened the scoring in the 11th with a header off a corner kick. Eight minutes later Ryan Hollingshead nodded in off a corner kick to pull LAFC level at 1-1.Son had said at his introductory press conference on Wednesday that he felt fighting fit and wanted to get on the pitch “as soon as possible.” His arrival reunites him with former Tottenham teammate Hugo Lloris, the French goalkeeper who said the South Korean will make a “big impact.”“It’s great for the league, great for the city, great for the club,” Lloris said.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles FCChicago FireMLSUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I also think form fluctuates so much on the day. You can lose two and one [6-2, 6-1] one day, you can win or you can make it close the next day, and it can be down to a few points. So I’m excited.”Raducanu begins Roig partnership with victory against Danilovic in CincinnatiRead moreIt will be Raducanu’s first ­significant match since ­starting workwith her new coach, Francisco Roig,last week in Cincinnati.Last monthshe played one of her best matchesagainst a top player in making life difficult for Sabalenka at Wimbledon in two tight sets. After serving for the first set and then later holding a set point against the ­Belarusian, Raducanu led 4-1 in the second set before losing 7-6 (6), 6-4.“She played incredible tennis,” Sabalenka said of the British player after her straight-sets win against Marketa Vondrousova on Saturday night. “I’m super happy to see her mentally and physically back, and definitely gonna be back in the top 10 very soon. She challenged me that much, and I like to accept tough ­challenges, so I’m super excited about facing her on the hard courts.”Raducanu gave an honest response when asked if she left Centre Court at Wimbledon determined to have another crack at Sabalenka as soon as possible.“I would say I thought I’d love to have another crack at that on grass, like tomorrow,” she said, ­laughing. “But I know, and I’m honestly reasonable enough, and, I guess, honest enough in myself to know that different surfaces favour different people and where my game is at in comparison. I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage but we’ll see how it goes.”Raducanu has enjoyed a positive run of form in recent months while training and competing consistently on the tour and she could be seeded for the US Open. However, while she has ­performed well in the matches she has been favoured to win, the lessons from most of her previous encounters against the top players have been that her general level has simply not been good enough.In their first few days working together, Raducanu and Roig will at least get a clear ­understanding of exactly where she stands in ­comparison to the very best.On Sunday, Cameron Norrie struggled badly in 33C (91F) heat and humid conditions as he lost 6-4, 6-3 against Roberto Bautista Agut in the second round.After trailing the 37-year-old Spaniard by an early break, Norrie had appeared to be finding his way when he suddenly began to feel sick. Despite fighting hard until the end, he spent the rest of the match clutching his chest and barely able to move on the court: “[In the] 5-4 game I started to feel like I wanted to throw up,” said Norrie. “Maybe it’s the heat, I don’t know. I went to the bathroom and threw everything up after the first set and I was still not feeling good. And I had no energy in the second set.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norrie had hoped to maintain his momentum on the North American hard courts, his favourite surface, but he has instead struggled in each tournament. Norrie’s physicality is usually one of his biggest strengths, which has made these results even more frustrating.“At this point, I don’t know what to say,” said Norrie. “We’re trying everything. We’re using the ice. We’re changing shirts and changing grips all the time. I don’t think it’s that hot, like it’s hot but it’s not crazy. I’m just not sure why my body is not letting me play. It must be mental too, because I’m really good in the heat, and I have such high expectations for myself to do well in the heat. So I guess maybe I need to lower those expectations now.”In his first match since losing in the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner last month, the men’s No 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz held firm in the decisive moments against Damir Dzumhur despite a turbulent performance to reach the third round in Cincinnati with a 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 win.

That left Rose two off the pace with Tommy Fleetwood, the world No 1 Scottie Scheffler and Spaun ahead of him.But four birdies from the 14th catapulted Rose to the top of the leaderboard and he just missed a 13-foot putt at the last to win outright. He produced two more birdies in three playoff holes, one a clutch effort after Spaun had holed from distance, with the second from 14ft after Spaun was half that distance away proving decisive as his opponent’s attempt to extend the contest raced past.View image in fullscreenJustin Rose pulls off a fine approach from the edge of the water during his playoff against JJ Spaun.Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty Images“That was an amazing last 90 minutes.

During an at-bat by Willie Randolph, Rivera took a step and fell to the ground in shallow center field behind second base.Jen Pawol breaks MLB’s gender barrier as first female umpire to work regular-season gameRead moreThe Yankees restored the Old-Timers’ Day game for the first time since 2019.“It was a fun day until we heard about Mariano. Mariano hurt his achilles,” seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens told WFAN broadcaster Suzyn Waldman. “I don’t know what was going on. We all thought it was a hamstring, but I think it’s a little worse than that. I think he’s at the hospital now. Unbelievable.”Rivera was the second player to get hurt in the event since 2017. Eight years ago, former outfielder and current YES Network analyst Paul O’Neill strained a calf running to first base.Rivera tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in May 2012 while shagging fly balls in batting practice in Kansas City. He returned for his final season in 2013 and finished as baseball’s career saves leader with 652 and posted 42 postseason saves.In 2019, the 13-time All-Star became the first player unanimously inducted into the Hall of Fame by getting all 425 votes in balloting conducted by theBaseballWriters’ Association of America. He helped the Yankees win five World Series titles and seven American League pennants.Rivera took part in the Old-Timers’ Game, played before the Yankees beat the Houston Astros 5-4, for the second time. He hit an inside-the-park homer in 2019.The event commemorated the 25th anniversary of the 2000 championship team, the last team to win three straight World Series titles. Clemens was a first-time attendee at the event, which had captain Derek Jeter give a short video message when he was introduced following Rivera.Before the event, Rivera said he intended to speak with struggling reliever Devin Williams, who allowed three runs in the 10th inning Friday. He has allowed nine runs in his last five appearances and 28 earned runs this year, two more than 2022-24 combined.“Can’t do nothing about it,” Rivera said Saturday morning. “Once it’s done, it’s done. Just learn from it, move on and be confident. You have to be confident in yourself. If you’re not confident in yourself, you’re playing the wrong sport.”Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesMLBBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

His old friend Ozzy Osbourne, the lead singer of Black Sabbathwho diedlast month, was apparently beamed in from some kind of rock heaven, where he was reunited with other departed stars including Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Bob Marley.The AI-generated images divided Stewart’s fans. Some denounced them as disrespectful and distasteful; others found the tribute beautiful.At about the same time, another AI controversy erupted when Jim Acosta, a former CNN White House correspondent, interviewed adigital recreation of Joaquin Oliver, who was killed at the age of 17 in a 2018 high school shooting in Florida. The avatar of the teenager was created by his parents, who said it was a blessing to hear his voice again.In June, Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of Reddit,posted on Xan animation of his late mother hugging him when he was a child, created from a photograph. “Damn, I wasn’t ready for how this would feel. We didn’t have a camcorder, so there’s no video of me with my mom … This is how she hugged me. I’ve rewatched it 50 times,” he wrote.View image in fullscreenAI-generated images of Ozzy Osbourne and Tina Turner were shown at a recent Rod Stewart concert in North Carolina.Illustration: Iamsloanesteel InstagramThese are just three illustrations of a growing phenomenon of “digital resurrection” – creating images and bots of people who have died using photographs, videos, voice messages and other material. Companies offering to create “griefbots” or “deathbots” abound, and questions about exploitation, privacy and their impact on the grieving process are multiplying.When a journalist uses AI to interview a dead child, isn’t it time to ask what the boundaries should be? | Gaby HinsliffRead more“It’s vastly more technologically possible now because of large language models such as ChatGPT being easily available to the general public and very straightforward to use,” said Elaine Kasket, a London-based cyberpsychologist.“And these large language models enable the creation of something that feels really plausible and realistic. When someone dies, if there are enough digital remains – texts, emails, voice notes, images – it’s possible to create something that feels very recognisable.”Only a few years ago, the idea of “virtual immortality” was futuristic, a techno-dream beyond the reach of ordinary people. Now, interactive avatars can be created relatively easily and cheaply, and demand looks set to grow.Apoll commissioned by the Christian thinktank Theosand carried out by YouGov in 2023 found that 14% of respondents agreed they would find comfort in interacting with a digital version of a loved one who had died. The younger the respondent, the more likely they were to be open to the idea of a deathbot.View image in fullscreenJim Acosta, a former CNN White House correspondent, ‘interviewed’ a digital recreation of Joaquin Oliver, who was killed in a 2018 high school shooting in Florida.Illustration: YoutubeThe desire to preserve connections with dead loved ones is not new. In the past, bereaved people have retained precious personal items that help them feel close to the person they have lost. People pore over photos, watch videos, replay voice messages and listen to music that reminds them of the person. They often dream of the dead, or imagine they glimpse them across a room or in the street. A few even seek contact via seances.“Human beings have been trying to relate to the dead ever since there were humans,” said Michael Cholbi, a professor of philosophy at the University of Edinburgh and the author of Grief: A Philosophical Guide. “We have created monuments and memorials, preserved locks of hair, reread letters. Now the question is: does AI have anything to add?”Louise Richardson, of York university’s philosophy department and a co-investigator on a four-year project on grief, said bereaved people often sought to “maintain a sense of connection and closeness” with a dead loved one by visiting their grave, talking to them or touching items that belonged to them.“Deathbots can serve the same purpose, but they can also be disruptive to the grieving process,” she said. “They can get in the way of recognising and accommodating what has been lost, because you can interact with a deathbot in an ongoing way.”For example, people often wonder what a dead loved one might have done or said in a specific situation. “Now it feels like you are able to ask them.”But deathbots may also provide “sanitised, rosy” representations of a person, said Cholbi. For example, someone creating a deathbot of their late granny may choose not to include her casual racism or other unappealing aspects of her personality in material fed into an AI generator.There is also a risk of creating a dependency in the living person, said Nathan Mladin, the author ofAI and the Afterlife, a Theos report published last year. “Digital necromancy is a deceptive experience. You think you’re talking to a person when you’re actually talking to a machine. Bereaved people can become dependent on a bot, rather than accepting and healing.”The boom in digital clones of the dead began in the far east. In China, it cancost as little as 20 yuan(£2.20) to create a digital avatar of a loved one, but according to one estimate the market was worth 12bn yuan (£1.2bn) in 2022 and was expected to quadruple by 2025.More advanced, interactive avatars that move and converse with a client can cost thousands of pounds. Fu Shou Yuan International Group, a major funeral operator, has said it is “possible for the dead to ‘come back to life’ in the virtual world”. According to the China Funeral Association, thecost is about 50,000 yuanper deceased person.The exploitation of grief for private profit is a risk, according to Cholbi, although he pointed to a long history of mis-selling and upselling in the funeral business.Kasket said another pitfall was privacy and rights to digital remains. “A person who’s dead has no opportunity to consent, no right of reply and no control.” The fraudulent use of digital material to create convincing avatars for financial gain was another concern, she added.Some people have already begun stipulating in their wills that they do not want their digital material to be used after their death.Interactive avatars are not just for the dead. Abba Voyage, a show that features digital versions of the four members of the Swedish pop group performing in their heyday, has been a runaway success,making about £1.6m each week. Audiences thrill – and sing along – to the exhilarating experience while the band’s members, now aged between 75 and 80, put their feet up at home.View image in fullscreenAbba’s avatars, wearing Dolce & Gabbana, as seen in Abba Voyage.Illustration: Abba VoyageMore soberly, the UK’s National Holocaust Centre and Museum launched a project in 2016 to capture thevoices and images of Holocaust survivorsto create interactive avatars capable of answering questions about their experiences in the Nazi death camps long into the future.According to Cholbi, there is an element of “AI hype” around deathbots. “I don’t doubt that some people are interested in this, and I think it could have some interesting therapeutic applications. It could be something that people haul out periodically – I can imagine they bring out the posthumous avatar of a deceased relative at Christmas dinner or on their birthday.“But I doubt that people will try to sustain their relationships with the dead through this technology for very long. At some point, I think most of us reconcile ourselves with the fact of death, the fact that the person is dead.“This isn’t to say that some people might really dive into this, but it does seem to be a case where maybe the prospects are not as promising as some of the commercial investors might hope.”For Mladin, the deathbot industry raises profound questions for ethicists and theologians. The interest in digital resurrection may be a consequence of “traditional religious belief fading, but those deeper longings for transcendence, for life after death, for the permanence of love are redirected towards technological solutions,” he said.“This is an expression of peak modernity, a belief that technology will conquer death and will give us life everlasting. It’s symptomatic of the kind of culture we inhabit now.”Kasket said: “There’s no question in my mind that some people create these kinds of phenomena and utilise them in ways that they find helpful. But what I’m concerned about is the way various services selling these kinds of things are pathologising grief.“If we lose the ability to cope with grief, or convince ourselves that we’re unable to deal with it, we are rendered truly psychologically brittle. It is not a pathology or a disease or a problem for technology to solve. Grief and loss are part of normal human experience.”"

Despite a seemingly tireless work ethic, Kruszelnicki, now 77 years old, can’t be everywhere all at once.Those questions now come in waves, across social media platforms at all hours of the day. “Sometimes, I get 300 requests a day on Twitter to answer an involved question about climate change,” Kruszelnicki says.Dr Karl Kruszelnicki: ‘Having been beaten unconscious really changes your life’Read moreParticularly on X (formerly Twitter), he says he would often engage with users who don’t believe the climate crisis is real or urgent. He hoped there might be a way to change the minds of this group of people, who he says have been bombarded by misinformation in places such as the Murdoch press for the past 30 years.After speaking with longtime friend and technology journalist Leigh Stark, the pair settled on an idea: an AI-powered Digital Dr Karl. Using a large language model (LLM), they’re creating a chatbot designed tosound like Kruszelnicki that provides users with evidence, backed by trustworthy sources, that the climate crisis is caused by humans and is an urgent problem to solve.“I cannot answer all the questions by myself and people want questions answered. The only way I can do it is develop this digital AI,” he says.Kruszelnicki’s achievements as a science communicator are unparalleled: in Australiahe’s considered a National Living Treasure, he won the Unesco Kalinga prize, he wrote dozens of books and is the one and only Julius Sumner Miller Fellow at the University of Sydney, a position he has held since 1993.He believes AI can help convince those who don’t believe in the severity and causes of the climate crisis – even if there are outstanding questions around the ethical use of AI, its training data, accuracy and its own environmental impacts. “I think with climate change, we are at a stage where the perfect is the enemy of the good,” he says. “We’re certainly not going to become unethical or become like the forces of evil.”Digital Dr Karl runs on an open-source LLM developed by Mistral, a French company considered one of Europe’s challengers to OpenAI and Google.To create Digital Dr Karl, Stark has taken Mistral’s base model, then trained it on a corpus of Kruszelnicki’s climate science resources acquired through his own research for his own books and writing on climate. It includes academic papers, consensus statements and original articles from publications including the New York Times, the Guardian and RenewEconomy to build out its knowledge, just like the real Kruszelnicki has.“This is an AI that’s been trained on the 40,000 PDFs I’ve gathered over the last 40 years,” he says.Stark says questions over copyright are valid, and he would like to ultimately have the chatbot trained exclusively on data, but says “we’re not at that point yet”, emphasising “this is beta, this is really early stuff” and the intent is to build something “based solely on data”.Putting Digital Dr Karl to the testTaking the Guardian through a demonstration of Digital Dr Karl, Stark reveals the AI interface is similar to ChatGPT, and users can type in a single query about the climate crisis to kickstart a conversation.Stark types in “climate change is a hoax” and the Digital Dr Karl replies a few seconds later in a stilted and tonally inconsistent recreation of Kruszelnicki’s voice. It wants to know if we are suggesting the climate crisis “is a fabricated idea”. We are only able to answer yes or no. We respond yes, at which point the AI quotes Barack Obama on the effects of the climate crisis.As the conversation continues, Digital Dr Karl displays data, such as graphs showing atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 170 years. But it also seems to mix metaphors and “hallucinate” (the terminology used in AI research for “to make up”) some of the numbers for atmospheric carbon dioxide rise.Stark describes the AI as both an “alpha” and “beta” version, and he is working to improve the AI voice, but expects Digital Dr Karl will release this in October. Kruszelnicki says he has already spent $20,000 of his own money since February to develop the AI: “This is purely philanthropic – I do this because I see this as my duty, in return for 16 years of free university education that I received.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

He will also post 100 TikToks, one a day, alongside the project and each one will push people to his Digital Dr Karl, Stark says. After 100 days, the pair will switch off their AI and “work out what the fuck just happened”. At that juncture they will do a survey with the hope that the result is that “more people are open-minded and believe in climate change”, says Stark.Kruszelnicki says they’re just “trying to do the Mark 1” and will see what they find before deciding whether they go on to a Mark 2.Dr Karl Kruszelnicki: ‘I took my hands off the artery – blood squirted up and hit the ceiling’Read moreThere are some hints about whatcouldhappen. Mounting evidence – academic and anecdotal – suggests LLMs can influence emotion, opinion and belief.In September 2024,a study in the journal Science showed conversations with a chatbot could reduce participants’ belief in their chosen conspiracy theory, including everything from the Kennedy assassination to the illuminati, by about 20% on average. The effect persisted for two months after the conversations took place.Thomas Costello, assistant professor of psychology at American University and lead author of the Science study, saysthe AI is persuasive because it can rapidly access and strategically deploy information in conversation. “The back and forth is useful because [reasoned] dialogue and debate is excellent at surfacing the crux of disagreements and kicking the tyres of each side,” he says.Costello has also co-authoredanother study, yet to be peer-reviewed but available online, suggesting a similar effect is seen when AI models, tailored to respond to specific concerns from a user, address climate scepticism and inaction. One of the key elements though, is that these AI agents are not based on any real person, and to shape belief, users must be willing to engage in conversation.But even if Digital Dr Karl can change minds, it contains the same outstanding issues as other LLMs. Kruszelnicki and Stark hope to alleviate the concerns around AI’s environmental impacts.“We’ll run the website entirely off solar panels and you don’t need a lot of energy,” says Kruszelnicki.Stark says Digital Dr Karl is running off a very small amount of computer memory on a $12,000 Mac and it theoretically can run on renewables. “If we can get several of these computers running off of a solar battery or basically solar panel and a large battery, then we can effectively run this on renewables.” However, with more users, Stark says scaling it could be a challenge – he expects up to 2,500 people will be accessing Digital Dr Karl at any time.“We’re going to be keeping an eye on it, on every response that it makes,” Kruszelnicki says. “And if it goes bad, we’ll pull the plug.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Climate science scepticism and denialClimate crisisClimate sciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last summer, lime-green videos of Kamala Harris with songs from Charli xcx’s smash album Brat went viral on X and TikTok, leading to mainstream conversations about “brat summer” onCNNandFox News.For 18-year-old Ellen, who runs the account @politicsprincess, the clips – or “edits”, in social media jargon – allow her to combine her interests of trawling video archives and pop culture.One of Ellen’s most popular posts, which has 130,000 views, pairs tightly edited clips from the1997 Labour party campaignwith Justin Bieber and Nicki Minaj’s Beauty and the Beat.

The sector is small compared to large game development nations such as Canada – but that is slowly changing.In 2023, the federal government brought in the digital games tax offset (DGTO), which allows developers who make or port (develop games for systems that aren’t the ones they were originally on) games in Australia to claim a 30% refundable income tax offset. It applies to companies which incur at least $500,000 in qualifying Australian development expenditure and is capped at $20m per company.Ron Curry, the chief executive of the IGEA, says in 2020-21 there were about 1,300 employees in the gaming industry in Australia – a figure which has now almost doubled.View image in fullscreenIndustry experts say government offsets and rebates are attracting the interest of international developers, as well as fostering local talent.Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/The GuardianThe Australian game development sector now accounts for 2,465 full-time workers and earned $339.1m in revenue in the financial year of 2023-24. “That shows an almost 100% increase in employment and revenue has grown about 85%,” he says.“The DGTO pulled a number of levers. Australia was a very expensive place to make games – we were the only developed country without any sort of rebate or offset. So it fixed that, so it brought us back in line with other developed countries.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailCurry says it signalled to the rest of the world there was confidence in the industry from government, and – in conjunction with state and territory grants to the sector – it made Australia a “healthy environment to operate in” and generated confidence from investors, game publishers and prospective employees.Interstate competition and legacy-buildingSerge Zebian, partner at Playwright Consulting, a firm that advises gaming companies on accounting matters, says the offset has made an “enormous difference” for companies hiring people in Australia and that momentum is starting to flow.“We’re making all the international studios aware of it, and some already are just from existing relationships with Australian vendors. But … now a lot of international studios are looking [toward] Australia. My clients’ proposals are progressing really fast up the queue.”Zebian says NSW used to be the home for film while Victoria had the reputation as a games development hub, but competition is increasing. Queensland has added a 15% rebate on top of the federal government’s 30% with a threshold of $250,000. In Victoria, the rebate is 10% or 15%, depending on shareholding, with a threshold of $500,000.“What we’re finding is a lot of indies [independent game studios] are … moving up to Queensland,” Zebian says.French developer Gameloft opened its Brisbane studio in 2014. The studio was behind the resurrection of iconic gaming character Carmen Sandiego this year on mobile, Netflix, Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.Manea Castet, the studio head in Brisbane, says he grew up playing the Carmen Sandiego games with his father. He found the character scary: Sandiego is a thief, after all, who you have to chase all over the world. For Castet, to come back and be able to make the new game and have players instead assume the role of Sandiego was a “fun twist”.Castet says Gameloft’s Brisbane studio is the only one within the company experiencing large growth, expanding from 55 employees two years ago to 217 today. Castet says it allows the studio to work on two games at once and have more complete development of the game from design, tech, audio, quality assurance and marketing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Users complained aboutbugs in the gameat launch, including jerseys with the wrong numbers on them and server errors making it difficult to play the game.Symons says it was a “very good day” when numerous patches were rolled out to improve the game. He blamed tight deadlines for the release of the game to coincide with the NRL season and last-minute changes to the game.View image in fullscreenSymons says Big Ant Studio’s latest rugby league game sold six times more than expected, temporarily overloading their online servers.Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/The Guardian“We were forced to make a hell of a lot of change in the game, 1,200 changes in the week before we release[d], and these changes were to do with betting sponsors, alcohol sponsors and all sorts,” he says. “So we sat there stripping the hell out of the game, still having to meet our day. So that was tough.”Gambling and alcohol company logos that are featured on player jerseys in real lifewere removed from the gameprior to release amid growing concern about marketing of those products to under-18s. Symons also says the company underestimated demand on the day the game went on sale; it sold six times more than their expectations, leading to server issues which he says have since been resolved.Big Ant had around 50 employees until the tax offset came in, which allowed the company to expand to 147 employees, Symons says. “It allows us to be competitive with every other place on the planet.”The studios say a tight jobs market, where games development skills are often sought out by other industries including artificial intelligence, makes it more difficult to grow.Curry says the industry is proud participants have transferrable skills, but it makes it competitive for talent. Secure jobs, commensurate salaries and an immigration system that attracts senior talent would help recruiting, he adds.“We know when you bring senior talent into a country, they act as an accelerator for those people that they’re training,” he says. “If you want to get a developer into Canada, you can do it in as little as two weeks through their system. We know people have taken up two years and beyond to get into Australia.”“That just doesn’t work when you’re in a field that’s quickly moving.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A change in political climate has revealed their weaknessesSun 10 Aug 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 16.40 EDTShareEarlier this month, as Nordic countries were hit with anunprecedented heatwaveand wildfires in the US began spurting“fire clouds”, Barclays pulled out of the net zero banking alliance. Thestorymay have seemed less alarming than extreme weather, but it has existential implications, as the finance sector quietly surrenders its former climate commitments.The initiative forms part of the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a voluntary network of banks thatMark Carney, formerly the UN’s special envoy on climate action and now Canada’s prime minister, launched in 2021. At the time, the alliance, which encourages banks and asset managers to work towards the goals of the Paris agreement, seemed like an optimistic step in the right direction. Mr Carney described it as a “breakthrough”.But times change. The election of Donald Trump, whose advisers have waged war on “climate fanaticism” and “woke” capitalism, has created an environment of impunity where businesses no longer need to even pay lip service to progress. Fossil fuel companiesdonated $19mto Mr Trump’s inauguration fund. So far, their investment has paid off. Mr Trump haswithdrawnfrom the Paris agreement, used an“invented”energy emergency to justify the expansion of fossil fuels, openedpublic landsto drilling, and plans tocut fundingfor renewable energy.With America reneging on climate action, businesses may feel they can relax. Barclays is the second British bank to leave the net zero alliance afterHSBCquit earlier this year. Six of the largest US banks quitjust weeksbefore Mr Trump’s inauguration. Some institutions have come under direct pressure from the right: BlackRock left the net zero asset managers initiative, another GFANZ group, after it was sued byRepublicanswho claimed its promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals had cut coal production. In each of his annual investor letters from 2020 to 2024, BlackRock’s chair, Larry Fink, namechecked climate change. His2025 lettermade no mention of it.The deterioration of GFANZ reveals the weaknesses in relying on businesses to do the right thing. Its goals were always fuzzy: instead of calling for hard limits on the financing of fossil fuels, GFANZ encouraged banks to invest in low-carbon sectors. It has since drifted further from its mission,expanding its membershipto companies without net zero commitments. Though it was never supposed to be a substitute for government action, inactive governments welcomed it. Boris Johnson, prime minister at the time of its creation, promised the alliance would help to“build back greener”.Many green finance initiatives have less to do with preventing climate breakdown than minimising investors’ exposure to the risks this creates, such as carbon taxes or curbs on fossil fuels. “Green ethical investing”,writesAdrienne Buller, is a way of betting “on the likelihood of a greener economy, rather than contribute to bringing that economy into being”. When the risk of regulation wanes, as it has under Trump, so too does the impetus for this style of investing.The lesson is that government action (and inaction) will determine the severity of the climate crisis. Governments need to prohibit fossil fuel extraction, reduce profits throughprogressive carbon taxes, support renewables and confront powerful interests. The myth that businesses are capable of self-policing has led to a dangerous delay.Explore more on these topicsGreen economyOpinionMark CarneyClimate crisisBarclaysBankingDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

As a Shiʿi Muslim, it permeates my religious consciousness and finds expression through annual mourning rituals. I find nourishment in mourning: from a young age I have lent my ears to lamentations and shed tears for martyrs felled in far-off lands.Recently though, grief, paid a more personal visit when news reached me of my grandmother’s passing. In response, I turned to my favourite poem, Lord Tennyson’s In Memoriam A. H. H., which ranks among the most profound and poignant elegies ever penned, in any language.Tennyson’s words are a balm for the soul, but some passages caught my eye for a different reason:I sometimes hold it half a sinTo put in words the grief I feel;For words, like Nature, half revealAnd half conceal the Soul within.But, for the unquiet heart and brain,A use in measured language lies;The sad mechanic exercise,Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.I was taken aback, for Tennyson’s words cast doubt on the effectiveness of poetry to deal with grief. It made me question whether the solace I sought in poetry was real, or merely a superficial remedy that lacked any substance. This spurred serious reflection on my part on the purpose of poetry in confronting grief, ably assisted by The Penguin Book of Elegy, which helped refine my thought process. I present some of these reflections below.The voice of our own inner critic can be strong. How can we break free from the mental prison? | Nadine LevyRead moreAll poetry is, in a sense, elegiac, as it attempts to preserve or recall that which has been, or will be, devoured by death. In wrestling with death, poetry attempts to distil the panorama of human experience into words, though it will inevitably fall short in describing the emotions and experiences of the poet. Tennyson alluded to this in the above excerpt when he wrote that words “half conceal the Soul within”.That is only half the picture, though, for Tennyson also conceded that words “half reveal”. It is in this tension that much of the beauty of poetry resides: it causes us to simultaneously hope and despair; urges us hold on and let go; and emboldens us to confront and flee from death.Poetryallows our hearts to hover in that mysterious realm that lies between life and death, to catch glimpses of our soul – for that part of us which yearns for something far greater than it. Words may not help us reach that which is beyond us, but they do help to reignite within us the innate desire to transcend ourselves.There is also something to be said for the role of poetry in transforming mourning from an individual into a communal experience. Poetry helps to unearth grief from one heart and plant it within the hearts of others; an individual pain is transformed into a shared sorrow. Words alone may not heal wounds, but I have found throughout my life that grief is easier to digest when it is shared.Tennyson’s own poem is proof of this: millions of readers have resonated with his words and perhaps found a degree of comfort and consolation that escaped Tennyson himself. A lone, pained voice of grief can feel meek before the shadow of death, but a symphony of sorrow orchestrated by hearts in sync can help soothe the grief.Some may read this and think I’ve overstated the significance of poetry in dealing with grief. This may be true, but I think we often fail to realise that words are magic: that with the assortment of letters cobbled together to form meaning, the emotions and thoughts that meander in our minds and hearts can flutter towards the minds and hearts of others.When we grieve, we mourn the most precious things that we have lost. But poetry helps us to not only preserve them, but to transform them: in allowing loss to sing, that which we have lost becomes beautiful and sublime, alive in ways we can only half comprehend.Ali Hammoud is a PhD candidate at Western Sydney University.

Between now and September, there could conceivably be further outbreaks of the kind of violence that rightwing politicians and their media allies have been frantically predicting. But for now, behold a fascinating spectacle: a country quietly refusing to chaotically combust, despite being endlessly encouraged to do so.One word in particular symbolises the gap between hyped-up rhetoric and everyday reality. “Tinderbox” was first used in the mid-16th century, to describe a crude instrument for starting fires: a container that carried a piece of either flint or steel, and a pocketful of the dry, flammable material that gave the device its name. With the invention of matches, the use of such implements fell away, and the word began its passage to how it is used today: as political shorthand for any situation supposedly on the brink of explosion. And here we are: over the past few weeks, “tinderbox” has become an inescapable cliche.At the end of July, the Institute for Public Policy Research publisheda report to mark the first anniversary of 2024’s riots, which claimed that the loss of communities’ shared spaces – pubs, youth clubs, community centres – can create “tinderbox conditions for violence”. At around the same time, the protests and violence outside hotels used for people seeking asylum began to attract the self-same description. “We need an emergency cross-party cabinet to stop tinderbox Britain exploding,” wrote a columnistin the Daily Telegraph. The former home secretarySajid Javid warnedthat the UK is “sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division”. And not long after, his one-time colleague Robert Jenrick – now the shadow justice secretary, and a man on constant manoeuvres – told the Today programme that “the country is like a tinderbox right now”.All this noise is part of a much bigger political development: a ballooning narrative about complete social breakdown. Just as people on the left have been predicting for at least 150 years that capitalism is about to chaotically implode under the weight of its own contradictions, so some of the loudest voices on the post-Brexit right have come up with their own version of a similarly historic meltdown: a vision of the immediate future in which rampant wokery, crime, failed immigration policy, weak policing and general establishment decay and corruption will lead inexorably to whatNigel Farage calls “societal collapse”.The Reform UK leader is now well into his summer of crime campaign,a breakneck run of pronouncementsdispensed from behind a lectern adorned with the slogan “Britain is lawless”. He says that “the social contract between the governed and the government is on the edge of breaking down”. And for months – if not years – helpful mood music has been provided by elements of the rightwing media. Again, the comment section of the Telegraph offers no end of examples: a newspaper that was once a byword for the political stiff upper lip now constantlyoffers such warningsas “Britain is lurching towards civil war, and nobody knows how to stop it”.All this echoes the kind of con trick used by reactionaries and authoritarians down the ages: warning of the country’s supposedly likely collapse in the hope that the rest of us support all the hardline policies they say would stop the rot. In Farage’s case, apocalyptic rhetoric feeds the idea that now things are so bad, the public ought to take a chance on his completely untested party. But also, the warnings of imminent social breakdown from Tory andReform UKpoliticians often sound quietly gleeful, as if they believe that some great moment of rupture is exactly what Britain needs, to wake up from its slumber.View image in fullscreenProtesters demonstrate near the Bell hotel, used to house asylum seekers in Epping, 20 July 2025.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockTheir talk always comes with caveats:Farage, for example, follows“Goodness knows what may happen over the course of the summer” with “We would encourage people to protest quietly and sensibly.” But, like Jenrick, he still sounds like someone with an alarmingly ambivalent view of unrest and chaos. Both of them make hyped-up claims of“two-tier justice”and draw questionable connections between migration and crime, which are much easier to popularise online than the comparatively complexreasons why they are specious. Put simply, they warn of disorder while recklessly rattling the tinderbox.Over the weekend, all this hit a new low. Friday and Saturday saw another spate of hotel protests, in locations including Portsmouth, Bristol,Nuneatonand Norwich. Compared with predictions of massed disorder, not much happened: a much bigger story, in fact, was thearrest of more than 400 peopleat demonstrations against the proscribing of Palestine Action. So, for want of a better story, the Mail on Sunday gave Jenrick – as ever, with the air of a callow opportunist flirting with mob politics – its front-page splash. “I certainly don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing,” he said. The accompanying messaging was less than subtle: an inside spread put a picture of Jenrick and his three daughters at what looked like a middle-English fete, next to an image of smiling young men “aboard a boat in France yesterday”.Just to be clear, the grim scenes that have materialised at those hotels are the signs not just of far-right activism and provocation, but broken policy. No one should underestimate how much thegrooming gangs scandalhas given many people a deep fear about the safety of women and girls, not least in places that have long felt ignored and neglected. But it is perfectly possible to acknowledge those plain facts while also highlighting something equally obvious: that the spectacle of politicians knowingly peddling inflammatory narratives is nauseating – and that, in the absence of the kind of countrywide immolation we were warned about, they are starting to look like desperate people throwing matches on kindling that refuses to ignite. That is a remarkable way for self-styled patriots to behave, and it would be nice to see a few Labour politicians loudly making such an obvious point. But we probably shouldn’t get our hopes up.Targeted by the right, Britain’s asylum hotels are places of fear and disorder. Bad political decisions made it so | Daniel TrillingRead moreOut in the real world, a lot of places suggest a social condition much more complicated than we hear from the prophets of British armageddon. The other week, I spent 36 hours in Pontefract, a classically post-industrial northern town that is part of the constituency represented by Yvette Cooper, the home secretary. Rather than a picture of incipient chaos and seething rage, it presents something much less dramatic: the feeling of a place that remains reluctantly locked into decline, but that also has a palpable and defiant community spirit. Its local council faces an £88m budget deficit over the next five years, and is in the midst of even more cuts; the everyday scene on its main streets suggests a quiet stoicism that the forces responsible for its predicament really don’t deserve.Neither Farage nor Jenrick’s parties offer anything that would assist its renewal and revival. The people who live there, in fact, deserve something a lot better than warnings that they are about to be plunged into civil war and social meltdown – issued, as ever, by the kind of privileged and cynical politicians who follow a time-honoured script: warning of apocalypse while keeping a very safe distance from the places they say are about to go up in flames.John Harris is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s why that’s importantGwen PearsonYes, they can be hard to spot – but this find highlights how little we know about creatures crucial to our ecosystemGwen Pearson is adjunct professor at Michigan State University Department of EntomologySun 10 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 16.35 EDTShareScientists recently announced they had found anenormous new stick insectin Australia. At 41cm in length and weighing 44g, the main question I heard was: “Why didn’t scientists notice something that big before now?”The short answer is: it’s a stick. Stick insects spent over 100m years perfecting their cosplay as leaves, branches and moss. They are diabolically difficult to spot, even with fairly acute human vision. If you disturb a stick insect, its usual response is to fall to the ground and lie still. So now you are looking for a stick lying on the ground … among all the other sticks.Scientists were alerted to the presence of this new insect,Acrophylla alta,by a photo posted on iNaturalist, the community science sharing site. Based on that image, they spent several nights tramping through a rainforest with headlamps and flashlights, hoping for a glimpse of this rare new beast. They eventually located and knocked the stick insect off of its perch, which can be 30 metres up in the tree canopy, with a long (actual) stick.Phasmids (stick and leaf insects) are an incredible example of natural selection at work. As herbivores quietly munching leaves, stick insects are a delicious snack for many other animals. Evolution shaped the 3,500-plus described species of phasmids into stunning examples of camouflage, usually by pretending to be objects that are irrelevant to predators: sticks, bark and leaves. They solved the problem of hiding in plain sight through a variety of forms most beautiful and wonderful; their bodies range from long skinny tubes to wide and flattened leaf shapes.Stick insects are grouped into delightful categories with names like broad prickly sticks, winged bark huggers, stout crawlers, narrow leaf mimics andtree lobsters. The last is a group best described as insects that gave up on the whole delicate leaf and twig act to become heavily armoured, spiny tanks – determined to make a predator profoundly regret ever trying to eat them.As a former keeper of stick and leaf insects in a bug zoo, I can attest to just how good these animals are at being invisible. Even when you knew there were exactly 10 leaf insects in a cage, finding numbers 9 and 10 always involved a long manual search of every single branch and leaf, sometimes requiring multiple people. Jungle nymphs (Heteropteryx dilatata) are 17cm lime-green spiky monsters that somehow manage to disappear into foliage despite their size. Often you only discovered one by getting a painful kick from a spiny leg.The recently described Australian stick insect also lives in a rainforest tree canopy, so it’s not surprising it remained hidden for so long. Insects and their relatives are the animals science knows the least about, despite being some of the most abundant organisms on Earth. After almost three centuries of taxonomic research, scientists have only described andnamed about 1m insect species; thousands of new species are added to that total yearly.View image in fullscreenThisAcrophylla altais 41cm long and weighs 44g.Photograph: Professor Angus Emmott, James Cook University/ReutersThe question is not why weird new insects keep getting described by science, but why there aren’t more strange insects, spiders and other relatives with extra legs being discovered daily. Research suggests that at least 5m insect species exist, and insects and their relatives (arthropods) make up 85% of all known animal species. To put that in context, there are as many species ofjust ladybirdsas there are of all mammals combined.The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species is a good benchmark to get a sense of how little we know. IUCN is the primary information source on the global conservation status of animal species, but its database lists only 1.3% of known insect species for evaluation. For the entire category of insects, the most species-rich animals on our planet, IUCN’s data table simply says “insufficient coverage”. It simply doesn’t have enough data toestimate the percentageof threatened insect species.Naming and describing is just the first step of understanding and preserving our biological diversity. For many species, we have no idea where they live, what they eat, or what their lives are like. Of the insects listed in the IUCN database, 26% are listed as “data deficient”. This adorable littlewillowherb leafcutter beeis extinct in the UK, and we don’t know enough about it to say much more than that.By focusing on large, charismatic animals, we miss understanding the little animals that run our world and provide essential ecosystem services. It’s little invertebrates that pollinate plants, feed birds and other animals, and keep soils healthy. They deserve to be studied as much, or more, than their bigger vertebrate kin. Concentrating on common threats to animals, big and small, can help us make better choices about prioritising research and conservation.Gwen Pearson is adjunct faculty at Michigan State University Department of Entomology.

She’s all of those things, but she is also a madwoman, who on her first night out in England from Zimbabwe was shocked by how cold it was after leaving her flat in a short skirt and heels, no jacket. She was pushed into hockey, literally, by her friend, who shoved her out of the line when the coach asked for a volunteer. I am named after that friend. My mother is both a protester and a nurturer; she has been teargassed at least twice (that I know of) while protesting in the name of human rights. Her life is a series of near misses and question marks, which I enjoy learning about and am sometimes horrified by.Given the obvious richness of her experience, I have asked her many times why she decided to have children. I couldn’t figure out why somebody who had such a full life would want to risk changing it for anything. When I was a teenager, she jokingly responded that she was bored. But as I get older, my curiosity has only grown. Because of her difficulties with endometriosis, the chances of her having children were slim. Becoming an older, black mother sounded even harder, with the risks associated with so-called geriatric pregnancies andsystemic racism within maternal health settings.One day, we were having a conversation at home, laughing about one of those interior design shows in which the couple had a child on the way and another running around, when I asked her again why she decided to have children when everything about it sounds so stressful and tiring. “I wanted to be a mother on my own terms. Not anyone else’s,” she told me. And then she went on: “Everyone has this magical idea of a baby. But those babies don’t stay babies.” By this, I understood that she never felt any pressure to have children because she had always looked at children as separate beings – not as possessions or boxes to tick or part of a life plan. What it said about her attitude to life – the determination to raise a person rather than be a mother for the sake of it – really floored me.Everyone asks me about my plans for having children. A nest of noisy miner birds has taught me how to respond | Joseph EarpRead more“What about getting married?” I asked her, and she answered with an indescribable look that I have yet to capture on camera. She told me she had never wanted to be a wife. Not that she thought marriage was a bad thing; in fact, her own parents had a long, happy marriage. But her father once told her that marriage and giving birth were not exactly achievements. Living a life worth talking about, where you made a difference, big or small, caring for other people – that is what mattered. That was the example she should give to children she might have. And that’s what she tried to do.And so, in her mid-30s, she decided she was ready to pass on what she had experienced and learned to a new generation.I told her: “I don’t think I’ll ever have children.” I had said so on many occasions, usually after babysitting a younger cousin or friend’s child – the best form of birth control. However, I wondered, did my mother wish to be a grandmother? My early childhood is filled with fond memories and pictures of her mother, my Gogo. She was excited to be a grandmother, for her daughter to have daughters.But she shrugged and said: “Good. You could change your mind, but someone who realises early on that they don’t want children is someone who recognises the immense responsibility it is.” If children were meaningful to me, that was good. If not, still good. She had a life before, during and after me. She has her bookcases full of novels, a rack full of good wine and holidays planned for herself in business class. We were her joy – but not the only thing in life that brought her joy. Her approach has always been: live a good life, do something meaningful. Basically, just don’t kill anyone.I do not have children. Maybe that will change; it is highly likely it will not. But I am always comforted to know that whether I raise dogs, alpacas, cats or even children, my mother will be fine with my choices.Michaela Makusha is a freelance journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hood 2 Farm sees him trying to learn the skills, and turning his wild, slapstick journey into hilarious TVShaad D'SouzaSun 10 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 03.01 EDTShareIn Hood 2 Farm, a 76-year-old shepherd is explaining his daily routine. “There’s only my wife and I, and when she gets out of bed, I get in, and when I get out of bed, she gets in,” he says. The south London rapper Fekky pauses, before saying: “If you don’t mind me asking, if she’s getting out of bed, you’re getting in bed, when are you …hugging up, man?” The farmer laughs and replies: “It’s not happening, chap!” to Fekky’s clear horror.This kind of interaction is common on Hood 2 Farm, a unique and genuinely inspired YouTube series about the rapper’s attempt to become the steward of his own farm. Across eight 30-minute episodes, he meets farmers from around the UK and learns basics such as milking cows, shearing sheep and driving tractors.The resulting show wraps genuine insight about agricultural practice in the screwball energy of classic British comedy, thanks to Fekky’s perpetual fish-out-of-water spirit – he is fond of wearing a Gucci cap on the farm – and clear passion for nature. With some episodes netting well over 100,000 views, the unconventional series has been a hit, and Fekky says he plans to continue with future seasons.Fekky, 38, says the idea began before lockdown, when he went on holiday to Thailand to decompress from the pressures of life in the music industry. As a rapper, Fekky has played to crowds of thousands, appearedalongside Dizzee Rascal,collaborated with Skeptaand started his own label, F Music, but has often talked about his struggles with alcohol use and anxiety. “After my long music career, I just decided to have a break – a lot of it gets very busy and gets wild,” he says over a video call. “I just fell in love with nature in Thailand.”I said to myself that I should learn farming but show everyone, especially the youth, what I’m doing – so as I learn, they learnWhen he got home, London was plunged into lockdown, and he began gardening as a way to pass the time, documenting his progress on social media. “I realised there were a lot of people that were engaged and loved seeing me doing it, I think because I was a fish out of water,” he says. He decided he “wanted to live in nature full time”, so he bought a plot of land – which he has dubbed F Manor – and decided to leave London for good, while continuing to post farm content. “I just said to myself that I should basically learn farming but show everyone that’s watching, especially the youth, what I’m doing – so as I’m learning, they can learn,” he says.The posts were a runaway success, and people began messaging him asking when his next piece of farm content would go live, “so it made sense for me to do a show about farming”. The only problem, of course, was that he “didn’t know nothing” about farming, and had never set foot on a farm until he bought one. His family back in Nigeria are farmers, he says, “so I knew it must be something in the family, but I had no idea”.View image in fullscreen‘You’re stepping into the unknown every time’ … Fekky in Hood 2 Farm.When he decided to visit other farms, he was shocked by how little he knew about where our food comes from. “A pig farm is like … I thought pigs weresmall, like that” – he holds his hands about 10 inches apart – “I didn’t realise pigs were, like,massive,” he says, still astounded. “You see food on a plate, but you never think about where it’s coming from. The first thing I learned about having chickens was like … it’s weird to think you’re eating chicken … but then Ilovemy chickens, if that makes sense.”You can see Fekky experiencing all this in real time onHood 2 Farm, which rivals some sitcoms in its laughs-per-minute ratio. It’s amazing to see how game Fekky is to puncture his own tough-guy rapper image. In the first episode, he gets hit in the face by a cow’s tail while attempting to milk it, admits he previously thought a cow’s teats were “willies”, and asks a farmer whether milk is actually just semen – to her dumbstruck confusion. In Fekky’s mind, there hasn’t been a single wildest moment of learning to farm – the entire process has been totally shocking.“A cow tried to hit me!” he says. “Even sheep, I was trying to herd sheep, and it was just crazy – they’re going everywhere! And I never thought I would have 10,000 bees all over me. You’re just walking straight into that craziness. Just being comfortable around animals was the hardest part – all the animals are big, and if you run into something where you don’t know what it can do, there’s a danger element. But it didn’t end up being dangerous, you just feel a bit, like, out of your depth.”The feeling of being around the animals, he says, isn’t so dissimilar to being on stage. “You’re stepping into the unknown every time,” he says. “The similarity is the adrenaline rush you get when performing on stage or when I’m with animals – because, like I said, it feels dangerous – but then after that, it’s like, it’s all right.”We live a very wild lifestyle as rappers; hotel to hotel, show to show. Nature gives you the balanceSince making the pivot to farm life, Fekky has found that his friends and family have been more than supportive – “a lot of my rapper friends all want to come to the farm” – and have been amazed to find that growing your own food can come with benefits on multiple levels. “When I give my eggs, which I get from my chickens, to my friends, they say they taste so much better than from any shop,” he says. “I think I’ve opened people’s eyes to eating food that you’re growing yourself. Something about it just tastes real.”The greatest benefit for him personally, he says, is on his overall mental health and wellbeing. “I think nature in general is very healing, and we live a very wild lifestyle as rappers; hotel to hotel, show to show,” he says. “Going into farming gives you the balance. We shouldn’t pigeonhole ourselves to one thing in our careers. After a while, you should start thinking about how diverse you can be, and what else can you do in life? Even if it’s just a hobby.”That’s the lesson he wants to impart to black British kids who might be watching. “I just hope the youth understand that where you start in life is not where you finish. You have to explore the world and open your thoughts. I think when we grow up, you see people like myself being rappers or footballers, and these are the most cliche careers that people think you have to go into to make it. I want you to understand that you can be you, you can explore, you can do farming, and you’ll be accepted and find happiness.”Hood 2 Farmis on YouTubeExplore more on these topicsTelevisionGrimeSkeptaDizzee RascalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Featuring scenes of rape and violence in a Sikh gurdwara, the ambitious state-of-the-nation work stirredhuge controversyamong religious communities when it premiered, and had its run at the Birmingham Rep cancelled following violent protests.Bhatti has since gone on to create similarly confronting work, including her recent touring play about prison motherhood, Scenes from Lost Mothers, as well as penning a coercive control storyline for The Archers. But those theatregoers expecting a continuation of this challenging storytelling may be disappointed by her latest work, Choir. Set during rehearsal sessions for a community choir who are preparing for a potential big break on TV, the play is more comic than visceral; more sitcom than Sarah Kane.The eight-person ensemble cast are tight-knit and lively, tackling musical numbers such as Queen’s Somebody to Love and the Eagles’ Hotel California with harmonic aplomb, while director Hannah Joss’s slick musical scene transitions add pace and rhythm to the script. But the characterisations are disappointingly clunky, giving us the likes of kooky pensioner Sheila, lonely divorcee Ken, diva-like former star Paul and troubled but promising upstart Freddie.View image in fullscreenKooky … Annie Wensak and Timothy Speyer as Sheila and KenPhotograph: Helen MurrayGroup dynamics play out predictably in the first half, as newcomer Freddie steals the spotlight from usual soloist Paul, and the stress caused by the TV crew’s imminent arrival leads choir founder Morgan (an energetic and engaging Laura Checkley) to make a compromising decision.Secrets abound and slapstick gags lead to panto laughs. Thankfully though, as the play’s final acts arrive, a series of emotional denouements elevate it. Danusia Samal as happy-go-lucky Anna delivers a beautifully muted monologue that reveals the sadness behind her plastered-on smile, while a standout scene between Keenan Munn-Francis’s shy Freddie and James Gillan’s acerbic Paul produces a moving rendition of Sinead O’Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U.Revelations come quickly and the show’s finale lands with a heartwarming flutter.

In addition, there have been a rash of documentaries, produced in various countries around the world, as well as a dramatic depiction of him played by actor Penn Badgley in a movie whose title alludes to his musical father,Greetings from Tim Buckley. Collectively, that places him in the realm of other departed stars, including Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis and Eva Cassidy, whose catalogues have been mined for every ounce of gold they can possibly produce.‘There just aren’t words to explain’: Jeff Buckley documentary brings tears to SundanceRead moreIn that context, the title of the new Jeff Buckley documentary,It’s Never Over, could easily read like a threat. Luckily, nothing could be further from the truth. The film winds up giving a largely familiar story a holistic reach like no project before it. However picked over the bones of Buckley’s story may be, director Amy Berg has found fresh flesh by emphasizing the crucial role women played in his life starting with his mother, Mary Guibert, and fanning out to various girlfriends, most of whom are fellow artists who sometimes doubled as spiritual collaborators. Together, they show how a female spirit not only shaped Buckley’s early life, it also provided a foundational part of his art. The earliest songs he sang as a kid were voiced by women, from Diana Ross’s yearning reading of Ain’t No Mountain High Enough to Judy Garland’s self-immolating take on The Man Who Got Away. “I wanted to be a chanteuse,” Buckley says in a vintage audio interview used in the film. “Secretly, I think I wanted to be Nina Simone.”You can hear the connection in the intensity, range and sustain of his quaver, which also drew from the qawwali chants of the Pakistani devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. In the film, Buckley refers to Khan as “my Elvis”. At the same time, he drew profound inspiration from classically macho sources, initially through the scorched earth whomp of Led Zeppelin and, later, via the chest-beating yowls of Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell. The breadth of those gender identifications allowed Buckley to idealize the Jungian concept of anima, which asserts that men have to recognize their feminine side in order to fully embrace their humanity, as well as to truly understand the role of women in their lives. In one vintage quote in the film, Buckley says, “I decided to make a woman of music and give myself to her. At another point, I decided to make a man of music and give myself to him,” adding for good measure: “Music was my mother. It was my father. It was the best thing in my life.”That last line can’t be easy to hear for his actual mother, who co-produced the film and who guards his estate like a sentry, deciding who from his life can speak for him and who cannot. To her credit, Guibert allowed director Berg to cast Jeff’s early years with her in a far from soft light. She was just a teenager when he was born, the product of a fleeting relationship with the visionary cult singer Tim Buckley. At the time, he was on the rise (or at least seemed to be), and, in his ambition, he ignored both her and the coming child. Five months into her pregnancy, Guibert recalls in the film, “I knew I was never going to see Tim again.”While Tim Buckley ran off to pursue his dreams, her ambitions of being an actor and musician withered under the responsibility of raising the child. She’s honest in the film about her own immaturity at the time, which meant that Jeff had to mother her in ways that came to haunt and anger him. The only time he saw his father was during several days they spent together when Jeff was a boy. His later attempts to reach his dad were ignored, then made impossible when Tim died of a heroin overdose at age 28 in 1975. Jeff harbored dark feelings afterwards, complicated further by the fact that music – his savior and muse – bound him inescapably to the man who abandoned him.View image in fullscreenJeff Buckley in 1994.Photograph: Dave Tonge/Getty ImagesJeff’s path to a career in music has been chronicled endlessly elsewhere and it’s dutifully recalled in the film. Yet seldom, if ever, has the story had as caring a context as the one provided by the friends and lovers who spoke to Berg. They paint a portrait of someone whose insecurities and neurosis ran in tandem with his talent and daring. When Grace appeared and artists of the order of David Bowie and Robert Plant fell over themselves to praise him in interviews, Buckley buckled under the expectations of their awe. He was just as itchy about his anointment by People magazine as one of the “most beautiful” men alive. A girlfriend in the film recalls him buying every copy of the magazine he could get his hands on so he could throw them in the trash.Stark as the contrast may have been between his often ugly view of himself and the beauty of his outward appearance, there’s no denying the part it played in his myth. Like Jackson Browne, Buckley’s soulful brand of handsomeness ideally mirrored the sensitivity and refinement of his art.The man behind that face is presented here as someone simultaneously confused and playful, sweet and lost. For a fresh insight, friends tell Berg they think he may have been manic depressive, a term given little airing back in the 90s, when Buckley died by accidentally drowning in the Mississippi River. Another coup for the film is the inclusion of voicemails he left for his mother, including one in which he excoriates her for her deficiencies and another in which he honors her perseverance and unwavering love for him. Despite that support, friends say Buckley had no idea how to grow into a mature man. As deeply as that vexed him, his melding of genders in his art allowed him to live his short life with the androgynous freedom of a child.Today Buckley would be 58, an unimaginable age for someone whom fate has forced us to see as forever young. Now he exists solely on a plane he might well appreciate, where he’s less a person than a sound, a soul captured wholly in song.It’s Never Over:Jeff Buckleyis out now in US cinemasExplore more on these topicsJeff BuckleyDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But could audiences be tempted to try something a little different?Tim DowlingSun 10 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 10 Aug 2025 13.24 EDTShareThis is the summer of the live immersive experience – Elvis, Grease, Traitors Live – but the biggest shows are expensive and tickets are already selling out. Never fear: there are plenty of other experiences out there for anyone looking to get immersed on a budget, or to try something a bit different. But what? We had a look at a few we could imagine happily queueing for. Book now, while places remain.White Lotus LiveThis former grain storage and processing facility, a short coach ride from central Birmingham, has been transformed into a luxury resort for the month of August, where you won’t just see how the other half lives – you’ll live how the other half lives, until one of you dies horribly (see our T&Cs). Experience the spiritual hollowness at the core of extreme privilege first-hand, while sipping luxury cocktails on the sands of our artificial beach (if you choose to swim, please be aware that the lifeguards are actors), while events around you move inexorably towards tragedy. Nightly shows begin at 7.30pm, but the bar opens at midday.Once Removed: Tribute Band Summer Festival ExperienceThe closest thing to watching your favourite band being impersonated live: a big-screen surround-sound festival evening featuring AI renderings of up to a dozen of Britain’s finest rock and pop tribute acts, including Phoney M, Not the Hoople, Re:Prince, Sham Sham 69 and Proxy Music. The only difference between this show and the real thing (not therealthing; see our FAQs) is the ticket prices, which start at a fiver for cash (dynamic pricing applies).Mickey 17: the Live MusicalThe live rights to this big-budget Robert Pattinson vehicle were acquired long before the film proved to be the box office flop of 2025. That’s why there is still availability throughout August, at prices to beat any outdoor immersive experience. State-of-the-art projection technology will make you think you’re part of the crazy world of Mickey 17. Or it would do if you’d seen it.MasterChef in the ParkEver wonder what it’s like to present a BBC cooking contest? This is your chance! The chefs are all professionals, the cooking happens in real time, the tense music is provided by a live band and you are one of the judges. MasterChef in the Park is more than a free admission immersive experience – it’s an open audition, and we’re in a bit of a hurry, so delete your social media account, get some headshots done and come on down.View image in fullscreenWould you go in search of a realistic recreation of a bus-sized agglomeration of cooking fat and baby wipes?Photograph: Thames Water/PAFatberg Subterranean ChallengeLucky ticket-holders are directed to a secret location in central London, where they’ll don hazmat suits before descending into a stunningly realistic recreation of an overburdened Victorian sewer. The journey is almost a kilometre long, with the only exit blocked by a bus-sized agglomeration of cooking fat and baby wipes.Can you dig your way free (spades provided) in time for light refreshments (not included in ticket price) at the far end? Rumours that this immersive experience is just a cheap way of addressing an acute manpower shortage have been denied by the production company (see FAQs). Either way, you’ll never put bacon grease down the sink again.Explore more on these topicsCultureImmersive theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Windblown,Karine Polwartcommemorates an Edinburgh institution of similar longevity. And she does it exquisitely.Her focus isthe sabal palmthat stood in the Royal Botanic Garden for more than 200 years and, even before that, grew in the original gardens at the top of Leith Walk. It outgrew the original glass house within decades and towered over generations of visitors until, in 2021, this oldest living specimen in the collection had to be chopped down.You might have expected a protectionist response from Polwart, but she does not question the necessity of the renovations to the Victorian palm houses that are now under way as part of theEdinburgh Biomesproject, designed to secure the future of the collection’s 13,500 plant species. Rather, her tone is elegiac, not least because this is also a lockdown-era story, haunted by loss and the need for reflection.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianFollowing the format of her equally sublimeWind Resistance, she blends songs, poetry and spoken word, all delivered in soothing, honeyed tones, to celebrate the wondrous natural beauty of the tree and to praise the generations of keepers who ensured its survival. With co-composer Pippa Murphy, Polwart was artist in residence at the Botanics, and in Windblown she draws on conversations with staff whose dedication to the plants is as personal as it is professional.One observes that on the day his dog was due to be put down, he still gave it a treat in the morning. The palm commands similar dedication and respect until the very end. “For the time is nearly over,” goes Polwart’s repeated refrain, set to an appropriately timeless folk melody.Accompanied by Dave Milligan on grand piano, she stands beneath a wild feathery arrangement of fronds designed by Neil Haynes and lit in ever-changing colours by Lizzie Powell, as Jamie Wardrop’s sparkling watery video projections suggest the epic journey from Bermuda (and its colonialist implications). Through it all, Polwart attributes to generations ofEdinburghcitizens an enterprise of everyday love, care and attention.AtQueen’s Hall, Edinburgh, until 13 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalKarine PolwartTheatreEdinburghreviewsShareReuse this content"

Lauren (Michelle Monteith) tells us that Luke (David Patrick Flemming), who enters the stage beside her, will tell her story. Later, we find out that she is a journalist, and so perfectly capable of telling it herself. Yet the telling is ceded to Luke.It begins with a newspaper assignment for a case of domestic abuse. She speaks to the survivor, the perpetrator and the company boss who re-employed the latter despite his assault. The experience sends Lauren to her own past – traumatic memories of being sexually violated and raped by a family member. Cleverly directed by Christian Barry, there is tension and horror. You lean in and listen. Lauren looks on as her story is narrated by Luke, her face registering the shocks.View image in fullscreenThe power of telling … David Patrick Flemming as Luke with Michelle Monteith in Red Like Fruit.Photograph: Riley SmithPremiering in Edinburgh, the acclaimed Canadian playwright Hannah Moscovitch’s drama this week won a Fringe First award. Its themes overlap with those inInter Alia, currently playing at the National Theatre in London, and Heidi Schreck’s masterfulWhat the Constitution Means to Me.So what niggles and makes Red Like Fruit feel, beneath the surface, confected? In its framing, with Luke speaking for Lauren, there is an obvious analogy of the way women’s stories are often silenced or co-opted by men.But what is Lauren’s position? Is she pointing this out, in silent condemnation, or is she willingly deferring the power of her testimony to Luke? She later explains that words are simply more believed when men speak them. Given the low conviction rates for rape charges, where women’s accounts are challenged, this is apt. But if this is the point of Luke’s ventriloquism, it seems too obvious and slightly gimmicky.Lauren is a strangely drawn character. She has internalised the misogyny, talking about the overweight women in her therapy group, and thinking herself a failure for being there, reassuring herself that she is a successful mother and wife. And she is slowly rising up against the conditioning to stay quiet about men’s damaging behaviour.But she is too naive: charmed by the company boss who justifies domestic violence and knowing she’s angry but not sure about what. What makes rape at the hands of a family member any different from sex that you regret, she asks Luke. It sounds too basic a question on consent from a journalist working on a domestic violence case, about a subject that has been in the air for many years. It all feels pre rather than post #MeToo. Maybe that is the point?None of these worries detract from the dramatic power of this piece. Tension remains strong, and the stories of abuse and undermining of women linger long afterwards. It’s just the mode of their telling that feels off.AtTraverse theatre, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsTheatreFestivalsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalDomestic violenceWomenMenreviewsShareReuse this content"

The singer is alleged to have conceived a child during a fling in 1976.Photograph: Steve Jennings/WireImageFreddie MercuryClaim Freddie Mercury had secret daughter divides fans and friendsWoman claiming the late singer is her father speaks out after some of his inner circle cast doubt ahead of new bookLanre BakareArts and culture correspondentSun 10 Aug 2025 09.10 EDTFirst published on Sun 10 Aug 2025 08.30 EDTShareHis performances defined an era, and his life story has been dissected intell-all booksas well ason the big screen.But now further revelations may open up an unknown chapter in the life ofFreddie Mercury.The question of whether or not Mercury had a secret daughter, whom he told no one about and would now be 48-years-old, has divided fans and the closest people in his life.A forthcoming book by Lesley-Ann Jones tells of a woman known only as B, who claims that the woman is in fact theQueenfrontman’s daughter – conceived during a fling with the wife of a close friend in 1976.“Freddie Mercury was and is my father,” she says in a handwritten letter. “We had a very close and loving relationship from the moment I was born and throughout the final 15 years of his life. He adored me and was devoted to me.”Little is known about B other than her age and the fact she is a medical professional working in Europe. She claims Mercury entrusted her with 17 journals that cover the final years of his life, which Jones says are “the closest thing to a Freddie Mercury autobiography that the world will ever know”.The claims, whichfirst emerged in Mayand were apparently common knowledge among Mercury’s inner circle, have been met with mounting pushback from some people who knew the singer best.When asked about B, the Queen guitarist Brian May said he wanted to remain “neutral”. However, his wife, the former EastEnders star Anita Dobson,dismissed the claimsas “fake news”. Mary Austin, a close friend of the singer, also doubted whether Mercury would have kept the fact he had a daughter secret from his inner circle.“Freddie had a glorious openness, and I cannot imagine he would have wanted to, or been able to, keep such a joyful event a secret, either from me or other people closest to him,” Austintold the Sunday Times.Austin inherited about half of an estimated £9m estate that Mercury left after the singer, who was diagnosed with Aids in 1987, diedaged 45of bronchial pneumonia in 1991.Mercury had relationships with men and women (including Austin) and described himself as bisexual.“The truth is that I am simply not the guardian of such a secret,” said Austin. “I’ve never known of any child, or of any diaries. If Freddie had indeed had a child without me knowing anything about it, that would be astonishing to me.”The woman referred to as B responded by saying she was “devastated” by Austin’s comments.Bob Geldof told Freddie Mercury ‘don’t get clever’ before 1985 Live Aid setRead moreJones – whose book Love, Freddie will be published next month – defended the validity of the claimswhen they first emerged, saying that a DNA test had been conducted that supported the version of events presented in her Mercury biography.She also pointed to the lack of a vocal rejection of the claims by the remaining members of Queen as further evidence that the details in her book were true.“What I would say is that the real inner circle – the other members of Queen and Freddie’s sister – would have denied this if they could, weeks ago, when the story broke,” Jones said. “They cannot because, as Freddie’s daughter says, they know that it is true.”Jones, who has written a series of books about music’s biggest names, has been talking up more revelations that appear in Love, Freddie – claiming she has been “crafting a narrative that will overturn everything we thought we knew about him and his legacy”.Explore more on these topicsFreddie MercuryQueennewsShareReuse this content"

As a newcomer with a passion for nature, I remember being eager to soak up the region’s archipelago of 30,000 islands and rocky outposts. But I was overwhelmed by complex public ferry timetables to dozens of places ending in the letter “ö” (the Swedish word for island) and uninterested in pricey cruise boats packed with tour groups.Then a former flatmate recommended Nynäshamn, which is on the mainland but embodies much of the nature and spirit of Stockholm’s archipelago. It’s home to a tasteful waterfront of colourfully painted bars and restaurants and a harbour packed with boats every summer, from simple dinghies to luxury yachts. Beyond, you can look across a clean, calm stretch of Baltic Sea, towards the island of Bedarön, flanked by pine trees and a smattering of dark red detached houses.View image in fullscreenMention Nynäshamn to Stockholmers and most will probably describe it as the port you pass through to catch the four-hour ferry to Gotland – Sweden’s largest island – or an overnight cruise to Gdańsk in Poland. But for international tourists (or new Swedish residents, as I was), it is an entry-level coastal destination where you can get a taste of the city’s island life without the complex logistics.Nynäshamn is on the commuter rail line from central Stockholm, and reachable in an hour. A one-way journey costs 43 kroner (£3.30), or it’s free if you have a valid monthly or weekly pass for the capital’s public transport system. For a little more adventure, it takes a further 30 minutes to reach Nåttarö, the closest island accessible by a public ferry service (£8 each way).View image in fullscreenNynäshamn’s pleasures are just an hour by train from Stockholm.Photograph: Zoonar/AlamyMy first destination in Nynäshamn is Trehörningen,an island suburb accessible by bridge, and just a 30-minute stroll from the train station. The route takes in a mishmash of glassy new-build apartments, low-rise 1960s rent-controlled flats and mansions with manicured gardens. Nynäshamn doesn’t have the swagger of swankier seaside towns in the region, such as Sandhamn or Saltsjöbaden, but it offers a slice of real-life small town Sweden far removed from the well-trodden tourist itineraries that typically lead to Stockholm’s medieval Old Town or isolated rural retreats.“It’s very good for my health,” says Hans “Hasse” Larsson, a smiley 73-year-old former truck driver who moved to Nynäshamn from Stockholm 16 years ago. He enjoys the clean air and quiet lifestyle, and describes a stronger sense of community compared with the somewhat stiffer Swedish capital. “Even if you don’t know people very well, you’ll say ‘hej’!” he laughs.Sweden isn’t a budget destination, but thanks to a favourable exchange rate, prices aren’t extortionateSweden isn’t a budget destination, but thanks to a favourable exchange rate, prices aren’t extortionate compared with those in popular British seaside destinations I’ve visited, such as Brighton or St Ives. On Trehörningen island, it costs from just over £100 a night to rent a compact wooden cottage for two fromOskarsgatan 12 B&B. A breakfast buffet and spa entry package at the nearbyNynäs Havsbad hotelworks out at around £45. The spa’s pavilion is a reconstruction of an art nouveau-inspired resort built in 1906, complete with an outdoor hot tub, a sauna and panoramic views. The hotel complex includes original buildings from the early 20th century, when it was a base for sailors during the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games.From here, it’s a short walk to Strandvägen, a French riviera-inspired waterfront road built for spectators of sailing. As locals will proudly tell you, it is the only place in the Stockholm archipelago region where you can see the horizon from the mainland. The scenic route winds towards Lövhagen, a wooded area offering shady trails and picnic tables. There are rocky swimming coves too – although, with average outdoor temperatures of 18C in July and August, the chilly waters won’t be to everyone’s taste.View image in fullscreenThe spa pavilion of the Nynäs Havsbad hotel is a reconstruction of a 1906 art nouveau-inspired resortFor walkers, Nynäshamn is also a gateway toSörmlandsleden, a system of hiking trails covering around 620 miles in total and clearly marked with orange arrows and painted tree markers. Section 5:1 from Nynäshamn passes through mossy forests and grassy farmland to the village of Osmö, where you can catch a train back to Nynäshamn or continue another nine miles to Hemfosa, snaking past Lake Muskan’s glistening waters.Back at Nynäshamn’s main harbour, the restaurants are filling up with tourists hungry for lunch. The most famous spot isNynäs Rökeri, a smokehouse dating back almost 40 years, where a platter of smoked salmon, seafood and potato salad costs less than £20. The adjacent delicatessen stocks fresh fish and classic Swedish treats, from cheesyvästerbottenpie to crispbreads and lingonberry jam. A nearby courtyard is shared with customers visiting the ice-cream storeLejonet & Björnen, a small cafe and a gift shop.The sweet smell of cinnamon wafts in the air and I spot the familiar logo ofSkeppsbro Bageri, an award-winning Stockholm bakery that has a food truck parked on the waterfront, packed with fresh bread, buns and pastries. “I like it here,” says Emelie Elison, the 24-year-old student who is working in the van for her third summer in a row. “There are a lot of people and there’s always something happening.”View image in fullscreenEmelie Elison in the Skeppsbro bakery truck.Photograph: Maddy SavageSweden’s cities empty out in July, as locals flock to the coast to spend the summer in wooden holiday cottages. There are more than 600,000 of these holiday homes, known asfritidshus, which are often passed down through generations; almost half of children with at least one Swedish parent have access to one. They also have plenty of time to enjoy them – most Swedish employees are entitled to four consecutive weeks off each summer.After a grey morning, the sun comes out as I join the ferry queue for Nåttarö. Many around me are armed with bags of groceries, backpacks and even suitcases, intending to stay at least a week. But one sporty-looking couple, carrying only tiny running backpacks, tell me they are fellow day-trippers from Stockholm, planning to run a six-mile loop oftheStockholm Archipelago Trail, a newly marked hiking and trail-running route stretching 167 miles across 20 islands.Most tourists visiting Nåttarö take things at a slower pace. It’s a small, car-free island with just one convenience store and two restaurantsMost tourists visiting Nåttarö take things at a slower pace. It’s a small, car-free island with one simple convenience store and two restaurants by the harbour. The main draws are the pine-lined walking trails, rocky clifftops and sandy beaches. There are50 wooden cabins for hire(sleeping up to six people, £90 a night). The campsite is priced at less than £5 a night, including access to pristine showers, compost toilets and dishwashing facilities. Wild camping is allowed too, thanks toallemansrätten,Sweden’s right to roam policy.Where Swedes holiday in Sweden: five locals’ favouritesRead moreI take a 1¼-mile trail to Skarsand, a small beach in the north-east of the island. I have fond memories of celebrating a friend’s 40th birthday here a couple of years ago, when we camped with friends and their kids, cooking dinner on the beach’s public grill. Today, despite being peak holiday season, I have it all to myself, save for some passing hikers.The sunny afternoon passes quickly, and a couple of hours later I’m back on the ferry for Nynäshamn. The Stockholm pair have made it too, having successfully completed their run. They are eagerly awaiting a pizza reward atMaggan’s, another popular restaurant in Nynäshamn’s harbour, and tell me they’ve squeezed clean T-shirts into their backpacks to change into. I’m planning a sunny evening drink on the waterfront too. Tomorrow I’ll be at my desk, catching up on emails – and researching my next coastal adventure.Explore more on these topicsSweden holidaysStockholm holidaysScandinavia holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Far easier to pull off than a pie, but more impressive than a crumble, cobblers are a great way to use a bargain tray of overripe or bruised fruit, should you be lucky to come across such a thing.The fruitView image in fullscreenAmerica’s Test Kitchen peels the fruit, to remove ‘any unpleasantly leathery bits of skin’ from its cobbler. All thumbnail photographs by Felicity Cloake.Peaches, obviously – but peaches in the UK will not usually be as fresh as those in the American south, which means we have to adjust our expectations accordingly. A couple of recipes call explicitly for “ripe but firm” fruit, which does not mean those cannonballs sold as ready-to-eat in many British retailers; I speak from bitter experience when I assure you that a peach that is crunchy when raw will still be al dente once baked. Though not squashy, the fruit ought to give a little under your fingertips (a good fruit vendor should be happy to pick some out for you, though sadly our supermarkets do not offer that service, so you’ll have to take it on trust or do some discreet andgentlesqueezing).That said, even in the south, there’s a delightfully bitchy hierarchy of peaches, with Villas instructing the reader ofThe Glory of Southern Cookingto “forget most of what you’ve heard about Georgia peaches. Yes, Georgia peaches are certainly far superior to the pulpy, bitter peaches they grow in California, but where I go for sweet peach perfection is to the South Carolina Piedmont region, intersected by Interstate 77 and, more specifically, to the Peach Tree and other orchards in and around Filbert. Peach fanatics from as far away as Pennsylvania and Kentucky flock to the Peach Tree every summer to see and smell and taste the luscious early belles, white ladies, lorings and indian red clings”. Meanwhile, I head to the greengrocers.Controversially, I will not be peeling the fruit. Everyone peels the fruit, I know, because they seem to have an aversion to what America’s Test Kitchen (ATK) terms“any unpleasantly leatherybits of skin”, but, as with apples, tomatoes and even potatoes, I happen to like a bit of chew – a skinless peach feels like a tinned peach to me, and though tinned peaches have their place (a hotel breakfast buffet), it’s not what I’m after here. Plus, a ripe peach is a pain to peel. (I can almost hear the southerners murderously murmuring: “Bless her heart”).The juicesRipe peaches are a very wet fruit, which proves a problem in recipes such as the one inMcDonald’s bookDeep South, where they’re used raw – this proves the first clue to perhaps the most important lesson I learn about peach cobbler: the dish should always be placed on a rimmed baking sheet, because if it can bubble over, you can bet your bottom dollar it will. Cutting the fruit into chunky wedges, as he suggests, rather than slices, is a good start; too thin, and they have a tendency to dissolve into perfumed mush in the oven.View image in fullscreenEmily Meggett’s peach cobbler swaps the top crust in favour of a buttery sponge batter.Like ATK , McDonald uses cornflour to thicken those juices (Edna Lewis prefers plain flour) but, to my mind, more muscular action is required to stem the tide. While this shouldn’t be a dry dish, equally, too much juice will make the topping soggy.Chef Joe Randall’s recipe in the book he co-authored with Toni Tipton-Martin, A Taste of Heritage, marinates his peaches with sugar, flour and spices to draw out the juices, then simmers them until those juices start to thicken – yet with similarly liquid results. I’m beginning to suspect that ATK’s claim that “most of the juices are not released until the peaches are almost fully cooked” is correct.My multi-prong solution, like ATK’s, is to drain off some of the liquid produced by mixing peaches with sugar and leaving them to sit, then to thicken that with cornflour and to pre-bake the fruit before adding the topping, to give that liquid more time to evaporate, as well as to leave enough gaps in said topping to encourage further evaporation.The flavouringEveryone uses sugar, naturally, and some in quantities that are a little too much for those not weaned on sweet tea. Randall’s dark brown sugar feels a little too treacly for this fresh fruit, but I like the idea of a lighter brown sugar with peaches – it just feels apt somehow. Almost everyone adds butter to their filling – I want to say it’s too much, but I’m afraid it does help make the syrup deliciously rich, so omit it at your own risk.View image in fullscreenBrad McDonald mixes his peaches with raspberries, ‘which, personally, I don’t care for when cooked’.Lewis, or Miss Lewis as she was properly called and is always referred to in her book with Scott Peacock, The Gift of Southern Cooking, also adds a pinch of salt, which, like the lemon juice in Meggett’s, Randall’s and the ATK recipes, helps to make the peaches taste … peachier somehow. If you happen to have some knocking around, I’d also highly recommend a dash of the almond essence in Villas’ recipe – not so much as to make the filling taste nutty, but just enough to enhance the flavour of the almond’s close cousin, the peach.McDonald mixes the peaches with raspberries – which, personally, I don’t care for when cooked (they break down completely in the peach juice, but if you like the idea, stick a handful in). She also adds vanilla and cinnamon, which we all like less than Miss Lewis and Randall’s nutmeg; peaches and sugar are sweet enough, after all, without enhancing that with cloyingly sweet spices. Randall’s ground cloves prove a surprise hit, but one spice feels like quite enough in a place where peaches hardly grow on trees.The toppingI thought I knew what a cobbler was until I started the research for this dish and found myself rolling out a lovely, delicately crumbly pastry for Randall’s double-crust version. Peacock helpfully explains that “in the US south, the term ‘cobbler’ is applied to a host of baked fruit desserts. To Miss Lewis, ‘cobbler’ meant a kind of deep-dish pie with fruit baked between a bottom and top layer of pastry … to other southern bakers, a cobbler might have only a top pastry crust. In Alabama, we called anything a cobbler that had fruit covered by a baked topping.” (He goes on to reminisce about “one of the more distinctive cobblers of my childhood”, from a local barbecue joint, that involved “canned peaches covered with a box of Duncan Hines Yellow Cake mix – dry – with melted butter poured over the top”.)View image in fullscreenJoe Randall’s ‘dark brown sugar feels a little too treacly for this fresh fruit’.The most distinctive cobbler I trycomes from Meggett’s book, Gullah Geechee Home Cooking, co-authored with Kayla Stewart and Trelani Michelle, on the Lowcountry cuisine of coastal South Carolina, and particularly her lifelong home, Edisto Island. Instead of a top crust, the dish is filled with a buttery sponge batter topped with peaches – it’s light, fluffy and very quick to make, though, good as all the recipes are, I like the scone-like toppings in McDonald and the ATK recipes best; if I’m serving up something called a cobbler, I don’t want it to feel like a pie or an upside-down cake, but something distinctively different, as well as emphatically American.Both recipes use fluffy drop biscuits, rather than the flakier rolled kind – for a British audience, these are more like dumplings thanrowies/butteries– which makes sense, because they’re better suited to soaking up juice (and, in keeping with the spirit of the cobbler, much quicker and easier to make). The method is similar to scones, but uses a wetter dough, moistened with McDonald’s tangy buttermilk, which my testers prefer to the more neutral but richer yoghurt in the ATK recipe. But we all agree some raising agent is required; an unleavened dough, though tasty, does have tendency to sit heavy as a stone upon the fruit. Adding it to a filling that’s already hot helps it to cook through in time, and though the biscuit itself shouldn’t be too sweet, in contrast to what lies beneath, a final topping of granulated sugar adds a delightful crunch.The accompanimentsView image in fullscreenEdna Lewis served her peach cobbler with ‘an unusual’ (but very tasty) nutmeg syrup.Miss Lewis served her peach cobbler with “an unusual” (but very tasty) nutmeg syrup, but more common pairings are vanilla ice-cream (McDonald and Randall), whipped cream (ATK) and even, non-canonically, creme fraiche or yoghurt. But ice-cream is, in my opinion, the American dream.(Note that this is good served warm as well as well as hot, but not chilled, because that makes the topping turn a little doughy. You could marinate the peaches in advance, but don’t make the biscuit dough until just before baking.)Perfect peach cobblerPrep10 minMarinate30 min+Cook45 min+Rest15 minServes6About 800g ripe but fairly firm peaches(about 4-5 medium-sized ones)2 tbsp soft light brown or demerara sugar, or white sugar if preferredA pinch of salt15g butter, diced, plus extra for greasing1½ tsp cornflour1 tbsp lemon juice¼tsp almond extract(optional)½ tsp freshly grated nutmegIce-cream, to serveFor the topping100g cold butter175g plain flour2 tbsp caster sugar¼tsp fine salt1 tsp baking powder150ml buttermilk, or 145ml milk mixed with 1 tsp lemon juice or vinegar1 tbsp demerara sugarView image in fullscreenCut the peaches into chunky wedges, scatter with the sugar and salt, then leave to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7, and grease a baking dish just large enough to hold all the fruit in a single layer.View image in fullscreenGrate or dice the 100g butter for the topping and put it in the freezer.

In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for theThe Entombmentby Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even just for a coffee and a cake atBar Giorgio, which is really just a coffee stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli’s chantilly cream-filled brioche buns for £7 a pop.Locatelli’s new arty venture is in partnership with the catering companySearcys, which controls the dining offering at a number of large, unwieldy venues – the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power station, to name just a few – as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall, Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots.View image in fullscreen‘One of the highlights of lunch’: Locatelli at the National Gallery’s roast aubergine with soy ‘ricotta’, cherry tomatoes, roast hazelnuts and basil pesto.The National Gallery, especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli’s much-famed, Michelin-starred restaurantLocanda Locatelli, where small portions of pricey pasta, drilled service and twinkly lightingcreateda charming ambience. So charming, in fact, that after yourlinguineall’asticeorstrozzapreti al pomodoro, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome.Locatelli’s skill at creating ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment, when school’s out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that’s packed with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be anywhere else but staring atThe Ambassadorsby Holbein the Younger, and are probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and panzanella antipasti.But here’s the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National Gallerya lot. Head chefImma Savinelliand general managerCostanzo Cappella, who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours,adonisesand breakfast martinis.View image in fullscreen‘Punchy’: Locatelli at the National Gallery’s calamarata with sea bream.What’s more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping hotfritto misto, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or calamarata with sea bream.Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil for dipping, which we ate with a bowl ofgiardiniera(pickled vegetables), including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with a very good soy “ricotta”, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil pesto.From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast chicken with polenta, both of them served with potatoarrosto, should one see fit. Thecontornisection, however, is a bit limited – there’s just those spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad – and I chose badly from the dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream buns.View image in fullscreenLocatelli at the National Gallery’s ‘cute’ dessert trolley.Service throughout felt as if everyone involved cared a great deal about your experience and was trying incredibly hard, even if it was the first time they’d ever worked in a restaurant, which in the current era of hospitality is really about as good as it gets. I’ll take my service pleasant, well-meaning and unpolished any day.Overall, then, there’s a lot to love about Locatelli at the National Gallery. Sure, it’s not a patch on a night out at Locanda Locatelli; it’s just a once-round-the-Botticellis followed by a bowl of fresh tagliatelle kind of gig. Not a masterpiece, but not bad.
