But where does the science end and the hype begin?Amy FlemingSun 26 Oct 2025 12.00 EDTShareLight therapy is certainly having a moment. You can now buy glowing gadgets for everything fromskin conditions and wrinklestosore musclesand gum disease, the latest beinga toothbrushenhanced with tiny red LEDs, described by its makers as “a breakthrough in at-home oral care”. Globally, the market wasworth $1bn in 2024 and is projected to grow to $1.8bn by 2035. You can even go and sit in an infrared sauna, where instead of hot coals (real or electric) heating the air, your body is warmed directly by infrared light. According to its devotees, it’s like bathing in one of those LED-lit beauty masks, boosting skin collagen, relaxing muscles, relieving inflammation and chronic health conditions while protecting against dementia.“It sounds a bit like witchcraft,” says Paul Chazot, professor in neuroscience at Durham University and a convert to the value of light therapy following 20 years of research in the field. Of course, some of light’s effects on our bodies are well established. Sunlight helps us make vitamin D, needed for bone health, immunity, muscles and more. Sunlight regulates our circadian rhythms, too, triggering the release of neurochemicals and hormones while we are awake, and winding down bodily functions for sleep as it fades into night.Sunlight-imitating lampsare a common remedy for people with seasonal affective disorder (Sad) to boost low mood in winter. So there’s no doubt we need light energy to function well.While Sad lamps tend to use a mixture of light frequencies from the blue end of the spectrum, most other light therapy devices deploy red or infrared light. In serious clinical research, such as Chazot’s investigations into the effects of infrared on brain cells (more on which, later), finding the right frequency is key. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which runs the spectrum from the lowest-energy, longest wavelengths (radio waves) to the highest-energy (gamma waves). Phototherapy, or light therapy, uses wavelengths around the middle of this spectrum, the highest energy of those being invisible ultraviolet, then visible light (all the colours we see in a rainbow) and then infrared (which we can see with night-vision goggles).UV light has been used by medical dermatologists for many years to treat chronic skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis and vitiligo. It works on the immune system within cells, “and dampens down inflammation,” says Dr Bernard Ho at the British Association of Dermatologists. “There’s lots of evidence for phototherapy.” UVA goes deeper into the skin than UVB, whereas the LEDs we see on consumer light-therapy devices (which generally deliver red, infrared or blue light) “tend to be a bit more superficial”.View image in fullscreenAn infrared light-therapy bed.Photograph: O2O Creative/Getty ImagesThe side-effects of UVB exposure, such as burning or tanning, are well known but in medical devices the light is delivered in a “narrow-band” form – meaning smaller wavelengths – which minimises the risks. “It’s supervised by a healthcare professional, so the dosage is monitored,” says Ho. And crucially, the lightbulbs are calibrated by medical technicians, “to ensure that the wavelength that’s being delivered is fit for purpose – unlike in tanning salons, where it’s a bit unregulated, and we don’t really know what wavelengths are being used”.Red and blue LEDs, he says, “aren’t really used in the medical sense, but they may help with certain conditions”. Red LEDs, it is proposed, help boost blood circulation, oxygen uptake and cell renewal in the skin, and stimulate collagen production – a key aspiration in anti-ageing effects. “The evidence is there,” says Ho. “Although it’s not strong.” In any case, amid the sea of devices now available, “we don’t know whether or not the lights emitted are reflective of the research that has been done. We don’t know the duration, how close the lights should be to the skin, whether or not that will increase the risk versus the benefit. There are lots of questions.”One of the earliest blue-light products targetedCutibacterium acnes, a microbe associated with acne. The evidence for its efficacy isn’t strong enough for it to be routinely prescribed by doctors – although, says Ho, “it’s often seen in medical spas or aesthetics practices”. Some of his patients use it as part of their routine, he says, but if they’re buying a device for home use, “we just tell them to try it carefully and to make sure it has been assessed for safety. Unless it’s a medical device, the regulation is a bit grey.”View image in fullscreenAn LED light anti-ageing mask.Photograph: AlamyMeanwhile, in a far-flung field of pioneering medical science, Chazot has been experimenting with brain cells, identifying a number of ways in which infrared can boost cellular health. “Pretty much everything I did with the light at that particular wavelength was positive and protective,” he says. It is partly these many and varied positive effects on cellular health that have driven scepticism about light therapy – that it’s too good to be true. But his research has thoroughly changed his mind in that respect.Chazot mostly works on developing drug treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, but over 20 years ago, a GP who was developing an antiviral light treatment for cold sores sought his expertise as a biologist. “He created some devices so that we could work with them with cells and with fruit flies,” he says. “I was pretty sceptical. It was an unusual wavelength of about 1070 nanometres, that nobody believed did anything biological.”What it did have going for it, though, was that it travelled through water easily, meaning it could penetrate the body more deeply.More evidence was emerging at the time that infrared light targeted the mitochondria in cells. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells, generating energy for them to function. “Every cell in your body has mitochondria, including the brain,” says Chazot, who, as a neuroscientist, decided to focus the research on brain cells. “It has been shown that in humans this light therapy increases blood flow into the brain, which is always very good.”With 1070 treatment, mitochondria also produce a small amount of a molecule known as reactive oxygen species. In low doses this substance, says Chazot, “stimulates so-called chaperone proteins which look after your mitochondria, look after your cells and also deal with the unwanted proteins”.All of these mechanisms appear promising for treating a brain disease: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-autophagy – autophagy being the process the cell uses to clear unwanted damaging proteins.View image in fullscreenA beauty therapist administering blue-light therapy on a teenage boy.Photograph: Constantinis/Getty ImagesThe last time Chazot checked the literature on using the 1070 wavelength on human dementia patients, he says, about 400 people were taking part in four studies, includinghis own initial clinical trialsin the US.Alzheimer’s Society describes research into light therapy as“promising”. However, it adds: “The research is still in its infancy and there is now not enough evidence to recommend using light therapy as an intervention in dementia.”One area where professionals have largely ditched light therapy is physiotherapy, according to Lucy Macdonald, a physiotherapistworking in Surrey. Not that this stops high-end gyms and consumer devices offering red-light and laser therapy to aid muscle recovery and reduce musculoskeletal aches and pains.Special red and infrared lasers, it has been claimed, could cause micro-injuries deep into cartilage and help it regrow. “It was considered that lower frequency levels would penetrate deeper,” says Macdonald. “Even when I first qualified, about 25 years ago, it was still being used. But no one uses it now for deep tissues like cartilage. It can be helpful and is still used for superficial lesions, wound healing and that sort of thing, hence where you get the overlap with the beauty industry. But for deep applications, there’s no evidence to show that it works.”The studies behind the claims that it can heal deep tissue are not randomised control trials, she says. “They’ll take two subject groups, and they’ll do a different type of laser on both of them, and then they’ll look at the outcomes of those two, but they’re not controlling it against no treatment. And obviously the body has an innate healing ability.”A few decades ago, she recalls, “people would go to the physio, be strapped up to a machine, press the button and off you go”. The placebo effect should never be underestimated, she says: “During that laser session, you’ve been talking to a physio, the problem’s been validated. You’ve got reduced fear levels. You feel more nurtured, and you’re ready to then go and be more active and move more and all the things that we know actually do help with cartilage issues – but it’s not the laser. Because when they control for the laser, it’s not shown to be effective.”She says that if she or anyone in her family had cartilage issues, she wouldn’t waft a laser over it. “Nowadays there’s so many other highly effective treatments with decent evidence.”What about the full-body beds studded with red LEDs now available in swanky gyms, and the expensive body mats for sale online, promising to aid muscle recovery? Macdonald can’t find any clinical studies to support their claims. “The best thing people can do to aid muscle recovery,” she says, “is keep moving because this maintains good circulation, eat healthily so that you’ve got all the building blocks for repair, and sleep.” Healing peaks during sleep.Similarly, Ho wouldn’t necessarily recommend LED products for the skin, although he suspects the risks are minimal if used as directed. “What overdoing it would probably mean is exerting too much heat on the skin, which can induce either pigmentation or even more inflammation in the skin. So there’s some concerns around the use of these products.”View image in fullscreenA man using an LED therapy mask at home.Photograph: Westend61 GmbH/AlamyBut even Ho has been tempted to try one. “It is kind of fun to use. I used it for a bit of brightening, a bit of anti-pigmentation. Mine has different modes to it, but I have to remind myself that it’s not a medical treatment. I think if you go in with the mindset that it’s a splurge, a fun treat to yourself … but I would avoid overuse, and use as it’s directed.” If you can afford it, you may, he says, “in theory have some nice-looking effects, even if it’s short-lived. If it gives you a little boost, or if it makes you feel a bit better, why not? But don’t rely on it as a holy grail.”In aesthetic dermatology practises, says Ho, LEDs are used to reduce some of the side-effects from other treatments that can cause inflammation, such as peels or injections. “The idea is the LED light will help reduce some of that downtime.” Professional or medical-grade equipment should have a CE marking, denoting higher standards of testing than with over-the-counter versions. Still, he says, “the evidence on exactly how much to use it, and at what frequency, is still slightly guesswork. Even if you’re using a medical device, it will depend on the device itself and what the manufacturers’ recommendations are based on their testing.” We also don’t know which, if any, beauty products might reduce or enhance their efficacy, and whether treatment should be before or after applying them.The jury also remains out for the new red-light toothbrush, or the myriad other glowing devices you can buy to fix gum disease. The British Dental Association says this is such a young field its experts aren’t yet in a position to assist. As with so many other consumer light-therapy products, while they could theoretically help reduce inflammation and boost cellular health, in terms of their efficacy and safety we remain largely in the dark.Explore more on these topicsSkincareHealthHealthcare industryBeautyDentistsNeurosciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inside the fragile system holding the modern world togetherBehind every meme and message is creaking, decades-old infrastructure. Internet experts can think of scenarios that could bring it all crashing down …Aisha DownSun 26 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 19.26 EDTShareIt is the morning after the internet went offline and, as much as you would like to think you would be delighted, you are likely to be wondering what to do.You could buy groceries with a chequebook, if you have one. Call into work with the landline – if yours is still connected. After that, you could drive to the shop, as long as you still know how to navigate without 5G.A glitch at a datacentre in the US state of Virginia this week reminded us that the unlikely is not impossible. The internet may have become an irreplaceable linchpin of modern life, but it is also a web of creaking legacy programs and physical infrastructure, leading some to wonder what it would take to bring it all down.The answer could be as simple as some acute bad luck, a few targeted attacks, or both. Extreme weather takes out a few key datacentres. A line of AI-written code deep in a major provider – such as Amazon, Google orMicrosoft– is triggered unexpectedly and causes a cascading software crash. An armed group or intelligence agency snips acouple of undersea cables.Amazon Web Services outage shows internet users ‘at mercy’ of too few providers, experts sayRead moreThese would be bad. But the real doomsday event, the kind that the world’s few internet experts still worry about in private Slack groups, is slightly different – a sudden, snowballing error in the creaky, decades-old protocols that underlie the whole internet. Think of the plumbing that directs the flow of connection, or the address books that allow one machine to locate another.We’ll call it “the big one” and if it were to happen then at the very least, you would need your chequebook.The big one could startwhen a summertime tornado cruises through the town of Council Bluffs, Iowa, laying waste to a low-slung cluster of datacentres that are an integral part of Google’s offering.This area, called us-central1, is a Google datacentre cluster, critical to its Cloud Platform as well as YouTube and Gmail – a 2019outageheredownedthese services across the US and Europe.Dinners burn as YouTube cooking videos sputter to a halt. Workers across the world furiously refresh their suddenly inaccessible emails, then resign themselves to interacting in person. Senior US officials notice some government services have slowed, before returning to planning a new blitz over Signal.All this is inconvenient, but nowhere near the end of the internet. “Technically, if we have two networked devices and a router between them, the internet is running,” says Michał “rysiek” Woźniak, who works in DNS, the system involved in this week’s outage.But there is “absolutely a lot of concentration happening on the internet”, says Steven Murdoch, a professor of computer science at University College London. “This happens with economics. It’s just cheaper to run all things in the same place.”But what if then a heatwave in the eastern US takes out US East-1, part of a Virginia complex that hosts “datacenter alley”, a key hub for Amazon Web Services (AWS), the focus of this week’s outage – among a handful of its neighbours. Meanwhile, a cyberattack hits a major European cluster, say inFrankfurtor London. In the wake of this, networks redirect traffic to secondary hubs, lesser-used datacentres, which like frontage roads in a Los Angeles traffic jam become quickly unusable.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of an Amazon Web Services datacentre known as US East-1 in Ashburn, Virginia.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersOr, if we stray from disaster movie to the perils of automation, the heightened traffic could trigger a bug in AWS’s internal infrastructure rewritten by artificial intelligence months ago – perhaps one that went unnoticedafterhundredsof AWS employees were let go this summer as part of the company’s larger push towards automation. Overwhelmed by unfamiliar requests, AWS starts to tumble.Signal goes down. So does Slack, Netflix and Lloyd’s bank. Roomba vacuum cleaners fall silent. Smart mattresses gorogueand smart locks malfunction.WithAmazonand Google taken out, the internet would look largely unfamiliar. AWS, Microsoft and Google together account for more than 60% of the world’s cloud services market – and it is almost impossible to approximate how many services depend on them.“But the internet at its very most rudimentary level is still working,” says Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who studies disruptions. “You just can’t do anything that you’re used to on the internet because that’s all posted out of these metacenters.”You may think that the biggest threat is an attack on an undersea cable. This excites Washington thinktanks, but otherwise achieves little. Undersea cables break regularly, says Madory – in fact, the UN estimates there are 150 to 200 faults a year.“You’d really have to take out a bunch to affect communication. I think the submarine cable industry would tell you: dude, we do this all the time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ultranet, another one, handles “.biz” and “.us”.Madory says it is extremely unlikely that one of them could ever be taken out. “If something were to happen to Verisign, .com would be gone. They have a huge financial incentive to make sure that never happens.”View image in fullscreenAWS, Microsoft and Google together account for more than 60% of the world’s cloud services market.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesBut it would take an error of that scale, one that implicates more fundamental infrastructure than Amazon and Google, to truly devastate the broader ecosystem. If it happened, it would be unprecedented – the closest analogy could be the 2016attackon Dyn, a smaller DNS service provider, whichdownedthe Guardian, X and others.With .com out, banks, hospitals, financial services and most communication platforms would be out. Some government internet infrastructure would still be there, such as the US’s secure messaging systemSiprnet.And – at least to a wonkish community of experts – there would still be the internet. There are self-hosted blogs, after all, and decentralised social platforms such as Mastodon, and niche domains including “.io”, for the British Indian Ocean, and “.is” for Iceland.The Guardian view on the cloud crash: an outage that showed who really runs the internet | EditorialRead moreMurdoch and Madory can think of scenarios that would devastate the rest. Murdoch suggests a bug in BIND, the softwarelanguagethat supports DNS. Madory points attestimonyfrom a group of Massachusetts hackers who in 1998 told the US Congress about a vulnerability that could “take down the internet in 30 minutes”.That vulnerability involved a system one level up from DNS: the border gateway protocol, which directs all traffic on the internet. This is extremely unlikely, says Madory – such an event would be an “all hands on deck” scenario, and the protocol is “super resilient, otherwise it would have crashed by now”.If the internet were ever fully shut down, it is unclear if it could be started up again, says Murdoch. “No one has turned off the internet after it’s been turned on. No one is really sure how it could be turned on again.”In the UK, there is a non-virtual contingency plan, or at least there was. If the internet shuts down, the people who know how it works will meet up in a pub outside London and decide what to do, says Murdoch.“I don’t know if this is still the case. It was quite a few years ago and I was never told which pub it was.”Explore more on these topicsInternetComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleAmazonMicrosoftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But we must not give up hopeSun 26 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 14.54 EDTShareOne year ago, everything was so different. In late October 2024, before the US presidential election, thoughtful Americans could certainly acknowledge the deep flaws of their country – its injustices and inequality – but they could still recognize it as the United States. A democracy. A place where the rule of law meant something. A nation led by a dignified and decent public servant, despite his advanced age and increasing frailty.These days, in late October 2025, many of us barely recognize the nation we live in. People suspected of being illegal immigrants are rounded up and shoved into vans, sometimes denied due process. The East Wing of the “people’s house” – the White House – is being destroyed for an obscene ballroom. Donald Trump is persecuting his political rivals or supposed enemies anddemanding the justice department hand over $230m. Armed military personnel are being sent into American cities on false pretexts. The Pentagon, relabeled the Department of War, has – in effect –rid itselfof day-to-day journalistic scrutiny as it spends what could amount tonearly $1tn of taxpayer money. Universities, law firms, news companies are buckling under the president’s threats, and billionaires are treated like members of the royal family.Democrats are captive to outdated etiquette. It’s endangering democracy | Ryan W PowersRead more“The United States, just months before its 250thbirthday as the world’s leading democracy, has tipped over the edge into authoritarianism and fascism,” Garrett Graff, the American historian and author,wrote in August. “In the end, faster than I imagined possible, it did happen here.”One awakes to new horrors each day. And it is difficult to grasp – and painful to realize – just how far gone we are, and how quickly it has happened.Yet, we know that Trump was duly elected. Even after his deeply disturbing first term and even after the warnings that came with the knowledge of Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint for an authoritarian second term – even after Trump himself said publicly he wouldbe a dictator just on day one– enough Americans chose him over Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent.Frightening as the current reality is, it’s even scarier to realize that we’re only nine months into this presidential term. Where will three more years of this decline leave us? And what if the three years turns into something even longer, since there is no one to restrain this president from deciding that a third term is necessary, perhaps for national security reasons?Granted, all is not lost. There will be midterm elections next year that could bring a different balance of power, if Democrats regain one or both houses of Congress. There are elected officials who are trying to exert some accountability, like the Democratic congressmen Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, ranking members, respectively, of the House judiciary and oversight committees, who arelaunching an investigationinto the attempted money grab from the justice department.And a presidential election in 2028 could start us down the road to recovery just as last year’s election put us on this regrettable path.There are millions of Americans protesting in the streets of their cities and communities, as they did last weekend in the No Kings rallies.Robert Reich, the former labor secretary,wrote recentlythat “the great sleeping giant of America is awakening”, just as it did after the Communist witch-hunt era in the 1950s or during the Vietnam war protests or during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.On those occasions, the listing ship eventually was righted.Reich says he knows the signs of that awakening and sees it happening now. As evidence, he cites the recent massive protests, the widespread, bipartisan pushback against late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s removal from television and the near-unanimous refusal by journalists to sign the defense department’s demands they report only what is sanctioned.“The sleeping giant always remains asleep until some venality becomes so noxious, some action so disrespectful of the common good, some brutality so noisy, that he has no choice but to awaken.”It’s an optimistic take, and I respect Reich’s experienced view. Maybe he’ll prove to be right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Can it reclaim its status in the world and its adherence to the rule of law?Or must we acknowledge that the 250-year-old experiment worked for a while, and then – suddenly, utterly – failed?My pessimistic brain tells me that the latter is true; that all may indeed be lost. My hopeful heart, however, tells me that we must try, in whatever ways we can.For me, as a media critic, that’s about urging journalists to live up, more fully, to their mission of holding power to account. For others, it may be working on congressional campaigns, or organizing rallies, or finding ways to protect voting rights.Less than a year ago, we were in a very different place. A year from now? Or three years from now? The truth is, we don’t know. All we can do is try to not give up.What’s giving me hope nowThe contact I have in the classroom with young journalists, who are both idealistic and realistic, always lifts my spirits. I’m also hopeful about the journalism I see from the crop of startup news organizations, many of them non-profits, that are helping to fill the gaps left by the tragic decline of local newspapers. And I’m heartened by the recent No Kings protests, where millions of Americans peacefully gathered and showed their patriotism and love of country.Explore more on these topicsUS newsFighting BackDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

I didn’t feel that honouring Trump with a state visit was very representative of the views of most Labour voters.JoeI thought Starmer handled it very well – Trump is partial to flattery, so if we’ve got something like a king to flatter him, just use anything we’ve got available to make our lives better.StuartI did quite like his point about rolling out the royal family for Trump, making King Charles work geopolitics, but, in this day and age, where we’re taught that we’re all foundationally equal, I don’t believe in having a head of state based on bloodlines. So it all seems wrong – an authoritarian being flattered by an illegitimate head of state.View image in fullscreenSharing plateJoeWe talked about public sector pay increases. Stuart said, in the current economic situation, he thought the pay offer they received isn’t terrible – and he’d probably rather there was more money in the schools budget than wages directed to him.

They’d just got a 22% pay rise – he said it was a bad reading of the mood. Normally I would support any union action by public sector workers, but I was somewhat in agreement with him.

I had discovered some tins of black and white gloss paint left on the floor and a narrow house-painting brush and I still remember, once the first dab lengthened into a line, how quickly I was lost in the pleasure of making another line and then another. I drew a woman in a long dress, maybe a kimono, with a wide belt or obi, and her hair dressed high. And when she was done, I stopped.I doubt it was any good as paintings go but it was the right shape, it was expressive. Also, no one complained. Though the garage was attached to the house it was considered my father’s domain and it seemed he wasn’t bothered by my daub on the wall, though he might have been bothered by the spoiling of a brush. He might have said, “What did you do that for?” which would have been enough to stop me doing more, but there were no serious repercussions that I can remember for my afternoon’s idle graffito.At that time, the garage was filling up with stray bits and, though he pottered about, my father did not use the place so much any more. In the early days of his marriage, he had furnished the house, pretty much, from the workbench. He made three chests of drawers from solid, pale oak, an entire living-room suite, a hall table with parquetry inlay. Five children later, he was cobbling a wardrobe together in MDF; his interest in fine craftsmanship had clearly waned. He could also afford a car which filled the garage when the weather was cold, its massive, mint-green bonnet slid in under the cupboards and shelves that held tins of nuts and washers, and rows of tools, their wooden handles darkened by use.One morning, in the long autumn when my mother was dying, I woke up to the image of my garage painting, and the desire to check if it was still there. I hadn’t thought of it in decades, but I saw it so clearly, and the need for verification did not leave me all day. I wanted to go home.It was probably a copy of something I had seen. When I search my memory for the original version an image comes to mind from a book I loved when I was 11, the Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology, a fabulous, heavy, ​ink-​smelling Christmas present that I have still, sitting on my shelf. There, beyond the Greek sculptures and Egyptian hieroglyphs, I find a Chinese ink drawing of Ch’ang-O, goddess of the moon. So, not a kimono after all. The wide belt I remembered was, in fact, a wide sleeve, but the shape, the high hair and the fall of cloth in her long skirt are the same.This melancholy feeling that I could not go back to the garage wall of my childhood was entirely imagined, because I could get in my car and be there in half an hour. The key to the front door was on my keyring. There was nothing to stop me. But there was no one living there since my mother moved into residential care, and this made the house feel more private; neither empty nor occupied. She had been dying and not dying for many months. The longer it went on, the more forbidden her home became. All trips led to her bedside now. Turn left, not right.View image in fullscreenEnright (front, centre) with her family in Dublin, 1968.Photograph: Courtesy of Anne EnrightEven when she was living there, I found it hard to move freely about the place. She would call me back from the kitchen when I tried to boil a kettle, asking me to fix something, do something, check something, talk to her, talk more, share my news, help her stand. This mix of urgency and immobility had been a problem for some years. She needed care around the clock. Professional help was supplemented by her children on a rota which was posted every Saturday morning to the family chat with a ping of doom. Hundreds of Saturdays went by. Uncountable weeks. The marital bed, in which my father slowly died in 2016, was now made over to a series of gentle strangers and the house felt tended but a little de-personalised. The rooms emptied for various hospital admissions and they filled again with grandchildren and great-grandchildren on birthdays we never thought she would ​see – 92, 93, 94. She went from hospital care to convalescent care and finally to residential care. There came a day when we knew she would not be back in the house, alive.“Does she still know you?” People were anxious about this on my behalf, and I wanted to say “probably” or “yes”, she knew me in some deep place. But I also wanted to say that “being known” was hardly the point for me. She had become “our” mother; less mine than a communal duty in which I shared. In all of this work, I was, as ever, her least good child, but I was also there.“Is she still herself?”Either you know the job of elder care or you cannot imagine it. These conversations (many people did not ask at all) contained ideas about the self that I let go over the long years of her decline. At the furthest extremity of her great old age, she could hardly hold a sentence, let alone a conversation. By then, we were not concerned about her personality so much as her personhood, which had to be honoured as capacity fell away.“Yes, yes. She is still herself.”And she was. She was in her place, surrounded by her family who did whatever she asked, and that helped to hold her identity together. During Covid, I found her very demanding, but later, she sweetened into forgetfulness and the last couple of years felt, to me, like a reclaiming of childhood affections. “Of course I know you. I’ve known you since you were this high,” she said once, fully delighted. I walked into her room and we were pleased to see each other, every single time.For some reason I wanted to be at her bedside the week she died, and so I was alone with her at the last. Her difficult breathing softened and I wondered if someone who was unconscious could also fall asleep. By the time I saw she was fading, it was done.The next morning the house was full of people as we planned the funeral and the wake. The kettle was on, wifi worked, the television screen filled with the Chromecast of the memorial leaflet in draft form. The place looked normal, presentable. The carpets, which were mostly green, were vacuumed by a grieving grandchild and it was turning back into the house I had known all my life.I went to collect some dishes, and found the house empty and silent, full of last things. Every place my eye fell was a still lifeOur parents had moved in to this modest bungalow in the suburbs as the last houses on the road were being built. The cul-de-​sac filled with young married couples like themselves; the husbands went out to work, the wives dropped in to each other’s kitchens and the children played on the road outside. Our mother was the last of this generation to die. The neighbours’ children were now reaching retirement age. The layout of our house was either identical to, or the mirror image of, their own childhood homes and, when they arrived for the wake, they looked around the rooms with older faces and young eyes.View image in fullscreenEnright with her mother Cora in 2015.Photograph: The Irish Times/ Alan BetsonA few days later, I went to collect some dishes, and found the house empty and silent, full of last things. Every place my eye fell was a still life. On a crocheted doily on my mother’s bedside table, a paperback, Hotel du Lac by Anita Brookner, along with some rosary beads and a Post-it note in her handwriting.If not now When?If not here Where?If not you Who?In the hall, on the oak chest of drawers my father made, was another embroidered piece of linen, a crystal vase with large silk flowers, the phone book with numbers recorded inside the cover, crossed out and crossed out again as older people died, as younger people left the country, returned again, or got a mobile. Beside the landline was a key for the post box on the wall outside, whose tag held an image of her first great-​grandchild as a baby. There was her glasses case, an ​upright, decorative thing with a lining of fake sheepskin, and it seemed insanely particular, this object she had chosen, and used, and not noticed, every day for years.It was so still. I took some photographs to distract myself, and this felt like robbery. Besides, the images looked inconsequential when I viewed them on my phone. They did not hold the emotion, they could not show the previous versions of the house, which I also saw everywhere I looked. There was a round window in the living room wall, which I woke to when it was the girls’ bedroom. In those days, the sill held a china statue of the Infant of Prague which, at some point, became a headless statue of the Infant of Prague, which was replaced by a Belleek vase in the shape of an owl, which then disappeared altogether. When I asked after the owl, my mother said, “I threw it against the coal-house wall” (the vase was a present from her sister, who could be annoying) but some years later it was back again: she had either bought another or the smashing story was a joke. I don’t remember any shards. The owl was standing there now, in need of a good clean.We pulled out blankets knitted by women now gone, poked through my mother’s box of buttons, remembering outfits to which they had been attachedThe touchstones of my mother’s life, the objects that concerned her most, were keys, each on their assigned hook or in their hiding place; also the remote control, the cooker knobs and electrical outlets, all the things that had to be switched on and off, because this place of safety was, for her, alive with potential catastrophe. I tried to focus on the quirks of the place instead: a useful piece of wood my father fixed to stop the sliding door from shutting on the fingers of small children. A book in her bedroom by Sartre with a large quotation on the cover, “I loathe my childhood and all that remains of it …” Another in the dining-room shelves, called Three to Get Married, which was not about polyamory but about the presence of God in every relationship. By way of penance, I dusted and realigned a studio portrait of my mother which my father had set in the place where he sat over his newspapers. Taken in her 20s, the picture shows her as a mild and unadorned beauty.For a while, I didn’t go back. I am not sure any of us did. Christmas was quiet, and free, for perhaps the first time in my entire life, of a sense of family obligation.In January, I rang a sibling executor and said all I wanted were my father’s English-Irish dictionaries, nothing else, not a single thing. My sibling executor said that was all very well but there would be a system, possibly involving stickers, and I hated everyone immediately. Later, I felt ashamed. Nothing had been stolen from me – nor could it be. I did not care about the dictionaries, though for one serious second I had felt they were the exact fix for my grief. They would fit and fill my loss precisely.In early February, the siblings had the first clearance of clothes and linens. We pulled out blankets knitted and crocheted by women now gone, allocated scarves, poked through my mother’s box of buttons, remembering outfits to which they had been attached. I recognised one from a nice purple-and-pink tweed coat I wore when I was six. I remembered how the sight of my bare wrists as I outgrew it seemed to make my mother angry, one morning on my way into school. This was around the time our granny died and, afterwards, she grieved very hard. There was a blue button from my confirmation outfit. Myself and a sister disagreed on the shade of the linen mix, and had no way to check because the family photographs were all in black and white. Also, my confirmation pictures were left in our father’s camera, never to be developed, for unknown reasons which I always thought must have been secretly sad.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA tin of buttons (top) and a bookshelf at Enright’s parents’ house.

Signs are taped to the doors of different rooms. Stickers are involved. Despite all this, we get confused, sidetracked, we lose things, as though the house is tricking us, the rooms giving way to unstable spaces.“Where are my keys?”“Can someone ring my phone?”I open the least impressive, most unprepossessing door in the cheapest piece of furniture in the house and find a cloth envelope full of letters. We gather piecemeal in the sunroom as a sister checks through and reads bits out.I am sorry to tell you that Eileen left us this day at 8pm.Some long-dead relative writing about the death of another to another, also now long dead.

On Monday I felt worst of all.It is a love letter, full of yearning phrased as complaint.She has filled her week with activityto help with the loneliness. Areally nicepicture of the two of them togethercheered me up morning and night as it was beside my bed. But,What do you think I did today but knocked it over and broke it. Was I mad?She tries not to worry about him on the road, but she does worry.I hope I am not harping too much in this letter on safety … I’ll say a little prayer every so often just the same.Love as loneliness, as small catastrophe and comical vexation, love as worry turned to piety. The revelation is that these moods existed before we, her children, became the cause of them. Also her frankness and her conviviality is right there on the page. She was very much herself, all along.On this, the first day of clearance, I mention I would like some snowdrops from the garden and a sister says, “Oh do, take them now.” So I get my father’s shovel and I find its pointed blade so deft I can dig another piece of turf to plug the gap so you would not know I had been there. I put the shovel in the car to take away with me. It is tall, as he was, and the wood contains the memory of his working hands. That is all I want, I think. I am done.I don’t take his magnifying glass. I cannot take, or bear to throw out, her rolling pin. None of us can. I will fail to sort or dispose of these items many times overBut actually, when it comes to the division of effects some weeks later, my stickers flutter through the rooms to land on treasures I cannot believe are uncontested. Five cut-glass whiskey tumblers (one chipped), a bottle of Powers Whiskey I bought for my father in 2010, which my mother insisted on conserving for her own wake. A scarf I brought her back from holidays which she did not like, but wore anyway to an official literary function where she collared Enda Kenny, our then taoiseach, and spoke to him in Irish and at length. A butter dish I don’t need. Champagne saucers that may never have seen champagne, though I did eat jellied desserts out of them every Christmas Day. Also her tin of buttons and two last, undeveloped rolls of film.View image in fullscreenCora with Enright’s son Lorcan.Photograph: Courtesy of Anne EnrightI don’t take his magnifying glass. I cannot take, or bear to throw out, her rolling pin. None of us can. I will fail to sort or dispose of these items many times over, as will my siblings. This includes a mountain of old papers, all of them meaningful: their itinerary or travel diaries in the year they drove across America, old photographs, the effects of a friend who died without relatives in the 1970s and whose memorabilia was kept in a box in the attic because it was all too sad.Everything must be seen and experienced before it can be recycled, shredded or, as a last resort, binned. We must honour and mourn. We must absorb the past out of each object, so it can turn into empty rubbish. This alchemy is deeply exhausting. Every clearing day, the same fog sets in. Layered under the stuff I cannot throw out is the stuff my parents could not throw out. My father liked a newspaper clipping. He held on to misdirected mail, and this makes perfect sense to me – how can you bin something that does not belong to you? That would be illegal. I open a virgin envelope addressed to a stranger and find a 60s postcard of overly eager African dancers, with a message on the back from a missionary priest. He says that all is well. This is good to know.I throw it out.I throw it all out.In my father’s many files, I find a gritty parcel that, carefully unwrapped, turns out to be a bag of seashells from a beach 60 years ago. In the small bedroom, his stored VHS tapes include every television appearance I ever made. I find my old school copybooks.The pace of clearance is slow.On one of these days, I tackle the garage, which is now filled by the plastic and aluminium clutter of infirmity, all of it intimate and horrible: a plastic shower chair, a commode, a selection of walking sticks. The calendar on the cupboard is dated October 1997. And there on the wall is my painting of the goddess of the moon. Part of it has been sloshed over by thin paint, in the cleaning of brushes, but some is still visible: the wide sleeve and skirt, and the white and grey folds of fabric. I could not be more disappointed. It is not beautiful, after all. It just isn’t. It is nothing.Months later, when the house is finally bare, I think, actually, you know, for an 11-year-old, it wasn’t too bad.The images from the undeveloped film arrive from the camera shop by email. Most of them are blotched and faded, but there are two family shots and some scenery from the year we went camping in Kerry and took the rollercoaster at a funfair in Tralee. The other roll was damaged by a gap in the back of the camera – so that was why he stopped taking pictures, it was not because he was sad or indifferent. A leak of light obscures my 11-year-old face, but you can see my ​confirmation outfit, whose buttons are much nicer than the one I found in the box. I am wearing summer gloves, and a ribboned pin of the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove. On my head is a long-forgotten, handmade pillbox hat, the blue of which will never be accurately known.View image in fullscreenThe damaged photograph of Enright’s confirmation.Photograph: courtesy of Anne EnrightA second picture shows a faded image of my face, with an expression I have not seen before – not the open, gammy smile of my childhood, but something more calculating and interested in mischief.

Politicians from Donald Trump to Giorgia Meloni and Nigel Farage will be closely watching what happens nextHeather StewartEconomics editorSun 26 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 13.11 EDTShare“Cambio,cambio.” Under the blazing sun, dozens of money changers are hawking US dollars along Florida Street, a bustling pedestrian strip in Buenos Aires. Known asarbolitos(“little trees”), they are thriving ahead of the 26 October midterm elections in a country long used to saving in the greenback.“The best time to buy is now,” says onearbolito, declining to give her name. “[The dollar] went down a little but it is a fake-out – it’ll rise again.”Like her, economists across the spectrum expect a devaluation of the Argentine peso once the voting is over. The president,Javier Milei, has placed a cap on the currency to tame triple-digit inflation and now it remains overvalued and reserves are depleted, leaving Argentina’s economy stagnant as consumers turn to cheap imports.Luciano Galfione, a textile industrialist, says the 75-year-old family company he heads is living through “the worst moment in its history”. Since the chainsaw-wielding Milei took office, Galfione has laid off almost 50 workers and suspended 45 more at his Buenos Aires mill as consumption has slumped.Between December 2023 and July 2025, 18,000 businesses have closed and 253,800 registered jobs have been lost, according to the Centre for Argentine Political Economy (CEPA). Alongside the exchange rate freeze, which made Argentina the most expensive country in South America, Milei’s government – unlike Donald Trump’s – has reduced or scrapped tariffs, leaving heavily taxed local industries at a disadvantage against Chinese imports.“It’s the perfect storm,” says Galfione, seeing no easy exit for Milei from his predicament. “If he devalues the currency, inflation will soar. For now, his only achievement is containing it – at the cost of a major recession.”Together with the retirees who protest against deep cuts in their pensions outside Congress every Wednesday, Galfione is among those counting the costs of Argentina’s turn to Milei two years ago.Milei’s populist experiment now faces a defining moment. From Trump (who is trying to prop up Milei and the peso with a$20bn (£15bn) currency lifeline) to Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and the UK’s Nigel Farage, politicians around the world are closely watching what happens when populist economic prescriptions collide with reality.Fertile groundArgentina is a very special case. The country has been repeatedly racked by debt defaults and economic crises and its voters have been susceptible over the years to leftwing populism, in the form of the powerful Peronist movement, and now Milei’s rightwing version.Milei is a textbook populist: charismatic, iconoclastic, promising muscular policies to wrest back control of the economy from the establishment on behalf of the people.These key characteristics are shared by his ally to the north, Trump, and by Farage, who styles himself as a pint-swilling people’s champion despite being a privately educated former stockbroker.Until recent months, Milei’s approach – involving extensive privatisations and deep public spending cuts – had won plaudits from the IMF for helping to bring inflation under control. The programme has something in common with that of Milei’s idol Margaret Thatcher, who also saw inflation as a dragon to be slain, no matter the cost.But financial markets began losing confidence in Milei’s radical project in recent months after a shaky result in provincial elections and a series of corruption scandals. Only massive financial intervention by Trump has averted what looked set to become a full-blown currency crisis.Milei’s travails raise wider questions about the appeal of charismatic populists who wield simple answers in today’s complex and fragmented global economy.Across Europe, the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis has been fertile ground for populists to flourish in. Ordinary citizens bore the costs of rebuilding after the great crash while banks were bailed out by the taxpayer. The Covid pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought fresh turmoil. Stagnant living standards, as evidenced by sluggish wage growth and surging prices, have driven a hunger for change – and for scapegoats.In France, Emmanuel Macron is trying to avoid calling a snap election for fear of his centre-right Renaissance party succumbing to the populist Marine Le Pen. Public dissatisfaction with a package of austerity policies aimed at tackling France’s yawning deficit and placating jittery bond markets is at the heart of the tussle.Italian voters turned to the charismatic rightwing populist Meloni in 2022. She had served in Silvio Berlusconi’s coalition cabinet as a member of the far-right National Alliance and founded her own party,Brothers of Italy, in 2011, offering a radical rightwing alternative to the austerity policies of Mario Monti’s technocratic government.She has not brought the tear-it-all-down approach to economic policy deployed by Milei – she quietly dropped earlier calls for Italy to leave the euro, for example – but she has appealed to voters’ desire to overturn the status quo, blaming immigration for Italy’s struggles.In the UK, the appeal of Farage is not hard to diagnose, says Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford’s Nuffield College. “The answer is probably quite simple: people feel rotten about the economy and have done since the end of Covid or the start of the Ukraine war. They switched government, they still feel awful, they don’t trust the main parties, so they turn to someone who says: ‘Everything needs to be disrupted: trust me.’”ContradictionsThe vote for Brexit in 2016 arguably had some of the same logic, and its figurehead, Boris Johnson, swept away doubts about economic detail with a bullish determination to implement the “will of the people” in the face of the establishment’s horror.Farage has so far committed few policies to paper aside from acall for mass deportations, which he subsequently appeared to revise on the hoof. He wants to rein in the Bank of England, perhaps evenditching its governor, Andrew Bailey, with scepticism of a stodgy establishment being a key part of the populist package.His tax and spending policies appear to be in flux: wary of being accused of planning a Liz Truss-style splurge, he recently abandoned a promise to make£90bn of tax cuts. His Reform party deputy, Richard Tice, said they would concentrate instead onpublic spending cuts.Labour hopes this stance will enable it to portray Farage as planning to bring back austerity – a point Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has made repeatedly, contrasting it with her approach of increasing public investment.Jo Michell, a professor of economics at the University of the West of England, says there are contradictions in Farage’s economic programme, such as it is.“Reform are bankrolled by very wealthy people demanding tax cuts and deregulation, but also talking a lot about the grievances of working people and the loss of industrial jobs and things that really resonate,” he says. “There’s a tension there between rich backers who want Thatcherism on steroids, and this narrative of bringing back British jobs and reindustrialisation.”Farage enjoys the company of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs but has also promised to reopen shuttered steelworks and run them on British coal.Michell says if a Farage government tried to implement massive tax giveaways to the wealthy without a plan to fund them, it would go down about as well with international investors that lend to the UK as Truss’s mini-budget. “If it was tax cuts without spending cuts, the markets would puke,” he says.Reform would face the same formidable challenge in winning over the markets as governments of all stripes in many developed economies currently do.Hefty public debts run up through the financial crisis and the Covid years, combined with the need for more spending on defence and ageing societies, mean borrowing has been rising in many countries simultaneously, making bond markets unusually volatile – with knock-on effects for interest rates.Despite the risks, as in the Brexit campaign it is unclear how successful detailed rebuttal of Reform’s economic policy is likely to be. Reeves has recently acknowledged that Brexit is one reason the Office for Budget Responsibility hascut its growth forecasts, but Labour has been consistently reluctant to lean into the issue.Ansell says successfully taking on populist arguments requires deft political communication. “You have to do it with a lot of charisma, with humour,” he says.The leftwing economist Ann Pettifor agrees that no one should be surprised by the allure of economic populism. “There’s real anger about the wrongness of the system, which is structurally impoverishing the many and enriching the few,” she says.Her riposte to the likes of Milei, Trump and Farage would be a left populism, akin to that on offer from the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani or the UK Green party leader, Zack Polanski, or once upon a time by Jeremy Corbyn, that challenges the power of corporations, central banks and the super-rich.“Trump is saying: ‘We should blame Mexico and Canada and China,’” Pettifor says. “The left should be saying the problem is Silicon Valley and Wall Street.”Trump shares Milei’s love of chaos and showbiz but his approach does not fit straightforwardly into his Argentinian ally’s laissez-faire playbook. While Trump has cut taxes for the wealthy and slashed regulation in some sectors, his administration has also taken stakes in strategic firms and used trade policy as a political weapon – a muscular interventionism more familiar in Beijing than Washington.So far the impact of the tariff blitz on the US economy appears to be relatively muted, though it is being masked by the historic boom in AI investment, which a growing number of experts warnmay be a bubble.Many experts believe Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve and blatant disregard for the rule of law may ultimately be more corrosive for the future health of the US economy than his erratic trade policies.Holding on to powerIn truth, the evidence suggests neither left nor right populists tend to fare well when faced with real-world challenges (though of course each charismatic individual claims to offer something unique).Arecent paperin the American Economic Review analysed the performance of 51 populist presidents and prime ministers, from 1900 to 2020. It found that on average, after 15 years, gross domestic product per head tends to be 10% lower in countries run by populist leaders than in similar economies with more mainstream regimes.“Economic disintegration, decreasing macroeconomic stability and the erosion of institutions typically go hand in hand with populist rule,” argue the paper’s authors, Manuel Funke, Moritz Schularick and Christoph Trebesch.Another intriguing finding of the research, though, is that despite their economic costs, these leaders tend to be good at holding on to power, lasting on average eight years, compared with four for their more moderate equivalents.In other words, it is not clear that even when their plans crash, populists immediately pay the price at the ballot box. Like the Brexiters’ promise to “take back control”, their appeal reaches beyond mundane economics.But back in Buenos Aires, whether Milei’s populist project collapses or is kept on life support by Trump, Argentina’s citizens have already paid a heavy price.Additional reporting byFacundo Iglesia"

Under French law, people suspected of committing serious crimes can be detained for up to 96 hours before being charged.Multiple French media outlets said the man detained at the airport had beenabout to board a planeto Algeria.Paris Match saidthe second, who was arrested at roughly the same time in the Seine-Saint-Denis department near Paris, had planned to travel to Mali.Both suspects were reportedly in their 30s, known to police and had criminal records for robbery.Le Monde saidthey had been under observation “for some time” before being taken into custody on suspicion of “organised theft and criminal conspiracy”.1:06‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen from Louvre in rapid heist, says French minister – videoCiting police sources,France Inter public radio reportedthat the pair were from Seine-Saint-Denis, north-east of Paris, which has the highest poverty and crime rates in mainland France, according to the national statistics office.The men were identified from forensic analysis of items that were abandoned at the scene, including gloves, a hi-vis vest, a motorbike helmet, angle grinders and other power tools, a blow-torch and a walkie-talkie.The French interior minister, Laurent Nuñez, on Sunday sent his “warmest congratulations” to the investigators who he said had “worked tirelessly”, but also called for confidentiality so as not to hamper the work of the detectives.Beccuau said on Fridaythat more than 150 DNA samples, fingerprints and other traces on objects found at the scene were being analysed in forensic laboratories and that she was “optimistic” about the investigation’s outcome.The four men pulled up outside the world’s most visited museum at about 9.30am last Sunday in a stolen furniture removal truck fitted with an extending ladder and lift, in which two of them mounted to the ornate first-floor Apollo gallery.Wearing hi-vis vests to resemble maintenance workers, they smashed an unsecured window and used disc cutters to open two display cases before descending in the bucket lift and fleeing on motorbikes driven by the other two men.The brazen heist lasted less than seven minutes, with the two who entered the gallery, which houses France’s surviving royal gems, spending just three minutes and 58 seconds inside.They dropped a diamond and emerald-studded crown during their getaway, but fled with eight richly gem-encrusted pieces that Beccuau said last week were worth “a spectacular sum, nearly €90m, but nothing compared to their historical value”.The jewels included an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave to his second wife, Marie Louise, and a diadem set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that had once belonged to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III.Originally built in the late 12th century, the Louvre palace was once the official residence of the French monarchs until Louis XIV abandoned it for Versailles. It became a museum for the royal art collection in 1793, four years after the French Revolution.The museum, which stands on a 37-hectare (91 acre) site along the north bank of the Seine in central Paris, houses a vast collection of masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo statue. It was visited by 8.7 million people last year.Nuñez expressed his “concern for the jewellery” in an interview with the French weekly La Tribune Dimanche on Sunday, saying the heist appeared to have been carried out by an organised crime group but adding that “thieves are always eventually caught”.The interior minister said there was a risk the jewellery would be broken up, with its precious metal settings melted down and the gems sold separately. “The loot is unfortunately often stashed abroad. I hope that’s not the case – I remain confident,” he added.While the museum’s internal alarms functioned normally, with a first going off at 9.34am when the robbers smashed the balcony window looking on to the Quai François Mitterrand, the museum’s directorhas acknowledged a security blindspot.Laurence des Cars told French senators last week that external security cameras did not adequately cover the thieves’ access point, with the only camera installed near the Apollo gallery pointed in the wrong direction to cover the window.However, Des Cars defended the museum’s €80m security programme, saying security camera coverage was being increased across the entire site, including “video surveillance covering all facades”.France’s culture minister, Rachida Dati, said on social media on Friday that she had requested findings from an investigation into the Louvre’s security by early next week in order to “announce concrete measures to secure” the museum.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I will endeavour to ensure my language is more accurate going forward.”Streeting hardened Labour’s attack on Reform as he told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show he had spent time in a London secondary school on Friday listening to boys describe racist abuse in “one of the most diverse cities on Earth”.“What they are describing, and what we have seen on our streets in recent weeks and months, is a return of 1970s-, 1980s-style racism I thought we had left in the history books.“The only way we are going to defeat this racism is to call it out and confront it for what it is, and for the decent majority of this country to stand against it as we have always done. I think what [Pochin] said was a disgrace. I think it was racist.”He accused Reform of believing “our flag only belongs to some of us, who look like me, not all of us who have built this country and its success”, and that Britain remained the “most successful multifaith democracy in the world”.Labour has called onNigel Farage, the Reform leader, to denounce Pochin’s comments.Zia Yusuf, the head of policy for Reform, told Sky News it was right that Pochin had apologised but said people must be able to talk about representation in advertising.Yusuf said: “I know Sarah very well. I was instrumental in her selection as a candidate, worked very hard to get her elected, and I’m extremely glad that I did.“I consider her a close friend and she’s a great MP for Runcorn. She did say those words and she has apologised, saying it was a poorly phrased thing to say, but you’ve got to put that into context.”The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, joined criticism of Pochin’s remarks as he said on X: “This is racism, pure and simple. It’s sad to see the Conservatives are pandering so much to Reform that they are too scared to call it out.”Several other Labour and Lib Dem MPs have also accused Pochin of using racist rhetoric.Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, refused to class Pochin’s remarks as racist. He told the BBC: “It’s not language I would have used … but we should acknowledge the public do have legitimate concerns about large-scale immigration and discussing that is certainly not racist.”Philp later sought to clarify his assessment of Pochin’s remarks as he told Times Radio: “She should not have said that in the way she said it, that was completely wrong and yes it was racist.”A Labour party spokesperson responded by saying it was “shameful that Chris Philp failed to condemn Sarah Pochin’s racist comments six times in a row. It just goes to show how far the Tory party has fallen.”Pochin appeared to double down on Sunday after Streeting’s criticism as she said on X: “Dear Wes Streeting, I’m sorry you feel that way. Perhaps you could remind us all how strongly you spoke up when this happened,” linking to a clip of the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, discussing a lack of diversity in Scottish public life.Explore more on these topicsReform UKRaceWes StreetingNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Your information could be the vital breakthrough that we need.“At this stage we are not linking this attack to any other offences.”Last month, aSikh woman was raped in grassland on Tame Road, Oldbury, in an incident also treated as racially aggravated by police.Preet Kaur Gill MP, the Labour (Co-op) MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, posted on X: “Deeply shocked and saddened that we are hearing of yet another racially aggravated rape this time in Walsall.“West Midlands police have reported a rape and assault of a young woman in her 20s in the Park Hall area, described as racially aggravated.”In a statement on Sunday evening, West Midlands police confirmed that officers from the public protection unit, local policing officers and forensic officers had worked overnight on the investigation.Ch Supt Phil Dolby said: “Our focus is on supporting the investigators in identifying and arresting the attacker.“Walsall is a diverse area and we know the fear and concern that this awful attack will cause in our communities.“We have been speaking to people in the community today to listen to and understand their concerns and there will be an increased policing presence in the coming days.”Anyone with information is asked to contact West Midlands police on 101 or the live chat online, quoting log 4027 of 25 October.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Trump is willing to say what many others are too timid or too diplomatic to say out loud. For the longest time people have been calling for Trump to pull out the sanctions hammer. It could be very significant.”The sanctions mean companies buying Russian oil risk losing access to the dollar-based financial system. This could have particularly large consequences for India and China, which have emerged as the largest importers of Russian oil and gas since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three and a half years ago.‘Economic coercion’The impact has been swift. Within hours, the sanctions had triggered a6% rise in the global oil priceand reports were emerging of an immediate pause of Russian oil deliveries to the biggest refineries in India, Moscow’s biggest crude customer, and to China’s biggest state-owned oil companies.Luke Wickenden, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), said a significant decline in Asia’s fossil fuel imports would be “devastating” for the Kremlin’s export revenues.“Between January and September this year, 86% of Russia’s crude oil exports – including pipeline deliveries – went to China and India. If Moscow lost access to these markets, it could forfeit approximately $7.4bn in monthly revenue, translating to roughly $3.6bn in tax receipts per month flowing directly into the Kremlin’s war chest,” Wickenden said.“There is some hope, however. In September, Russian crude imports by India’s state-owned refineries dropped to their lowest levels since May 2022, falling by 38% month on month. If India alone were to cut its imports of Russian crude, the Kremlin could lose roughly $1.6bn in monthly tax revenues.”Chart of the largest markets for Russian crude oilRussia’s monthly fossil fuel export revenues slipped by 4% last month to the lowest since the full-scale invasion and are now half of what they were in September 2022.Putin says he will never bow to US but concedes sanctions may cause ‘some losses’Read moreBut while revenues are significantly lower than they were, they remain propped up by purchases of oil and gas from buyers in Asia and easternEuropeand shipments of seaborne liquefied natural gas (LNG) into the EU. Russia is also understood to export millions of tonnes of crude via so-called “shadow tankers”, a fleet of ageing vessels used to circumvent western sanctions.Trump’s latest move to starve Putin’s war machine of fossil fuel revenues came after he received a tepid response to his demands for India and China to cut their Russian energy imports orface tougher trade termsas a consequence.China denounced the Trump administration’s “unilateral bullying” and “economic coercion” over what it described as its “legitimate” oil purchases from Russia and vowed to take “firm countermeasures” if its national interests were harmed.Trump said India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had assured him during a phone call this week that Delhi was “not going to buy much oil from Russia” as he too “wants to see the war end with Russia-Ukraine”. But while Modi has acknowledged the call, on which Trump wished the prime minister a happy Diwali, hehas not publiclyconfirmed plans to limit India’s crude imports from Russia.‘Disgraceful stain’ on EUFor Trump, the mission to break Russia’s energy dominance has twin benefits, according to Keatinge. “There is an opportunity here to bring peace to Ukraine and profit to the US,” he said.The US has become Europe’s biggest supplier of LNG since the war in Ukraine caused pipeline imports of Russian gas to run dry and seaborne shipments of gas to slow. It accounted for more than 55% of the EU’s LNG imports last year, from negligible volumes in 2019.Trump can expect US gas exports to Europe to increase after the EU agreed last week to phase out all imports of Russian gas, including LNG, by the beginning of 2027. Although Europe’s reliance on Russian energy has slumped, the continent is still funding the Kremlin through purchases of Russian oil and gas, which Keatinge said was “a disgraceful stain” on the EU.Chart showing major buyers of Russian energyThe EU remains the largest buyer of Russian LNG, according to data from Crea, and has bought half of Russia’s total LNG exports, followed by China (22%) and Japan (18%). The bloc is also the largest buyer of pipeline gas, buying 35% of Russia’s pipeline gas, followed by China (30%) and Turkey (29%).Hungary and Slovakia were the EU’s largest importers of Russian gas last month, buying €393m- and €207m-worth of Russian fossil fuels respectively. France, Belgium and the Netherlands having continued to import Russian gas, too.France was the EU’s third largest buyer of Russian gas last year, importing €153m of Russian fossil fuels, all in the form of LNG, some of which was subsequently delivered to Germany. Belgium was the fourth biggest importer, importing €92m of Russian LNG, while the Netherlands bought €62m of LNG.Chart showing the main EU buyers of Russian fossil fuelsKeatinge said: “The EU has been quick to say they’re bringing forward the day they stop to January 2027, but how many Ukrainians will die before then? Some European countries were able to find a way to go without Russian imports almost immediately – this should have come three years ago. We should hold India and China to account, of course, but we should look at our own, too.”The long-term impact of Trump’s war on Russia’s fossil fuel revenues, and whether it can bring peace to Europe and profit to the US, remains to be seen. Industry observers have warned that much will depend on how strictly the sanctions are enforced and how those still reliant on Russia’s fossil fuels respond.In the meantime, Keatinge is optimistic. “Never bet against Trump,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryOilGasRussiaUkraineTrump administrationGlobal economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

He made the almost 6,000-mile journey from Ethiopia by travelling through Sudan, Libya, Italy and France.Sexual assault7-8 JulyHe is transferred to accommodation for asylum seekers at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. On 7 July in Epping town centre he makes sexually explicit comments to a 14-year-old girl who offered him some pizza. He also tries to kiss her. A day later he sexually assaults a woman and also tries to kiss her. He then encounters the girl from the previous day and again tries to kiss her before sexually assaulting her.He is arrested and charged overnight.Protests13 July onwardsView image in fullscreenLarge crowds of anti-immigration protesters clashed with cordons of police who tried to separate them from anti-hate counter-protesters outside the Bell hotel in Epping, 17 July 2025.Photograph: Lab Ky Mo/Sopa Images/ShutterstockTwo security guards are injured in the first of many anti-immigration demonstrations outside the Bell hotel on 13 July. The protests were exploited by far-right activists who on17 July attacked police. Over the next five weeks protests outside the hotel led to several assaults on police officers and to 32 arrests.Court injunction19 AugustEpping Forest district council is granted a temporary high court injunction blocking the accommodation of asylum seekers at the Bell hotel. The injunction is overturned at the court of appeal on 29 August.Trial27 AugustKebatu tells his trial that he was a sports teacher in his home country, and denies the offences, saying: “I’m not a wild animal.”4 SeptemberKebatu is found guilty of two counts of sexual assault, one count of attempted sexual assault, one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and one count of harassment without violence.23 SeptemberKebatu is sentenced to 12 months in prison and ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for 10 years. He is also told that he faces deportation.Released in error24 OctoberKebatu was accidentally released from HMP Chelmsford instead of being sent to an immigration detention centre to be deported. He was seen by a delivery driver to return “four or five times” to the prison over an hour and a half in a “very confused” state before he was directed to Chelmsford railway station. Later on Friday he was spotted in Chelmsford in a grey prison tracksuit.6pmView image in fullscreenHadush Gerberslasie Kebatu (left) in Dalston on 24 October 2025.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PACCTV captures Kebatu in a library in Dalston, east London, at 6pm.Police appeal25 OctoberPolice urge Kebatu to hand himself in. They also appeal to the public for any information on his whereabouts. A senior officer said the police believe Kebatu had access to funds and had sought assistance from members of the public.Rearrest26 October, 8.30amKebatu is arrested in Finsbury Park, north London after a tipoff from a member of the public. Dog walker Jack Neill-Hall witnessed Kebatu being led away by five police officers. He said: “He wasn’t struggling, he was walking quite calmly, a bit dejectedly, he was staring down, he had his hood up, but it was a calm situation. It was a leisurely stroll out of the park with him with his hands cuffed but he wasn’t trying to get away.”10.24amKeir Starmer insists that Kebatu will be deported and orders an independent investigation into how he was released in error.Explore more on these topicsEnglandImmigration and asylumEssexMetropolitan policePolicePrisons and probationtimelinesShareReuse this content"

But you cannot fake the kind of chemistry this brother and sister haveLucy ManganSun 26 Oct 2025 18.00 EDTShareThe last time I reviewed something with Charlie Cooper in as “himself”, he, or “he”, was visiting folkloric hotspots around the British Isles as the presenter of Myth Country. I was beguiled by the impossibility of identifying where his most famous creation, Kurtan, in the brilliant, heartbreaking comedy This Country, written by Charlie and his sister Daisy May, left off and the real Cooper began. Or, if you prefer, where the real Cooper left off and Kurtan began. What were we to make of him listening with apparently genuine delight on his face to a man playing an old local tune on a recorder before announcing with perfect Kurtanish sensibility and timing that it was because: “In the wrong hands, it’s murder”? He watched with admiration as a friend with a divining rod approached and re-approached some ancient stones near – but, crucially not actually part of –the historic Avebury site of neolithic monuments. “I dread to think how long he’d be here doing that,” Cooper/Kurtan whispered to camera. “He’s light years ahead of his time.” Then a quintessentially Kurtanish worried pause. “Or light years behind his time.”I have pondered Fractal Cooper – genius? Poet? Muppet who’s right twice a day? – in many a quiet moment since. So I welcomed the chance to dwell with him awhile again in Daisy May and Charlie Cooper’s NightWatch, a slice of Halloween schedule-filler in which he and Daisy – who plays Kurtan’s more, uh, limited cousin Kerry in the sitcom – spend the night in different spooky locations in the hope of being visited by ghosts, an ambition they have shared since their Ouija board-playing games as children. And while I cannot say yet that I have the measure of the man, whose essence is perhaps as uncapturable as the spectres they seek, it becomes possible to conjecture that there are at least two threads running through both artist and invention.One is that in dealing with Daisy May/Kerry – chaos demons both, in very different ways – they have the patience of a saint. Our first sight of Daisy is of her emerging from a crystals shop laden with protective amulets for their adventures. Our second is of her unpacking her luggage for their single-night stay in the long abandoned Gloucester prison, said to be haunted by the souls of the 123 men who were hanged there. She has brought cushions, a dry robe, a stuffed unicorn (“For comfort”), fairy lights, a face mask, a foot mask and – sensibly – two hot-water bottles and some pillows. “It’s like a clown’s suitcase,” marvels her brother as items keep emerging. He has brought a tiny rucksack, which at least means he is good for packhorse duties. She doesn’t have a phone though. She has to borrow his to order them pad thai. It is my ambition in life to become much, much more Daisy May Cooper. Why should we not, it suddenly occurs to me, all be so comfortable?The second common denominator between Charlie and Kurtan is that they are both romantics. Stuck in a life he does not want, but cannot fully re-imagine in This Country, is Kurtan’s tragedy. Here, in the real world, it is Charlie’s charm. He wants to see not just a ghost but “a hearty Victorian ghost, like a gaoler!” And when they are put in the tiny cell for the night, as Daisy May gets comfortable with her pillows and her unicorn, he looks at the mirror over the sink and wonders about all the faces that have seen themselves reflected in it over the years. “Quite moving, actually.” He does also comment that Daisy May needn’t worry about him getting up in the night to pee. “You’re like a hippo. Once you’re asleep, you’re done, there’s no waking you up.” Whatever else they are, brothers are always brothers.And that is the main draw of the show, otherwise built on the flimsiest of premises – the sight of the siblings together, and the unfakeable camaraderie between them. Which, as any sib knows, comprises equal parts bickering (“I will go home!” threatens Charlie as Daisy May loads him up with another bag from the car. “Good!” replies his sister instantly. “Glad!”), shared memories (Charlie and his dad chasing a burglar out on to the street in their matching underpants) and negotiation of fart hazards (“Your particles have been absorbed by the mattress above me,” says a content Daisy May, who took the bottom bunk). Later episodes contain more of the same (“You have the gauntness of a highwayman,” says Daisy May appraisingly as they head for an inn notorious as a stop for the historic robbers and their victims) and even stray occasionally into mildly emotional-revealing territory as long nights wear on.For those who like their Halloween programming heavier on the supernatural investigations, it won’t do at all – the sole gesture towards it in the first programme is Daisy May laughing herself to death as Charlie waves a spirit radio around the place; in the second, they set up a teddy bear that senses temperature changes in the pub bar and go to bed. But for those of us who can’t wait for this stupid season and festival to be over, and who love the Coopers and This Country beyond the telling of it – well, let’s enjoy our precious time together.Nightwatch aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“An exciting departure from [his] previous work,” claims the publicity for Simon Amstell’s new standup show – but it’s a claim that proves hard to substantiate. Likeany Amstell set, I Love It Here is self-analytical to an absurd degree – and this level of forensic solipsism, from this clever and funny a man, can’t help but be engaging. But departure it is not – and indeed, I found it frustrating how Amstell’s concerns have not moved on a jot in a show largely about his disappointment (“pain”, he would call it) that his crush on a famous singer isn’t reciprocated.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The abiding impression, of a show set at a star-studded Hollywood party, is of an artist whose life (and creative output) might benefit from a little more friction. We encounter Amstell at the start of this set blissful with his partner of 14 years, increasingly at ease with himself afterovercoming shame. But an invitation to a Tinseltown bash, where his erstwhile teenage crush will be in attendance, brings out Simon’s wounded inner child. And so we’re pitched into a long anecdote in which fretful Amstell butterflies around with Baz Luhrmann, Viola Davis and Charli xcx, seeking to absolve his childhood agonies by coupling up with an unnamed pop hunk.Your delight in this shaggy dog story may depend on your tolerance for name-dropping, and for Amstell (a famous man for more than two decades) casting himself as a fish out of water in such company. It also requires you to invest in the supposed high stakes of Amstell’s pursuit of his celeb crush – and many in the audience do, greeting each unreturned text message (once Amstell has returned home to the UK) with an indulgent “aaww”. I couldn’t join them. For me, the show doesn’t do the work of justifying why this all matters so much to a now-contented 45-year-old man.Perhaps it’s enough that this is Amstell, and we must take his fragility and neediness as read. His is after all one of comedy’s most compelling personae these past few years, and continues to be funny here, moment to moment. There’s an amusing section on Mel Robbins’ self-help bookThe Let Them Theory, and how easily Amstell might have written it himself. One droll running joke finds him showering the world’s villains with forgiveness. Another worries away at his dwindling household-name status: “How are you supposed to keep a career going when new people keep being born?”Does that sound like an exciting departure from his previous work? It isn’t: it’s a show that sits squarely in the territory, where therapy, spirituality and neurosis meet, that Amstell has made his own, and is often as wonderfully funny and obsessively self-reflexive as we expect from him. But it made me crave anactualdeparture, something more substantial for Amstell to grapple with. “I try to remember,” he says at one point, amid all the crushing and flirting, “I’m not a desperate 17-year-old any more” – and the show makes you wish he’d tried a little harder.Returns toArches London Bridge, 11-28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsComedySimon AmstellreviewsShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: Annabel Smith. Archive image: courtesy of Harriet WebbBorn in Lancashire in 1986, actor Harriet Webb’s breakthrough role was as Theodora in Michaela Coel’s Bafta-winning 2020 seriesI May Destroy You. She has appeared in The Split, White Gold, Plebs and Wreck, and stars in Channel 4’s Big Boys as Shannon and as Kirsty in Sky comedy Mr Bigstuff.This image sums up how I spentmost of my days as a four-year-old – splashing around in the River Bela in Cumbria, wearing a dress, looking for fish, and collecting stones that I would take home and paint.My auntie Pat was behind the camera. She was an art teacher and really encouraged my imagination. We spent a lot of time together and she was a big influence on my artistic growth – I was a compulsive storyteller and she was one of the only people who indulged in the insane anecdotes that I would concoct in the hope that I’d make someone laugh. Pat would even write me long letters reflecting on the minutiae of my performance in whatever primary school play she had seen me in. She was such a fan, and gave me the belief that I could do anything.At this age I was curious and enthusiastic – the sort of girl who jumped into everything with full force; something that is still true to this day. I had a wonderful childhood in a village called Arkholme and inherited this base-level optimism; a faith that has very much been given to me by my parents and my brother and sister, through the pretty, wonderful, consistent and sunny life I was lucky to have. There was always laughter and a lot of conversation in our house.One of my first memories of wantingto be an actor was seeing my brother Will perform in his school play and doing a scouse accent. I’d never seen him do anything like that before, or since, and I was gobsmacked by how amazing he was. I idolised him for it and it was a real lightbulb moment. I thought: “Whatever it was that he just did, I need to do it, too.” After that, I started performing in village talent shows, doing a kind of rip-off Victoria Wood act. Even though it was probably rubbish, it made people laugh, and entertaining people gave me such a buzz.I’m not assertive when it comes to my career, but I’ve got this low-level sense that everything’s going to come goodI had an innocent start in life, and as a result I got to be a child for a really long time. Probably too long. I was wearing Minnie Mouse leggings until I was about 15. I didn’t even think about how I looked or what I was wearing until I was way older. For a while, I dabbled in a bit of skate culture – wearing a tea cosy on my head like a hat, with my two buns popping out of the holes. It was actually quite radical in Arkholme. There were some strange haircuts, too. Toni & Guy had taken over the streets, so I sported quite a few feathered Rod Stewart cuts in my adolescence.I never had the inclination to rebel. I respected my parents too much to do anything that might get me in trouble. It wasn’t until I was in my 20s that I started experimenting with more permanent things like piercings, or the terrible tattoo I got in Berlin. It’s a rectangle on my arm. As soon as I got it I wanted to gouge it off. I can’t even go into what it means, because it’s ludicrous.I studied at Paul McCartney’s Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a place with an incredible atmosphere – a true melting pot of artists, designers, actors and musicians. I made it through those years mostly unscathed, though one teacher did once tell me I needed to lose 10 stone so I could “be like everyone else”. For a young actor just starting out, being asked to fundamentally change who you are is about the worst thing you can hear. It was especially baffling given that the advice came from someone who was also overweight. Did I take it? No. Partly because I was too lazy, but mostly because I was stubborn enough to know I didn’t need to. I was good, and knew that people would recognise that no matter what size I was. In many ways that moment was the making of me; and taught me to lean in and own who I really am.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Now I realise my idiosyncrasies are what make me authentic’Read moreAside from that, I had an easy time studying, and made some amazing friends who I ended up living with in London, in a Withnail and I-esque house in Finchley. It was freezing cold, there was ice on the inside of the windows, and we had to wear all of our clothes at once just to survive winter without contracting pneumonia. On top of trying to make it as an actor, I worked as a teacher and as host at a restaurant in Peckham called Forza Wine, both of which are essentially just ways of making money while performing. When I wasn’t doing that, I was going out a lot in Soho and Camden. My extended childhood very much continued into my 20s.There wasn’t a big break in my careerbut lots of tiny taps – the odd TV credit here and there. I was delighted if I got three lines in an episode. I was playing to my casting a lot, mainly doing a lot of the “fat funny friend” parts. I still do some of that now, but I don’t think there’s any shame in utilising what you’ve got if it leads to an opportunity further down the line to show your other dimensions.The script for I May Destroy You arrived out of the blue. I’d never read anything like it – the words jumped off the page and I could see the world that Michaela Coel had created immediately. I did one self tape, then an audition, and two days later I got the part. I didn’t meet Michaela until the first day we filmed together – her presence on set was so inspiring. She carries herself with grace and warmth and hilarity, and because she operates on such a level, everyone else matches it, too.I’ve also learned so much from [Mr Bigstuff co-stars] Danny Dyer and Ryan Sampson. They are both total perfectionists. I am, too, even though I appear very scatty. Danny has never dropped a word of a line and he never corpses. Whereas he just has to look at me in a certain way and I’m gone. He has zero ego, and brings an energy that’s galvanising.I am really hard on myselfand liketo get things right. My drive comes from blind self-belief – knowing I can do better all the time – which can be really exhausting. I would honestly do 100 takes if a director wanted me to, because there’s always something at the bottom of the barrel that’s not quite been explored yet. I also think I get parts because I am easy to be around. [Big Boys creator] Jack Rooke once called me “provocatively kind”. I still don’t know exactly what that means, but I do believe there’s a virtue to being nice and fun to have on set, qualities that are often underestimated in this industry.All of which I owe to that little girl in the dress. I’m not assertive when it comes to my career, but I’ve got this low-level sense that everything is going to come good. Even though I spend less time ankle deep in a river, I am still filled with hope and curiosity.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackTelevisionI May Destroy YouPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having been given little chance to scintillate in the movies from her debut as a child in 1938 until 1947, she shone on the small screen in scores of popular series, above all in Lassie.Taking over fromCloris Leachmanin 1958, Lockhart continued in the show until 1964. She played Ruth Martin, married to the farmer Paul Martin (Hugh Reilly), and the adoptive mother of seven-year-old Timmy Martin (Jon Provost), whose collie was the titular hero of the series.In her role as a housewife, Lockhart somehow managed to avoid being completely upstaged by the clever canine. She described the show as “a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes, in time for the last commercial”. After she left the show, Lockhart commented: “In six sexless years of playing a country wife and mother, I was hardly ever allowed to kiss Hugh Reilly on the cheek.”View image in fullscreenJune Lockhart and Guy Williams in Lost in Space, 1965.Photograph: AllstarLockhart went straight into another hit, Lost in Space (1965-68), a semi-spoof sci-fi series aimed mostly at children and inspired by The Swiss Family Robinson, the 19th-century novel by Johann David Wyss. Lockhart and Guy Williams portrayed Maureen and John Robinson, two scientists exploring alien planets. Lockhart had to spend most of her time deftly trying to survive special effects. As the series continued, the narrative became less and less about this Swiss Family Robinson in space and more about the Robinsons’ young son (Billy Mumy) and his friendship with a robot, and the cowardly villain Dr Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris).Lockhart’s feature film debut, at the age of 13, had come as Belinda Cratchit in A Christmas Carol (1938). In the roles of her parents, Bob and Mrs Cratchit, were her actual parents, Gene and Kathleen Lockhart. As British-born Kathleen (nee Arthur) and Canadian-born Gene were both actors in dozens of films, as well as on stage, it was almost inevitable that June, who was born inNew York, would enter show business.Her first stage appearance, at the age of six, came in a non-singing role in Deems Taylor’s opera Peter Ibbetson at the Metropolitan Opera in New York (1931).When her father was offered a contract by the RKO motion picture studio, after his success on Broadway in Eugene O’Neill’s Ah, Wilderness! (1933), she moved with her parents to Hollywood, where Gene made around 300 films. After attending school in Beverly Hills, June began her career in films, mostly in small roles in prestigious pictures such as Sergeant York (1941), The White Cliffs of Dover (1942) and Meet Me in St Louis (1944). In the latter, she is charming as a New Yorker at the Smith family’s house party, whose dance card is filled byJudy Garlandspitefully to prevent Lockhart dancing with her brother.More significantly, although she did not know it at the time, was Son of Lassie (1945). It was one of several sequels to the hugely successful Lassie Come Home (1943), in which Elizabeth Taylor had played the girl, Priscilla, who helps the dog to escape back to the family who had had to sell her. In the later film, Lockhart played the now grown-up Priscilla.The affectionate way in which she handled both Lassie and her son, Laddie, hero of a wartime adventure in Nazi-occupied Norway, was in the minds of the producers when it came to casting the Lassie TV series 13 years later.View image in fullscreenA 1960 portrait of June Lockhart.Photograph: CBS/Getty ImagesAlthough she was given leading roles in two thrillers, She-Wolf of London (1946) and Bury Me Dead (1947), Lockhart decided her movie career was getting her nowhere and that television would be the answer. Before going in a new direction, she won acclaim onBroadwayin For Love or Money (1947), a comedy by F Hugh Herbert, for which she won a Tony award as best newcomer.A further substantial run came with Petticoat Junction (1968-70), set in a country hotel, where Lockhart is a doctor and mother figure. She also featured regularly in TV westerns in the 50s, such as Have Gun Will Travel, Wagon Train, Gunsmoke, and Rawhide. Her busy workload continued for the following five decades, with a recurring role in General Hospital between 1984 and 1998. Among her many one-off appearances were as herself in a 1988 episode of It’s Garry Shandling’s Show, where the talkshow host, finds a stray collie, and in Roseanne in 1995 as the mother of the restaurant manager Leon.Her final TV credit came in 2021 as the voice of Alpha Control in an episode of Netflix’s remake of Lost in Space. In the big screen version starring William Hurt and Mimi Rogers (1998), she had a holographic cameo as Will’s school principal.

I’ve had my fun. I’ll have a mastectomy, get it done and get on with my life.But when I came out of surgery, I was wheeled into a hospital room shared with one other woman. The doctors closed the curtain around us, sat down and told me the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes and my other breast. I would need a second mastectomy and an extensive course of chemo. I felt as if I’d been hit by a truck. I couldn’t believe it.When everyone left, the woman on the other side of the curtain, who must have heard this entire conversation, called out to me and said “Hey friend, are you OK?”I replied that actually, no, I’m not. We talked, and she had breast cancer too. She’d just had a lumpectomy. What amazed me was she’d gone through this horrible thing but was so attuned and supportive to me. She told me, “It’ll be OK. They’re really good at breast cancer. They know how they treat it.” And then we just started talking about our lives.The kindness of strangers: a glamorous flight attendant gave me her brand-new lipstickRead moreHer partner later came bearing a marijuana cookie, and we ate half each. When he left, we talked all night – about our childhoods, our foibles, our mistakes, our mutual past as surfer chicks, her time as a party girl, my kid, her not having kids. We didn’t sleep. At the end of the night, I felt as though I’d shared everything that I’d never shared with anyone before, and we just were so loving and kind to each other. And thanks to the cookie, we also laughed so much we wet our pants and got in trouble with the nurses for making too much noise.The next day she checked out. She sent me an email saying I was in her thoughts and that she knew I’d be OK. I began two years of intensive treatment – I had another mastectomy, a hysterectomy, chemo and radiation – and was too sick to contact anybody. I later had my email hacked and lost her contact details.But that woman was a game-changer. Even though I had a not-terribly-positive future in front of me, it was transformative to have this fantastic night together. It taught me two things: that I could leave that space of darkness and find joy, and to look for the kindness people give you, because kindness is what will sustain you. And itisthere, if you look for it.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

On the sprawling 640-acre property of pine and cottonwoods, buffalo grass and blue grass, Baker drives out early in the mornings to feed his cows and think about what he could have done differently.On 1 June 2004, Gerard Baker became the first Native American superintendent at Mount Rushmore national memorial, and his six years at the helm were both transformative and turbulent.Mount Rushmore was first conceived by Doane Robinson, theSouth Dakotastate historian, who wanted to build sculptures in the Black Hills that reflected the American west and attracted regional car tourists. When Robinson tasked the controversial artist Gutzon Borglum to lead the project, however, the idea metamorphosed from economics to politics, as Borglum decided to build a memorial to the American political system, which he deemed the apotheosis of western civilization. He envisioned portraits of four presidents who he called “empire makers”, and on 1 October 1925, Borglum held the memorial’s first dedication in front of over 3,000 spectators.After centuries of trauma, Montana’s Blackfeet Nation turns to an old friend for food sovereignty: bisonRead moreOne hundred years later, the national memorial is a lightning rod of political and historical interpretation. In summer 2020, Donald Trump gave a speech at Rushmore that offered a narrow view of American history and the memorials and monuments meant to reflect that history. More recently, Rushmore has become a totem for Maga America, with legislation introduced to carve Trump into the granite. Yet the memorial stands on land that reflects the darker side of our nation’s past, a history the Trump administration is keen to erase.The Black Hills, the Paha Sapa in Lakota, are sacred to the Lakota, and the US took the Paha Sapa from the Lakota Nation in early 1877, after the tribe had defeated George Armstrong Custer’s 7th Cavalry at the Battle of Little Bighorn the previous June. The Lakota call the Black Hills the Heart of Everything That Is, and when the US stole the landscape of ponderosa pine and granite, it broke the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie and began a process to erase Native American culture and history.During his six years as leader at Rushmore, Baker, who is now 71, worked to reintroduce this history at Mount Rushmore and expand the memorial’s interpretation to include stories and histories of the Indigenous American tribes who have called the Paha Sapa home for thousands of years. He hired local, Native American interpreters to tell their tribes’ stories; set up teepees to educate visitors and recruited hoop dancers to perform at Rushmore’s large auditorium to showcase Indigenous culture. For Baker, these efforts were the culmination of a career spent expanding the interpretation of our national parks.View image in fullscreenGutzon Borglum works on his model for the Mount Rushmore memorial at his studio in Pennington county, South Dakota, circa 1926.Photograph: Keystone View Company/FPG via Getty ImagesWhile many of the millions of annual visitors to Mount Rushmore loved the new perspectives, others within the Black Hills were unsettled by this widened interpretive framework. They were debates, in hindsight, that presaged this current political moment.Mount Rushmore national memorial is stewarded by the National Park Service (NPS), which is itself part of the US Department of the Interior (DOI). In an effort to “restore truth and sanity to American history”, Trump issued an executive order that took effect this fall and instructed the DOI to ensure memorials and monuments “do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living … and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people”.While this effort to sanitize American history at our national parks fits within the Trump administration’s broader goal to reshape American historical narratives, it runs counter to Baker’s struggles to make our national parks – to make Mount Rushmore – a more accurate reflection of our complex nation and history.When Baker retired from the National Park Service in 2010, he was the highest-ranking Indigenous American to ever work in the organization. “I like to tell people that my first job in the Park Service was cleaning toilets and I worked my way down to management,” he once joked with me. Baker, who is Mandan-Hidatsa, was born on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota in 1953, the year the Garrison Dam opened along the Missouri River.Garrison Dam was built to prevent flooding along our country’s longest river, and though everyone wanted to control the flooding, no one wanted their communities impacted by the proposed dams. As the least powerful citizens in North Dakota, the Indigenous Americans living on Fort Berthold Reservation watched as Garrison Dam flooded their homes, crops, graves, historical sites and generational memories. Eighty percent of the families living in Fort Berthold – including the Bakers – were forced to relocate; a traumatic experience Baker and his family never forgot.Baker’s first job in the National Park Service was tending campgrounds at nearby Theodore Roosevelt national park. By summer 1974, Baker had switched to weekend patrol, and on Sunday evenings, he would witness the campfire theater and interpretive programs offered by the park rangers.View image in fullscreenGerard Baker’s official National Park Service portrait.Photograph: National Park Service“And they would talk about – obviously Theodore Roosevelt – talk about the wildlife, talk about the cottonwood trees and asters, talk about natural resources and white cultural resources. And nothing about Indians. Nothing about Indians. And that was their territory. That was Hidatsa territory.”Baker approached the park’s chief interpreter and asked if he could give a program, and she surprisingly agreed. Baker built a fire, dressed in traditional Hidatsa clothes, and set traditional music over the speakers as a crowd assembled. He wanted to almost magically emerge from behind a partition, and when he did so, dancing and spinning, he was shocked to see many of his relatives in attendance.Though Baker was embarrassed to perform in front of his family, he grew committed to telling Native American stories within the largely white national park system. It was a commitment he brought with him to two critical leadership positions within the NPS. First, as superintendent at the Battle of Little Bighorn National Monument, where he received death threats for his efforts to tell the stories of the Indigenous Americans who fought against Custer in 1876. Later, as superintendent of Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, where he led the bicentennial of the expedition, emphasizing not only the two American explorers but also the Native peoples and villages affected by their journey west.Still, these challenges paled in comparison with what he would experience at Mount Rushmore.Days before Baker started as superintendent of Rushmore, he and his wife drove to a hotel in the Black Hills town of Custer. Baker, who is tall, physically imposing and always in braids, asked for a room and was told none were available. His wife, who is white, then went into the hotel, asked for a room, and returned with a key. It was a form of racism not uncommon in the Black Hills, an area of the US with a fraught history between Indigenous Americans and white residents.Thirteen years after the US seized the Black Hills, in 1890, the Wounded Knee Massacre – in which nearly 300 Indigenous Americans, largely unarmed, were slaughtered by American soldiers – took place just south of the Hills. Before Mount Rushmore was even an idea, Native American tribes in South Dakota had their lands taken and were forced onto reservations, their children forced into residential boarding schools designed to stamp out Indigenous language and culture.Under this historical backdrop, no one contested the building of a memorial to the US on sacred Lakota land. A century on from Mount Rushmore’s initial dedication, however, perspectives have changed.As Native American political consciousness and activism grew in the 1960s and 1970s, many in the Native American community and beyond began to see Rushmore less as a reflection of American exceptionalism and more a reflection of the genocidal march west that killed millions of Native peoples. The memorial became – and remains – a source of deep, generational pain.Baker was attuned to all this when he took the job.“The Rushmore story is tough to tell,” Baker told me. “That is a bad, tough story to tell without people getting emotional. And mad and crying and everything else. And it’s still that way.”View image in fullscreenBaker’s ranch in Montana.Photograph: Taylor ChapmanBefore Baker introduced Native interpretation, he had his rangers travel to nearby Indian reservations. In public forums, Baker and his team asked residents how Rushmore should be interpreted, and the answers – full of pain and forgotten history – brought some rangers to tears.In summer 2005, a year into his tenure, Baker set up a singular teepee to the left of Borglum’s sculpture, a flat stretch of land partially shaded by the ponderosa pine. The teepee had been up for a couple of days when Baker noticed a problem with the flaps. Dressed in his National Park ranger outfit, Baker went to adjust the teepee when he noticed a small crowd form around him. He gave an impromptu interpretive talk about Native history and culture, about the people who live and had lived in the Paha Sapa for generations. It was the beginning of Native interpretation at Rushmore; and today, that singular teepee has grown into the Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota Heritage Village, which still stands today.Though Baker’s expanded interpretations were ultimately successful, he clashed with the Mount Rushmore Society – a local non-profit that supports and helps fund the memorial – whose leadership questioned Baker’s emphasis on Native interpretive programs and bristled against his confrontational style. The fighting took a toll on both his relationships and his body. Baker’s health deteriorated, and in November 2009, after years of strain, he suffered a stroke. When he looks back on those days now from his Montana ranch, Baker wonders if he could have been less forceful in his pursuit of change.Yet Baker’s battles over the interpretive soul of Mount Rushmore strike a chord today, as the Trump administration aims to remove any historical complexity from our national parks and museums. These efforts to narrow historical perspectives at places meant to serve all Americans emphasize what Baker has always understood, what he always fought for – the power of interpretation.“We have to look at what do the visitors want to hear when they come to a park like Rushmore,” he once told me. “And how do they want to leave? Well, most people want to come to a national park and leave with that warm, fuzzy feeling with an ice cream cone. Rushmore can’t do that if you do it the right way. If you do it the right way people are going to be leaving pissed.”Matthew Davis is an award-winning journalist and author based in WashingtonDC. His latest book,A Biography of a Mountain: The Making and Meaning of Mount Rushmore(11 November 2025) marks the memorial’s 100th anniversary in 2025.Explore more on these topicsNative AmericansSouth DakotaIndigenous peoplesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When will the PM realise that his strategy just isn’t working?Sun 26 Oct 2025 10.04 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 13.58 EDTShareThis result was never particularly in doubt. Lucy Powell continually polled ahead of her rivalBridget Phillipson, and now she has won. What made her triumph so predictable is just how patently unhappy people, including members of the Labour party, are with Keir Starmer and his progress after more than a year in government.Pollingfrom the end of September has his approval rating among members at -11. As I never tire of saying, a core thing to remember about internal Labour party contests is that party members – who, along with members of affiliated unions, form the voter base for such races – are fairly bog standard left liberals who like public services and Europe, and nationalising the railways and Ed Miliband. “Tough on immigration” doesn’t do so much for them. They are also often less politically engaged than you might expect, and should be understood separately from the party’s hardened activist class.Powell was the right person at the right time to be the vehicle for this discontent. Before entering parliament, she was an aide to Miliband during his time as leader: she is on the soft left. She entered parliament in 2012, becoming the MP for Manchester Central, and when Angela Rayner resigned there was a strong sense that her successor should be a woman from the north of England. And, whilePowell has decried as sexistdescriptions of her as a proxy for the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, a whole bunch of headlines linking her name to one of the most popular figures in the party doesn’t exactly hurt. She was sacked from cabinet in the post-Rayner resignation reshuffle that took the top team unambiguously to the right: that left heravailable to run and, presumably, not delighted with the leadership herself.That the result was comparatively close –54% for Powell, 46% for Phillipson – is testament to the latter’s strength as a candidate. Being the leadership’s pick, in the circumstances laid out, was always going to be a poisoned chalice. Phillipson did about as well as anyone could have. As education secretary (and also, of course, a northern woman – as the MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, technically even more northern, but out of the powerful Greater Manchester orbit), she has been doing exactly the kind of work that Labour members like,giving teachers pay risesandproposing to apply VATto private school fees. Traditionally on the right of the party –she addressed the conferenceof the Blairite groupingProgressive Britainearlier this year – her plans forgreater control of academieshave drawn ire from some in that part of the political world, and sheranks highlyin members’ polls of preferred cabinet members.The overall campaign – compressed into the drizzly post-conference mid-October blur – was not one for the ages. There was a graveyard shift hustings at conference after most people had gone home.Reports appearedthat Phillipson was putting pressure on the government to lift the two-child benefit cap, probably the single policy most hated by Labour members. Powell said Labour couldn’t “sugar-coat” how badly things were going. Party members got a lot of texts.1:45Lucy Powell is elected as Labour deputy leader – videoDespite the low-energy campaign,bad feelingwithin the party did grow. Some on the party’s right drew attention to the fact that the Corbynite campaign group Momentum had, after aballot of members, “strongly recommended” a vote for Powell. This strikes me as a bad attack line, in part because it is out of date – Momentum is not the force it was and Jeremy Corbyn is long gone from the party – and in part because of Powell’s reputation as a fairly staid character. She has served in the shadow cabinet and the cabinet; unlike, say, the Socialist Campaign Group’s deputy leadership nominee, Bell Ribeiro-Addy (who didn’t get the nominations needed to make it on to the ballot paper), there is little chance that Powell will use her new position to become a wholesale anti-government outrider.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Powell, fairly enough, objects to being seen as a proxy for Burnham, but she is certainly a proxy for anti-Starmer sentiments, and now she is possessed of both an independent mandate and a seat on Labour’s national executive committee, the party’s powerful governing body (which adjudicates on, among other things, candidate selections). Inher acceptance speech, she said that Labour must “give a stronger sense of our purpose, whose side we’re on, of our Labour values and beliefs. That’s what I’ve heard loudly and clearly around the country these last few weeks. As deputy, my job will be to bring those voices to the heart of our party”. She added that she thinks “people feel that this government is not being bold enough in delivering the change we promised”.Overall, this isn’t good news for Starmer. Despite the fact that he and his new deputy profess much the same politics, her election signals serious opposition. She was able to get around a better-resourced and better-endorsed opponent through sheer force of popular feeling. Thebyelection in Caerphillylast week, in which Labour came a distant third in its former safe seat behind Plaid Cymru and Reform, was only a taste of what the party can expect in next May’s local elections. At that point Starmer – already a beleaguered figure – will undoubtedly face some calls to stand down. It’s hard to picture Powell as the smiler with the knife – but equally difficult to imagine her being hugely energetic in any endeavours to keep Starmer in No 10.Morgan Jones is the co-editor of Renewal: A Journal of Social DemocracyExplore more on these topicsLucy PowellOpinionKeir StarmerLabourBridget PhillipsoncommentShareReuse this content"

Other local authorities should take noteSun 26 Oct 2025 07.12 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 15.11 EDTShareOn a windswept housing estate by the Channel, Jacob Taylor surveys the latest addition to his property empire: a mixture of one-, two- and three-bedroom flats, built on the playing fields of an old private school.They might not look like much but these neat rows of redbrick homes are an important acquisition – not for an offshore investor or a real-estate mogul, but for the Labour-runBrightonand Hove city council, where Taylor, its deputy leader, is taking a trailblazing approach.“We are essentially rapidly buying properties from private landlords,” he says, walking through the plot in the Sussex village of Rottingdean, where Rudyard Kipling once lived.In a plan agreed this month, the council is spending £50m to acquire 200 homes over the next two years, with the aim of replenishing its heavily depleted stock of social homes and temporary accommodation.This isright to buyin reverse. Taking chunks of private property into public hands, Taylor aims to tackle a worsening housing and homelessness crisis in the seaside city, where as many as 10 more people are sleeping rough every week.“The housing crisis is so bad in Brighton – we have near-London house prices but don’t have London wages,” he says. “It’s actually been getting worse in the last year, not better.“You can’t underestimate the impact it’s having on people. As yet, I haven’t got enough homes versus the demand. But I am not going to put up with this disaster. I am determined to dramatically reduce the problem.”Other councils, and the government, should take note.Housingshortages, spiralling rents, and the cost to local authorities of housing families in temporary accommodation – funnelling public money into the pockets of private landlords – are a massive national problem. In this all-encompassing economic and social crisis sweeping the country, Brighton is but a microcosm.More than 1.3 million families in England are on social housing waiting lists, enough to fillevery home in Lithuania. Their ranks have swelled by 37% since 2015, and a record 164,040 children are homeless and stuck in temporary accommodation, double the number in 2012. For the worst three councils, all in London, it wouldtake more than a centuryto clear the housing register.Brighton is fairly middle of the pack in the national picture, with about 5,000 households on its register. However, the wait is long enough that a child born today could finish secondary school without finding a council home.David Chaffey, the chief executive of BHT Sussex, a social housing provider that also supports rough sleepers in Brighton and Hove, says the lack of affordable housing is causing untold social misery and strangling the local economy.Ministers confirm plans to reduce London’s affordable housing quotasRead more“You need to be able to have adequate housing for people to work in your local economy. Jobs can’t be filled. We have helped people who were working in a full-time job but living in their cars before they came to us, as they just can’t afford the rent here.”When Rachel Reeves talks about “securonomics”, this is exactly what she means. Britain’s social foundations have been stripped bare, eroded by years of neoliberal policymaking, flatlining growth, and under-investment. Brighton’s story shows the scale of the challenge to overcome.Above the windswept white cliffs, one cause of Brighton’s housing crisis is immediately clear.House pricesand rents are well above average thanks in part to its fast train line to London, which makes it attractive to affluent City commuters. “DFLs, we call them,” Chaffey says. The acronym means “down from London”.However, another cause is more pernicious: the erosion of the council’s housing stock under Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy scheme. Since 1980,more than a thirdof homes locally have been sold off. Many are now student HMOs (houses in multiple occupation) or are rented out by private landlords, often to tenants on housing benefit or in council-funded temporary accommodation.“If you want to understand why we have huge swaths of the country where the housing market is totally broken, point to that [right to buy],” says Taylor.Although it helped millions of families on to the housing ladder, the Thatcherite policy has been a disaster,costing taxpayers almost £200bnin one of the biggest transfers of public wealth to private hands in modern history.Failure to replace these homes has not only deprived councils of stock to house today’s generation of families in need of support. Privatisation has embedded structurally higher housing costs for local authorities. Spending on housing hasballooned to more than £30bn, with about 90% going on housing benefit.View image in fullscreenVaughan Williams Way, Rottingdean. The council is spending £50m to buy 200 homes over the next two years.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianIn Brighton the council expects to overspend its budget by about £3.8m on temporary accommodation this year, money Taylor says is flowing entirely to private landlords.“It’s all a consequence of Thatcherism, plus austerity, and not being able to turn the tide on it properly.“Our aim is to accelerate the increase in stock of social housing, but also to directly reduce the extreme costs of booking temporary accommodation with private landlords, which is pushing us to bankruptcy.”At a national level, Labour’s plan to build 1.5m new homes will help. But it is increasingly in danger of failing to live up to its full billing. At risk of failure to meet the target, ministers could also sacrifice quality, affordability and targeting construction in the places in most need.This could be problematic for Brighton. Wedged between the sea and the South Downs national park, development land here is scarce or costly. Taylor fears ministers – playing a numbers game – might prioritise places with lower development costs when allocating £39bn of funding that the government has earmarked to build a new generation of social homes.However, bit by bit, the tide is ebbing in the opposite direction on the south coast, helped by reversing right to buy. Under its acquisition programme, Brighton and Hove is growing its housing stock for the first time in decades.At a pace of about 100 acquisitions a year, progress is slow. “It’s not wiping out the register – we’re honest and acknowledge that,” Taylor says. Going faster would require Labour not just to build more homes, but to put more financial firepower into the Brighton model.Explore more on these topicsHousingEconomics viewpointBrightonHouse pricesPropertyEconomic policyRachel ReevesEast SussexcommentShareReuse this content"

The leftwing, independent TD (member of parliament) with the quiet composure and austere appearance of a contemplative nun has won anoverwhelming victoryto succeed the outgoing national treasure, 84-year-old poet Michael D Higgins. Her choice as the republic’s 10th head of state in a contest so bizarre it might have been scripted by Basil Fawlty has left the two government parties reeling.Fianna Fáil’s candidate, Jim Gavin, hand-picked by the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, for his accomplishments in sport and the cultural bastion of the Gaelic Athletic Association,withdrewafter it emerged he had failed since 2009 to refund €3,300 owed to a former tenant. Gavin’s name remained on the ballot paper as a ghost candidate. How Martin must rue the day Live Aid founderBob Geldofphoned him last summer seeking the party’s nomination and he demurred because he already had Gavin in mind.There is egg dribbling down the established media’s face too. Sinn Féin, the biggest opposition party, announced last month that it was supporting Connolly’s candidacy. When the party’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, promised that this decision would be an election “gamechanger”, commentators scoffed, “some gamechanger”.The five leftwing parties in the Dáil – Sinn Féin, Labour, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and the Greens – forged an unprecedented collaboration to support Connolly’s independent candidacy. Her triumph has therefore exploded the shibboleth that the fractured left is an immovable obstacle to Sinn Féin ever forming a government.Connolly’s election is also counter-cultural in an EU increasingly moving to the right and a climate of racism, anti-feminism and militarism.Connolly was not a perfect candidate but she had two big advantages. For the past 35 years, since Mary Robinson became the first woman and first leftwing president of Ireland, the electorate has relished plumping for the edginess of an outsider – a hint of idiosyncrasy, even – in the country’s first citizen. It seems to satisfy a national self-image of nonconformism, albeit never manifested in parliamentary elections. One of the hottest-selling gift items during the current presidency was a Higgins look-alikeknitted tea cosy.Connolly’s bigger advantage, though, was the ABH (Anybody But Humphreys) factor. Heather Humphreys, a genial former government minister of the keep-talking-but-say-nothing old school – was lured out of retirement to represent Fine Gael after her party’s first choice, former EU commissionerMairead McGuinness, dropped outfor health reasons. When Humphreys’ vaunted potential to unify the island as a Presbyterian living beside the Irish border failed to find traction, Fine Gael launched an American-stylenegative campaignin a desperate attempt to stop her sliding further down the polls. An internet video accused Connolly of hypocrisy for attacking the banks’ role in Ireland’s catastrophic housing crisis when she had represented the banks in court as a barrister before her election to the Dáil in 2016. The tactic backfired when many voters objected to Fine Gael’s Trumpian tactics.Connolly is the eldest of 14 children. She grew up in a local authority house in Galway. She is anti-war, anti-imperialist, pro-Ireland’s reunification and an advocate of disability rights. Like her predecessor, she has been critical of theEU’s inertiaduring Israel’s human slaughter in Gaza. Her more reckless pronouncementsthat France and the UK could not be trustedbecause of their arms industries, and likening Germany’s rearmament to the situation that prevailed in 1939, made many voters wary of what she might say as president. That risk, however, has proved preferable to the alternative of returning to old-style, pre-Robinson presidencies when the incumbents unfailingly toed the government line to the point of public irrelevance.A psychologist and a lawyer, Connolly was often evasive during the campaign when questioned about acontroversial visit she made to Syriaduring the Assad regime andher employment in the Dáil of a dissident republicanwho had been jailed on firearms charges. The latter, she said, was an exercise of her commitment to prisoner rehabilitation.At 68, she is older than Humphreys but she had stronger appeal for younger voters who latched on to her civic society-style peacenik campaign. Her fluency in Irish, the state’s first official language, sharply contrasted with Humphreys’ inability to speak it in public. After decades of resisting the native tongue, speaking Irish has become cool for a generation tuned into Kneecap.While her election is being feted by her backers, there is too a sense of a country holding its breath. An extraordinarily high number of spoilt votes in Friday’s election – exceeding Humphreys’s votes in some areas – coincided with two consecutive nights ofviolent riotingoutside a Dublin accommodation centre for asylum applicants and war refugees last week. Leftwing parties, having coalesced under Connolly’s candidacy, will be at loggerheads again once the byelection is called to fill the Dáil seat she leaves vacant. Yet the seeds have now been sown for future cooperation on the left by way of a vote-transfer pact at the next general election which could offer the electorate a plausible choice between a government leaning right or one leaning left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The result is an emphatic humiliation. Mutterings of discontent in both parliamentary parties are already generating speculation about how long the two leaders can survive before the next general election – to be held by January 2029 at the latest.For a position that is largely ceremonial and devoid of political power, the ramifications of this presidential election are likely to rumble on well past Connolly’s formal inauguration at Dublin Castle next month.Justine McCarthy is a columnist with the Irish TimesExplore more on these topicsIrelandOpinionEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

No, it isn’t. The violence is much reduced. Yet Israeli forces havereportedlykilled about 100 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more since the 10 October ceasefire began. Food aid supplies are stillheavily restricted. The occupation continues, in Gaza and the West Bank. US officialsfearprime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his accomplices may renege on the deal, as in the past.Likewise,Hamaselements and rival gangs have kept fighting. The terrorist group is not disarming; Israeli forces have not fully withdrawn to the agreed lines. US-framed security, governance and reconstruction proposals remain vague, hypothetical and contentious. The war’s root causes, principally the denial of Palestinian sovereignty and statehood, are not addressed. Unless that changes, it will all kick off again, sooner or later.Yet for the sake of argument, let’s pretend – and hope – that Trump is right, and sustainable peace somehow slowly emerges from Gaza’s ruins. What happens next? Justice is what must happen next. As in other “post-conflict” situations, the living and the dead in Israel andPalestineare owed a reckoning.All who committed, or oversaw, war crimes on or after 7 October 2023 must answer for their actions. Lest we forget, there are multitudes of victims, on both sides, whose suffering cries out for recognition, resolution and reparation. If only to reduce the risk of resumed warfare, it’s imperative that there be accountability and an end to impunity.Genocidemust never go unpunished. How extraordinary, then, that Trump’s “historic”, supposedly Middle East-transforming20-point peace planmakes no mention of, and offers no path towards, any sort of official, postwar public investigatory process. Senior European, Arab and UK politicians are silent on this issue, too, apparently keen to draw a veil over the shaming events of the past two years.One explanation is that, in different ways, their governments were complicit. Another is that the war exposed their lack of influence – and a societally damaging failure, exploited by Netanyahu and some Jewish diaspora leaders, to distinguish between crude antisemitism and legitimate anti-Israel, anti-war sentiment.It’s even suggested that looking back jeopardises efforts to move forward. Nonsense. The restorative quest for justice, truth and reconciliation in Sierra Leone,Argentina,Rwanda, South Africa, Cambodia and formerYugoslaviademonstrates the opposite can be true. Lessons learned in such places have universal application.A reckoning is necessary and urgent. So let’s start at the top. Netanyahu and Israel’s former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, were charged last year by the international criminal court (ICC) with war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder and starvation. The late Hamas chief, Mohammed Deif, was also indicted.It’s shameful these two fugitives from justice remain at large. Israel must surrender them – or face punitive sanctions. The wartime words and actions of Netanyahu’s far-right accomplices, notablyItamar Ben-Gvirand Bezalel Smotrich, senior Israeli military chiefs and surviving Hamas leaders also require expedited ICC investigation.Netanyahu must face the consequences at home, too. The unblocking of an independent commission of inquiry into 7 October security failures is essential. And now “peace” has broken out, Netanyahu’s oft-delayed corruption trial must quickly conclude. Trump’s demand that he be pardoned is itself deeply corrupt.Israel Defense Forces (IDF) actions in Gaza have shocked world opinion and permanently harmed Israel’s reputation. The global verdict is already in: the IDF knowingly and systematically violated international humanitarian law (including the Geneva conventions) and routinely committed war crimes bydeliberately targeting civilians.If this verdict is unfair to what Netanyahu, in all seriousness, calls the world’s “most moral army”, then an independent, external investigation might clear its name. Hamas must answer for its crimes, too.It’s hard to keep track of all the atrocities, let alone prosecute those responsible. In March, 15 Palestinian medics and rescue workers were executed, the UN said. In April, photojournalist Fatma Hassouna and six family members diedin an airstrikeon their Gaza City home. In June, civilians seeking food aidwere shotin one of many such incidents. These are three recent instances of alleged IDF war crimes, chosen at random.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIsrael stands accused by the UN, many governments, human rights groups, legal scholars and informal “people’s courts” of committing genocide in Gaza, which it denies. By some legal definitions – weaponisation of food and forcible transfer – “genocidal acts” are continuing despite the ceasefire. After South Africa and others challenged Israel’s actions, the international court of justice (ICJ) found in January that there was ademonstrable risk of genocide. Yet a final rulingmay not come until 2028. That’s an unacceptable delay – and in any event, the court cannot enforce its decisions.What’s urgently needed now is a UN-sponsored international criminal tribunal forGaza, modelled on those in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. It should be empowered to examine all aspects of Israel’s and Hamas’s conduct of the war, especially their shared disregard for civilian lives and their killing, torture and mistreatment of hostages and detainees.The tribunal, complementing the ICC and ICJ, should also scrutinise wartime political decision-making, and whether third parties such as the US and Iran, which actively aided and abetted the combatants, share responsibility for the unlawful consequences. The culpability of countries such as the UKthat armed the IDFmust also be assessed. To kickstart this process, all of Gaza should be immediately opened up to UN investigators and international journalists.An international tribunal with power to punish perpetrators and compensate victims is an essential antidote to Gaza’s world-shaking horrors. It’s not about revenge. It’s about justice – and political will. A tribunal cannot change what happened. Yet it could help ensure it does not happen again. Until there’s a full and honest accounting, the war will never be truly over.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuOpinionInternational court of justiceHamasGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Sound appealing?Sun 26 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 11.46 EDTShareEd Gamble is already an award-winning comedian, chart-topping podcast and radio host and author, but he might have just added a surprising new accolade to this collection: the saviour of marriage.Fellow standup Rhys James recently appeared on Off Menu, the podcast Gamble presents with James Acaster, where guests detail their dream meal. For his starter, Rhys James said he wanted buffalo wings and nachos from a former culinary hotspot called Billy’s in the Hertfordshire town of Harpenden, where his dad used to take him during the year he and James’s mum were separated. That James’s parents had split up for only 12 months obviously provoked further questions and comment, during which Gamble had his moment of genius.“So they had a rumspringa,” he announced.Rumspringa is a period in Amish teenagers’ lives, usually around the age of 16, where they’re allowed to leave their communities and “encouraged to explore otherwise forbidden or strictly regulated behaviours”, before choosing whether to return and commit to the church. With the divorce rate currently at around 42% in the UK, is it time we introduced the concept of the Long-Term Relationship Rumspringa?To be clear, this is not an open marriage. It’s a pre-agreed length of time when a couple live apart and are “encouraged to explore otherwise forbidden or strictly regulated behaviours” before choosing whether to return and commit to the relationship anew. A grass-is-greener test, if you like, because you just never know, do you? For example, this week a post from Fesshole, the social media account where people anonymously confess their darkest secrets, read: “I fantasise about my wife of 25 years dying. Time to myself. Drink what I want. Live the life. Do what I want. She went away for a week with her girlfriends. I was so bored and lonely it was unreal. I hope I die first.”The first rule of Relationship Rumspringa is you have to earn it. This is for those who’ve served their time, put in the hours, toiled at love’s coalfaceIn an ideal world, post-Rumspringa, the two parties will come home both hoping they die first. They will return with renewed enthusiasm and appreciation for their spouse, and the institution of marriage/endurance cohabitation itself. Of course, there’s a risk it could backfire because the lawn was indeed much more verdant on the other side, but it’s better – all round – to know, isn’t it? This isn’t a dress rehearsal, after all.The first rule of Relationship Rumspringa must be that you have to earn it. Can’t work out if you should propose or not and believe this will help you decide? Boohoo, no way. Newlyweds, wait your turn. Done a ten-stretch and think you’re ready? In your dreams. This is for those who have served their time, put in the hours, toiled tirelessly at love’s coalface. The average life sentence in the UK is 15 to 20 years, and that should be the case here too. Any fewer miles on the clock than that and you’re not coming in. (Well, getting out, technically.)Fully indulging in the Rumspringa – as in, biblically – or not is an individual decision to wrestle with for those taking part. Some will see it as cheating if there’s no cheating, some will never be able to get past it if there is, though being granted permission to sleep around may well be a wake-up call – we’re talking about people who have been in comfortable relationships for two decades here, and are less likely to be in peak physical condition, with rusty, dusty seduction techniques. Good luck on the apps!When the Rumspringa has sprung, and it’s time to reunite, there should perhaps be a ritual to follow. Each person writes down whether they want to stay married or break up for good, and they reveal their verdicts simultaneously, like on the old gameshow Mr and Mrs (but with an added question mark at the end of the title). Otherwise you run the risk, if you want to make the split permanent after a humdinga of a Rumspringa, that the other talks first and wants to stay together, and you feel so bad you remain married out of politeness. Just after experiencing a torturous glimpse of the new life you could have won.If the time apart does reignite that old spark, and you fall back into each other’s arms gratefully, you should then be permitted to renew your vows. No one else should be allowed, for the record, because vows do not expire. Actually, maybe they should, though? Ed Gamble’s presumably chewing this over as we speak.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsOpinionRadio comedycommentShareReuse this content"

But I ended up thanking himSun 26 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 14.00 EDTShareWhat do vicars do in their spare time? Last week, I went with two friends, both fellow vicars, to see thenew film I Swear. I knew from the trailer that it was about a man with Tourette syndrome (TS). What I didn’t know was that it was about a real person: John Davidson who was the subject of a 1989 BBC documentary calledJohn’s Not Madand who laterreceived an MBEfor his efforts to educate people about the condition and support others who have it.Before that programme, most people had never heard of TS. Nearly 40 years later, everybody (sort of) knows what it is, but it’s still often treated as a punchline – particularly on the comedy circuit.From the trailer, it seemed clear that the film was going to try to have its cake and eat it by both capitalising on the undeniable comic potential of someone shouting the most inappropriate things (“I use spunk for milk”) at inopportune times and attempting to continue Davidson’s work of raising awareness in a respectful and sensitive way. I hope it’s not a spoiler to say it was successful on both counts – but of course I only knew that by the end.As the film was starting, a young man sitting in the row in front of us suddenly shouted out a string of obscenities. For a minute, I thought it was a joke – albeit one in very poor taste. However, it quickly became apparent that this was a real-life person with TS: a teenager accompanied by his father.And as the film continued, so did the boy – with no apparent intervention from either his dad or anyone in the audience. I felt somewhat conflicted. Clearly, it was a big deal for this family to see their no doubt incredibly difficult life depicted on the big screen, and I was pleased that they were having that opportunity. But was it OK that I (and everyone else in the auditorium) could hardly hear the film as a result? Could the cinema not have put on a special screening – as most of the chains regularly do for neurodiverse people in general?View image in fullscreenJohn Davidson signs copies of his memoir, I Swear, about living with Tourette syndrome, at Wigtown book festival, Galloway, 4 October 2025.Photograph: Steven May/AlamyI’m ashamed to say that I actually considered saying something – not to the boy’s father himself (I’m not a monster), but to the manager of the theatre. However, both of my clearly more charitable fellow vicars seemed to have resigned themselves to what was happening. Plus, in the back of my mind was the (admittedly fictional) incident in Extras when Ricky Gervais’s Andy Millman complains about a child making too much noise in a restaurant, unaware that he has Down’s syndrome. He barely survived the resultant bad press – and my offence would have been far worse because I knew the boy literally couldn’t help it.Fortunately, my better nature prevailed and something extraordinary happened over the following hour and a half. First, I simply became accustomed to the once-intrusive noise. Then, as the film reached its climax and we saw the incredibly liberating effect that Davidson’s Tourette’s camps have had on so many people, I felt humbled and very privileged to be sharing this moment with people who’d actually lived it not just as actors – although Robert Aramayo’s performance as Davidson was superb and, in my view, award-worthy.I’ve had similar experiences in the cinema before – watching The King’s Speech with a friend with a stammer and his speech therapist wife, or bumping into actual veterans of the Normandy landings in the foyer after Saving Private Ryan – but this was on another level. It was like a 4D screening, but instead of the chairs moving about and sprays of water hitting you in the face, the characters were sitting next to you saying, “This isn’t just a movie. It’s my reality.” And then swearing. Spunk for milk.So I didn’t complain. As the credits rolled, I actually went and thanked Joe – who was 14 – and Mark, his father, for the gift of their presence, which undoubtedly made our experience even more profound than it would have been anyway. We then had a long chat and took a selfie together – during which we all shouted a rude word in solidarity with Joe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But responsibility does not mean retreat. When speculation outpaces production and wealth grows without work, fairness must be restored. That’s why we’ll levy a modestchargeon financial trades that enrich the few but not the many.Only Labour can repair the damage caused by the Tories. Our mission is to renew the nation – engaging with the EU, not rejoining it. Public investment is not a drain on the present but a foundation for the future – paying back in stronger communities, greater self-reliance and higher productivity. So today we launch a national reconstruction plan, investing1% of GDPeach year in sustainable energy, green transport and advanced manufacturing – the industries that will power Britain’s recovery.This will be delivered within our new public balance‑sheet rule:net public worth(the value of our assets minus our liabilities) must rise over the economic cycle. Every pound we invest in British industry will strengthen, not weaken, the nation’s finances.I want to thank the Bank of England’s governor and the monetary policy committee for the work they have done. But independence must never mean isolation. So today we are establishing a new Bankconcordat, ensuring that the pace ofquantitative tighteningand debt issuance is in the public interest. If the economy operates below its potential, the Bank’scurrentduty to support the government’s economic policy will stand alongside its duty to maintain price stability. That is not politicisation – it is partnership in service of the common good.Mr Speaker, technology can power growth. But it cannot give it purpose on its own. Productivity comes from steady demand, investment and decent work. So we will pilot a regional job guarantee,offering jobsto all at a living wage in local green and care projects – rebuilding communities, securing incomes and achieving stability through full employment. In a volatile world, Britain cannot build its future on imported growth. Our new Agency for Public Investment will back homegrownindustryand enterprise so that value and jobs stay here, not overseas.To those who cry “too much borrowing”, I say this: we’ve paid billions to banks for money we created during quantitative easing. That waste ends today. The Bank will adopt a tiered-reserve system,saving taxpayers£20bn a year. This will help to end austerity and fund public services. And, yes, we will introduce a bank tax. Those who profit most must help rebuild the nation they rely on. That is sound finance: backing productivity, not balance sheets.Mr Speaker, every pound of day-to-day spending in this budget is fully funded. We will not raise income tax, national insurance or VAT.Promises made, promises kept.This budget draws a line under the failed orthodoxy found on the opposition benches. We will invest where markets fail and revive the regions left behind. The Tories say Britain spent too much. The truth: they invested too little, too late and in too few of our people. Labour ends that failure today. I commend this statement to the House.Explore more on these topicsBudgetOpinionRachel ReevesBank of EnglandEconomic policyGreen economyTax and spendingTaxeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Their promise is profound, but so are the risks. Progress must be guided by ethics and accessibilitySun 26 Oct 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 14.08 EDTShareIn medical terms, the eye is not the window to the soul, but to the mind. The retina and the optic nerve are outgrowths of neural tissue, and theremarkable successof electronic implants in restoring sight shows how far brain-computer interfaces have come. These have not delivered a sci-fi vision of augmented humans with incredible new powers but, perhaps more happily, significant progress has been made, restoring ability and agency to those who have suffered injury or disease.People with age-related macular degeneration face a fading world. The disease, affecting about600,000 people in the UK, causes progressive loss of central vision. There is no cure, but new trials offer something else: a new way of seeing.Patients at several trial sites across Europe, including Moorfields eye hospital in London, were fitted with asurgically implanted microchipin their retina. Just 4mm square and 30 micrometres thick, the chip functions as a pattern converter. Visual information recorded by a camera in a pair of glasses is beamed to the chip via infrared light, which the chip converts to electrical signals detected by the retina, restoring the lost link between the eye and the brain. After one year, 84% of patients in the38-person trialwere able to read letters and numbers with the device, having previously lost vision, with the average improvement equal to about five lines on a standard eye-test chart.The line between mind and machine is shifting. Devices placed on the head to read brainwaves have allowedparalysed people to type. Prosthetics currently in trialsare controlledby sensors placed on muscles and nerves remaining after amputation, and can feed back signals as well – restoring a sense of touch and proprioception. Last year, in typical hard-charging fashion, Elon Musk’s Neuralink venture implanted a chipdirectly into a volunteer’s brain, allowing him to send basic commands to a computer.The dangers should be obvious. In the macular degeneration trial there were 26“adverse events”, including retinal damage requiring further surgery. Go deeper into the brain and those risks multiply. Even then, the brain must be taught to read the signals – a reminder that these chips do not yet speak the body’s language. (An AI algorithm was used to pick text out of the visual signals more clearly, a simple example of how AI’s unique data‑processing and pattern-recognition power is made truly useful.)With any new medical technology, cost and accessibility are an issue. The Prima device from the trial isunder reviewby the US Food and Drug Administration and EU regulators. A CE mark from the latter would allow Prima to be considered for NHS provision. As with most prosthetic devices, this is the result of partnerships between publicly funded medical researchers and a private biotech firm, which handles any eventual large-scale manufacturing. In 2022, the NHSapproved various multi-gripprosthetic hands, controlled by non-invasive electrodes that read muscle signals, for widespread use – and reportedcosts of about£13,000 to £37,000 per prosthetic, plus additional service costs over time.Prima and other devices in trials are a step further – a direct fusion of advanced computer technology and the human nervous system. Few novels or films dwell on cyborgs simply throwing a ball or reading a newspaper, but that appears to be our future, and it is welcome.Explore more on these topicsMedical researchOpinionTechnology sectorHealthHealth policyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But, as he points out, it’s not a guarantee of sane government. At least 75% of what Donald Trump is doing is unconstitutional, but it’s permitted by a compliant Congress and a rubber-stamp supreme court that is suddenly discovering presidential powers in the constitution that its framers never intended. The true problem is that a large proportion of the US electorate is content to let this happen.Marina Hydenoted the same trend here – too many people are so dischuffed (some with good cause, some not) that they are willing to press the “F you” button and smash the system. In 1795, as the first US government was getting under way, the writer Samuel Miller commented that “political prosperity resides, not in the words and letters of the constitution; but in the temper, the habits, and the practices of the people”. With or without a constitution, there needs to be peaceful civic resistance to a future extremist regime until more people are persuaded that a humane and tolerant government is worth having.Peter LoschiOldham, Greater ManchesterGeorge Monbiot advocates a written constitution to defend against the threat ofReform UK. Do we really believe that it will win 40%-plus of votes and a majority of seats in a general election? I know it may be dangerous to dismiss it as a protest vote, but I can’t believe that.I was reading an entry from Alan Bennett’s Writing Home recently, where he opined that if Labour fought an election on the state of the NHS alone it would surely win hands down. Still true. Yet it is desperate to engage Reform on its home ground. I can’t believe people think that migration and cutting public services are the country’s biggest priorities.Ray FloodDundeeGeorge Monbiot calls for a written British constitution to be created through “a citizens’ constitutional convention”, with “participatory events all over the country”. But such events are likely to be dominated by people like him – educated, activist-minded liberals – whose values would then shape the constitution. Views that clash with theirs would be excluded by a process controlled by similar voices. In wanting to make his own values permanent, Monbiot shows an instinct not unlike Nigel Farage’s – both seek to enshrine their worldviews as the national default.Nathon RaineBradfordGeorge Monbiot says we urgently need constitutional change – there is an immediate opportunity for citizens to contribute to this agenda. The public bill committee reviewing theEnglish devolution and community empowerment billis welcoming submissions right now. In the evidence I submitted, published on the parliamentary website, I point out how the rise of far-right extremist groups gives renewed urgency to the importance of providing constitutional protection for all elected local authorities in England.It is a simple step for such a clause to be added to the bill. I explain how countries that outperform the UK on economic, social and environmental indicators, for example, Sweden, already enjoy such protections.Robin HambletonEmeritus professor, University of the West of EnglandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Ms Bakker reaches back into the 20th century to make her point, and says that “lesbians have always been invisible to society”.Lesbians were visible and audible in 1970s feminism. My late friend Sheila talked about the ideas behind Lesbian Nationby Jill Johnston, and tried to persuade me that “feminism is the theory, lesbianism is the practice”. In a career almost unimaginable without 70s feminism, Sheila became a rabbi.Through circumstance and solidarity, another late friend, Frances, was emboldened to write, sing and make music with others. She became Vi Subversa, the lead singer, lyricist and rhythm guitarist in the anarcho-punk bandPoison Girls.They played benefit gigs for the peace movement and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Their song Bully Boysmade them a target for the National Front.Moments in RiotWomenremind me of Frances/Vi when, unexpectedly, she began to write about her experience. I’m sorry Ms Bakker can’t appreciate Riot Womenfor what it is rather than disparage it for something it isn’t.Janet DubéPeebles, Scottish BordersTiff Bakker castigates Sally Wainwright’s approach to Riot Women as superficial. I am feeling quite foolish as I had not realised that this series was claiming to celebrate the north-west American feminist punk movement. I thought I was watching and enjoying a drama about the fraught lives of a group of women who cope with honesty, generosity and humour – a drama that yet again displayed Wainwright’s exceptional writing.Kathleen HamiltonPeasenhall, SuffolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, only 5,900 of them responded – suggesting that only 10% thought that they had a problem.The article cites the National Audit Office report, which confuses failure to meet PAS 2035 (a very tough standard for retrofit measures) with “defects”. Other research also shows that SWI is often installed well.True, solid wall insulation can go very wrong. Like with roof repairs, poor workmanship or cutting corners can be very costly to correct.

After months of speculation over whether he would recover in time,CricketAustralia on Monday finally confirmed that the quick would have to sit out the game at Optus Stadium.‘Team togetherness is crucial’: David Gower on how to win the AshesRead moreThe 32-year-old’s acumen with the ball in hand and his presence as a leader on the field will be sorely missed, and with uncertainty remaining over when he will be able to feature again, his absence comes as a blow to Australia’s hopes of retaining the Ashes urn.The 32-year-old has resumed running and “expects to return to bowling shortly”, CA said on Monday, although an exact date has not been put on any return to full fitness.Cummins has previously indicated he would like a full four weeks of bowling before returning to the starting XI, meaning the second Test in Brisbane starting on 4 December would be a realistic target, if he can resume bowling in the next week or so.Smith, who was stripped of the captaincy in the wake of the sandpaper scandal in 2018, has since filled in for Australia six times as Cummins’s vice-captain since the bowler assumed the role in November 2021. Smith boasts a better batting average as captain (68.98), compared with when not in the role (49.9).After spending six weeks in New York, Smith will have two chances to get his eye in ahead of the Ashes after being included in NSW’s Sheffield Shield squad. He will make his first appearance for the Blues in 12 months against Queensland at the Gabba this week, before facing Victoria on home soil at the SCG starting 10 November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Liverpool slipping to a fourth straight league defeatat Brentford on Saturday, Arsenal finished the weekend seven points clear of the defending champions.“I told the boys that I value more this victory than any other victory this season,” Arteta said. “We knew the difficulty of it after playing every three days. It was a big opportunity as well, with the things that happened during the weekend.Arsenal move four points clear at top as Eze strike sees off Crystal PalaceRead more“But I knew we were playing against a team who have, in my opinion, been one of the best in terms of organisation and how frustrated they can make you. The moment you lose concentration they will punish you.”Manchester City, aftera 1-0 loss at Aston Villaon Sunday, find themselves six points behind Arsenal. Arteta was keen, however, to pour cold water on any title talk. “We are where we are,” he said. “It’s a credit to us, because we’ve been very, very consistent knowing the difficulty of every match as well. It is early and doesn’t mean anything other than, ‘let’s keep doing a lot of things like we’re doing really well.’ But there are things to improve to give us better margins.”Eze’s goal was his first in the Premier League since joining from Crystal Palace for £67.5m in August. “He did it very similarly last year, but against us,” Arteta said smiling. “We know against a team that defends with so many bodies, doesn’t allow any space, you have to generate chaos or open spaces to generate big chances. He took the goal really well.”Arteta could not confirm the extent of the injuries that forced off William Saliba and Declan Rice. The substitute Gabriel Martinelli was also “a bit uncomfortable” by the end.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Oh my god, are you kidding me? Did you just see that?” he said to his engineer on team radio. “I could have fucking killed them.”After the race he was outraged that the marshals had been placed in such danger apparently without being informed that he was out of time with the rest of the field after pitting early. “I honestly couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” he said.“Boxed, came out and then I got to turn one and there were just two dudes running across the track. I nearly hit one of them, honestly, it was so dangerous. Obviously there’s been a miscommunication somewhere but I’ve never experienced that before and I haven’t really seen that in the past.“It’s pretty unacceptable. We can’t understand how on a live track marshals can be allowed to just run across the track like that. I have no idea why, I’m sure we’ll get some sort of explanation, but it really can’t happen again.”The FIA issued a statement afterwards stating it was investigating what had happened as instructions for marshals to enter the track had been revoked. “Following a turn one incident, race control was informed that debris was present on the track at the apex of that corner. On lap three, marshals were alerted and placed on standby to enter the track and recover the debris once all cars had passed turn one,” the statement read.“As soon as it became apparent that Lawson had pitted, the instructions to dispatch marshals were rescinded, and a double yellow flag was shown in that area. We are still investigating what occurred after that point.”Norris also brushed off booing he received from the crowd after his victory, apparently aimed at the British driver because Mexican fans perceived it had been unfair that he had been given back a place he lost to Piastri after a slow pit stop under team orders at Monza. In a poll Mexicans had voted that he should return the three points.“They have the right to do it if they want to do it, that’s sport sometimes,” he said. “I don’t know why I can’t stop laughing when I get booed. I think it makes it more entertaining for me, so they can keep doing it if they want.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

So long. This is my experience. There are many teams there and we have a good test against Bournemouth [next weekend], who are doing very well. We will try to do our game.“I was worried before the [September] international break when we were 14th in the table and they were seven or eight points in front. Our job is not to look at the table. If they win all their games and win the Premier League, congratulations to them, that’s all we can do. But I have the feeling the team is alive, the team is good.”Guardiola, whose side travel to Swansea in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday night, added: “I don’t know how many teams can come here and play the way we played, with the courage, possession and chances. We have to be stable with that. I don’t live in October and November thinking: ‘Oh what is going to happen if we don’t win the Premier League?’ So it’s game by game now.”City lost at Villa for the third successive season asErling Haaland, who has 11 league goals this season, failed to score for the first time in 13 matches. Guardiola pointed to the quality of Unai Emery’s side. “They are a Champions League team – unfortunately they are not there this season – but they are a top, top team and compete very well,” he said. “I admire them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here was one last chance to salvage something, theBarcelonamidfielder somehow hauling himself up the pitch in search of a final twist; instead, as he reached the other end, a tired touch and a desperate lunge saw him take out Aurélien Tchouaméni – the world upside down – and get sent off. And so theclásicowas over, bar the shouting and the pushing.There was plenty of that, players squaring up then and again when the final whistle went a few seconds later, Thibaut Courtois and Lamine Yamal confronting each other; so too Vinícius Júnior, who had stormed off when he was substituted, and Raphinha, who had not even played.Real Madrid 2-1 Barcelona: La Liga – live reactionRead moreIn the midst of it all, Madrid celebrated. The match that never lets you down was 105 minutes long and featured 37 shots, three goals scored, three more disallowed, a penalty given and taken away again and another saved. It also had a new winner, Madrid beating Barcelona fiveclásicoslater.First-half goals from Kylian Mbappé and Jude Bellingham brought revenge and maybe even some redemption afterfour defeats last season, Fermín López scoring for Barcelona. For 70 minutes, it had been frantic, players pouring through wide spaces from one end to the other; then Madrid had found a way to cede territory but not control, holding on to the lead they established early and might have established even earlier.When they scored the first of the day’s three goals, it was the third time this stadium had erupted; the difference, 20 minutes into a wild, noisy first half, was that the celebrations were not cut short by the video assistant referee.They had been playing just a minute and 57 seconds when César Soto Grado pointed to the spot, only to be called to the screen where he saw that it had, in fact, been Vinícius Júnior, running into the area and swiping at a shot, who had made contact with Lamine Yamal, not the other way round.Less than 10 minutes after that, Mbappé sent a superb shot flying beyond Wojciech Szczesny and into the net. Again, though, the replay rescued Barcelona, the Frenchman was fractionally offside.The tone was set for a match in which the best chances, of which there were many, came when Madrid were able to run, which they did often. Barcelona were unable to exercise the control they have become accustomed to. Uncomfortable when they were pushed back, nor did they look secure stepping up, the space behind them opening: the timing of their line is not what it once was, nor is the pressure applied on the passer.When the breakthrough came, when the line was breached, it was Bellingham who did it. Turning superbly away from Pedri, he slotted through for Mbappé to score.View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Pedri was sent off in the 10th minute of stoppage time.Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty ImagesA storm had started: Bellingham’s shot was deflected wide, Federico Valverde struck over, Mbappé was stopped by Szczesny, Álvaro Carreras was too, and Eric García had to slide in to stop Mbappé racing clear once more. All that inside nine minutes. Next came another opportunity for Vinícius Júnior and one for Bellingham, both saved by Szczesny.Yet Barcelona suddenly had a great chance – Ferran Torres’s shot was weak from near the penalty spot – and then the equaliser. Under pressure, Arda Guler lost it and Pedri, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Balde and Rashford again set up López to finish.It was Rashford’s seventh assist inblaugranabut it was not sufficient. Madrid led again when Vinícius Júnior beat Jules Koundé and played a long, looping cross, which was headed back across by Éder Militão. Waiting by the line to score was Bellingham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First, he put the ball in the net from close range just before the break but was offside. Then, García handled early in the second half but his penalty was saved superbly by Szczesny’s flashing right hand.The game was not showing any sign of slowing, the spaces still wide, and at the other end López wasted another collective stampede when he chose to go it alone and curled a shot straight at Courtois.Madrid though would not relinquish their lead, some of the frenzy finally slipping from the match as it went into the final quarter of an hour. Bit by bit, Barcelona got the ball but Xabi Alonso’s side waited, contained and continued to break. They, in fact, threatened more than the visitors did.Brahim Díaz, on for Guler, set up Bellingham to find the net, but the flag was up again. Mbappé had two chances to run, one stopped by Ronald Araújo and the other pulled wide.Still there was more: Koundé was unable to control a glorious ball from Lamine Yamal, which might have levelled it, Rodrygo was denied twice by Szczesny and then, with heavy legs, Pedri went off on that last run.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé celebrates putting Real Madrid 1-0 up against Barcelona.Photograph: Bernat Armangué/APExplore more on these topicsLa LigaReal MadridBarcelonaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 36-player squad, including 19 forwards and 17 backs, gathered at Pennyhill Park in Surrey on Sunday night.‘Exciting’ Noah Caluori could make England debut this autumn, says BorthwickRead moreCaluori made his second Prem start for Saracens in thedefeat by table-topping Northamptonon ­Friday. He had a considerably quieter night than the phenomenal display against Sale, and was given a severe defensive test by the Saints’ all-court attacking game.However, his remarkable aerial ability was in evidence at Franklin’s Gardens and, by turning to Caluori for his autumn squad, Borthwick has ­signalled that he sees potential for him to play at the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. The head coach found no place for Adam Radwan of Leicester, who shone in the Tigers’ win against Sale on Saturday and was chosen in Borthwick’s training squad last week. Radwan’s 23-year-old club colleague Emeka Ilione misses out because of a shoulder injury.The Sale flanker Tom Curry returns, having had surgery on a wrist ligament problem after the British & Irish Lions tour in the summer, and his scrum-half clubmate Raffi Quirke is also back from injury.Quick GuideEngland squad for the Autumn Nations SeriesShowForwardsFin Baxter (Harlequins), Ollie Chessum (Leicester), Alex Coles (Northampton), Luke Cowan-Dickie (Sale), Chandler Cunningham-South (Harlequins), Tom Curry (Sale), Theo Dan (Saracens), Ben Earl (Saracens), Ellis Genge (Bristol), Jamie George (Saracens), Joe Heyes (Leicester), Maro Itoje (Saracens), Nick Isiekwe (Saracens), Jack Kenningham (Harlequins), Asher Opoku-Fordjour (Sale), Guy Pepper (Bath), Henry Pollock (Northampton), Will Stuart (Bath), Sam Underhill (Bath).BacksHenry Arundell (Bath), Noah Caluori (Saracens), Fraser Dingwall (Northampton), Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (Exeter), George Ford (Sale), Tommy Freeman (Northampton), Ollie Lawrence (Bath), Alex Mitchell (Northampton), Cadan Murley (Harlequins), Max Ojomoh (Bath), Raffi Quirke (Sale), Tom Roebuck (Sale), Henry Slade (Exeter), Fin Smith (Northampton), Marcus Smith (Harlequins), Ben Spencer (Bath), Freddie Steward (Leicester).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There is good news for the Harlequins forward Chandler ­Cunningham-South, who takes his place in the squad despite a recent ankle ­problem, while Elliot Daly of ­Saracens and Leicester’s George ­Martin and Jack van ­Poortvliet will join the squad to work on injury rehabilitation.“Our focus is on making the most of the time we have together as we approach what will be a fiercely ­competitive series,” Borthwick said. “Facing Australia in the opening match will be a great test against a team that has been training and playing together for some time and is one of the in-form teams in the world.”The uncapped Caluori will be pitched into a fierce battle for ­starting spots in the back line: Tommy Freeman scored four tries in Northampton’s win against ­Saracens and, while the 24-year-old may be ­switching to outside-centre, there are several other world-class wing options available to Borthwick.Immanuel Feyi-Waboso scored his seventh try of the Prem season in Exeter’s victory against Gloucester on Saturday and leads the ­try-scoring charts, with Sale’s Tom Roebuck on five and Henry Arundell of Bath on four.Feyi-Waboso’s Exeter ­colleague Henry Slade, meanwhile, has scored a league-leading 70 points in five Prem rounds, roaring back into top form at 32. Slade has started the past two matches in the centres alongside Exeter’s new signing Len Ikitau of Australia, and they may now face each other at Twickenham on Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fin Smith, who ­stylishly pulled the strings for Northampton on ­Friday, was on Lions duty in ­Australia and the stock of the 32-year-old Ford rose in his absence.Tom Willis of Saracens is left out, as expected, after announcing his decision to return to France having established himself as Borthwick’s first-choice No 8. The 20-year-old Henry Pollock, another player who starred for Northampton on Friday, will be an option for the No 8 jersey ­leading into the World Cup.Australia defeated Japan 19-15in Tokyo on Saturday to begin their autumn schedule but after the ­forwards Lukhan Salakaia-Loto and Josh Canham were injured, Joe Schmidt said he may be forced to call up reinforcements, with the second row being an area of concern. “With England’s strong pack, it just means that we are light in the second row, and we may need to get some reserves dug out from ­Australia,” the head coach said. “That’s probably our first thought.”Australia’s visit to Twickenham on Saturday is followed by fixtures for England against Fiji a week later, New Zealand on 15 November, and Argentina on 23 November.View image in fullscreenGeorge Ford has staked a claim for the fly-half shirt.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAExplore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionSaracensnewsShareReuse this content"

Hall finished with 18 carries for 133 yards. The Jets (1-7), who trailed 31-16 after three quarters, rolled to 502 yards of offense in their highest scoring game of the season, including a season-high 254 on the ground. Joe Flacco passed for two touchdowns and rushed for a one-yard score, but the Bengals (3-5) lost for the fifth time in six games. Ja’Marr Chase had 12 catches for 91 yards in his third consecutive game with double-digit receptions.New York Giants 20–38 Philadelphia EaglesSaquon Barkley ran for a 65-yard score on his first carry of the game and topped 100 yards rushing for the first time this season in the Philadelphia Eagles’ victory over theNew York Giants(2-6). Barkley finished with 150 yards rushing and caught one of Jalen Hurts’ four touchdown passes before he left the game with a groin injury. The Eagles (6-2) evened the season series against their division rivals. The Giants’ run at their first season sweep of the Eagles since 2007 and first win at Philadelphia since 2013 suffered a serious blow when rookie Cam Skattebo suffered a dislocated ankle and was taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Skattebo was carted off the field after he took a hard hit over the middle and went down. His foot appeared to twist backward, and players from both teams huddled around the standout running back until he was taken off the field.Dallas Cowboys 24–44 Denver BroncosBo Nix threw for four touchdowns, rookie RJ Harvey scored three times and the Denver Broncos routed the Dallas Cowboys. The Broncos (6-2) have won five straight overall and nine in a row at home. That’s the longest home winning streak in theNFL. JK Dobbins ran for 111 yards on 15 carries and the Broncos also got big performances from rookies Pat Bryant and Jahdae Barron. Bryant scored his first touchdown and Barron picked off Dak Prescott for his first career interception. The Cowboys (3-4-1) got two touchdown runs from former Broncos running back Javonte Williams.Chicago Bears 16–30 Baltimore RavensDerrick Henry ran for two touchdowns, Tyler Huntley made a big third-down throw late in the fourth quarter and the Baltimore Ravens finally won without Lamar Jackson. The Ravens snapped a four-game skid and ended Chicago’s four-game winning streak. The Bears (4-3) dominated the first quarter but managed only two field goals in that period and didn’t score again until the fourth. Although Jackson returned to practice this week, he was ruled out Saturday for a third straight game because of a hamstring injury. The Ravens (2-5) had lost 11 of their previous 13 when their star quarterback didn’t play.Buffalo Bills 40–9 Carolina PanthersEverybody hates Russ: how the NFL’s nicest guy became its most resented | Andrew LawrenceRead moreJames Cook ran for a career-high 216 yards and two touchdowns, Josh Allen accounted for three touchdowns and the Buffalo Bills (5-2) returned from their bye with a resounding win over the Carolina Panthers (4-4). Allen improved to 8-0 following the bye week and established an NFL record by becoming the first player to run and throw for a touchdown in 46 games, breaking the mark previously held by former Panthers QB Cam Newton. Allen’s 77 career rushing touchdowns (including playoff games) tied Newton for the most all-time. Cook had touchdown runs of 64 and 21 yards.Cleveland Browns 13–32 New England PatriotsDrake Maye passed for three touchdowns as the New England Patriots extended their winning streak to five games by beating the Cleveland Browns.Maye completed 18 of his 24 pass attempts for 282 yards. He was intercepted once. Each of his three TD passes came in the third quarter. The Patriots (6-2) were helped by three field goals from Andy Borregales. Cleveland (2-6) defensive end Myles Garrett recorded a franchise-record five sacks in the loss. Garrett passed Reggie White and set the NFL record for career sacks by a player under the age of 30 with his first sack in the game. Garrett has 10 sacks this season and 112.5 for his career. Cleveland’s Dillon Gabriel was 21 of 35 for 156 yards. He threw two touchdowns and was intercepted twice.Tennessee Titans 14–38 Indianapolis ColtsJonathan Taylor rushed for two touchdowns and caught another in a milestone game, and Daniel Jones threw for two more scores to help the Indianapolis Colts (7-1) continue their surprising start with a rout over Tennessee (1-7). Taylor also scored three TDs against the Titans in each of their previous two meetings, making him the first player in league history to have three touchdowns in three consecutive games against the same team. He finished with 12 carries for 153 yards, the fourth 100-yard game this season for the league’s rushing leader.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23–3 New Orleans SaintsTampa Bay edge rusher Anthony Nelson had an interception for a touchdown to go with a forced fumble and two sacks, Sean Tucker ran for a one-yard touchdown on fourth down and the Buccaneers (6-2) beat the hapless New Orleans Saints. Antoine Winfield Jr recovered a fumble and intercepted a pass for the Buccaneers, who forced four turnovers and also played a role in forcing Saints second-year quarterback Spencer Rattler out of the game. First-year Saints coach Kellen Moore inserted rookie QB Tyler Shough late in the third quarter. But the switch did little to improve matters for New Orleans, now tied for the worst record in the NFL with the New York Jets and Tennessee at 1-7.Miami Dolphins 34–10 Atlanta FalconsTua Tagovailoa threw a season-high four touchdown passes and the Miami Dolphins ended their three-game losing streak by dominating the short-handed Atlanta Falcons. The Dolphins (2-6) held the Falcons (3-4) to 213 yards. Tagovailoa completed 20 of 26 passes for 205 yards with scoring passes to De’Von Achane, Malik Washington, Jaylen Waddle and Ollie Gordon II. The Falcons were without quarterback Michael Penix Jr, top wide receiver Drake London and sacks leader Zach Harrison, among others, due to injuries. Atlanta veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins made his first start of the season. Bijan Robinson was held to 25 rushing yards.San Francisco 49ers 15–26 Houston TexansCJ Stroud threw for a season-high 318 yards with two touchdowns and the Houston Texans got off to a quick start and held on for victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Stroud completed passes to nine different players with star receiver Nico Collins out after sustaining a concussion Monday night. Xavier Hutchinson led the group with 69 yards receiving and a score to help the 3-4 Texans bounce back after a loss to Seattle. Mac Jones had trouble getting San Francisco’s offense going. He threw for 193 yards and two touchdowns in his fourth straight game and sixth this season filling in for the injured Brock Purdy. The Niners fell to 5-3.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsNew York GiantsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not for an England try, but for a paper aeroplane crafted by a home supporter that had successfully made its way from the top of one tier on to the pitch. It was about the only thing that went right for those of an English persuasion.London mauling: Kangaroos return to rule roost with harsh lesson for England | John DavidsonRead moreThe beauty of a three-Test series is that no matter what happens in the first match there is an opportunity to bounce back. But, conversely, England are already in must-win territory after their 26-6 defeat and the odds feel worryingly stacked against them going into next weekend’s second Test at Everton’s new ground. There was no shortage of effort from England and the promise that they would be motivated going into a first Ashes series in 22 years could not be questioned. But there was a critical lack of quality at any stage of the contest, which means Shaun Wane, the head coach, is surely goingto have to make changesto try to keep the series alive.“We felt like we were off the mark, so there’s a lot to work on,” the England prop Mike McMeeken said. “We were going toe-to-toe with them early on but they’re pretty clinical. Any opportunity they get, they seem to take it.”Jack Welsby’s longstanding position as England full-back feels under threat. He has had a difficult season for St Helens but had credit in the bank with Wane, so much so that he was a guaranteed starter at Wembley.But England have brought the former Queensland star AJ Brimson – who was 18th man on Saturday – halfway around the world after he switched his allegiance from Australia. To omit him again next weekend would be a grave error after Welsby underwhelmed in this Test.There will surely have to be tweaks elsewhere too, given the worrying lack of enforcement or aggression from England’s middles, of the kind we have been used to in recent years from players such as Sam Burgess and James Graham. What Wane would give for either of those two in his side next weekend. Canberra’s Morgan Smithies is the closest candidate to come in.What will also serve as a great disappointment for Wane and his men is that the biggest crowd for an Ashes Test in the United Kingdom were given little to cheer.Wembley was incredibly flat, with England struggling to deliver on the big occasion. “We’re disappointed with the result and the scoreline on a day like this,” McMeeken said. “Sixty thousand here, a pretty big crowd, and we feel like we haven’t lived up to the potential and the occasion.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But this isn’t done. It’s game one and, while we weren’t up to the standard required, we’ll go again.”England will have to go again, and they will have to up their levels significantly in the next Test. Saturday was perceived to be the hosts’ best shot of victory with the feeling that they could catch the Australians cold in the opening match. Ominously, the Kangaroos have had their loosener now and there is little doubt they will be even better at Hill Dickinson Stadium. The harsh reality is that the tourists never really got out of second gear on Saturday.Throw in the prospect of a referee from Australia’s National Rugby League taking charge – meaning faster rucks, something the tourists are used to – and it all points to a tall order for England in the second Test. Wane has to respond and he has to make some difficult decisions.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby league teamAustralia rugby leagueRugby leagueAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Three headed goals condemned Everton to a first defeat at their new home and elevated Spurs to third in thePremier League. A ­correction of their home form and Frank’s team can contemplate ­staying up there.The disconnect at Tottenham ­Hotspur ­Stadium stands in stark contrast to the ruthless efficiency and resilience of Spurs away from home. Victory on the banks of the River ­Mersey made it 13 points from a possible 15 on the road. The outstanding Micky van de Ven led the way.Captain in the absence of Cristian Romero, the Spurs defender made it five goals in 13 appearances this season by converting two first-half corners. The substitute Pape Matar Sarr banished any prospect of anEvertonrecovery with another close-range header in the 89th minute. Given the glaring absence of a quality striker in David Moyes’s squad, the prospect of an Everton comeback always appeared remote despite the intelligent probings of Iliman Ndiaye, James Garner, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish.View image in fullscreenPape Matar Sarr heads home Tottenham’s third goal from close range.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“Going here to Everton, a very good team and unbeaten here so far, and winning 3-0 away is a very good result,” said Frank. “I’m very happy with the set pieces and the clean-sheet mentality is a good foundation. We need to do more but it is an inexperienced Champions League squad so to go every three or four days and keep the energy and focus showed a lot about the mentality.”The contest was shaped by corners and Van de Ven’s domineering presence at both ends of the pitch. Everton matched Spurs for enterprising approach work but had no answer to the quality of the visitors’ set-piece delivery or their captain’s aerial strength. The boos that greeted the half-time whistle were aimed squarely at the referee, Craig ­Pawson, however.Everton v Tottenham: Premier League – live updatesRead moreGrealish almost started where he left off last time out at Hill Dickinson Stadium by putting Everton ahead. The impressive Ndiaye scorched past Djed Spence to set up Beto but, after the hapless centre-forward failed to connect, Grealish arrived at the back post and saw a goal-bound drive blocked in front of the line by Pedro Porro.Rodrigo Bentancur and Xavi Simons both troubled the Everton defence as an open, flowing game allowed the respective midfields to impress. But it was a central defender who took centre stage. From a Mohammed Kudus corner swept high to the back post, ­Bentancur directed the ball back across goal with his shoulder for Van de Ven to nod in from a yard out.It was the first goal Everton have conceded from a set piece all season. A second followed in first-half stoppage time when the visitors’ accuracy punished Moyes’s team again. Porro was the provider, this time from the left with a brilliant, vicious corner that demanded a finish. Van de Ven applied it once the inswinging ­delivery sailed over James Tarkowski and before Jordan Pickford’s fists could connect.The defender’s two first-half headers must have come from a combined distance of two yards out. “I told him at the start of the season he should be scoring more goals with his head,” said Frank of Van de Ven, who did not score once for Spurs last season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Everton defender thought he had equalised from a Dewsbury-Hall corner, and a header that gave Guglielmo Vicario no chance in the Spurs’ goal. Everton celebrations were diluted when the video assistant referee sent Pawson to the pitch-side monitor. They were spoiled completely when the match official deemed that Ndiaye and ­Grealish were both offside and interfering with Vicario. The pair were clearly in offside positions when O’Brien connected but the extent to which they interfered with the goalkeeper was debatable. Pawson’s on-field explanation was inaudible amid the jeers.Moyes had no complaints. “I think the goal we got chalked off for offside was the correct decision,” said the Everton manager. “We have been undone by set pieces. I’m not happy about it but overall there were some positives to the performance.”Everton responded well to the blows, particularly after the restart when Vicario’s superb reflexes were required to preserve a clean sheet from a Beto overhead kick. But the hosts were exposed late on when the former Everton striker Richarlison cushioned a header from Porro’s delivery back across goal for Sarr to convert beyond Pickford.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the western part, Hamas is seeking to reassert its control in the vacuum left by the partial Israeli withdrawal, carrying out public executions of rival militia or gang members it claims are backed by Israel.In the other half of Gaza, covering the eastern strip as well as the northern and southern borders, the IDF has been reinforcing scores of military outposts and firing at anyone approaching the line, whether it has been marked with yellow blocks or not.“In our area, the yellow lines aren’t clearly visible. We don’t know where they start or end. I think they’re clearer in other places, but here, nothing is defined,” Mohammad Khaled Abu al-Hussain, a 31-year-old father of five, said. His family’s house is in al-Qarara, north of Khan Younis and just east of the yellow line, in the IDF-controlled zone.View image in fullscreenMohammad Abu al-Hussain: ‘What’s the point of a ceasefire if I still can’t return home?’Photograph: Amjad Tantesh/The Guardian“As soon as we get close to our homes, bullets start flying from every direction, and sometimes small drones, the quadcopters, hover above us, watching every move,” he said. “Yesterday, I was with my friend when we suddenly came under heavy gunfire. We threw ourselves to the ground and stayed there until the shooting stopped. I couldn’t reach my house.“It feels like the war hasn’t really ended for me. What’s the point of a ceasefire if I still can’t return home?”He added: “It breaks my heart to see people on my way going back to their houses while I remain stuck between hope and fear. But what worries me most is the idea that this line might stay, that no decision will ever allow us to return.”Israel insisted on Sunday that it would maintain control of security in Gaza. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told ministers it would decide for itself where and when to strike its foes and which countries would be allowed to send troops to police the truce.“Israel is an independent state. We will defend ourselves by our own means and we will continue to determine our fate,” he said. “We do not seek anyone’s approval for this. We control our security.”The free-fire policy along the line – ordered by the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz – follows an attack on Sunday 19 October in the southern city of Rafah in which two Israeli soldiers were killed.Turkey likely to be excluded from Gaza stabilisation force after Israeli objectionRead moremap of yellow line in GazaTwo weeks into the ceasefire, more than 20 Palestinians are still being killed on average each day, many of them close to the yellow line. Consequently, very few of the displaced are returning to the area under Israeli control.The political hurdles remain immense to moving to a second phase of the ceasefire, which would involve Hamas being disarmed and replaced by an multinational stabilisation force, and an IDF withdrawal from the yellow line to positions closer to the Gaza border. The right wing of the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition is fiercely opposed to further withdrawal, and the internationalisation of control over Gaza.In the impasse, the yellow line continues to take on a more permanent form, and is increasingly referred to in Israeli media as a “new border”.Writing in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, the military correspondent Yoav Zitun predicted the yellow line could evolve into “a high and sophisticated barrier that will shrink the Gaza Strip, enlarge the western Negev and allow for Israeli settlements to be built there”.“It looks like a de facto creeping annexation of Gaza,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of the Refugees International advocacy group and a former US aid official.View image in fullscreenA screen grab from a handout video shows an Israeli vehicle moving yellow blocks to mark the yellow line dividing Gaza.Photograph: Israeli Ministry Of Defence/ReutersUnder the terms of the US-brokered ceasefire, which came into effect on 10 October, the IDF withdrawal to the yellow line would leave it occupying 53% of the Gaza Strip, but aBBC satellite analysisof the new yellow markers suggested they had been placed several hundred metres beyond the proposed line, representing a further substantial land grab.An IDF spokesperson said there was no official comment on the BBC report. An earlier IDF statement said only that work had started on marking the yellow line with a “concrete barrier with a pole painted yellow, standing 3.5 meters high”, intended “to establish tactical clarity on the ground”.What is becoming clear is an ever-sharper partition of Gaza, with most of the surviving 2.1 million population crammed into half the territory, amid the ruins left by two years of Israeli bombardment.“The yellow line, as far as we have been told, lies about 1km past Salah al-Din Street,” said Ayman Abu Mandeel, referring to the main thoroughfare running from south to north through the middle of the Gaza Strip.Abu Mandeel is 58 years old, with nine children. The remains of his house are in eastern al-Qarara, but he has little hope of returning there any time soon. “The Israeli army has set up cranes, watchtowers and tanks there. They monitor every movement and open fire on anyone who gets close.”“We haven’t seen the yellow markings ourselves, because anyone who tries to reach those areas is immediately targeted,” he said. “The quadcopters don’t hesitate to shoot at anyone who moves toward them, as if getting close to our own land has become a crime.”View image in fullscreenAbu Mandeel: ‘The Israeli army monitors every movement and opens fire on anyone who gets close.’Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianAt the root of the continuing division and violence is the vagueness of the truce. The “Trump peace plan” wasa list of 20 principles and aims, but with no sequence or sense of how one goal might follow another.“It is incredibly vague,” said Rohan Talbot, the director of advocacy and communications for the charity group Medical Aid for Palestinians. “Now we are in a moment when many different actors, obviously including the Israeli government, the Americans, the international community and humanitarian actors, are all vying to interpret and influence what comes next.“One of the guiding principles that we should appreciate from decades of grim experience is that anything temporary in occupied Palestinian territory very quickly becomes permanent.”Palestine rights group seeks prosecution of UK citizens who fought for IsraelRead moreThe status quo meanwhile leaves at least half of Gaza’s population unable to return home or even think about rebuilding. The hopes aroused by the ceasefireare fading fast.“Each time we try to get closer to home, we see new destruction, new bombardment, and new advances by military vehicles. The shelling from artillery, tanks, and drones hasn’t stopped, as if the war never ended,” said Salah Abu Salah, from Abasan al-Kabira in east Khan Younis, which is now on the “wrong” side of the yellow line.“I can’t help but fear that the army now intends to establish new borders that we will never be allowed to cross again.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Texas – the only state with more commercial holders – has a rate almost 50% higher than California. Facts don’t lie.

ATrump administrationofficial added in a separate statement that Hamdi is facing deportation.“Our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice,” Cair’s statement said. The statement also called on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “to immediately account for and release Mr Hamdi”, saying his only “‘crime’ is criticizing a foreign government” that Cair accused of having “committed genocide”.The press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, wrote of Hamdi in a social mediapost: “This individual’s visa was revoked, and he is in ICE custody pending removal”.McLaughlin’s post also said: “Those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”During his tour, Hamdi spoke on Saturday at the annual gala for Cair’s chapter in Sacramento.

The government hopes a deal with the GCC could add £1.6bn to the UK economy each year and contribute a further £600m to UK workers’ annual wages in the long term.Reeves said: “Our number one priority is growth, so I am taking Britain’s offer – of stability, regulatory agility and world-class expertise – directly to one of the world’s most important trade and investment hubs, making that case in our national interest.”She added that after deals were struck with the US, the EU and India, the government was determined to go “further and faster on partnerships that create good jobs, boost business and bring investment into communities across the UK”.However, such a deal is likely to come under fresh fire from campaigners who have previously said the UK should not secure an agreement without legal commitments on areas such as human rights improvements.The Trades Union Congress is among those who have urged caution over the deal and raised concerns with ministers. It has said: “Our view on trade deals is consistent: the government should not agree deals with countries that abuse human rights and workers’ rights, and violate international law.”Reeves is expected to finalise a series of investments between the UK and Saudi Arabia this week, as the government prepares for its second budget on 26 November. Pressure is rising on the chancellor to announce further tax rises to plug a gap in public finances thatcould be as high as £30bn.She will speak at the Fortune Global Forum in Riyadh inSaudi Arabiaon Monday, and at the Future Investment Initiative, nicknamed Davos in the Desert, on Tuesday, to try to convince global business leaders that the UK is a good destination for investment at a time of global uncertainty.The chancellor will be joined by the minister for investment, Jason Stockwood, as well as prominent British business leaders, including CS Venkatakrishnan, the chief executive of Barclays; Sir Jonathan Symonds, chair of GSK; Georges Elhedery, chief executive of HSBC, and Julia Hoggett, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange.Trade with the Gulf is worth about £59bn a year, according to government estimates, as the UK’s seventh-largest export market. The deal with the GCCis expected to increase trade by about 16%. Sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have been some of the biggest foreign investors in the UK, with the Saudi Public Investment Fund buying a 15% stake in Heathrow airport last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had been feared he would be reliant on a wheelchair for the rest of his life.But in a new upbeat progress report on his recovery, his family detailed how much the 12-year-old can now move unaided.They said: “Our little knight had long set himself the goal of being able to run, jump and swim again.“He can’t do it like other children his age, of course, but we can no longer describe what he does in any other way than by saying it’s running, jumping and swimming.“It’s different, only over a few metres or a very small height, but it’s an incredible achievement. We are happy that he has been able to reach this stage of progress before his next operation.”The procedure early next year will leave him immobilised for two months, the family said. Doctors have told him he should regain more movement after the treatment.“The surgeon is relying on all the progress he has made so far to reassure him of the future benefits and how much he will be able to do even better afterward,” the family said.They said their “preteen” son’s memory is still limited but improving as he gains “cognitive endurance”. This summer he enjoyed a holiday in the mountains with other children who did not speak French. “Our son was able to work on his English and play French teacher a little,” his parents said.They said a psychomotor therapist has worked with the boy to help him stop tensing up the left side of his body, which was causing him pain. They said the boy also needs 10 separate rehabilitation sessions each week.The family said they are trying to find a new school for their son that will allow him to do all the subjects in the curriculum and still have time for these therapy sessions.They added that this “means that we will have to move again soon so that our son maintains his chances of progress”.Afundraising pagecreated after the attack has so far raised more than £477,000.Explore more on these topicsTate ModernEnglandFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He has since been accused by the Russians of high treason.The Guardian has seen a document said to be the one provided by the Russian authorities to Pshenichnov’s lawyers, outlining the allegations against him.View image in fullscreenLeonid Pshenichnov ‘had the misfortune of living in Kerch, Crimea, when it was captured by Russian troops’, a colleague said.Photograph: NANCA translation of the document describes the scientist as a “citizen of the Russian Federation” who “defected to the enemy’s side” by assisting Ukraine’s delegation to the Antarctic conference, which has been organised by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart, Tasmania.It accuses Pshenichnov of using his research to undermine Russia’s fishing of krill in Antarctica by encouraging, via a Ukrainian proposal, the restriction of krill harvesting. Such proposals would harm the economic interests of Russia, the arrest document said.CCAMLR, an international commission with 27 members established by convention in 1982, is about to discuss whether to create a marine protected area (MPA) around the Antarctic Peninsula to protect krill, the small crustacean that is one of the bases of the food chain in the Southern Ocean.China and Russia, which have blocked the creation of MPAs in the region for decades,have been accusedby analysts and conservationists of working together to loosen restrictions on fishing for krill. This year, for the first time, the amount of krill fished in Antarctic waters reached what scientists believe is an unsustainable level.Australiahas said it is “gravely concerned”by Russia’s detention of the scientist, while the UK called Moscow to release “all arbitrarily detained civilians”.Fellow researchers said Pschenichnov was a scientist of “outstanding” calibre and a “very kind” person. His detention was “unspeakable”, they said, adding that as their colleague had health problems they were “all dreadfully worried”.On the opening day of the conference, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko,told delegates of his “profound shock”on learning of the “illegal incarceration” of the scientist and called for other parties of the commission – whose members include Australia, the United States, Japan, Russia and China – to condemn Moscow’s actions.“Is it acceptable for the CCAMLR community to stand by while a Ukrainian biologist, who has devoted his life to the study, conservation and rational use of Antarctic marine living resources, faces persecution and imprisonment by Russia?” he said.View image in fullscreenA scientific expedition’s catch of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba).

These are trumped-up charges, his detention is groundless.”The charges of high treason against Pschenichnov were directly related to his scientific contributions at CCAMLR, the ambassador said. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin,raised the maximum sentence for treasonfrom 20 years to life imprisonment in 2023.“He was forced to take up a Russian passport while staying with family in temporarily occupied Crimea and has been arbitrarily charged with ‘threatening the security of the Russian Federation’,” said Myroshnychenko.The ambassador said his deputy was collecting signatures from countries for a letter to Moscow demanding his release.Licence to krill: the destructive demand for a ‘better’ fish oilRead morePshenichnov lives inKerch, Crimea, with his wife and one of his two sons, according to a fellow scientist who called his detention “unspeakable”.Dr Evgeny A Pakhomov, a biological oceanographer at the University of British Columbia, Canada, who has published two scientific papers with Pshenichnov and has known him for 30 years, said: “He is a very kind person … he has kneecap problems and needs regular injections. We are all dreadfully worried.”Valerii Paramonov, an oceanographer, described Pschenichnov as an outstanding scientist whose contribution to CCAMLR was “difficult to overestimate”.Paramonov added: “His only problem was that he had the misfortune of living in Kerch, Crimea, when it was captured by Russian troops.”Dan Crockett, executive director of the conservation charity Blue Marine Foundation, said Pschenichnov had been imprisoned for “nothing more than providing scientific evidence about the impact of krill fishing on the Antarctic ecosystem”.He called on CCAMLR countries to put pressure on Russia for his release and to “honour his research” by restricting krill trawling.The Russian embassy was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsAntarcticaSeascape: the state of our oceansRussiaUkraineFishingFishing industryConservationFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he still listened to music every day as a form of escape.He described the jangle pop band Orange Juice as “absolutely fantastic” and said he had discovered their music after moving to Leeds for university, where he studied law in the 1980s.“The whole cultural experience going from rural village life to a really busy, diverse, fantastic, living city like Leeds. And with it came a whole new chapter of music,” he said. “I love the music [of Orange Juice], I love the lyrics, but also for me it’s this memory of going to Leeds.”A real party island: Keir Starmer’s desert discs have Stormzy and soulRead moreIn an interview recorded at Chequers last week, he also talked about his family’s love of northern soul music. “If you can imagine me, sleeves rolled up, chopping in the kitchen, happy, listening to northern soul and my daughter singing away at the top of her voice,” he said.Starmer shared personal details of his family life, including his mother’s struggle with Still’s disease, a rare auto-inflammatory disorder that led to her death weeks before he was first elected as an MP in 2015.“I later learned that my dad had organised a way to get her into her wheelchair, he’d adapted their car and he had arranged that they would be there when I was sworn in as a member of parliament. I didn’t know this and of course that couldn’t happen,” he said.His first song choice was music from Swan Lake, in tribute to his mother’s love of ballet.The prime minister became emotional as he discussed the death of his younger brother, Nick, aged 60 on Boxing Day last year. “It really hit me. That was really hard because I just wanted to grieve for my little brother. And music gave me a place to go to escape from all of that,” he said.When questioned about the decline of music on the school curriculum, he said: “I think we’ve let music, creatives and art slip too much. It is a concern that the numbers have gone down. I think to be fair we need to signal what an A-level in music might give to you.”He also said the government was determined to ease some of the problems created by Brexit that meant British musicians were finding it difficult to tour in Europe.“It’s had a huge inhibiting effect. And I genuinely don’t think anybody voted in that referendum, whether they voted to remain or to leave, to make it harder for musicians and artists to be able to perform in other countries,” he said.“I absolutely understand the urgency and the need for this, and I’m absolutely determined that we will do whatever we can to make it easier.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourNorthern soulnewsShareReuse this content"

This week, the Home Office announced they had adopted a series of his recommendations forreforming the underperforming Windrush compensation scheme.Foster is now calling for “proper stress testing” of any proposed changes to immigration policy to ensure there is “a clear understanding of the human impact”, suggesting legislation could be needed to ensure no future government rowed back on promises made after Windrush.In theWindrush scandal, Commonwealth Britons who had entered the country legally as British subjects were wrongly classed as illegal migrants years later.In parallels with the rhetoric of the 1970s, the UK’s migration debate reached another low point this week when Katie Lam, a Tory MP, saidlegal migrants should “go home”.Reform UK has said it would scrap indefinite leave to remain – the pathway to settlement for legal migrants. Meanwhile, the Labour government plans todouble the standard qualifying periodfor settlement.View image in fullscreenFoster’s parents moved to the UK from Jamaica in 1959.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianFoster did not refer to individual politicians, but said “rhetoric which is demeaning” needed to be challenged, as the UK’s “resilient” Black community heard echoes of the past.“People have been telling me how they are fearful, they feel fragile, that with the current debate, they feel less secure,” Foster said.He added: “I think people are also concerned that the hard-fought commitments around integration and identity in this country are going to get lost.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the kind of language I was hearing years ago.’ There’s a cold chill. I’ve heard people say to me: ‘are we going backwards, Clive?’”Foster said people he had met during his tour felt huge pride in being British, saying he was “humbled” to see Black “veterans coming out wearing their medals” in Wales.But he said theWindrush scandalwas “bigger than we first realised” and that more needed to be done to reach people from across the Commonwealth whose status had been denied, Foster said.“In going around the country, people have spoken to me about their fears about losing some hard-won commitments around this,” he added. “People have been talking to me about how we are securing progress beyond the lifetime of a government. So I will be working in my office and with ministers, to be looking at how we can achieve that through legislation.”This week, the Home Office announced survivors would get 75% of their compensation award in advance; would be compensated for lost contributions to a work or personal pension for the first time, and that applications would be prioritised for claimants 75 and over and people with serious health conditions, after recommendations from Foster. Earlier this year, Foster said people had told him they believed the“Home Office is waiting for us to die off”.“I think what people are most afraid of is the lack of justice or healing,” he added. “They want to see action now, justice now.”Foster said one “byproduct” of the Windrush scandal had been “more dialogue and knowledge” of the wartime and postwar Black British story. On Tuesday, Foster met campaigners after the Home Office moved portraits from Brixton’s “Windrush Untold Stories”exhibition to display in its buildings.“We don’t want to be defined by a scandal,” Foster added. “That’s why the gentleman comes out in his medals, proudly and says, ‘look, this is the contribution that I have made’.

However a Lib Dem source told the Guardian that the party was “exploring all options, including an opposition day debate, to ensure parliament can scrutinise this properly – from Prince Andrew’s residence at Royal Lodge to his dukedom”.They added: “The first thing we need is proper transparency and accountability – that’s why we’ve called for the crown estate and Prince Andrew to give evidence under oath in parliament.”While noting that the government controls the timing of such debates, the source said the Lib Dems hoped an eventual move by parliament would be “hand in hand with the palace” and in line with the king’s wishes.The comments signal that the Lib Dems want to frame any discussion of Andrew’s future as a matter of public accountability rather than of personal scandal, reflecting growing unease in Westminster about the lack of transparency around royal finances and grace-and-favour residences.Party figures have privately suggested the episode underlines the need for “modern standards of public scrutiny” to apply across all publicly funded estates, including those managed by the crown estate.Their intervention is likely to add to pressure on ministers and Buckingham Palace to clarify the duke’s future at Royal Lodge. Figures from other parties have noted that any Commons debate on the issue would be symbolically significant, breaking from decades of convention that MPs avoid direct criticism of the royal family.The ability of MPs to discuss matters relating to the royal family is constrained under the Commons’ procedures. The guide to the rules, known as Erskine May, states: “Unless the discussion is based upon a substantive motion, drawn in proper terms, reflections must not be cast in debate upon the conduct of the sovereign, the heir to the throne or other members of the royal family.”Andrew, 65,announced last weekhe would no longer use his titles and honours, after the continuing fallout over his links to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child sex offender.The terms of his residency atRoyal Lodgedominated headlines after it was reported he paid £1m to the crown estate for the lease in 2003, and paid the required £7.5m to refurbish the property, but has paid “one peppercorn (if demanded)” in rent a year since.Andrew’s announcement came days before the posthumous publication of the memoir of his sex assault accuser, Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April aged 41. The prince has always strenuously denied her allegations that he had sex with her on three occasions while she was trafficked by Epstein.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewLiberal DemocratsHouse of CommonsMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

This is not something that we would want to see prolonged by any measure in the budget.”Pressure is mounting on the chancellor to increase taxes in the budget on 26 November to help to plug ashortfall in public finances.Supermarkets have complained that they were hit hard at the last budget, when Reeves announced a £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions and a 6.7% rise in the “national living wage”. The changes came into effect this April.The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said it was concerned that big shops could face much higher business rate tax bills if they are included in the government’s new additional tax for properties with a rateable value of more than £500,000.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said exempting supermarkets from this surtax would help keep food inflation under control.“The chancellor has rightly made tackling inflation her top priority, and with food inflation stubbornly high, ensuring retail’s rates burden doesn’t rise further would be one of the simplest ways to help,” she said.“This would not cost the taxpayer a penny, with large office blocks and industrial plants, for whom business rates is a smaller proportion of their costs, paying a little more.”Official data shows that UK inflation was unchanged last month at 3.8%, with annual food price inflation easing from 5.1% in August to 4.5% in September. It was the first time this rate had slowed since March.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No community in Kingston is immune.”Authorities said a decision on whether to issue a mandatory evacuation order would be made later in the day.Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, said earlier: “I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously. Take all measures to protect yourself.”Melissa was centred about 120 miles (195km) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 280 miles south-southwest of Guantánamo,Cuba, on Sunday morning. It had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225km/h) and was moving west at 5mph, the US national hurricane centre said.It was expected to drop torrential rains of up to 760mm (30in) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola –Haitiand the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre. Some areas may see as much as 1,010mm of rain.The combination of rapid intensification and snail-paced advancement is a recipe for a catastrophic, record-breaking natural disaster, experts said. In its increasingly grim updates, the hurricane centre warned that extensive damage to infrastructure, power and communication outages and the isolation of communities in Jamaica were to be expected.MapSome residents in the small fishing village of Port Royal, one of Jamaica’s most exposed and vulnerable communities, refused to heed official advice to leave their homes and take cover in shelters.Residents such as Ann Marie Chamberlain, 51, decided to ride out the storm at home. She said villagers were confident they had done everything necessary to avert danger, adding: “Father God will protect us.”Chamberlain, who is self-employed, said: “We know danger and we know when we are in danger and right now we are not. All the boats have been pulled up, the roofs with zinc have been battened down … we are taking the necessary precautions.“The main reason we refuse to leave Port Royal is because of an experience 21 years ago. We went to the shelter, the first night was fine when it was just us, but then when other people started coming all hell broke loose. Females weren’t safe, and to top it off people stole our stuff. You would go to sleep and when you woke up your radio, money and other belongings [were] gone.”View image in fullscreenJamaica prepares for Hurricane Melissa, securing small fishing boats in Port Royal, Jamaica.Photograph: Gilbert Bellamy/ReutersDerrick Powell, 42, a marketing manager, echoed her sentiments. He said: “I have never been to a shelter but residents who have been say they will never go back.“Everybody is already preparing, we know what it is like. We have heard about Hurricane Charlie. I experienced Gilbert and all the other storms … We don’t have any gullies or river to burst its banks. If a little water come up it’s maybe a few but by the time the rain ends it disappears.”When Melissa leaves Jamaica it is expected to head towards Cuba by late Tuesday, where it could bring up to 300mm of rain, before moving towards the Bahamas late on Wednesday.The Cuban government on Saturday issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin.The erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and one person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.Jamie Rhome, the hurricane centre’s deputy director, said: “Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire.” He said the storm would continue to move slowly for up to four days.In Haiti there were reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the north-east.Ronald Délice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, said: “The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving.” Local authorities have organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.The storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million people. It also downed trees and traffic lights, set off a series of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by flood waters.The Bahamas department of meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the south-east and central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from 1 June to 30 November. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms.The Associated Press writer Evens Sanon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsHurricanesCaribbeanJamaicaHaitiCubanewsShareReuse this content"

The book, titled Retribution, cites Pence’s notes from the 6 January 2021 phone call with Trump, who was purportedly trying to shame his vice-president into refusing to certify Joe Biden’s victory weeks earlier in the White House.“If you do that, I made a big mistake five years ago,” Trump is said to have told Pence, who was his running mate when he won his first presidency in 2016. “You’ll go down as a wimp.”According to Retribution, before he ultimately fulfilled his duty of certifying Biden’s victory, Pence’s notes maintain that he told Trump both had taken “an oath to support + defend the constitution”.“It doesn’t take courage to break the law,” Pence’s notes portray him as saying to Trump. “It takes courage to uphold the law.”The notes cited in Retribution say Trump also reportedly told Pence, “You listen to the wrong people.”Pence has publicly said that he certified Biden’s victory, despite Trump’s wishes, because he knew he had no legal right to overturn Trump’s electoral defeat at the hands of Biden. That stand came as Trump and his allies brazenly pushed lies that electoral fraudsters had rigged the 2020 election in Biden’s favor, leading to his victory.A mob of Trump supporters eventually stormed the US Capitol, unsuccessfully demanding Pence’s hanging and delaying the joint congressional session certifying Biden’s victory by several hours.Federal authorities later charged Trump with working to forcibly reverse his defeat in the 2020 election ahead of the Capitol attack, though that prosecution was derailed when he won the 2024 presidential race. As Retribution pointed out, prosecutors considered Pence’s notes as key evidence of the hours before the attack.Prosecutors did convict or at least criminally charge more than 1,500 other people who were attributed roles in the January 6 attack, which a bipartisan US Senate committee linked to several deaths, including the suicides of law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol that day.Then in January, in one of Trump’s first acts back in the Oval Office after he defeated Kamala Harris – Biden’s vice-president – in the 2024 presidential election, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of all linked to the Capitol attack.JD Vancewas Trump’s running mate when the latter man won his second presidency and summarily ignited warnings about the US’s “trajectory” toward authoritarian rule, according to anassessmentfrom former intelligence and national security officials. Pence did not pursue public office during that election cycle.The Retribution excerpt arrived days afterSteve Bannon, who was chief White House strategist during Trump’s first presidency, said in an interview with the Economist that he predicted Trump would get “a third term” in 2028 despite being barred by the US constitution.“People ought to just get accommodated with that,” said Bannon, whotouteda “plan” purportedly to be laid out later that would circumvent the constitutional amendment limiting US presidents to two terms.Bannon’s comments echoed those of others aligned with Trump, along with the president himself, who has previously madethreatsabout their being “methods” – and possibly even unspecified “plans” – to keep him in office no matter the constitution.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMike PenceUS Capitol attackUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Can they maintain their hardcore ethos?Tom BreihanSun 26 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareOn a Wednesday evening in September, about 6,000 people cross footbridges to reach Brown’s Island, a bucolic park in the middle of the James River in Richmond, Virginia. They’re here to see Turnstile, the Baltimore band who came from the hardcore punk underground but whose reach expands far outside that world.Turnstile take the stage to a shimmering swell of keyboards – the intro from Never Enough, the title track from their new album. It’s a slow song by Turnstile standards, a tender confession of self-doubt that builds into a cathartic singalong. The moment that the song ends, Turnstile jump directly into TLC (Turnstile Love Connection), a frantic fist-pumper from 2021’s Glow On, and the crowd become a mass of flailing limbs. For the next hour-plus, bodies fly in all directions, as strangers scream lyrics into each other’s faces. Every new riff, every change in tempo, brings a fresh wave of sweaty euphoria.Turnstile gigs have been like this for years. In the early days, the band played dive bars and church halls, and the shows never took place entirely on stage. Frontman Brendan Yates would dive balletically into the crowd, and the stage would be a constant blur of people from the audience running up, grabbing the microphone to belt out a line or two and then leaping back off.View image in fullscreenStiling it out … Turnstile.Photograph: Trevor RobertsIn 2009, a teenage Yates dropped out of college to become the drummer for the mythically tough Baltimore hardcore band Trapped Under Ice. He formed Turnstile with close friends a year later, and the band had a tremendous underground buzz from the very beginning. By the time they released their full-length debut Nonstop Feeling in 2015, they were one of the biggest bands in hardcore. Where many of their peers went for heavy extremity, Turnstile’s dizzy hooks and colourful aesthetics set them apart. Before long, they started to attract fans far outside their subculture.When I saw my first Turnstile show at a Washington DC church hall in 2018, drummer Daniel Fang played in a hospital gown. He’d missed one Turnstile show because he’d injured himself while training for the tour. Fang tells the story as the band checks in on a Zoom call from a Mesa, Arizona hotel room a few weeks after the Richmond show. “The doctor was like: ‘You will have kidney failure if you go play the show. Don’t do that,’” Fang recalls. But he refused to miss the show, so he checked out of the hospital and drove himself. “I was delirious in pain, but then felt the kind of amplified beauty of it, too. It was so, so joyous.”The joy was what really struck me – not just the dedication it must have taken for Fang to check himself out of the hospital, but the rapture that Fang and his bandmates all clearly felt that night. It was one of the greatest performances I’ve ever witnessed. An image has lived in my head ever since: Yates jumping off the stage during the first song and seemingly hanging in the air for hours before completing a full flip and landing in the crowd. Gigs like that turned fans into evangelists, and the band’s momentum kept growing.Turnstile’s third album, 2021’s Glow On, was the breakout moment. For that album, the band worked with veteran pop producer Mike Elizondo and moved toward a sunnier sound, with shimmering hooks and percussive breakdowns, that was still rooted in hardcore catharsis. The record arrived just as Covid lockdowns ended, and its charged energy was infectious. Turnstile’s audience grew exponentially. They got Grammy nominations, toured arenas with Blink-182 and served as the sole rock band at rap festivals such as Rolling Loud in Miami.Earlier this year, just before the release of Never Enough, many thousands of people came to Turnstile’s free daytime show at Wyman Park Dell in their home town. Every moment was marked by friends and well-wishers rushing the stage, only to cartwheel or backflip right back off. These days, however, every Turnstile set can’t be like that. The crowds that come to see them are simply too big. They need to play venues with barriers between them and the fans, so they find ways to convey all that frenzied energy on their own. They always figure it out.Much of the magic of a hardcore show is in the lack of distinction between performers and crowd – the way the audience themselves become the show. When Turnstile play to thousands every night, they can’t recreate the feeling in the same way, but they find other ways to channel and direct that collective energy. “The biggest transition was learning how to make the show happen on the stage instead of us just being a part of the show,” says bassist Franz Lyons. “You start learning that you need to create the energy with all five of you, to just band together and display that right on the other side.”View image in fullscreenBassist Franz Lyons.Photograph: Trevor RobertsOnstage, the five members of Turnstile are always in motion: jumping, spinning, stomping, calling for the crowd to give them more. They sweat buckets, with dazed and victorious looks in their eyes. It’s exhausting just to watch, but when you’re near the front at a Turnstile show, you can’t really watch. You’re too busy careening around and crashing into people yourself.You don’t see a lot of upraised phones at Turnstile shows. People need to be alert. In the old days, someone could always jump offstage and land on your head. Even with the barriers preventing stagedives, a Turnstile gig is still a full-body immersion experience. But it’s welcoming, not forbidding. The giant screen at the back of the stage doesn’t often display what happens onstage. Instead, it shows the giddy, ecstatic faces of the people in the crowd: people of different backgrounds, races, ages and genders, all caught up in the moment.That utopian vision can’t always be maintained. Turnstile end the Richmond show with Birds, a community-minded rager from Never Enough: “Finally, I can see it! These birds not meant to fly alone!” During the breakdown, Yates demands: “Get up here!” People finally scramble over the barrier, joining the band on stage. But amid the rush of bodies, a sheriff’s deputy sprays one fan, a teenage boy, with a stream of pepper spray to the face in what appears to be a completely unwarranted display of force. Fumes from the spray visibly affect Lyons, who stops playing his bass and covers his face. Video of that moment goes viral. In the days that follow, Richmond’s sheriff claims that the incident is under internal investigation while refusing to answer reporters’ questions about it.View image in fullscreenSticky situation … drummer Daniel Fang.Photograph: Trevor RobertsYates still sounds upset when he reflects on the way the Richmond show ended. “A cowardly action from an officer coming in and spraying a 15-year-old kid and then walking away – I don’t think that’s an isolated event,” he says. “But at our shows, it was a new thing. It’s something that we strive to keep away.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Sometimes, it’s the nature of big events and people coming together.”At this point, every Turnstile show is a big event. Their North American tour is a labour of love. They have sought out venues without seats, sometimes developing whole new venues when those spaces don’t exist in those cities. “The Denver show was just a stage under a bridge, and it was the first time they’d done a show there,” says Yates. “In LA, we just built a stage in a big park.” The band carefully curated the tour lineup, which covers a wide spectrum. The glitchy pop experimenter Jane Remover and the swaggering Australian heavy hardcore band Speed are on board for the entire run, with groups such as Melbourne’s Amyl and the Sniffers and Philadelphia’s Mannequin Pussy jumping aboard at different points. In November, the band will take a version of the tour to the UK and Europe, with heart-on-sleeve London rockers High Vis and experimental California thrashers the Garden opening.View image in fullscreenString theory … guitarist Meg Mills.Photograph: Trevor RobertsYates says that Turnstile always seek out tourmates that share “a connected thread” with the band: “Sometimes, it’s sonic threads. Sometimes, it’s an ethos thread, or something that’s sonically exciting that pairs together and creates something that feels like it could be really interesting. It gives everyone an opportunity to come and bring different people out and experience new things – but not in a random way, in a very intentional way.”Turnstile: Never Enough review – flute solos and formidable tunes from hardcore punk’s great crossover bandRead moreThat intentionality extends to Turnstile’s music. It’s still rooted in that explosive catharsis of hardcore, but lots of other sounds shine through: dance music, synthpop, funk. Never Enough has flute from London jazz great Shabaka Hutchings, vocals from Paramore’s Hayley Williams and singer-songwriter Faye Webster, and production from Charli xcx collaborator AG Cook. One highlight is Look Out for Me, an expansive, seven-minute odyssey that veers from crisp, mosh-ready riffage into the homegrown house subgenre known as Baltimore club music. Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes contributed to the last two Turnstile albums. At the Richmond show, Hynes plays an opening set and gets a roar from the crowd when he joins Turnstile for Alien Love Call, his 2021 duet with Yates.Even as Turnstile venture further afield from the hardcore underground that birthed them, their live shows still stand as expressions of community. It’s not easy to maintain that feeling when you’re playing to thousands every night, but Turnstile remain rooted in the city and the scene where they started. Other than new guitarist Meg Mills, a veteran of UK punk bands like Big Cheese and Chubby and the Gang, all of them still live in Baltimore. Yates still plays drums for his old band Trapped Under Ice whenever he gets the chance, and Lyons often joins them on stage.View image in fullscreenFeeling blue … singer Brendan Yates.Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty ImagesLyons’ bandmates marvel that Lyons is “in the mix all the time”, that he’ll still have the energy to hit a local punk show right after returning from a tour. “These are the things that I actually love to do, just like everybody else [in the band] loves to do,” says Lyons. “The passion for that, it doesn’t stop at being in our band.”That passion extends outward. It’s infectious. “I’m continuously seeing them do new things that I’ve never seen,” says Trapped Under Ice and Angel Du$t frontman Justice Tripp, a big-brother figure to the members of Turnstile, calling in from his tour van. “I’ve seen every young band from Baltimore brainstorming what they can do to have an impact like that. It causes waves. It causes people to step outside what they know and redesign what it means to be an artist and contributing to our culture or your city.”Yates insists that Turnstile don’t have a gameplan: “We try to maintain a level of appreciation for the present. Focusing too far ahead doesn’t really do much for you.” It makes sense. Nobody could’ve plotted Turnstile’s rise from church halls to festival stages. It’s the kind of thing that can only happen through sweat, dedication and an absolute belief in what they’re doing.When Turnstile members talk about playing live, they sometimes speak in almost mystical terms. Lyons says: “It’s been years in the making – learning how to really work on that chemistry and togetherness, making the energy onstage so much that it can touch the people who are on the other side.”Turnstile tour the UK and Ireland from 1 to 5 November; tour startsDublin.

Later, when Rawlings straps on a harmonica, his musical partner quips: “That’s all you get by way of costume changes from us.” The “show” comes in the playing, the performance and 23 songs which cast a magical spell for (including interval and encores) just short of three hours.After playing on each other’s albums for years, last year’s stellarWoodlandalbum cemented the pair’s more recent emergence as a classic American acoustic singing duo. They complement each other perfectly. Stetson-topped Rawlings fingerpicks and grapples with his vintage guitar as if it is a wriggling animal, while Welch strums purposely in a flowing dress that could be straight from a spaghetti western. Rawlings’s voice is beautifully plaintive with shades of Cat Stevens while Welch’s stirring vocals evoke mountain ranges, open skies, railroads.Occasionally joined by upright bassist Paul Kowert (the stool is for him to rest his bow), the duo share lead and harmonies to deliver largely sad themes such as loss, the songs’ yearning power interspersed with jokey banter. When Rawlings is tuning up, Welch quips: “Oh, God. Do I have to tell a joke now?”View image in fullscreenEncore follows encore … David Rawlings and Gillian Welch with bassist Paul Kowert.Photograph: Mike AinscoeNumerous highlights include Rawlings’s aching Ruby, Welch’s wistful What We Had or the mesmeric, pointed The Way It Will Be, about the effects of war. The pair aren’t known for political statements, but a sudden segue into Woody Guthrie’s This Land Is Your Land feels pointed and is rapturously received.Encore follows encore — Elvis Presley Blues, Look at Miss Ohio – as neither crowd or artists want the show to end. With the house lights up, Rawlings asks for “one more diddy one”, which turns out to be a sublime rendition of Jefferson Airplane’s psychedelic-era anthem White Rabbit. An unforgettable evening from two artists in love with what they do and at the peak of their powers.At London Palladium, tonight and 27 October, and Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicAmericanaGillian WelchDavid RawlingsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I was two years old and have no conscious memory of life before that. I can remember walking around our little apartment in East Orange, New Jersey, singing those songs.The first album I boughtI grew up in a fundamentalist Christian conservative family. Remember Footloose? It was exactly like that. No dancing, no movies, no records. My aunt bought me Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants and I fell in love with Send One Your Love.The song I inexplicably know every lyric to[Sings]: “Of war and peace the truth just twists / Its curfew gull just glides / Upon four-legged forest clouds / The cowboy angel rides.” I learned Gates of Eden by Bob Dylan when I was really young. I was mesmerised by this voice of an Old Testament prophet who had reincarnated itself into modern times.The song I do at karaokeI’ve never been drawn to karaoke. I was talked into it in Japan, after copious amounts of whatever the hell was being drunk, and doing Tiptoe Through the Tulips by Tiny Tim. Japan is fascinating. You have a drink, the next thing there are 30 people dressed as bunnies or Godzilla doing a dance routine.The best song to have sex toGet It Up by the Time. You need some extra motivation when you pass 60.The best song to play at a partyI Love Onions by Susan Christie. I always say the best song to play is the one that gets people to leave.The song I secretly like, but tell everyone I hateAs a boy, there were certain things that it wasn’t smart to acknowledge you liked, such as Barbra Streisand. I’m a huge fan of the Carpenters, but I couldn’t admit it back then, else I’d have guys trying to beat the Carpenters out of me.The song that changed my lifeI remember being 10, in 1972, living in Daytona beach. My cousins lived two blocks down the road. One day my mother got a call: they had something to show me. I cycled over and they played me Superstition by Stevie Wonder. It was one of those moments when your world shifts.The song that makes me cryI’m a complainer more than a crier.I make other people cry!If I’m in the right spirit, I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry by Hank Williams, with the line: “And as I wonder where you are / I’m so lonesome, I could cry.” They used to call him the Hillbilly Shakespeare.The song I want played at my funeralAs a native-derived person, we don’t believe in death. Death is a western, fear-based concept. We believe that an eternal spirit is housed into a temporary vehicle, and when that vehicle no longer becomes tenable to inhabit, we just move on. If I had to play music, I’d insist on Beethoven’s Triple Concerto.Sananda Maitreya ison tourto 6 November.Explore more on these topicsSananda Maitreya (Terence Trent D'Arby)Honest playlistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And even if the reason for their disappearance is infinitely far removed from the things themselves – as far removed, say, as the crimes of the German Wehrmacht are from German coffee, which is always far too weak, served in those pear-shaped pots it always tried to trickle down until it was held in check by the drip catcher, a little roll of foam rubber on an elastic band decorated with a butterfly, a doll, or a pearl perched atop the lid of the pot, a little thing that protected white tablecloths in Germany from coffee stains until the mid-1970s – even then, no matter how far removed the thing itself might be from the custom, the invention, or the revolution that leads to its disappearance, that disappearance creates a bond that could not be tighter. For example, the Berlin painter Heinrich Zille once said that you could kill a person with an apartment just as easily as with an axe.So the little roll of foam rubber and its elastic bridle end up in the trash, which means that now Germans are rich enough to afford vacations in Italy again and to bring back espresso makers in their luggage when they return. Just as every thing, no matter how simple, contains within it all the knowledge of its time, just as everything you can’t touch is contained in a spool of darning thread, for example: in the same way, whenever a thing disappears from everyday life, much more has disappeared than the thing itself – the way of thinking that goes with it has disappeared, and the way of feeling, the sense of what’s appropriate and what’s not, what you can afford and what’s beyond your means. We don’t have darning thread any more! Really, why? People shouldn’t darn their tights, they should buy new ones!View image in fullscreenJenny Erpenbeck.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty ImagesThingsEach time I take a long trip, I lose at least one scarf or hat, sometimes even a pair of sunglasses or a watch. I’ve also lost a number of things when moving house: a piece of moulding from an old rustic wardrobe, a few blinds, and once I even lost the typewriter I used to write my first works. Although the hotel rooms I left were small, and the apartments I left were clearly empty, the things were still missing later; somehow, somewhere, they had disappeared in the no man’s land between departure and arrival, it happened so regularly that I began to expect it when packing my suitcase or my boxes, as if it were a sacrifice, a price I had to pay for the change in my circumstances, and in that respect, despite all the randomness, it was still appropriate. However, in the course of my everyday life, the number of things around me never decreased, but rather increased, the piles grew higher, the folders thicker, I could imagine that a fire would break out and I would tuck my diaries, letters, and photo albums under my arm and run out of the house, but fortunately no fire broke out.Recently, a Russian woman came to visit me. She moved to Germany a year ago with four children. A piano, how lovely! she says as she enters my apartment. Books, how lovely! A few steps further on, she points to a few of my son’s drawings hanging on the wall and says: Lovely! She adds: It’s lovely to have something like that. At first, I don’t understand what she means; after all, she has four children herself. Well, she says and smiles, you can’t take it all with you. Sure, sure, I say. So, she says, still smiling, we made a big bonfire, we all sat around it, then we took page after page in our hands, we looked at everything again and remembered who drew this or that, how old he or she was at the time, we enjoyed it together one last time, and then we burned it all. It was a lovely bonfire, we were singing. I don’t say anything now. You can’t take it all with you, she repeats and says with a smile: We left with four children and two large suitcases. That was all.A Better World“How often in grey hours, O glorious art, / When life ensnares me in its circle wild, / Hast thou enkindled love within my heart / And raptured me into a better world!” – these are the words to one of Schubert’s songs. But I have to: call the insurance company, go to the doctor, the car has a red emissions sticker, do you want digital cable?

Because what else can it mean when life’s wild circle is whirling around me with its two demented circular knitting needles, when it’s been whirling around me for some time now, when life’s wild circle has almost completely knitted me up, what else can it mean but that the moment of rapture has in fact long since arrived, that the rapture has long since been as deep inside me as possible.This is an extract from Things That Disappear: Reflections and Memories by Jenny Erpenbeck, translated by Kurt Beals, published by Granta on 6 November.Explore more on these topicsFictionShort storiesextractsShareReuse this content"

But while that idea lacks coherence, the sketches and medleys are buoyantly performedMark FisherSun 26 Oct 2025 10.31 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 10.32 EDTShareThe piano is full of feathers to keep the noise down.Irving Berlinliked to write at night and the feathers were his way to dampen the strings so as not to annoy the neighbours. It is also full of feathers, in Jane Livingstone’s play about the writing and impact ofWhite Christmas, to suggest an imminent snow fall – although, oddly, when the singalong finale comes, it is to a flurry of regular stage snow.Also odd is that a play about the world’s most famous Christmas song should be staged in October. No matter: April Chamberlain’s production has the feel of a show that will be revived in festive seasons to come.Is that a good thing? Well, it is an innocent enough excuse to run through the Berlin songbook, pluckily sung by Frances Thorburn and Ross Forbes-MacKenzie with some lovely harmonies by musical director Hilary Brooks. From the plangent When I Lost You to the polemical Supper Time, with detours to the patriotic God Bless America and the light-hearted Sisters, there is much here to enjoy.As a play, though, it is all over the place. First we get a false start in which Thorburn appears as Moneta, the Roman goddess of memory, introducing a theme about the past that is forgotten as quickly as her white robes. Then Forbes-MacKenzie enters through the auditorium, meek and apologetic with suit and briefcase, but takes an age to declare his purpose. Having arrived at New York’sTin Pan Alley, he eventually admits to being the human embodiment of White Christmas.View image in fullscreenJolly medley … Frances Thorburn and Ross Forbes-MacKenzie.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicIt is a novel idea, but inconsistently applied. Structured as a series of sketches, Livingstone’s play is sometimes the story of the song itself, with its “27 simple lines”, and sometimes the story of the composer, an impoverished immigrant who could play only the black notes on the keyboard.Coming across like an illustrated Wikipedia page, A Piano Full of Feathers is too piecemeal either to be dramatically coherent or to give its sentimental moments emotional weight. Frequently, the pretence of a story is abandoned altogether in favour of a jolly medley of songs which, along with the buoyant performances, are the production’s chief strength.At Perth theatre until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

God-fearing Alannah (Rachael Rooney, her angular movements like a frightened bird) is scrubbing the cooker with a toothbrush when her muddy-booted, foul-mouthed, IRA-recruited little sister Fianna (Meghan Tyler, also the play’s writer; wildness written all over them) bursts in through the window of their childhood home. This fearless revenge play has a taste for chaos, transforming a biting domestic drama into a surreal, gruesome horror.First performed at Edinburgh’s Traverse in 2019 and set over one stormy night in 1980s southArmagh, this new production is a revelatory character study of these two troubled sisters. Tensions start high and keep climbing. Gun-wielding Brits roam the streets outside, while inside, Alannah tiptoes under the rule of their abusive, now-paralysed father (Stephen Kennedy, with a slippery, sinister entrance, the fear of him built up before he even gets on stage).View image in fullscreenSinister … Meghan Tyler as Fianna and Rachael Rooney as Alannah, with Stephen Kennedy as Da.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAfter serving time for a crime both women feel guilty over, Fianna’s reappearance sets off a tornado of violence in Alannah’s small and pious life, in which she cleans every speck of dust and slurps alcohol like air. Under Mehmet Ergen’s direction, we recognise both sisters entirely; when Fianna tries to get Alannah to loosen up, the younger sibling is easy and free, the older tight-hipped, ever inward. Through piercing, bitterly comic conversation, they reveal the damage done to them by patriarchal, colonial powers – here, their father and the soldiers (James Pedley-Holden) are rolled into one monstrous enemy – and in the tipsy haze of hatred, agree to put things right.Tyler’s black comedy is unafraid to take wild, deadly leaps. The sisters drink the house dry, their father’s beastliness is fully realised, and Merve Yörük’s attentive design of a pristine kitchen-living room is quickly covered in a mess far harder to clean up than Fianna’s dirty boot prints. Though some of the carefully won clarity and tension slips as the hallucinatory final scenes flirt with the ridiculous, the merciless guts, macabre humour and justice-driven bloodlust create a vice-like hold on our attention. Gloriously gory, Crocodile Fever offers the dark delight of watching these sisters tear their past limb from limb.At Arcola theatre, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The collection is described as having emerged from “journeys of great personal significance, and out of a migrant sensibility tied to three different countries”. The Canadian poet Solie shared the prize for Wellwater, a “self-interrogative conversation with a culture in crisis and a natural world on the brink”.Each poet received £5,000. The winners were announced at a ceremony at London’s Southbank Centre on Sunday evening.One judge, Lisa Kelly, said the winners “address the urgent challenges of our time” – climate crisis, war and migration – “with personal insight and philosophical depth”.The prize also recognised three other winners. Isabelle Baafi, a London-based poet of Jamaican and South African heritage, won the Jerwood prize for best first collection for Chaotic Good, described as “a feat of formal brilliance” that explores power and transformation through the story of escape from a toxic marriage.Abeer Ameer, a Cardiff-based poet of Iraqi heritage, won the Forward prize for best single poem in written form for At Least. The poem, responding to the violence of airstrikes on a block of flats, was praised for its “devastating” meditation on loss and for exposing the “duplicity of language” used to sanitise tragedy in media coverage of Gaza.The Manchester poet Griot Gabriel received the Forward prize for best single poem in the performance category for Where I’m From, a “love letter to Manchester” that celebrates and mourns his communities in Longsight and Ardwick.The judges this year – Sarah Hall, Lisa Kelly, Hannah Lavery, Sean O’Brien and Rommi Smith – praised the ambition of the shortlisted works. Lavery said the joint best-collection winners reflected “how many ways poetry can speak to us right now”, describing Avidyā as “dazzling and searching” and Wellwater as “rooted and elemental”.“It was buoying to read poetry from all corners of the globe and find within its diversity common ground – light, song, sincerity, humour, wisdom and courage,” said the chair of judges, the author Sarah Hall. “It’s more vital than ever to be culturally collegiate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I pretend I haven’t had water for several days in a desert. I’m parched. I need to drill down to my last drop of strength to arrive at the oasis. (OK, it’s an ego fantasy as well as one of survival.) I feel the relentless desert heat, but refuse to slow down. I push and push, and then – oh wow, that stream of cool, clean water flowing down my throat at the end is like a magical elixir.Diana Nyad,long-distance swimmer and motivational speakerTry atiny bit of tidyingWhen I feel weighed down by unanswered emails or tedious admin tasks, I turn to tidying a small space. It might be my bag or a corner of a drawer – just one manageable spot. Even this tiny act of tidying clears my head, lifts my energy and sparks the motivation to get moving again. Because tidying involves physical movement, I often use that momentum to tackle the very tasks I’ve been putting off.Marie Kondo, organising consultant and authorBeat the soundtrackWhen it comes to cleaning my home, racing to finish a task before a song or playlist comes to an end is helpful. I like to see what I can achieve toThe Saturdays’ Greatest Hits Megamix, which is around seven minutes long.

The easiest and most enjoyable way to keep death ever-present in the mind is to read the obituaries every morning. When I read about people who did something with their lives, it makes me want to do something with mine.Austin Kleon, author ofKeep Going: 10 Waysto Stay Creative in Good Times and BadAimlow(brow)I only allow myself to watch my favourite lowbrow TV shows while exercising. That means I end every workout wanting more and look forward to my time on the cross-trainer. This is how I’ve watched shows such as Bridgerton, Emily in Paris, Never Have I Ever, The Sex Lives of College Girls, Ted Lasso and more.KatyMilkman, author ofHow to Change: The Science of Gettingto Where You Want to BeUse your imaginationWhen I need to push through a workout, I’ve got a few motivators on rotation. I once read that exercise is like a shotgun blast of health for the body, so I imagine that. Other times it’s more personal: I move for my dad, who’s too sick to move himself, or I remind myself that after giving birth to two kids, this is a piece of cake. I also hear my old coach, Rob Shaul, in my head yelling “Suck it up!”, which never fails.Mintra Tilly,director ofsports at fitness company HyroxTake one small step …View image in fullscreenIronman triathlete Chrissie Wellington.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty ImagesIt might seem incongruous for an Ironman athlete to talk about making things as easy as possible, but hear me out. Don’t think about moving mountains, think about taking one small, easy step. If I can’t motivate myself to go for a run, I put my shoes on and open the door. Once I get there, I step out and run four or five steps. Once I have that momentum, I continue – and so does my motivation. I log my progress in a training diary, ensuring I bank feelings of euphoria to draw on in future, and can be buoyed up by memories of times when I completed sessions that I didn’t want to do.Chrissie Wellington,four-time IronmantriathlonworldchampionSay yesI say the word yes over and over again – in my mind or out loud. One syllable. It’s positive and it gets you into a motivated mindset.Emily Harrington, professional rock climberAsk yourself whySometimes when we lack motivation or procrastinate, there’s a reason. Often, it’s because there is some fear or reluctance to do something; maybe we think we won’t be able to manage or cope with it. Ask yourself exactly what you’re worried about. You can sometimes then see the fears are not real or at least not as large as you might believe. It may just be that you’re focusing on these feelings of not wanting to start, but turn it around and ask yourself how you’ll feel, or the repercussions, if you don’t begin that task. Often those feelings will be more scary or worrying. This helps me to start – because it’s the least worst option!Dr Radha Modgil, author ofKnow Your Own Power: Inspiration, Motivation and Practical Toolsfor LifeKeep a logI like to keep a tally of hours spent doing deep work each day – that’s time spent focusing on cognitively demanding tasks without opening emails or having meetings. When I find myself, in the moment, wanting to avoid hard work for busyness, I ask myself: how will you feel tonight when you put down a big zero for your daily deep work hours? That often helps.CalNewport, author ofDeep Work: Rules for Focused Successina Distracted Worldskip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I get through this by lying to myself about how many flights there are to go. I repeat “one, one, one” as I step, because if I count properly it seems to take for ever. So this is basically a strategy to stop me counting for real and then chickening out as it’s so many steps. I find this both makes it easier, stopping me thinking about how many stairs there are to go, and means reaching my floor is a pleasant surprise.Prof Sophie Scott,directorof theInstitute of Cognitive Neuroscience,University College LondonChoose a lucky charmView image in fullscreenPolar explorer Ann Daniels.Photograph: Martin HartleyMy mini motivator is Clive. He’s a pink-haired, inch-high troll that my niece gave me while I was doing IVF for my now grownup triplets. He was there for egg harvesting, reimplantation and birth. He symbolised support and care. I’ve since taken him on every expedition, and when it’s tough and I’ve used all my motivators (chanting my children’s names is favourite), I take comfort from his presence and keep going. He’s not just useful for expeditions. I regularly speak at corporate events and always have nerves beforehand. I never go on stage without him.Ann Daniels, polar explorerEngage your sensesI swear, if I get more than one of my senses actively involved, I can suddenly do tasks I couldn’t do mere moments ago. There is something about tuning into your senses that gives the mind a reset, an opportunity to get off the hamster wheel of dread and recalibrate into the current moment. This could be lighting a candle while playing moody music in order to focus on yoga lesson planning. It could be getting a drink and eating an apple before I settle in for Zoom calls. I’ve also been known to step outside to feel the Texas sun on my skin before slaying my chores. It’s really hard for me to put away laundry. I need the cross-sensory boost to gear my body and brain up for the tasks at hand, especially if they feel big that day.Adriene Mishler, host ofYogawith AdrieneFocus for 15To get through boring admin, I set a 15-minute timer on my phone. Here’s what happens in your brain when you do that: the open-ended anxiety of “this could take for ever” gets replaced with “I just need to focus for X minutes.” Fifteen minutes is the sweet spot for many people – long enough to make real progress, short enough to feel manageable even on difficult days or really tedious tasks. Usually, one of two things happens: the task doesn’t take anywhere near as long as you thought, or you get into the flow and it’s nowhere near as bad as you thought it would be. Before you know it, the task is done.Mia Northrop,co-founderof life coaching companyLife Admin Life HacksDitch your devicesWhenever I find my motivation dipping, I’ll go for a device-free walk around the block. This may sound like procrastination, but it’s the opposite. A device-free walk always helps me reorient toward the task at hand. If I’m distracted, being device-free helps settle my mind. If I’m putting a task off, I can reflect on what’s making me not want to do it – and form a plan to combat that aversion.Chris Bailey, author ofHyperfocus:How to Work Less and Achieve MorePicturethe end resultBefore decluttering or organising a space, I visualise how the newly organised space will make me feel. Daunted at the thought of organising all those coats and shoes jumbled at the front door? Imagine the ease and calm of stepping into the right pair of shoes and taking your favourite jacket as you leave the house in the morning. About to dive into sorting out the toy mountain? Imagine a sitting room where you can do a quick tidy in five minutes because everything has a home.Mel Carruthers, owner of decluttering serviceMore OrganisedStart smallI remind myself not to wait for motivation as it rarely shows up. What matters is momentum, and momentum starts with something small: tidying one drawer, sending one email. That first step creates energy, and results follow with consistency. The truth is, most people give up because the vision in their head doesn’t appear instantly, but real change is a process.Craig Hoareau, owner of house organisation companyA Tidy Mind LondonExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingTime managementMarie KondoFitnessWork & careersYogafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’ve always thought a french press was a euphemism for a passionate snog outside a boulangerie, then you’ll be disappointed to hear that this article is purely about coffee brewers. Cafetières, to be specific. Or, to give the French invention its full name, the cafetière à piston. You may know it as such – or as a french press; the brewing device, not the street rendezvous – but regardless, it’s a cheap, simple and brilliant way to brew coffee. Or tea, if you’re so inclined.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The cafetière is, deservedly, many people’s go-to brewer in the morning. You blearily grab it from the cupboard, heap in a few tablespoons of coffee – or lazily tip straight from the bag – and pour over some boiling water. A few minutes later, all that’s left is a final stir and a torturously slow plunge before the freshly brewed coffee pours into the cup.You can pick up a basic cafetière for about a tenner, but spending more can get you a prettier model – or open the door to insulated models that keep your coffee hot for a couple of hours. Pricier designs may now employ double filters, too, to keep the coffee free of murky residue.I’ve tested 10 of the best french presses over the past couple of months, and these are my favourites.At a glanceBest cafetière overall:Bodum Chambord£36.50 at AmazonBestbudget cafetière:John Lewis stainless steel cafetière£25 at John LewisBest affordable insulated cafetière:ProCook double-walled cafetière£24 at ProCookBest insulated cafetière for camping:Yeti Rambler french press£110 at AmazonBest cafetière for beautiful design:Bodum Columbia£79.95 at BodumBest cafetière for enthusiasts:Espro P7From £111 at EsproWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing coffee appliances and paraphernalia for years now, including everything from grinders to four-figureespresso machines. I drink a lot of coffee, too, with most days powered by thermal carafes full to the brim with filter coffee, the occasional guilty latte macchiato from the Nespresso machine and – during heatwaves – cold-brew experiments diluted by desperate handfuls of ice.How I testedView image in fullscreenThe James Hoffmann method was used to make a brew in each cafetière.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianIt’s controversial, but primarily I used the cafetières to brew coffee. I brewed coffee with every model here using freshly ground, medium-coarse coffee.In terms of brewing, I (mostly) followed former world barista champion James Hoffmann’s guidelines. Boiling water, four minutes of brewing, stir and wait another five minutes. Then depress the plunger so that it’s just beneath the top of the brewed coffee.Crucially, for the insulated models, I tested their heat retention, taking temperature readings in 20-minute intervals up to an hour and beyond. You’ll find the results quoted in the reviews and the specifications beneath each.The best cafetièresView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianBest cafetière overall:Bodum ChambordView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£49.90 at Bodum£36.50 at AmazonClose your eyes and picture a cafetière. You’ve probably just imagined the Bodum Chambord. A shiny metal frame and lid with a large, black handle and a plunger crowned by a black plastic ball.Why we love itThis is a design classic. You can take your pick of 0.35-, 0.5-, 1- and 1.5-litre sizes, and there’s an array of different colours and slight design variations. Our favourite is the old-school chrome, silver and black version.The metal frame and solid plastic handle feel sturdy, the glass carafe fits snugly in place, and the lid, filter and plunger all feel nice and solid. The lid and filter are modular, so you can unscrew the filter and separate the metal filter to clean out trapped coffee grounds.There’s nothing special going on here. It’s a design that works, and the parts are all a standard size, so you can replace the carafe and plunger if they crack or snap a few years down the line.It’s a shame that …if I have to quibble, then I could point to the fact that the all-metal filter is prone to letting coffee sludge through if you don’t pour carefully – or if you want every last drop from the carafe.It’s also expensive for what it is. If you’d prefer a cafetière that keeps coffee warm for longer, then you could buy something like ProCook’s model for similar money. If you simply adore the Chambord silhouette, wait patiently for a sale.Dimensions:23x 38 x 34cm (WDH)Weight:644gQuoted capacity:one litreTested brewing capacity:940mlDishwasher safe?Metal and glass components, yes; the rest, hand-wash onlyBest budget cafetière:John Lewis stainless steel cafetièreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£25 at John LewisYes, I know. A £25 cafetière hardly qualifies as cheap. But compared with the cheaper models here, John Lewis has put together a much sturdier-feeling cafetière with a classic profile. For the money, it’s good value.Why we love itLove is a strong word. Pleasingly inoffensive is closer to the mark. The design is nowhere near as pretty as the Bodum Chambord, but it feels solid and looks fine.The metal frame and plastic base add welcome protection to the glass carafe, and the plunger and lid are a standard size. It all comes to pieces for easy cleaning or replacement.And yes, it brews a decent coffee. The classic all-metal filter does a good job of keeping grounds out of the brew if you plunge carefully, and the metal frame uses circular cutouts to maintain rigidity. The cheaper models here use thinner metal with bigger gaps, and are far more flexible.The one-litre capacity isn’t overly optimistic either, so you’ll get about 950ml of coffee from a brew without risking grounds overflowing when you plunge.It’s a shame that …it’s just such a boring design. I feel like a basic cafetière such as this should be about £10 cheaper – and rather snobbishly, I’d be tempted to shop around for a discounted Bodum. If you’re looking for a basic cafetière that should last, though, it’s a safe pick.Dimensions:15 x 10 x 23cm (WDH)Weight:590gQuoted capacity:one litreTested brewing capacity:950mlDishwasher safe?Hand-wash onlyBest affordable insulated cafetière:ProCook satin double-walled cafetièreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£24 at ProCookProCook has made a name for itself with affordable, good-quality kitchen gear, and its cafetière is a basic insulated model that retails for a sensible RRP of £40. It’s a generic rebadged design that we’ve seen from various brands – George at Asda, John Lewis and VonShef – but it keeps coffee hot and is more robust than glass models.Why we love itYou can choose between a 350ml model and the one-litre model we have here. The modern, minimalist styling looks good, although hardly unique. Apart from the tiny ProCook engraving on the bottom, it’s vanishingly different from other rebranded versions on the market.The metal casting is quite rough and ready in some places, around the spout for instance, but it feels solid. This is a cafetière you can drop, bash and abuse for years without destroying it. The use of a standard-size modular plunger and lid means you can replace parts as and when required.Heat retention isn’t quite as good as the best here, but it’s far better than a glass alternative. After one hour, the temperature had dropped to 67C. After two, it was 54C.Coffee brewing is fine, but the use of a metal filter means you need to be a little careful not to pour too roughly, or you’ll get sludge in your cup.It’s a shame that …at this price, there’s not much to complain about. The use of a standard metal filter in tandem with a metal carafe means you may end up scratching the metal over time, though. This may require you to occasionally clean off any sticky coffee residue.It does brew slightly less than rivals, too. I suggest you’ll struggle to get more than 890ml out of the ProCook without spilling it during plunging. This is a minor quibble, however. For £40, or less while discounted, you’re getting a virtually unbreakable cafetière that keeps coffee hot for longer than a standard glass cafetière. If you can find a suspiciously similar-looking model with a different brand name, though, give it a go – it’s almost certainly identical.Dimensions:18 x 11 x 20cm (WDH)Weight:825gQuoted capacity:one litreTested brewing capacity:890mlTemperature after 60/120 minutes:67C/54CDishwasher safe?YesBest insulated cafetière for camping:Yeti Rambler french pressView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£110 at AmazonYeti’s family of reassuringly expensive outdoor gear includes the Rambler french press. It’s a familiar recipe: tough materials, eye-catching bright colours and good performance. And, naturally, a three-figure price.Why we love itThe build is spectacularly solid, and this is matched by superb thermal qualities. Yeti is the only brand here to use double-wall vacuum insulation, and this was clear in our testing. Even after an hour, the temperature was a piping-hot 71C, and it was the only cafetière to keep temperatures above 60C for two hours.You can choose between this one-litre and a1.9-litre (about £130) model, and take your pick from a range of colours including navy, pink, red and white, plus limited-edition colours such as black forest green and ultramarine violet.Yeti’s GroundsControl filter uses a rubber plate above the filter to attempt to stop the brewing process once you’ve plunged it. This works pretty well and combines with the rubber-sealed filter to keep coffee sludge to a bare minimum.Unfortunately, the pouring spout doesn’t self-seal, nor is there a closing mechanism, so it doesn’t stay warm for even longer. Campers should note that the lid catches rain and allows it to pour into your brew, and it’ll spill easily if you knock it over. You can spend another£13 on the Yeti MagSlider lidto add a seal, but at this price, it should come as standard.It’s also heavy. It’s one of the smallest one-litre cafetières here, and only brews about 850ml of coffee, but fill it to the brim and it weighs more than 2kg. If you’re weak of wrist, you may not appreciate this.It’s a shame that …the price is daunting, although the quality does go a long way towards justifying the expense.Dimensions:15 x 11 x 21cm (WDH)Weight:1.2kgQuoted capacity:one litreTested brewing capacity:850mlTemperature after 60/120 minutes:71C/62CDishwasher safe?YesBest cafetière for beautiful design:Bodum ColumbiaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£79.95 at BodumThis is by far the prettiest insulated design here.

There are 0.35-, 0.5-, 1- and 1.5-litre models, and each has the same design with a slightly taller and thinner, or squatter profile.The all-metal design feels sturdy and doesn’t have the uneven edges or cheap casting you’ll see on budget all-metal cafetières. It uses a dual-wall construction to help retain heat, and this works well. After an hour, temperatures dropped to 68C; after two, 54C.The metal lid and keyhole-shaped plunger handle are unique, but the filter is the same plastic-framed type as found on Bodum’s cheaper Java models. This isn’t a bad thing, though: it uses plastic rather than a metal seal around the edge to save scratching the metal interior, and this is noticeably better at preventing sludge from pouring into the cup.The plunger comes in three parts, so you can unscrew it and replace the filter, plunger or lid. It also uses a slightly more sturdy-looking metal screw connector, rather than plastic.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive. If you prize prettiness as highly as hot coffee, though, then you may not mind the expense – and what’s more, there are no glass carafes to break or replace. If you like the idea of stylishly serving after-dinner coffee to your favourite guests, then what better way to do it?Dimensions:20 x 13 x 21cm (WDH)Weight:937gQuoted capacity:one litreTested brewing capacity:930mlTemperature after 60/120 minutes:68C/54CDishwasher safe?YesBest cafetière for enthusiasts:Espro P7View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£111 at Espro£149 at Borough KitchenEspro makes lovely french presses with a twist: the brand uses dual filters to banish as much coffee gunge as possible. This model, the P7, is its premium insulated model.Why we love itThe dual filters clip together, providing one layer of fine mesh and a second layer of ultra-fine mesh. This is backed up by a twin silicone seal around the edges to obstruct sludge as much as possible. You even get paper filters in the box to provide further filtration.It works, too. Even without the paper filters, I measured less coffee residue after pouring every last drop out of the P7. It’s not perfect, though – some grounds get through if you pour out every last drop, as I did in my testing.The tall, 1.2kg design may be a bit much for weaker wrists, but it does feel super sturdy and heat retention is good – if no better than the cheaper insulated models here. Happily, though, capacity is ample. Espro claims a maximum of 946ml as it uses a US 32oz sizing, though the actual brew size is closer to a litre.It’s a shame that …the clever dual filter design ties you into Espro parts. The carafe and plunger are a non-standard width, so you’ll have to buy Espro replacements, which are available on thewebsite. And unlike other designs, the dual filter also locks some brewing water in with the grounds. This makes for messier cleaning.If you’re a coffee and tea fan who simply hates gunge in the cup, the Espro design is better than the others here. For less fussy, budget-conscious buyers, a cheaper cafetière is a better buy.Dimensions:16 x 11 x 26cm (WDH)Weight:1.2kgQuoted capacity:946mlTested brewing capacity:990mlTemperature after 60/120 minutes:67C/53CDishwasher safe?Yes (website clarifies as top-rack only)The best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianEspro P3View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£36 at EsproBest for:enthusiasts who hate sludgeThis is Espro’s entry-level cafetière, and it’s actually very good. The dual filters hold back more sludge than all the other brand’s cafetières, and that means you get a slightly cleaner cup. The more refined brewing does, however, come at a cost, in that the P3 feels plasticky and a bit cheap.Make no mistake, the dual filters work well. There’s far less coffee residue than you get with other standard filters, and you can get a little more coffee from each brew without having to pour really carefully. The issue is that many buyers probably don’t care.Indeed, this is quite a lot to spend on a predominantly plastic cafetière. The P3 very much feels like a cafetière that’s been built to a tight budget. It doesn’t look particularly attractive, and the plastics just feel a tad rattly and basic.It’s not badly made, but it’s more than 25cm tall – so may not fit into standard cupboards too easily – and the extra cleaning required for the dual filters may actually be more off-putting to less fastidious coffee drinkers. You’re also tied into using Espro parts as the carafe and plunger are non-standard sizes.If you’re a coffee enthusiast, however, the P3 is an affordable way to try Espro’s dual filters. It’s all a matter of perspective.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s too expensive for most people.Dimensions:15 x 11 x 25cm (WDH);weight:632g;quoted capacity:946ml;tested brewing capacity:1,100ml;dishwasher safe?Yes (website clarifies as top-rack only)Ikea 365+ coffee/tea makerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£15 at IkeaBest for:people who are walking around Ikea and need a cafetière right nowIkea’s cafetière looks good. The all-glass carafe is an interesting twist, and the combination of a brushed-metal lid and wooden plunger handle makes for something that looks a little more expensive than £15. You even get a little cork mat to put under the carafe. Cute.There are no complaints about the function here: this makes coffee. Nice coffee. The brewing capacity is on the low side, however. I fit a litre of water into it, but once I added coffee into the equation, I was able to brew about 850ml at a push.This is a cheaply made thing. The little wooden handle screws on top of the metal shaft, but it was wonky right out of the box. It also tries to unscrew itself every time you touch it. The plunger and lid all come to pieces so they’re easy to replace, but they feel light and cheap, too.The cork mat is another negative. Because it’s not attached, you’re very likely to lose it. And once you do, you’ve got to wonder how long the exposed glass bottom and glass handle will last under normal use. I’m clumsy, so I know this is a cafetière that would not last long in my home.It didn’t make the final cut because …I would spend a little more on the John Lewis cafetière instead.Dimensions:14 x 10 x 20cm (WDH);weight:466g;quoted capacity:one litre;tested brewing capacity:850ml;dishwasher safe?Metal and glass, yes; wood, hand-wash onlyHabitat eight-cup cafetièreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£12 at ArgosBest for:an ultra-cheap cafetièreThis Habitat cafetière is cheap and it brews coffee. It’s a standard-size carafe and plunger, too, so when bits break or wear out, you should be able to find suitable replacement parts easily – although this may end up costing more than the cafetiére itself.This is bargain basement stuff. The plastics are a bit wonky here and there – look closer, and you can see the moulding imperfections. While writing this review, I also noticed that the filter was slightly skewwhiff – this let a few coffee grounds escape into the brew. It may have been that way from new, but gently bending it back was a simple fix.That said, the filter’s thin metal frame won’t take too much encouragement to bend back again, so I’d be careful not to use too fine a grind, or you may need to press harder than the plunger can handle. I also broke the carafe while trying to clean it. The plastic shell was so tight that it cracked when I tried to slide it out. Nota bene.It didn’t make the final cut because …build quality is mediocre.Dimensions:13 x 10 x 21cm (WDH);weight:458g;quoted capacity:one litre;tested brewing capacity:940ml;dishwasher safe?Hand-wash onlyWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenCafetières’ filters vary in terms of how well they prevent fine coffee grounds from escaping.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianAre all cafetières the same?Broadly speaking, yes. Unless the manufacturer has done something really silly – such as use a filter that’s too narrow for the carafe and lets through loads of grounds – every cafetière here will brew a decent coffee. If your method is consistent and your coffee good and freshly ground, even a cheap one will make great coffee.Where they differ isvolume. You’ll note that some are described as having three- or eight-cup capacities, but don’t confuse this with an actual everyday cup: a cup in coffee parlance is a mere 125ml. A mug will hold double that, so if you want three or four mugs of coffee, you’ll need an eight-cup cafetière. If you like to have a couple of coffees, and there are three or more of you, then a larger cafetière is a better bet. Many of the models here are available in 12-cup sizes.Another noteworthy difference is thetype of filterthey use. If you hate sludgy residue at the bottom of your mug, this will be important for you. Fundamentally, there are typically three types of filter. The classic, all-metal mesh filters; plastic-bodied filters with metal mesh sieves and rubber seals; and Espro’s dual plastic-and-metal mesh filters with dual rubber seals.These filters all vary in terms of how well they prevent fine coffee grounds from escaping. The classic, all-metal filters are least effective, as they allow fine coffee sludge to seep through around the edges. The filters that use plastic seals are far better at preventing that sludge from ending up in the cup, and unsurprisingly, Espro’s dual filters and dual seals are yet more effective again.I tested the three filter types by brewing 500ml of coffee and then pouring out as much of the brewed coffee as possible through a paper filter. In terms of dry weight, the all-metal filter paper weighed 2.6g, the plastic filter 2.2g, and Espro’s dual filter weighed 1.8g. In truth, though, this is a worst-case scenario as I deliberately poured all of the coffee through. If you use a medium-coarse grind, pour carefully, and don’t bring the cafetière above the 90-degree mark, you can minimise the amount of sludge with any type of cafetière.How to use acafetièreThe key starting point for a successful brew is coarsely ground coffee. If you grind too fine, you’ll find that the plunger will be incredibly hard to press down, and you’ll be much more likely to, eventually, smash your glass carafe. It’ll also taste horribly bitter, as you’ll overextract the coffee.Ideally, the consistency you want is somewhere in the region of coarsely ground salt. If you have your own grinder, the best bet is to err on the side of too coarse. If the brew is a little too underextracted and sour, you can then dial your grinder finer until it starts to edge into bitterness. Somewhere in between both extremes lies perfection.If you’re usingsupermarket coffee, then steer well clear of finely ground espresso options – unless you enjoy sludgey brews. If you can afford it, buy some good-quality beans and grind them yourself. A hand grinder such as my go-to, theKinGrinder K6 (£99), is a good, long-lasting pick, but you can make do with any grinder that’ll grind medium-coarse and won’t produce lots of fine coffee dust in the process.Water is obviously another key ingredient to any brew – if you have a water filter, all the better. It’s perfectly acceptable to just filla kettlewith the amount of water you need, boil it and pour it on top of the grounds in the cafetière. While a few degrees can make all the difference with other brewing types, most of us don’t have a temperature-controlled kettle – and in any case, by the time your boiling water hits the room-temperature coffee and cafetière, it rapidly drops down to a perfect brewing temp. The only exception to this is with very dark roast coffees – if you’re finding them excessively bitter, try leaving the just-boiled kettle to cool for a little longer. This may help ease the bitterness.All things being equal, though, theJames Hoffmann methodis a reliable starting point. Use 60-70g of ground coffee per litre of water, and once you pour in the boiling water, stir once and wait for four minutes. Then stir the crust, scoop off any floating bits if you prefer and wait another five minutes or so. Then plunge slowly – and not all the way, as this agitates the coffee at the bottom. Just beneath the surface is fine. If you prefer to transfer the coffee into a thermal jug, then do so straight away and pour carefully. Then drink. Enjoy.

Quaint isn’t a word I use often, but nor do I eat at many places with a spacious upstairs bar area that doubles as a yoga studio. Go for the spice bag potatoes with tropea onions and roast chilli, stay for the 45-minute flow yoga with Amanda.Actually, scrap that: do not even dream of pulling shapes after eating too many spiced onions. Leave it a couple of hours. Still, whatever it is that chef Tobias Godfrey and his co-owner and partner, Laura Day, are offering, the locals are clearly loving it, because on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago, the place was orderly bedlam. Word has clearly spread that Fête was last month named runner-up restaurant of the year in Essex Life’s 2025food and drink awards, and ladies wearing Friday-night tops were dining in droves and ordering rounds of matcha margaritas and maple martinis.View image in fullscreenFête’s bowl of ‘balm-like’ burrata also features figs, hot honey, pistachios and beetroot.Fête’s road to taking the Chelmsford dining scene by storm has been largely ignored by nearby trendy London, which is a scene that celebrates only itself. Essex is only a few miles away, but the great and the good are scarred by too many stories of local restaurants boasting helium balloon arches, bottomless brunches, walls of plastic greenery andGemma from Towiedrinking Aperol spritz, not to mention too many old-fashioned, and definitely “old hat” country pubs serving venison on celeriac puree to lads with new hair from Turkey. The cool, metropolitan crowd avoid these places unless a London chef takes the helm.For what it’s worth, Iloveboth these aspects of Essex, which may explain why I was so pleasantly jollied by Fête’s eclectic menu, where Taiwanese chicken bao sits side by side with Kashmiri scallops, and where duck-fried rice with kimchi and mac and cheese with guanciale nestle cosily together on the small plates menu, all casual like, as if they aren’t from entirely different continents.Perhaps Fête, which is open all day, and serves this lengthier, more complex menu on Friday and Saturday evenings, has caused such a stir because it absolutely dares to be different, focusing on big, hearty, pan-global flavours, rather than any narrow theme. For so-called “small plates”, the portions are whopping, too, and we ordered far too much. Take the bowl of pale, wobbly, balm-like burrata laden with figs and hot honey, which also featured generous amounts of pistachio and layers of beetroot, and came with a slab of sourdough toast. Next up, a giant-sized beef tartare, made rather strangely with wholly unnecessary mayo, that had a great, acidic bite of capers and cornichons, and turned up on another big slice of bread. Godfrey clearly sets out to throw as much flavour on a plate as possible, so this tartare also came with crispy kale and wobbly egg yolk.View image in fullscreenFête’s ‘irresitible’ and ‘ridiculously generous’ portion of duck-fried rice.The idea of that duck-fried rice proved irresistible and was, again, ridiculously generous, and came topped with a fried egg, kimchi, XO sauce, chilli and kimchi furikake. One cannot doubt Godfrey’s devotion to taking his customers on a whistle-stop tour of the entire culinary cosmos, but hang on to your hats for the gear changes when your battered sausages with mustard are followed by a Taiwanese bao with a side of winter tomatoes in cashew cream. There’s something so endearingly adventurous and devil-may-care about this menu that makes me love the place.The front-of-house are jolly, friendly and, above all, clearly happy. The kitchen zings with an enthusiasm that speaks of a bunch of mates having the time of their lives, and who can’t quite believe that their dream of serving scallops in Kashmiri curry alongside a French-style vegan courgette cassoulet is actually paying dividends, and that they’ve become the hottest place for miles around as a result.Is the cooking perfect? No. By doing so much on every plate, there are flaws, and tweaks to be made, if you’re being picky. A piece of kingfish with burnt butter, preserved lemon and capers, for instance, was overcooked and the mega-chunk of beef tartare wasn’t hugely balanced. Yet I was still smiling by the time we were handed the dessert list and its banana parfait, sticky toffee pudding and house sorbet, before opting for the chocolate fondant with honeycomb and burnt butter ice-cream. Sure, by this point, we’d eaten far too much, but we still found room for this piece of hedonism.Fête is a welcome slice of unpretentious hospitality happiness. The only way isn’t Essex, but if it were, I wouldn’t complain.Fête10-13 Grays Brewery Yard, Chelmsford, Essex,hello@fetegraysyard.co.uk(no phone).

But, when made with care, the crunchy meat, tangy sauce and sweet fruit will remind you why you fell for it in the first place.Prep20 minMarinate30 min+Cook10 minServes2For the marinade200g pork loin or lean shoulder1 garlic clove1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp rice wine, or dry sherry½ tsp salt¼ tsp Chinese five-spice powder(optional)To cook1 onion, peeled1 green pepper, stalk, seeds and pith discarded1 mild red chilli1 egg60g cornflour, plus extra to coatNeutral oil, for frying100g pineapple chunksFor the sauce2 tbsp apricot jam– the lower in sugar, the better1 tbsp cranberry sauce– ditto1 good squeeze lemon or lime juice25-40g soft light brown sugar2½ tbsp Chinese red vinegar, or rice vinegar1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp cornflour, or potato starch1 Alternatives to porkView image in fullscreenI’ve chosen to make this with pork (spare ribs also work well, if you don’t mind a bone; if possible, get your butcher to chop them up), but chicken thigh or breast, chunks of firm white fish or firm tofu would also work well. Anything that can be battered and fried without giving off too much water is a safe bet.2 Marinate the meatView image in fullscreenCut the pork into strips about 1cm wide, then peel and crush the garlic. Put both in a bowl, toss with the soy, rice wine, salt and five-spice powder (if using), cover and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes (cover and put in the fridge if you’re leaving it to sit for longer).3 Mix the sauceView image in fullscreenWhile the pork sits, prepare the sauce by stirring the preserves, then add the citrus juice and sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then mix in the vinegar, soy and 90ml water. Season to taste, adding more sugar, if you like. Use another small bowl to stir the cornflour into a teaspoon of cold water.4 Chop the vegView image in fullscreenCut the onion and pepper into chunky diamonds, separating the onion layers as you go. Slice the chilli into rings. If you like, add other vegetables to the mix, too (Tenderstem or mangetout would be nice); just make sure they’re sliced thinly enough to stir-fry without overcooking the other ingredients.5 Prepare the batterView image in fullscreenBeat the egg in a bowl, gradually whisk this into 60g cornflour until you have a smooth batter, then season. Spread some more cornflour on a plate, then put both the bowl and plate near the hob. Add another tablespoon of cornflour to the marinated pork, and toss until the meat is coated.6 Heat the oilView image in fullscreenPour enough neutral oil into a large pan, wok or fryer to fill it by a third, then heat it up to 180C (digital thermometers are cheaper than oil and will ensure you get good results). Once the oil is nearly at temperature, dunk the pork in the batter, then shake off any excess and roll it in the plate of cornflour to coat.7 Fry the porkFry the pork in the hot oil for three minutes, until golden (it will be fried again later, so don’t go too dark at this point or you’ll overcook the meat), then lift out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Keep the oil warm on a low heat while you make the sauce.8 Cook the sauceView image in fullscreenHeat a tablespoon of neutral oil in a wok until smoking, then stir-fry the onion, pepper and chilli until softened. Tip in the sauce mixture, bring to a boil, then stir in the cornflour-and-water mixture and cook until the mix thickens. Add the pineapple, turn down the heat to low, and keep warm.9 Finishing touchesView image in fullscreenHeat the same pork oil to 190C and fry the meat again, this time for just 30 seconds, until golden brown. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and transfer to the sauce. Turn up the heat, toss to combine, then tip out on to a platter. Serve with egg-fried rice and perhaps something fresh and green.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassPorkMeatMain courseChinese food and drinkSauces and graviesVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

SinceI started secondary school, I’ve had pretty much the same friendship group: B, C and D.My best friend (B) and I have always been quietandhesitant aboutdoing anything where it’s just the two of us, for fear of leaving the other two out.However, this past yearwe have been consistently ignored by C and D, anddecided to do the things we want to do and not wait for approval.We can be friends independently of the others while still being friends with them too.Recently, wemade plans together and bumped into C andD while out. They had gone out without saying anything to us. C in particularseemed annoyed by this, whichwassurprising because she, especially, leaves us out.I have always feltas though she doesn’t valuemy friendship,or B’s,but expects us to be there for her andfor our friendship to revolve around her. Thisrecently came to a head over an incident where she felt we’d left her out. She called me a name anddidn’t read texts B and I sent herto apologise.I’m more annoyed than upset now,as she’s prolonged a fight that could have been resolved by reading the text. I worry that we’re trapped trying to please a toxic person.I don’t want to lose afriend going into our last year of school, but this feels unsustainable.Is this friendship worth keeping?I’m glad you feel it’s unsustainable, because something in you is telling you a valuable truth: you’re worth much more than this. This isn’t friendship. Your friends C and D, but especially C, sound deeply unhappy, and unhappy people often try to get rid of the discontent they feel and project it on to others, instead of trying to deal with it. People tell us a lot about themselves in the way they treat others.I went to clinical and counselling psychologist and psychoanalyst Prof Alessandra Lemma. “This is,” she said “such a familiar scenario, but you show real thoughtfulness in the way you describe the friendship. What comes through strongly is the imbalance. You and B avoid excluding others, while C excludes without any care.”She appears to be operating from a narcissistic position, needing to be central, quick to feel slighted, and punishing when she isn’t centre stageLemma added: “C appears to be operating from what I would understand as a narcissistic position, needing to be central, quick to feel slighted, and punishing when she isn’t centre stage.”You may find mypodcaston narcissists interesting. True narcissists (and it’s a word that is bandied about a bit too much) are very fragile people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I would encourage you to consider prioritising the good relationship with B; and to stop apologising to C, because that only reinforces the submissive role and feeds into her need to control.”There’s a huge loss involved in accepting that sometimes friendships aren’t what we want, or can make them, no matter how hard we try.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toOlivia LadanyiSun 26 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTShareLuna, 23Sometimes I wear fluffy cat ears and crawlunder Zach’s desk while he’s writing his thesisZach and I met in a bar one Halloween. I needed somewhere to put down my drink while I vaped, and started talking to him about the Hellenistic period. He was waiting for a Hinge date, but cancelled it when he found out he could get free drinks because I knew the bartender. Things started off slowly between us. I’d only had one partner before, and Zach was sleeping around, so I refused to have sex with him for a month until he’d had all the sexual health checks done. He was patient and didn’t try to go further, which I appreciated.My last boyfriend was religious, and the sex was regimented, whereas sex with Zach is spontaneous and creative. Sometimes I wear fluffy cat ears and crawl under Zach’s desk while he’s writing his thesis. He’ll stroke me and say, “Do you like that? Do you need anything?” It’s a way for me to feel safe and turn off my brain for a little while. We live with Zach’s grandparents as their carers, and once I forgot to take the ears off. His grandma saw me in them and said, “What a cute headband, dear. Maybe I should get one of those.”We have sex about four times a week, but Zach would be happy if we had moreZach’s grandparents’ house looks big from the outside, but it’s small on the inside. Our bedroom is Zach’s mum’s childhood room; there are glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling and a 1970s leather headboard, which bangs against the wall when we have sex. We moved to the floor, but realised his grandparents could hear everything downstairs when they asked, “Were you having a fun dance up there?” I told them we’d been watching Irish dancing and were trying to emulate the moves.We have sex about four times a week, but Zach would be happy if we had more. He’s far hornier than I am. I don’t crave sex at all – I could go a month without it and wouldn’t notice, but I do enjoy physical intimacy.There are intimate moments throughout the day, like filling up each other’s water glasses when we see they are getting low, or when we sneak to the park or pub. Zach is wonderfully thoughtful – he knows what I need before I do.

Often, they’re just asking if we want to do the crosswordSix months ago, Luna and I moved in with my elderly grandparents to become their full-time carers. They weren’t coping on their own, and we no longer have to worry about rent or paying the bills.I have quite a high sex drive, but it’s definitely decreased since living here. Caring leaves you with little energy, and it’s not like we can come home and relax after a day’s work. Work is at home. Changing bandages and emptying the commode doesn’t exactly create a sexy environment, but we never talk about doctors’ appointments or heart problems when we’re in our room – we preserve that little bit of space for ourselves.Sometimes, we’ll be having sex and hear the stairlift beeping, or one of my grandparents calling up to us. It’s never anything urgent – often, they’re just asking if we want to do the crossword – but it pulls you out of the moment. And we can’t make too much noise, meaning we can’t let go in the way we’d sometimes like to.We need to take advantage of the time we do have, so I buy Luna flowers, take her out and embrace the moment moreThere are some perks – we’re cushioned from the cost of living crisis here and we get to spend time with my grandparents. Living in this house, we’re in closer proximity to death, which makes me hyper aware of the temporary nature of things. We need to take advantage of the time we do have, so I buy Luna flowers, take her out and embrace the moment more.Before I met Luna two years ago, I was pretentious and performative, showing off to the people I dated that I was reading Kafka. But Luna made me feel more like myself – I didn’t need to perform with her. The first week we spent together, it felt as though we’d been married our whole lives. Now, watching Luna care for my grandparents, I can imagine having a family with her – I already know how capable she is of nurturing and being tender, because I see her do it every day.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You are distracted by the children in the back seat when you feel a slight bump and realise your vehicle has been hit by a moped.When you get out of the car you can see little damage but the driver of the moped insists he takes a picture of your driving licence or insurance documents in order for any claim to be sorted.What you don’t know is that the collision has been orchestrated as part of a “crash for cash” scam. The details you hand over will be used to take out motor insurance policies in your name so that bogus claims can be made.TheInsuranceFraud Bureau (IFB), an industry body aimed at tackling fraud, says there has been a rise in the number of identify thefts from the moped scam.‘£850 to skip the queue’: how scammers are exploiting driving test delaysRead moreDrivers have been targeted in London and in parts of the home counties such as Chelmsford in Essex, Hertford, Rickmansworth and St Albans in Hertfordshire.Between summer 2024 and March of this year, more than 1,100 fraudulent motor insurance policies were taken out by moped scammers using details from “crash for cash” victims, the IFB says. It believes many more instances of fraud go unreported.It warns that in the winter months the scammers could exploit the poor driving conditions.“As the nights draw in and road conditions worsen, drivers may be at greater risk of being targeted in reckless crash for cash scams,” says John Davies, an intelligence and investigations manager at the IFB.What the scam looks likeThe scam starts with what appears to be a random collision. The moped drivers often hide out of sight on a side road or in a parking space and then drive into the victims at low speed. While the damage may be minor or even nonexistent, the scammer will throw their moped to the ground and start taking photos, while accusing the victim of being at fault. They may have an accomplice nearby to act as a witness.They will then start to press you to hand over unnecessary details – a driving licence or an insurance certificate – and take pictures of the documents while at the roadside, taking advantage of any confusion.View image in fullscreenAvoid sharing any unnecessary information such as copies of an insurance policy or your driving licence.Photograph: Lee Martin/AlamyThese details are then used in a number of financial crimes. In one case highlighted by the IFB, more than 40 insurances policies were taken out in a victim’s name using the information they had handed over. It was only discovered when they started to receive letters in the post from insurers.In another case, criminals hijacked a victim’s insurance policy and made false claims.While anyone can be a victim of the scam, women who are driving alone or with children are particular targets, as are elderly people.What to doAfter an accident, drivers are required to exchange names, addresses and vehicle registration but nothing else. Avoid sharing any unnecessary information such as copies of an insurance policy or your driving licence.If you do feel you have been targeted, collect as much information about the incident as possible – the make and model of the moped, the number plate, a description of the driver, details of any other witnesses and dashcam footage.Call your insurer and the police and tell them you suspect you have been targeted in a “crash for cash” scam. The IFB has aconfidential Cheatline serviceto report such incidents.You can apply for Cifas Protective Registration (£30 for two years) which puts your details on the national fraud database.

This new series aims to fill the gapsJoel SnapeSun 26 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 05.26 EDTShareAll vertebrates yawn, or indulge in a behaviour that’s at least recognisable as yawn-adjacent. Sociable baboons yawn, but so do semi-solitary orangutans. Parakeets, penguins and crocodiles yawn – and so, probably, did the first ever jawed fish. Until relatively recently, the purpose of yawning wasn’t clear, and it’s still contested by researchers and scientists. But this commonality provides a clue to what it’s really all about – and it’s probably not what you’re expecting.“When I poll audiences and ask: ‘Why doyouthink we yawn?’, most people suggest that it has to do with breathing or respiration and might somehow increase oxygen in the blood,” says Andrew Gallup, a professor in behavioural biology at Johns Hopkins University. “And that’s intuitive because most yawns do have this clear respiratory component, this deep inhalation of air. However, what most people don’t realise is that that hypothesis has been explicitly tested and shown to be false.”View image in fullscreenIs he tired – or increasing arterial blood supply to his cranium?Photograph: Galina Zhigalova/Getty ImagesTo test the idea that we yawn to bring in more oxygen or expel excess carbon dioxide,studies published in the 1980smanipulated the levels of both gases in air inhaled by volunteers – and they found that while changesdidsignificantly affect other respiratory processes, they didn’t influence the regularity of yawns. There also doesn’t seem to be any systematically measurable difference in the yawning behaviour of people suffering from illnesses associated with breathing and lung function – which is what you would expect if yawns were respiration-related.This, more or less, was where Gallup came to the subject. “When I was pursuing my honours thesis, my adviser at the time said, well, why not study yawning, because nobody knows why we do it?” he says. “That was intriguing – we knew it had to serve some underlying physiological function. So I started to examine the motor action pattern it involves – this extended gaping of the jaw that’s accompanied by this deep inhalation of air, followed by a rapid closure of the jaw and a quicker exhalation. And it occurred to me that this likely has important circulatory consequences that are localised to the skull.”We can think of the gaping of the jaw as a localised stretch, similar to stretching muscles in other areas of the bodyThis, in fact, seems to be exactly what’s happening: several reviews of the medical literature suggest that yawning increases arterial blood supply to the cranium, and then venous return (the rate at which blood flows back from the head to the heart).“We can think of the gaping of the jaw as a localised stretch, similar to stretching muscles in other areas of the body,” says Gallup. “In the same way that stretching helps circulation in those extremities, yawns seem to do the same for the skull.”From here, Gallup and his fellow researchers started to develop the idea that yawning helps regulate heat in and around the skull. Your brain’s temperature is mainly determined by three variables – the rate of arterial blood travelling to the brain, the temperature of that blood, and metabolic heat production that occurs within the brain, based on neuronal activity – and yawning, theoretically, can alter the first two. When you yawn, you take in a deep breath of air that moves across the moist surfaces of your mouth, tongue and nasal passages, a bit like air flowing across a car radiator – carrying heat away through evaporation and convection.Studies seem to bear this out: ambient temperature has a pretty predictable effect on yawn frequency, which goes up when it’s justslightlytoo toasty (when it gets really hot, the air temperature is too high for the radiator effect to work, so other cooling mechanisms such as sweating kick in and yawning settles down again) and down when it’s colder.View image in fullscreenContagious, isn’t it? A Turkish fox.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThis also seems to explain why certain medical conditions are associated with excess yawning: either the conditions themselves, or the drugs used to treat them, cause elevated brain or body temperature. The “neuronal activity” explanation is also borne out by animal studies – the mammals and birds with more neurons in their brains yawn for longer durations, irrespective of the size of their actual brains.This isn’t to say that other hypotheses have been entirely put to rest. The one best supported by the evidence is the “arousal change” theory: basically, that yawning helps the brain transition between states – from sleeping to wakefulness, boredom to alertness, and so on. “One possibility is that yawning helps the brain switch between using its ‘default mode network’ – the regions associated with daydreaming, recalling memories and self-reflection – and the attentional network responsible for preparing the body for action,” says the historian of medicine Dr Olivier Walusinski, who has authored several papers on the subject. “One proposed mechanism for this would be that it helps with the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, the liquid that surrounds and cushions your brain and spinal cord.”It could be the case, in fact, that this function evolved first, with the thermoregulation effect emerging as a useful after-effect: something we’ll have better evidence for as studies are done on a wider array of animals. It could also be that the two explanations are directly related: these state changes probably mean changes in brain activity and temperature, meaning a need for enhanced blood flowandneural cooling. This would explain why you yawn when you’re bored: your brain’s activity level may upshift as it starts to think of ways to move you into a more stimulating situation, and so do its circulatory needs.Yawning’s probably good for you, and it’s probably helping your brain function betterWait a minute, though: what aboutcontagiousyawning? We’re all aware of the phenomenon of one person in a room – or even on a TV screen – taking a gulp of air, only for everyone else to do the same. Some researchers have suggested that this sort of infectious behaviour brings groups together, perhaps because it’s a hard-to-fake signal of sleepiness, boredom or vigilance – though it’s unlikely to be yawning’s main purpose, as plenty of solitary animals are regular yawners.“It could be that contagious yawning doesn’t have a function and is just a byproduct of advanced social cognitive mechanisms within highly social species,” says Gallup.To put that slightly more simply, lots of animals – including humans – have various ways of improving their empathy, including “mirror neurons”, which fire when an individual performs an action and when they see someone else perform a similar action. It might be, then, that seeing someone else yawn simply makes your mirror neurons kick in, prompting you to yawn yourself. But contagious yawningmayalso play a role in group coordination through mechanisms related to the arousal change theory: helping every animal in the group switch states from relaxed to active.One2021 study that tested this effect in lionsfound that other behaviour can be contagious among yawners, so if one lying lion yawns and then gets up for a walk, other yawners follow.Contagious yawning may also promote group vigilance: if one baboon in a troop triggers others to yawn, they may all become more alert. This may also work the other way around – helping to downregulate arousal before sleep.So, in other words: yawning’s probably good for you, and it’s probably helping your brain function better. Oh, and if you’ve been conspicuously yawning to get a five-year-old to go to sleep, don’t stop – there’s a chance it’s really working.Explore more on these topicsHuman biologySecrets of the bodyHealth & wellbeingSleepBiologyPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Snails and worms seem to have been successful using that method for sharing genes between any two individuals, but vertebrates evolved away from it. Why?Janet Lesley, Kent, UKSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyBecause it takes all the fun out of courtship.Richard OrlandoThe question is based on a misperception. Big chunks of the phylogenetic tree of animals are hermaphroditic. There is a distinction between simultaneous hermaphroditism, where two different gonads occur in the same animal at the same time, and other forms of hermaphroditism called sequential where an animal can morph from male to female or vice versa. If you take together all these, this is a lot of animals and most angiosperm plants, too. It shows you how narrow or cultural and human perceptions are and how divorced from facts they are. This is one of the beauties of science, that it allows you to correct those misperceptions in a structured way.WhomightitbeFor life forms where finding a mate is relatively easy, it is massively more beneficial to specialise into dimorphism to optimise traits, either female or male. For a life form with access to limited resources, to invest those in both systems is expensive and does not bring as much advantage.Niclas UlfeldtWhile common garden snails are hermaphroditic, not all molluscs are. Some are sequential hermaphrodites, but many have separate sexes and exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, such as the paper nautilus [a species of octopus]. Investment in eggs often requires a larger body size, or at least larger female cells. If the female has to care for the eggs or young, this also requires more investment in growth. I suspect there is a link between hermaphroditism and lifespan, and whether the animal is viviparous or oviparous.JaneTheSnailWait. Are you telling me that Brian from The Magic Roundabout wasn’t a bloke?EddieChorepostNo. He was both!BruthaIt seems to me that most biology is based upon opportunistic evolutionary chance, mutation and the conditions in which that organism finds itself. Nature is not picky – it goes to the limits of possibility in all areas of life, hence the production of, for example, the most extraordinary deep sea creatures. But nor does it “care” about consequences. It’s not logical in any terms the human brain can conceive. Though “why” is my favourite question, I don’t believe in this instance there is a single answer.LorLalaGonochorism [a system where there are two sexes and each individual organism is either male or female] is more fun :-)SylDaiPouPredictably, this question seems to have triggered some mildly humorous answers. The possibility this is pure evolutionary chance perhaps seems a bit threatening to our sense of sexual identity. However, the good news is there is a solid scientific reason why more advanced animals will be of either one sex or the other. Having reproductive organs of either kind places a metabolic drain on an individual. Any individual having both types simultaneously doubles that load, and thus puts the individual at a significant survival disadvantage. Thus the force of evolution will, even if only marginally, favour a form which is sexually dimorphic rather than hermaphroditic.RejennyratedExplore more on these topicsLife and styleNotes and queriesBiologyAnimal behaviourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A tenure-track economist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, she was working in a career she had long dreamed of. Her husband, stepchild and baby lived in New York City and the two-hour commute to Philadelphia was inconvenient but sustainable. She was embarking on a journey to do it all: a working mom, supporting her family with a career she loved.As track repairs tripled her commute time, things suddenly felt like they were falling apart. Instead of getting home in time to put her baby son to bed, Low found herself sobbing while breast pumping in an Amtrak bathroom.As an economist, Low searched for a more precise term to describe how she and other working moms often find themselves stretched for time and energy. She came up with “the squeeze”, and it’s backed by data that shows how women often get burnt out trying to manage competing demands at home and work, especially when they are parenting young children.Childcare is a hellscape for most US families. Why isn’t there a bigger push for change?Read moreLow has spent much of her career as an economist trying to understand how women navigate a modern world that has prioritized the careers of men. In her new book,Having It All:What Data Tells Us About Women’s Lives and How to Get the Most Out of Yours, Low outlines how structures around women’s work and home lives fail to truly accommodate working women.Low calls the book a “love letter to women”, an effort to let women know that society has so often made them feel like something is wrong withtheminstead of the system. Much of the book is dedicated to offering advice on how women can figure out what “having it all” means to them in the face of stubborn expectations around work and home.In an interview with the Guardian, Low said the book encompasses how women are “economic agents” just like men. They make rational decisions to optimize outcomes. As obvious as this may seem, the field has tended to discount women’s economic contributions.“When we think about the fact that women spend, on average, more time outside the labor force and spend more time with children, we’re like: ‘Oh, well the gender wage gap is because women have different preferences, and this is their choices’,” Low said. But women aren’t “just having these feelings and preferences that are perpendicular to economic realities”.Historically, the work women did at home was drastically undervalued compared to the salaries that their husbands earned. Low and other economists have pointed out that “home production” – childcare, laundry, cleaning and cooking – is a full-time job.When a woman specialized in home production, it meant that her husband could fully focus on his career and earn a salary that could support the entire family. On the surface, it appears to make sense. Two people for two full-time jobs.But economists have noted that this setup only works when the relationship remains intact. It’s no coincidence, Low points out, that women entered the workforce right as unilateral divorce laws were introducedin the US in the 1970s, and getting a divorce became easier in most states. Low cites a paper that traces the connection between these divorce laws and rising college graduation rates for women and is aptlytitledDegrees Are Forever.“Men could walk away from their marriages, taking their paycheck with them,” Low writes. “Wives could have spent years investing in home production and easing the path of someone else’s career that they now couldn’t benefit from.”Low notes that poorer women and women of color have always been working because their households could not afford only one person with a job. Being a stay-at-home mother, for a time, was actually seen as a privilege.But, among other factors, the possibility of divorce pushed women to develop their own “human capital”, a term used to describe the skills and expertise a person has to earn an income, which allowed for economic freedom in case something went wrong in their relationship.There were a few catches. First, just as women were starting to make their way into the workplace, expectations around parenting started to become more intensive. Instead of outsourcing breastfeeding to powdered formula and meals to microwave TV dinners, parents were expected to be present with their children.But while data shows that many women are now earning just as much, or sometimes even more, than their partners, the time men spend on home production hasn’t budged.“If you understand women entering the labor force as a gender revolution that came in and changed our attitudes about women’s role in society, then of course, men’s role would change, too,” Low said. But “there was no force acting on men requiring them to do something different.”Instead, much of the societal focus has been about how women can adapt to workplaces that were built and designed for men, rather than encouraging men to take on home production tasks, especially things like childcare or cleaning a home. While men fix windows and mow the lawn, these “exterior maintenance” tasks take less time than the tasks more often done by women.Books like Lean In by former Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg’s and Sophia Amoruso’s #Girlboss in the early 2010s ushered in a new era where women were told to take up space in the workplace and show their male colleagues they can keep up and work harder.The consequences of this have manifested in what appears to be the modern “feminist” movementagainstwork – a backlash, Low said, to the “girl boss” era.Low argues that the advice of Sandberg and co falls short. “It ignores the structural realities that put the onus on women,” she said. “It’s rational to say well, because the structural barriers are standing in my way, maybe I don’t feel like pursuing a career where I’m going to feel like I’m … a battering ram against these structural forces.”Where the Lean In ideology can ignore gender differences, under the guise of achieving equality, Low writes that some gender differences are important to acknowledge. When she was pregnant with her son, three of her male colleagues’ wives were also pregnant. “I bitterly clocked the ways in which our investments in this miracle of creation diverged,” she writes. “Whereas I was exhausted all the time and often bent over a toilet with morning sickness, they were merrily skipping (so it seemed to me) down the office halls.”The ongoing gender divide has seeped into the dating sphere, where women often complain about how men on dating apps are uncommitted and balk at the idea of non-casual dating. Low notes that women who want kids are on a much more constrained timeline than men, amping up the pressure of dating just as they are supposed to be building up careers.Because the girl boss era didn’t resonate with all women, Low worries that in defiance to the massive effort it takes to fight the headwinds, women have started to believe they would be happier not working at all. The so-called “tradwife” movement has taken hold of many spaces on social media, where couples romanticize traditional gender roles. Women become unburdened by careers, while men can focus on their work.But Low said there may be a sense of “amnesia” about how bad the arrangement was for women.Women were once warned by their mothers about the impact of divorce on women without an independent source of income. “That generation went to school at high rates. But the generation coming up under me did not get that message. The message they’re getting is: ‘Your moms are really stressed out. Wouldn’t it be nice to not be so stressed out?’” she said. “I don’t think they have the historical context to understand how risky that is. You are not protected, divorce laws have changed.”So, where does this leave women? Low’s solutions are two-fold. First, there needs to be societal changes that address the ongoing gender gaps at work and at home. For example, the US does not have a federal mandate for employers to offer paid maternity leave. When a government does not require companies to offer paid maternity leave, it can actually disincentivize companies from hiring women.But societal changes take time. Instead of happiness, the elusive goal of so many advice books, Low suggests women start thinking about their unique “personal utility function” – the sum total of what makes their life full and content that may look very different from what’s promoted on social media.“You have 24 hours in a day, being the Instagrammable tradwife or being Sheryl Sandberg are two separate full-time jobs,” Low said. “You cannot do those two together, but you can have elements of both of those – it is not all or nothing,”Low insists balance is possible, but it requires some forward thinking – and some tough conversations with partners.‘Too loud’, ‘too messy’, ‘too much’ … why should women be expected to shrink and shut up?Read moreAfter her time in “the squeeze”, which was exacerbated by Covid-19 shutdowns, Low divorced her husband and moved to Philadelphia, where the lower cost of living allowed her to hire an au pair. With more time to focus on her work, Low was eventually able to get tenure, which eventually led to a better work-life balance.“I do have a career, but I also like spending time with my kids,” Low said. “I try to be a very involved mom.”For some women, things may look different. In the book, she cites women who have made all sorts of choices that ended up working for them because they were intentional, grounded in their own unique set of values.“You’re not failing and you’re not bad at this. Thisisthat hard, itisdifficult.” Low said. “Once you have the tools to make those decisions with data and information, then whatever you choose is okay. There’s no wrong way to navigate the life that you choose and that works for you.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersEconomicsWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)Parents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time of her death in 1884, the princess’s estate held about 9% of the island chain’s total acreage.Her will established the Kamehameha schools using those lands and property to endow them. Today, the system encompasses three campuses for K-12 education and 30 preschools that focus on Hawaiian culture-based education. The schools educate about 5,400 students across all grades and have an endowment of about $15bn, a figure greater than all but about 10 of the country’s most elite universities. The schools take no money from the federal government.Entrance is highly competitive at all grades, with only about one in five students being accepted at the high school. Kamehameha schools also subsidize about 92% of the cost of educating their students, with almost 80% of the student body also getting some kind of financial aid based on need.A storied Los Angeles high school band had fallen on hard times. Then along came Mr JRead moreJon Osorio, the dean of the Hawaiʻinuiākea School of Hawaiian Knowledge at the University of Hawaii, said the Kamehameha schools were established at a time when the Native Hawaiian population was still on the decline. In the late 1880s, about 50,000 Native Hawaiians were estimated to live on the islands, down from a high of between 300,000 to half a million people at the time of contact with Europeans.“The kingdom itself was really in a precarious kind of place, particularly because the United States was becoming more and more interested in securing a permanent base at Pearl Harbor,” Osorio said. “The kingdom’s precariousness and not really seeing the long-term fate of the Hawaiian nation was one of the things that led the princess in thinking she did not want her people to be left behind.”Osorio said throughout the 20th century, “almost everything Hawaiian was being marginalized or even eliminated, or very actively suppressed”.“In that period of time, the Kamehameha schools was really the only thing that we had,” Osorio, an alumnus of the schools, said. “The institution that we had, that was just for us, and had the potential at least of keeping us abreast of the rest of the population.”Now, almost all of those enrolled at the schools have Native Hawaiian ancestry. But thenew suit, filed in district court in Honolulu, says that is unfair.The lawsuit was launched by a group called Students for Fair Admissions, a neoconservative non-profit based in Virginia that has for years waged a legal battle against affirmative action and race-based admissions practices. The group sued Harvard in 2014 andultimately secured a landmark supreme court rulingin 2023 that saw the conservative supermajority end race-conscious admissions in higher education across the nation.Awebsite launched last monthas a precursor to the Kamehameha schools suit notes that while it is a “great school system”, the schools’ “admissions policy expressly prefers students with Native Hawaiian ancestry over non-Native Hawaiian students”.“In fact, that preference is so strong that it is essentially impossible for a non-Native Hawaiian student to be admitted to Kamehameha,” Students for Fair Admission says. “We believe that focus on ancestry, rather than merit or need, is neither fair nor legal, and we are committed to ending Kamehameha’s unlawful admissions policies in court.”The kingdom’s precariousness … was one of the things that led the princess in thinking she did not want her people to be left behindJon OsorioThe effort is led byEdward Blum, a conservative activist who has led groups that have filed more than a dozen lawsuits challenging the use of race in education, business and across cultural bodies.Blum did not reply to the Guardian’s request for comment. He told the New York Times that while the group supported the Kamehameha schools’ mission, their offerings should be available to all Hawaiians, “not just those with a specific genetic background”.Eujin Park, an assistant professor at the graduate school of education at Stanford University, said the lawsuit targeting the Kamehameha schools was a striking example of how the fight to roll back civil rights-era legislation and policies to support equal opportunity in schools had moved from the battleground of higher education to K-12.Park said conservative groups had targeted Harvard “very specifically” a decade ago.“I think they’re targeting the Kamehameha schools because they are a very uniquely situated school,” Park said. “Much like the way they chose Harvard very specifically, because it’s such an elite space, because it’s so famous, and because … what we know as affirmative action … was modeled after the Harvard admissions plan.”Park said even though affirmative action had its critics as a fairly limited tool to expand education opportunity and access, “it was an important tool in the toolbox”.“It was part of this wider range of policies available to schools and universities to expand access and to build a more just education system,” she said. “To lose that tool, it’s incredibly harmful.”Crystal Kauilani Rose, the chair of the board of trustees at Kamehameha schools, spoke about that legacy in front of the landmark ʻIolani Palace in Honolulu on Tuesday.Rose said the princess’s mission to uplift Native Hawaiians “remains as vital today as when Pauahi wrote her will”.“Our mission is simple, yet powerful: to fulfill [Pauahi’s] vision of empowering Native Hawaiians in perpetuity by improving the wellbeing of our people through education,” she told a crowd of hundreds of alumni and supporters. “This is our focus, and our purpose.”I think they’re targeting the Kamehameha schools because they are a very uniquely situated school …much like the way they chose Harvard very specificallyEujin ParkRose was one of the lawyers who successfully defended the admissions program in a 2003 challenge. At the time, the court ruled Kamehameha schools’ race-conscious admissions policy served “a legitimate remedial purpose”.“One of the most meaningful moments of my career personally was defending our admissions policy two decades ago,” Rose said during the event on Tuesday. “When I took my oath as a trustee, I said, with every bone in my body, and every part of my soul, I made a promise. I promised to protect Pauahi’s vision, to honor her name, to defend this incredible institution.”Things could be more difficult than they were 20 years ago, despite Kamehameha schools’ public comments that it is ready for a long legal fight.Osorio said times were different now with a ninth circuit court of appeals that is “no longer what it used to be”. He pointed to a panel of three judges on the circuit, who recently ruled 2-1 thatDonald Trump can deploy the national guard to Portland.He added the schools had been “under attack” since the early 2000s by groups who “suggest this resource and this institution was a racist institution since it had assessment for those of Hawaiian ancestry”.“Nobody in Hawaii was ever fooled by that,” he said. “No one here who understands this history ever really thought that the Hawaiian preference at Kamehameha schools was a racist preference. The vast majority of people here, including people who are not Hawaiian, saw this as the very, very least kind of resource that could be left in our hands.“To Hawaiians, this challenge, I think it’s the most important thing we’ll ever be fighting,” Osorio went on. “And I think it’s going to bring all of us – all of our vigor and all of our anger – together.”Explore more on these topicsHawaiiUS educationWest CoastLaw (US)featuresShareReuse this content"

Politicians from Donald Trump to Giorgia Meloni and Nigel Farage will be closely watching what happens nextHeather StewartEconomics editorSun 26 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 13.11 EDTShare“Cambio,cambio.” Under the blazing sun, dozens of money changers are hawking US dollars along Florida Street, a bustling pedestrian strip in Buenos Aires. Known asarbolitos(“little trees”), they are thriving ahead of the 26 October midterm elections in a country long used to saving in the greenback.“The best time to buy is now,” says onearbolito, declining to give her name. “[The dollar] went down a little but it is a fake-out – it’ll rise again.”Like her, economists across the spectrum expect a devaluation of the Argentine peso once the voting is over. The president,Javier Milei, has placed a cap on the currency to tame triple-digit inflation and now it remains overvalued and reserves are depleted, leaving Argentina’s economy stagnant as consumers turn to cheap imports.Luciano Galfione, a textile industrialist, says the 75-year-old family company he heads is living through “the worst moment in its history”. Since the chainsaw-wielding Milei took office, Galfione has laid off almost 50 workers and suspended 45 more at his Buenos Aires mill as consumption has slumped.Between December 2023 and July 2025, 18,000 businesses have closed and 253,800 registered jobs have been lost, according to the Centre for Argentine Political Economy (CEPA). Alongside the exchange rate freeze, which made Argentina the most expensive country in South America, Milei’s government – unlike Donald Trump’s – has reduced or scrapped tariffs, leaving heavily taxed local industries at a disadvantage against Chinese imports.“It’s the perfect storm,” says Galfione, seeing no easy exit for Milei from his predicament. “If he devalues the currency, inflation will soar. For now, his only achievement is containing it – at the cost of a major recession.”Together with the retirees who protest against deep cuts in their pensions outside Congress every Wednesday, Galfione is among those counting the costs of Argentina’s turn to Milei two years ago.Milei’s populist experiment now faces a defining moment. From Trump (who is trying to prop up Milei and the peso with a$20bn (£15bn) currency lifeline) to Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and the UK’s Nigel Farage, politicians around the world are closely watching what happens when populist economic prescriptions collide with reality.Fertile groundArgentina is a very special case. The country has been repeatedly racked by debt defaults and economic crises and its voters have been susceptible over the years to leftwing populism, in the form of the powerful Peronist movement, and now Milei’s rightwing version.Milei is a textbook populist: charismatic, iconoclastic, promising muscular policies to wrest back control of the economy from the establishment on behalf of the people.These key characteristics are shared by his ally to the north, Trump, and by Farage, who styles himself as a pint-swilling people’s champion despite being a privately educated former stockbroker.Until recent months, Milei’s approach – involving extensive privatisations and deep public spending cuts – had won plaudits from the IMF for helping to bring inflation under control. The programme has something in common with that of Milei’s idol Margaret Thatcher, who also saw inflation as a dragon to be slain, no matter the cost.But financial markets began losing confidence in Milei’s radical project in recent months after a shaky result in provincial elections and a series of corruption scandals. Only massive financial intervention by Trump has averted what looked set to become a full-blown currency crisis.Milei’s travails raise wider questions about the appeal of charismatic populists who wield simple answers in today’s complex and fragmented global economy.Across Europe, the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis has been fertile ground for populists to flourish in. Ordinary citizens bore the costs of rebuilding after the great crash while banks were bailed out by the taxpayer. The Covid pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought fresh turmoil. Stagnant living standards, as evidenced by sluggish wage growth and surging prices, have driven a hunger for change – and for scapegoats.In France, Emmanuel Macron is trying to avoid calling a snap election for fear of his centre-right Renaissance party succumbing to the populist Marine Le Pen. Public dissatisfaction with a package of austerity policies aimed at tackling France’s yawning deficit and placating jittery bond markets is at the heart of the tussle.Italian voters turned to the charismatic rightwing populist Meloni in 2022. She had served in Silvio Berlusconi’s coalition cabinet as a member of the far-right National Alliance and founded her own party,Brothers of Italy, in 2011, offering a radical rightwing alternative to the austerity policies of Mario Monti’s technocratic government.She has not brought the tear-it-all-down approach to economic policy deployed by Milei – she quietly dropped earlier calls for Italy to leave the euro, for example – but she has appealed to voters’ desire to overturn the status quo, blaming immigration for Italy’s struggles.In the UK, the appeal of Farage is not hard to diagnose, says Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford’s Nuffield College. “The answer is probably quite simple: people feel rotten about the economy and have done since the end of Covid or the start of the Ukraine war. They switched government, they still feel awful, they don’t trust the main parties, so they turn to someone who says: ‘Everything needs to be disrupted: trust me.’”ContradictionsThe vote for Brexit in 2016 arguably had some of the same logic, and its figurehead, Boris Johnson, swept away doubts about economic detail with a bullish determination to implement the “will of the people” in the face of the establishment’s horror.Farage has so far committed few policies to paper aside from acall for mass deportations, which he subsequently appeared to revise on the hoof. He wants to rein in the Bank of England, perhaps evenditching its governor, Andrew Bailey, with scepticism of a stodgy establishment being a key part of the populist package.His tax and spending policies appear to be in flux: wary of being accused of planning a Liz Truss-style splurge, he recently abandoned a promise to make£90bn of tax cuts. His Reform party deputy, Richard Tice, said they would concentrate instead onpublic spending cuts.Labour hopes this stance will enable it to portray Farage as planning to bring back austerity – a point Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has made repeatedly, contrasting it with her approach of increasing public investment.Jo Michell, a professor of economics at the University of the West of England, says there are contradictions in Farage’s economic programme, such as it is.“Reform are bankrolled by very wealthy people demanding tax cuts and deregulation, but also talking a lot about the grievances of working people and the loss of industrial jobs and things that really resonate,” he says. “There’s a tension there between rich backers who want Thatcherism on steroids, and this narrative of bringing back British jobs and reindustrialisation.”Farage enjoys the company of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs but has also promised to reopen shuttered steelworks and run them on British coal.Michell says if a Farage government tried to implement massive tax giveaways to the wealthy without a plan to fund them, it would go down about as well with international investors that lend to the UK as Truss’s mini-budget. “If it was tax cuts without spending cuts, the markets would puke,” he says.Reform would face the same formidable challenge in winning over the markets as governments of all stripes in many developed economies currently do.Hefty public debts run up through the financial crisis and the Covid years, combined with the need for more spending on defence and ageing societies, mean borrowing has been rising in many countries simultaneously, making bond markets unusually volatile – with knock-on effects for interest rates.Despite the risks, as in the Brexit campaign it is unclear how successful detailed rebuttal of Reform’s economic policy is likely to be. Reeves has recently acknowledged that Brexit is one reason the Office for Budget Responsibility hascut its growth forecasts, but Labour has been consistently reluctant to lean into the issue.Ansell says successfully taking on populist arguments requires deft political communication. “You have to do it with a lot of charisma, with humour,” he says.The leftwing economist Ann Pettifor agrees that no one should be surprised by the allure of economic populism. “There’s real anger about the wrongness of the system, which is structurally impoverishing the many and enriching the few,” she says.Her riposte to the likes of Milei, Trump and Farage would be a left populism, akin to that on offer from the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani or the UK Green party leader, Zack Polanski, or once upon a time by Jeremy Corbyn, that challenges the power of corporations, central banks and the super-rich.“Trump is saying: ‘We should blame Mexico and Canada and China,’” Pettifor says. “The left should be saying the problem is Silicon Valley and Wall Street.”Trump shares Milei’s love of chaos and showbiz but his approach does not fit straightforwardly into his Argentinian ally’s laissez-faire playbook. While Trump has cut taxes for the wealthy and slashed regulation in some sectors, his administration has also taken stakes in strategic firms and used trade policy as a political weapon – a muscular interventionism more familiar in Beijing than Washington.So far the impact of the tariff blitz on the US economy appears to be relatively muted, though it is being masked by the historic boom in AI investment, which a growing number of experts warnmay be a bubble.Many experts believe Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve and blatant disregard for the rule of law may ultimately be more corrosive for the future health of the US economy than his erratic trade policies.Holding on to powerIn truth, the evidence suggests neither left nor right populists tend to fare well when faced with real-world challenges (though of course each charismatic individual claims to offer something unique).Arecent paperin the American Economic Review analysed the performance of 51 populist presidents and prime ministers, from 1900 to 2020. It found that on average, after 15 years, gross domestic product per head tends to be 10% lower in countries run by populist leaders than in similar economies with more mainstream regimes.“Economic disintegration, decreasing macroeconomic stability and the erosion of institutions typically go hand in hand with populist rule,” argue the paper’s authors, Manuel Funke, Moritz Schularick and Christoph Trebesch.Another intriguing finding of the research, though, is that despite their economic costs, these leaders tend to be good at holding on to power, lasting on average eight years, compared with four for their more moderate equivalents.In other words, it is not clear that even when their plans crash, populists immediately pay the price at the ballot box. Like the Brexiters’ promise to “take back control”, their appeal reaches beyond mundane economics.But back in Buenos Aires, whether Milei’s populist project collapses or is kept on life support by Trump, Argentina’s citizens have already paid a heavy price.Additional reporting byFacundo Iglesia"

At a ceasefire ceremony in front of a sign that read “Delivering Peace”, the Thai prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, and his Cambodian counterpart, Hun Manet, signed an expanded ceasefire deal related toa deadly five-day conflict in July.Trump helped broker the end of the two nations’ worst border conflict in recent history, telling the leaders they risked putting their respective trade talks with the US on hold if they didn’t end hostilities.“The United States will have robust commerce and cooperation, transactions, lots of them, with both nations, as long as they live in peace,” Trump said on Sunday.Trump in Asia: five key questions as US president prepares for diplomatic tourRead moreTrump has touted himself as a global peacemaker during his second term and his decision to weigh in behind the Malaysian premier Anwar Ibrahim’s mediation efforts prompted Manet to nominate him for the Nobel prize, lauding his “extraordinary statesmanship”. On Sunday, Trump told reporters he also intended to solve the current Afghanistan-Pakistan conflict “very quickly”.In the new deal signed by Thailand andCambodia, both sides agree to remove heavy weapons from the border area, cooperate on removing landmines, and for Thailand to release 18 detained Cambodian soldiers. The two sides blame each other for the short conflict, in which at least 48 people were killed and about 300,000 displaced.Manet said: “This declaration, if fully implemented, will provide the building blocks for a lasting peace, but more importantly, it will begin the process of mending our ties.”Anutin said: “This declaration reflects our will to resolve differences peacefully in full respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity.”Trump had a busy run of trade negotiations on Sunday. After a meeting with the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Trump said: “we should be able to make some pretty good deals for both countries.” The US and Vietnam also agreed to a framework for a trade agreement that the White House said would limit reciprocal tariffs to between zero and 20%.He also signed a trade agreement with Malaysia that would ensure no restrictions on US access to critical minerals, in return for a formalised 19% tariff on Malaysian goods. Trump had earlier said he also expected a similar deal withThailand.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with Cambodia’s prime minister Hun Manet in Kuala Lumpur.Photograph: Mohd Rasfan/EPATrump said he was confident of hammering out a deal with the Chinese president before an expected meeting on Thursday, as top trade officials from both sides met for a second day in Kuala Lumpur and agreed on a framework for a trade agreement.Earlier this month China announceda shock ban on global exports of rare earth mineralsthat could have dual use for foreign military or some semiconductor sectors. China controls the vast majority of mining and production of the critical minerals, and the announcement sparked panic in global markets. The US in particular is racing to diversify its supply chains,signing a recent deal with Australiato help it kickstart its own domestic industry.Trump’s arrival at the annual Asean summit is the first stop on an Asian tour that also includes Japan and South Korea, where he is expected to meet Xi. The US and China are in the midst of a trade war which has seen damaging moves and countermoves including escalating tariffs and a Chinese pause on US soya bean purchases.The meeting with Xi is expected to cover much more than trade, with the US leader saying he expects to bring up the Hong Kong dissident Jimmy Lai – who isin jail and awaiting a verdict on national security chargesrelated to his involvement in the pro-democracy movement – and the issue of Taiwan.The Chinese Communist party is preparing to annex Taiwan as a province, claiming it is currently run by “separatists”. Taiwan’s government is democratically elected. The governing party, opposition, and the vast majority of Taiwan’s population reject the prospect of CCP rule.The US is Taiwan’s most important supporter in its resistance to a Chinese takeover, despite Washington not formally recognising it as a country and instead having diplomatic ties with Beijing.Trump’s inconsistent and occasionally dismissive language over Taiwan has raised some concerns among observers and officials about his stance on continuing US support, most of which takes the form of weapons sales and supply, obliged under US law.On Saturday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, dismissed these concerns.“If what people are worried about is we’re going to get some trade deal or we’re going to get favourable treatment on trade in exchange for walking away from Taiwan – no one is contemplating that,” Rubio said.Rubio’s remarks followed recent comments by Trump that Xi “doesn’t want to do that”, referring to invasion. However, he has since walked that back, saying: “I hope they won’t, we’ll have to see.”With Reuters and the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyAsia PacificThailandCambodiaTrump administrationAsean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)MalaysianewsShareReuse this content"

It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead more“Artificial intelligence presents significant opportunities for Australia and our economy; however, it’s important that Australian creatives benefit from these opportunities too,” she said.The attorney general will convene the government’s copyright and AI reference group on Monday and Tuesday to canvass other options for responding to the challenges posed by the evolving technology.That includes whether a new paid licensing framework under the Copyright Act should replace the existing voluntary regime.The Australian Recording Industry Association, which was among the creatives campaigning against the exemption, welcomed the announcement as a “critical step in the right direction”.“It is a win for creativity and Australian culture, including First Nations culture, but it’s also a win for common sense,” said its chief executive, Annabelle Herd. “Current copyright licensing structures work.“They are the foundation of the creative economy, the digital economy, and the technology industry.

It had been feared he would be reliant on a wheelchair for the rest of his life.But in a new upbeat progress report on his recovery, his family detailed how much the 12-year-old can now move unaided.They said: “Our little knight had long set himself the goal of being able to run, jump and swim again.“He can’t do it like other children his age, of course, but we can no longer describe what he does in any other way than by saying it’s running, jumping and swimming.“It’s different, only over a few metres or a very small height, but it’s an incredible achievement. We are happy that he has been able to reach this stage of progress before his next operation.”The procedure early next year will leave him immobilised for two months, the family said. Doctors have told him he should regain more movement after the treatment.“The surgeon is relying on all the progress he has made so far to reassure him of the future benefits and how much he will be able to do even better afterward,” the family said.They said their “preteen” son’s memory is still limited but improving as he gains “cognitive endurance”. This summer he enjoyed a holiday in the mountains with other children who did not speak French. “Our son was able to work on his English and play French teacher a little,” his parents said.They said a psychomotor therapist has worked with the boy to help him stop tensing up the left side of his body, which was causing him pain. They said the boy also needs 10 separate rehabilitation sessions each week.The family said they are trying to find a new school for their son that will allow him to do all the subjects in the curriculum and still have time for these therapy sessions.They added that this “means that we will have to move again soon so that our son maintains his chances of progress”.Afundraising pagecreated after the attack has so far raised more than £477,000.Explore more on these topicsTate ModernEnglandFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Under French law, people suspected of committing serious crimes can be detained for up to 96 hours before being charged.Multiple French media outlets said the man detained at the airport had beenabout to board a planeto Algeria.Paris Match saidthe second, who was arrested at roughly the same time in the Seine-Saint-Denis department near Paris, had planned to travel to Mali.Both suspects were reportedly in their 30s, known to police and had criminal records for robbery.Le Monde saidthey had been under observation “for some time” before being taken into custody on suspicion of “organised theft and criminal conspiracy”.1:06‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen from Louvre in rapid heist, says French minister – videoCiting police sources,France Inter public radio reportedthat the pair were from Seine-Saint-Denis, north-east of Paris, which has the highest poverty and crime rates in mainland France, according to the national statistics office.The men were identified from forensic analysis of items that were abandoned at the scene, including gloves, a hi-vis vest, a motorbike helmet, angle grinders and other power tools, a blow-torch and a walkie-talkie.The French interior minister, Laurent Nuñez, on Sunday sent his “warmest congratulations” to the investigators who he said had “worked tirelessly”, but also called for confidentiality so as not to hamper the work of the detectives.Beccuau said on Fridaythat more than 150 DNA samples, fingerprints and other traces on objects found at the scene were being analysed in forensic laboratories and that she was “optimistic” about the investigation’s outcome.The four men pulled up outside the world’s most visited museum at about 9.30am last Sunday in a stolen furniture removal truck fitted with an extending ladder and lift, in which two of them mounted to the ornate first-floor Apollo gallery.Wearing hi-vis vests to resemble maintenance workers, they smashed an unsecured window and used disc cutters to open two display cases before descending in the bucket lift and fleeing on motorbikes driven by the other two men.The brazen heist lasted less than seven minutes, with the two who entered the gallery, which houses France’s surviving royal gems, spending just three minutes and 58 seconds inside.They dropped a diamond and emerald-studded crown during their getaway, but fled with eight richly gem-encrusted pieces that Beccuau said last week were worth “a spectacular sum, nearly €90m, but nothing compared to their historical value”.The jewels included an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave to his second wife, Marie Louise, and a diadem set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that had once belonged to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III.Originally built in the late 12th century, the Louvre palace was once the official residence of the French monarchs until Louis XIV abandoned it for Versailles. It became a museum for the royal art collection in 1793, four years after the French Revolution.The museum, which stands on a 37-hectare (91 acre) site along the north bank of the Seine in central Paris, houses a vast collection of masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo statue. It was visited by 8.7 million people last year.Nuñez expressed his “concern for the jewellery” in an interview with the French weekly La Tribune Dimanche on Sunday, saying the heist appeared to have been carried out by an organised crime group but adding that “thieves are always eventually caught”.The interior minister said there was a risk the jewellery would be broken up, with its precious metal settings melted down and the gems sold separately. “The loot is unfortunately often stashed abroad. I hope that’s not the case – I remain confident,” he added.While the museum’s internal alarms functioned normally, with a first going off at 9.34am when the robbers smashed the balcony window looking on to the Quai François Mitterrand, the museum’s directorhas acknowledged a security blindspot.Laurence des Cars told French senators last week that external security cameras did not adequately cover the thieves’ access point, with the only camera installed near the Apollo gallery pointed in the wrong direction to cover the window.However, Des Cars defended the museum’s €80m security programme, saying security camera coverage was being increased across the entire site, including “video surveillance covering all facades”.France’s culture minister, Rachida Dati, said on social media on Friday that she had requested findings from an investigation into the Louvre’s security by early next week in order to “announce concrete measures to secure” the museum.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump is willing to say what many others are too timid or too diplomatic to say out loud. For the longest time people have been calling for Trump to pull out the sanctions hammer. It could be very significant.”The sanctions mean companies buying Russian oil risk losing access to the dollar-based financial system. This could have particularly large consequences for India and China, which have emerged as the largest importers of Russian oil and gas since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three and a half years ago.‘Economic coercion’The impact has been swift. Within hours, the sanctions had triggered a6% rise in the global oil priceand reports were emerging of an immediate pause of Russian oil deliveries to the biggest refineries in India, Moscow’s biggest crude customer, and to China’s biggest state-owned oil companies.Luke Wickenden, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), said a significant decline in Asia’s fossil fuel imports would be “devastating” for the Kremlin’s export revenues.“Between January and September this year, 86% of Russia’s crude oil exports – including pipeline deliveries – went to China and India. If Moscow lost access to these markets, it could forfeit approximately $7.4bn in monthly revenue, translating to roughly $3.6bn in tax receipts per month flowing directly into the Kremlin’s war chest,” Wickenden said.“There is some hope, however. In September, Russian crude imports by India’s state-owned refineries dropped to their lowest levels since May 2022, falling by 38% month on month. If India alone were to cut its imports of Russian crude, the Kremlin could lose roughly $1.6bn in monthly tax revenues.”Chart of the largest markets for Russian crude oilRussia’s monthly fossil fuel export revenues slipped by 4% last month to the lowest since the full-scale invasion and are now half of what they were in September 2022.Putin says he will never bow to US but concedes sanctions may cause ‘some losses’Read moreBut while revenues are significantly lower than they were, they remain propped up by purchases of oil and gas from buyers in Asia and easternEuropeand shipments of seaborne liquefied natural gas (LNG) into the EU. Russia is also understood to export millions of tonnes of crude via so-called “shadow tankers”, a fleet of ageing vessels used to circumvent western sanctions.Trump’s latest move to starve Putin’s war machine of fossil fuel revenues came after he received a tepid response to his demands for India and China to cut their Russian energy imports orface tougher trade termsas a consequence.China denounced the Trump administration’s “unilateral bullying” and “economic coercion” over what it described as its “legitimate” oil purchases from Russia and vowed to take “firm countermeasures” if its national interests were harmed.Trump said India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had assured him during a phone call this week that Delhi was “not going to buy much oil from Russia” as he too “wants to see the war end with Russia-Ukraine”. But while Modi has acknowledged the call, on which Trump wished the prime minister a happy Diwali, hehas not publiclyconfirmed plans to limit India’s crude imports from Russia.‘Disgraceful stain’ on EUFor Trump, the mission to break Russia’s energy dominance has twin benefits, according to Keatinge. “There is an opportunity here to bring peace to Ukraine and profit to the US,” he said.The US has become Europe’s biggest supplier of LNG since the war in Ukraine caused pipeline imports of Russian gas to run dry and seaborne shipments of gas to slow. It accounted for more than 55% of the EU’s LNG imports last year, from negligible volumes in 2019.Trump can expect US gas exports to Europe to increase after the EU agreed last week to phase out all imports of Russian gas, including LNG, by the beginning of 2027. Although Europe’s reliance on Russian energy has slumped, the continent is still funding the Kremlin through purchases of Russian oil and gas, which Keatinge said was “a disgraceful stain” on the EU.Chart showing major buyers of Russian energyThe EU remains the largest buyer of Russian LNG, according to data from Crea, and has bought half of Russia’s total LNG exports, followed by China (22%) and Japan (18%). The bloc is also the largest buyer of pipeline gas, buying 35% of Russia’s pipeline gas, followed by China (30%) and Turkey (29%).Hungary and Slovakia were the EU’s largest importers of Russian gas last month, buying €393m- and €207m-worth of Russian fossil fuels respectively. France, Belgium and the Netherlands having continued to import Russian gas, too.France was the EU’s third largest buyer of Russian gas last year, importing €153m of Russian fossil fuels, all in the form of LNG, some of which was subsequently delivered to Germany. Belgium was the fourth biggest importer, importing €92m of Russian LNG, while the Netherlands bought €62m of LNG.Chart showing the main EU buyers of Russian fossil fuelsKeatinge said: “The EU has been quick to say they’re bringing forward the day they stop to January 2027, but how many Ukrainians will die before then? Some European countries were able to find a way to go without Russian imports almost immediately – this should have come three years ago. We should hold India and China to account, of course, but we should look at our own, too.”The long-term impact of Trump’s war on Russia’s fossil fuel revenues, and whether it can bring peace to Europe and profit to the US, remains to be seen. Industry observers have warned that much will depend on how strictly the sanctions are enforced and how those still reliant on Russia’s fossil fuels respond.In the meantime, Keatinge is optimistic. “Never bet against Trump,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryOilGasRussiaUkraineTrump administrationGlobal economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

He has since been accused by the Russians of high treason.The Guardian has seen a document said to be the one provided by the Russian authorities to Pshenichnov’s lawyers, outlining the allegations against him.View image in fullscreenLeonid Pshenichnov ‘had the misfortune of living in Kerch, Crimea, when it was captured by Russian troops’, a colleague said.Photograph: NANCA translation of the document describes the scientist as a “citizen of the Russian Federation” who “defected to the enemy’s side” by assisting Ukraine’s delegation to the Antarctic conference, which has been organised by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart, Tasmania.It accuses Pshenichnov of using his research to undermine Russia’s fishing of krill in Antarctica by encouraging, via a Ukrainian proposal, the restriction of krill harvesting. Such proposals would harm the economic interests of Russia, the arrest document said.CCAMLR, an international commission with 27 members established by convention in 1982, is about to discuss whether to create a marine protected area (MPA) around the Antarctic Peninsula to protect krill, the small crustacean that is one of the bases of the food chain in the Southern Ocean.China and Russia, which have blocked the creation of MPAs in the region for decades,have been accusedby analysts and conservationists of working together to loosen restrictions on fishing for krill. This year, for the first time, the amount of krill fished in Antarctic waters reached what scientists believe is an unsustainable level.Australiahas said it is “gravely concerned”by Russia’s detention of the scientist, while the UK called Moscow to release “all arbitrarily detained civilians”.Fellow researchers said Pschenichnov was a scientist of “outstanding” calibre and a “very kind” person. His detention was “unspeakable”, they said, adding that as their colleague had health problems they were “all dreadfully worried”.On the opening day of the conference, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko,told delegates of his “profound shock”on learning of the “illegal incarceration” of the scientist and called for other parties of the commission – whose members include Australia, the United States, Japan, Russia and China – to condemn Moscow’s actions.“Is it acceptable for the CCAMLR community to stand by while a Ukrainian biologist, who has devoted his life to the study, conservation and rational use of Antarctic marine living resources, faces persecution and imprisonment by Russia?” he said.View image in fullscreenA scientific expedition’s catch of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The zooplankton form one of the bases of the food chain in the Southern Ocean ecosystem.Photograph: Tenedos/GettyPschenichnov has conducted research for CCAMLR, part of the Antarctic treaty system, since 1983 and has participated in its activities as a Ukrainian scientist since 1994.Myroshnychenko told the Guardian: “He’s a scientist, not an official, not a politician. These are trumped-up charges, his detention is groundless.”The charges of high treason against Pschenichnov were directly related to his scientific contributions at CCAMLR, the ambassador said. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin,raised the maximum sentence for treasonfrom 20 years to life imprisonment in 2023.“He was forced to take up a Russian passport while staying with family in temporarily occupied Crimea and has been arbitrarily charged with ‘threatening the security of the Russian Federation’,” said Myroshnychenko.The ambassador said his deputy was collecting signatures from countries for a letter to Moscow demanding his release.Licence to krill: the destructive demand for a ‘better’ fish oilRead morePshenichnov lives inKerch, Crimea, with his wife and one of his two sons, according to a fellow scientist who called his detention “unspeakable”.Dr Evgeny A Pakhomov, a biological oceanographer at the University of British Columbia, Canada, who has published two scientific papers with Pshenichnov and has known him for 30 years, said: “He is a very kind person … he has kneecap problems and needs regular injections. We are all dreadfully worried.”Valerii Paramonov, an oceanographer, described Pschenichnov as an outstanding scientist whose contribution to CCAMLR was “difficult to overestimate”.Paramonov added: “His only problem was that he had the misfortune of living in Kerch, Crimea, when it was captured by Russian troops.”Dan Crockett, executive director of the conservation charity Blue Marine Foundation, said Pschenichnov had been imprisoned for “nothing more than providing scientific evidence about the impact of krill fishing on the Antarctic ecosystem”.He called on CCAMLR countries to put pressure on Russia for his release and to “honour his research” by restricting krill trawling.The Russian embassy was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsAntarcticaSeascape: the state of our oceansRussiaUkraineFishingFishing industryConservationFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

In the western part, Hamas is seeking to reassert its control in the vacuum left by the partial Israeli withdrawal, carrying out public executions of rival militia or gang members it claims are backed by Israel.In the other half of Gaza, covering the eastern strip as well as the northern and southern borders, the IDF has been reinforcing scores of military outposts and firing at anyone approaching the line, whether it has been marked with yellow blocks or not.“In our area, the yellow lines aren’t clearly visible. We don’t know where they start or end. I think they’re clearer in other places, but here, nothing is defined,” Mohammad Khaled Abu al-Hussain, a 31-year-old father of five, said. His family’s house is in al-Qarara, north of Khan Younis and just east of the yellow line, in the IDF-controlled zone.View image in fullscreenMohammad Abu al-Hussain: ‘What’s the point of a ceasefire if I still can’t return home?’Photograph: Amjad Tantesh/The Guardian“As soon as we get close to our homes, bullets start flying from every direction, and sometimes small drones, the quadcopters, hover above us, watching every move,” he said. “Yesterday, I was with my friend when we suddenly came under heavy gunfire. We threw ourselves to the ground and stayed there until the shooting stopped. I couldn’t reach my house.“It feels like the war hasn’t really ended for me. What’s the point of a ceasefire if I still can’t return home?”He added: “It breaks my heart to see people on my way going back to their houses while I remain stuck between hope and fear. But what worries me most is the idea that this line might stay, that no decision will ever allow us to return.”Israel insisted on Sunday that it would maintain control of security in Gaza. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told ministers it would decide for itself where and when to strike its foes and which countries would be allowed to send troops to police the truce.“Israel is an independent state. We will defend ourselves by our own means and we will continue to determine our fate,” he said. “We do not seek anyone’s approval for this. We control our security.”The free-fire policy along the line – ordered by the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz – follows an attack on Sunday 19 October in the southern city of Rafah in which two Israeli soldiers were killed.Turkey likely to be excluded from Gaza stabilisation force after Israeli objectionRead moremap of yellow line in GazaTwo weeks into the ceasefire, more than 20 Palestinians are still being killed on average each day, many of them close to the yellow line. Consequently, very few of the displaced are returning to the area under Israeli control.The political hurdles remain immense to moving to a second phase of the ceasefire, which would involve Hamas being disarmed and replaced by an multinational stabilisation force, and an IDF withdrawal from the yellow line to positions closer to the Gaza border. The right wing of the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition is fiercely opposed to further withdrawal, and the internationalisation of control over Gaza.In the impasse, the yellow line continues to take on a more permanent form, and is increasingly referred to in Israeli media as a “new border”.Writing in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, the military correspondent Yoav Zitun predicted the yellow line could evolve into “a high and sophisticated barrier that will shrink the Gaza Strip, enlarge the western Negev and allow for Israeli settlements to be built there”.“It looks like a de facto creeping annexation of Gaza,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of the Refugees International advocacy group and a former US aid official.View image in fullscreenA screen grab from a handout video shows an Israeli vehicle moving yellow blocks to mark the yellow line dividing Gaza.Photograph: Israeli Ministry Of Defence/ReutersUnder the terms of the US-brokered ceasefire, which came into effect on 10 October, the IDF withdrawal to the yellow line would leave it occupying 53% of the Gaza Strip, but aBBC satellite analysisof the new yellow markers suggested they had been placed several hundred metres beyond the proposed line, representing a further substantial land grab.An IDF spokesperson said there was no official comment on the BBC report. An earlier IDF statement said only that work had started on marking the yellow line with a “concrete barrier with a pole painted yellow, standing 3.5 meters high”, intended “to establish tactical clarity on the ground”.What is becoming clear is an ever-sharper partition of Gaza, with most of the surviving 2.1 million population crammed into half the territory, amid the ruins left by two years of Israeli bombardment.“The yellow line, as far as we have been told, lies about 1km past Salah al-Din Street,” said Ayman Abu Mandeel, referring to the main thoroughfare running from south to north through the middle of the Gaza Strip.Abu Mandeel is 58 years old, with nine children. The remains of his house are in eastern al-Qarara, but he has little hope of returning there any time soon. “The Israeli army has set up cranes, watchtowers and tanks there. They monitor every movement and open fire on anyone who gets close.”“We haven’t seen the yellow markings ourselves, because anyone who tries to reach those areas is immediately targeted,” he said. “The quadcopters don’t hesitate to shoot at anyone who moves toward them, as if getting close to our own land has become a crime.”View image in fullscreenAbu Mandeel: ‘The Israeli army monitors every movement and opens fire on anyone who gets close.’Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianAt the root of the continuing division and violence is the vagueness of the truce. The “Trump peace plan” wasa list of 20 principles and aims, but with no sequence or sense of how one goal might follow another.“It is incredibly vague,” said Rohan Talbot, the director of advocacy and communications for the charity group Medical Aid for Palestinians. “Now we are in a moment when many different actors, obviously including the Israeli government, the Americans, the international community and humanitarian actors, are all vying to interpret and influence what comes next.“One of the guiding principles that we should appreciate from decades of grim experience is that anything temporary in occupied Palestinian territory very quickly becomes permanent.”Palestine rights group seeks prosecution of UK citizens who fought for IsraelRead moreThe status quo meanwhile leaves at least half of Gaza’s population unable to return home or even think about rebuilding. The hopes aroused by the ceasefireare fading fast.“Each time we try to get closer to home, we see new destruction, new bombardment, and new advances by military vehicles. The shelling from artillery, tanks, and drones hasn’t stopped, as if the war never ended,” said Salah Abu Salah, from Abasan al-Kabira in east Khan Younis, which is now on the “wrong” side of the yellow line.“I can’t help but fear that the army now intends to establish new borders that we will never be allowed to cross again.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The company said in a statement that it was increasingly hearing from workers “who want to cross the picket line” and “understand the value of our offer”.The five-year offer was largely the same as offers previously rejected by union members. The company reduced the ratification bonus but added $3,000 in Boeing shares that vest over three years and a $1,000 retention bonus in four years. It also improved wage growth for workers at the top of the pay scale in the fourth year of the contract.“The union’s statement is misleading since the vote failed by the slimmest of margins, 51% to 49%,” Boeing’s statement read. “We are turning our focus to executing the next phase of our contingency plan in support of our customers.”How are unions pushing back against Trump’s attacks on labor and layoffs?Read moreThe machinists’ union acknowledged the vote was close but said in a message to members that “very few” workers have crossed the picket line.“Our solidarity remains strong, and the company’s claim otherwise is wrong,” the union said.Union leaders have pressed the planemaker for higher retirement plan contributions and a ratification bonus closer to the $12,000 that Boeing gave to union memberson strikelast yearin the company’s commercial airplane division in the Pacific north-west. Boeing has argued that workers’ demands exceed the cost of living in the midwest.Ahead of Sunday’s vote, the union told its members that it did not recommend approval of the company’s latest offer, which it said “had no meaningful improvements” to retirement benefits and wage increases for workers with more seniority.“It’s well past time for Boeing to stop cheaping out on the workers who make its success possible and bargain a fair deal that respects their skill and sacrifice,” Bryant said.Negotiations escalated over the summer in the days leading up to the strike, with the workers rejecting an earlier proposed agreement that included a 20% wage hike over the life of the five-year contract.Boeing quickly countered with a modified agreement that didn’t boost the proposed pay raises but did remove a scheduling provision affecting the workers’ ability to earn overtime pay. Workers rejected that offer too and went on strike the next morning. They also voted against revised terms in September.The company has said that it was prepared for a strike, with a contingency plan in place “to ensure our non-striking workforce can continue supporting our customers”.Boeing Defense, Space & Security business accounts for more than one-third of the company’s revenue.

The restrictioncoveredmost of the southern California region and delays are likely when flights resume.By noon ET on Sunday, the agency had recorded shortfalls in air traffic controllers at six US airports.The Trump administration warned flight disruptions are expected to increase as the shutdown drags on.Duffytoldthe Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures program that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Saturday had 22 “triggers” that indicated shortages of air traffic controllers. He said that figure was “one of the highest that we’ve seen in the system” since 1 October.“That’s a sign that the controllers are wearing thin,” Duffy said.According toFlightAware, a flight tracking website, there were more than 5,300 US flight delays on Saturday and more than 2,500 by 12pm ET on Sunday. Since the shutdown began, delays have often been above average.According to the FAA, air traffic control staffing issues had already been reported on Sunday forChicagoand Newark flights.Through the shutdown of the federal government, around 13,000 air traffic controllers and about 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers must work without pay during the shutdown, as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked over passing a federal budget.“This shutdown has real consequences for these hard-working American patriots,” said Nick Daniels, President of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), in astatementlast week. “With each passing day, controllers become more distracted by the risk of receiving a zero-dollar paycheck on 28 October, despite working 40 hours per week and, in many cases, mandatory overtime due to the controller staffing shortage.”Air traffic controllers received a paycheck two weeks ago at around 90% of their regular pay, but Tuesday will mark their first fully unpaid pay period for work in October.Duffy noted air traffic controllers have been taking on second jobs to try to supplement the lost income.“They’re taking second jobs, they’re out there looking,” he said.The FAA is around 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels, which had many to work mandatory overtime and six-day weeks before the shutdown began.The shutdown also forced employees in training at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma to be sent home on 3 October.“It can take three to five years to fully train a technician,” said Dave Spero, President of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, AFL-CIO (Pass), which represents 11,000 employees at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Department of Defense. “Any lapse in training can push the clock back, as it did during the academy’s closure during the pandemic.”“For every day the government is shut down and employees in the aviation ecosystem are still furloughed, another layer of safety may be peeled away,” added Spero. “The furloughed employees want to be back on the job, all of the employees need to be paid and they want to start actively contributing to the modernization of the air traffic control system. We call on Congress to open the government as soon as possible.”In 2019, during a 35-day shutdown, absences by controllers and TSA officersincreasedthroughout the shutdown, resulting in extended wait times at some airport check points and forcing authorities to slow air traffic in New York and Washington DC.Explore more on these topicsUS newsWest CoastCaliforniaChicagoNew JerseyAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

He urged anyone with video from the scene or other information that could help the investigation to contact the FBI.Authorities weren’t sharing details about the victims, including their conditions or where the injured were being treated.The campus is about 50 miles (80km) south-west of Philadelphia. Chester county detectives are leading the investigation, with support from state police and the FBI.Saturday’s shooting is the latest in a disturbing trend of gun violence at homecoming games and celebrations across the nation this football season.On Friday,five people were shotnear Washington DC’s Howard University as the school celebrated homecoming weekend. Police later arrested two suspects and recovered three guns near the scene, and a statement from the university said a fight between the two individuals had resulted in gunfire.Six people dead with multiple injured in three shootings at Mississippi homecoming weekendsRead moreHoward University officials said in a statement that the violence was not affiliated with the school and no students, faculty or staff were involved.High school homecoming celebrations inMississippiwere interrupted by gun violence on 11 October whenthree separate shootingsresulted in six people being killed and 18 injured.The most fatal shooting took place in Leland, where four people died, according to John Lee, the mayor of the small city in western Mississippi’s Washington county. At least 16 were wounded in that incident, with four in critical condition airlifted to the state capital of Jackson and 12 others treated at local hospitals.Around 200 miles (320km) to the south-east, in Heidelberg, Mississippi, police said a shooting during the local school’s homecoming weekend left two people dead. Later there were reports that a third shooting occurred at South Delta high school in Rolling Fork, just 40 miles south of Leland in the Mississippi delta, where two people were injured.Late Saturday night, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro said in asocial media postthat he was briefed on the shooting and offered the support of his administration and family.“Join Lori and me in praying for the Lincoln University community,” he said.Lincoln University’s police chief, Marc Partee, said the shooting devastated the school’s community on what was supposed to be a joyous day focused on the school’s legacy.“If there was another word to describe that, that’s more impactful, I would use it,” he said, “but ‘devastated’ is a start.”Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaUS universitiesUS school shootingsGun crimeUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Texas – the only state with more commercial holders – has a rate almost 50% higher than California. Facts don’t lie.

The book, titled Retribution, cites Pence’s notes from the 6 January 2021 phone call with Trump, who was purportedly trying to shame his vice-president into refusing to certify Joe Biden’s victory weeks earlier in the White House.“If you do that, I made a big mistake five years ago,” Trump is said to have told Pence, who was his running mate when he won his first presidency in 2016. “You’ll go down as a wimp.”According to Retribution, before he ultimately fulfilled his duty of certifying Biden’s victory, Pence’s notes maintain that he told Trump both had taken “an oath to support + defend the constitution”.“It doesn’t take courage to break the law,” Pence’s notes portray him as saying to Trump. “It takes courage to uphold the law.”The notes cited in Retribution say Trump also reportedly told Pence, “You listen to the wrong people.”Pence has publicly said that he certified Biden’s victory, despite Trump’s wishes, because he knew he had no legal right to overturn Trump’s electoral defeat at the hands of Biden. That stand came as Trump and his allies brazenly pushed lies that electoral fraudsters had rigged the 2020 election in Biden’s favor, leading to his victory.A mob of Trump supporters eventually stormed the US Capitol, unsuccessfully demanding Pence’s hanging and delaying the joint congressional session certifying Biden’s victory by several hours.Federal authorities later charged Trump with working to forcibly reverse his defeat in the 2020 election ahead of the Capitol attack, though that prosecution was derailed when he won the 2024 presidential race. As Retribution pointed out, prosecutors considered Pence’s notes as key evidence of the hours before the attack.Prosecutors did convict or at least criminally charge more than 1,500 other people who were attributed roles in the January 6 attack, which a bipartisan US Senate committee linked to several deaths, including the suicides of law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol that day.Then in January, in one of Trump’s first acts back in the Oval Office after he defeated Kamala Harris – Biden’s vice-president – in the 2024 presidential election, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of all linked to the Capitol attack.JD Vancewas Trump’s running mate when the latter man won his second presidency and summarily ignited warnings about the US’s “trajectory” toward authoritarian rule, according to anassessmentfrom former intelligence and national security officials. Pence did not pursue public office during that election cycle.The Retribution excerpt arrived days afterSteve Bannon, who was chief White House strategist during Trump’s first presidency, said in an interview with the Economist that he predicted Trump would get “a third term” in 2028 despite being barred by the US constitution.“People ought to just get accommodated with that,” said Bannon, whotouteda “plan” purportedly to be laid out later that would circumvent the constitutional amendment limiting US presidents to two terms.Bannon’s comments echoed those of others aligned with Trump, along with the president himself, who has previously madethreatsabout their being “methods” – and possibly even unspecified “plans” – to keep him in office no matter the constitution.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMike PenceUS Capitol attackUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

An economist on how a workforce built for men has failed womenIn her new book Having it All, Corinne Low outlines how stubborn expectations around work and home fail to accommodate working womenLauren Arataniin New YorkSun 26 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 07.01 EDTShareWhen Corinne Low gave birth to her son in 2017, everything seemed to be lining up. A tenure-track economist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, she was working in a career she had long dreamed of. Her husband, stepchild and baby lived in New York City and the two-hour commute to Philadelphia was inconvenient but sustainable. She was embarking on a journey to do it all: a working mom, supporting her family with a career she loved.As track repairs tripled her commute time, things suddenly felt like they were falling apart. Instead of getting home in time to put her baby son to bed, Low found herself sobbing while breast pumping in an Amtrak bathroom.As an economist, Low searched for a more precise term to describe how she and other working moms often find themselves stretched for time and energy. She came up with “the squeeze”, and it’s backed by data that shows how women often get burnt out trying to manage competing demands at home and work, especially when they are parenting young children.Childcare is a hellscape for most US families. Why isn’t there a bigger push for change?Read moreLow has spent much of her career as an economist trying to understand how women navigate a modern world that has prioritized the careers of men. In her new book,Having It All:What Data Tells Us About Women’s Lives and How to Get the Most Out of Yours, Low outlines how structures around women’s work and home lives fail to truly accommodate working women.Low calls the book a “love letter to women”, an effort to let women know that society has so often made them feel like something is wrong withtheminstead of the system. Much of the book is dedicated to offering advice on how women can figure out what “having it all” means to them in the face of stubborn expectations around work and home.In an interview with the Guardian, Low said the book encompasses how women are “economic agents” just like men. They make rational decisions to optimize outcomes. As obvious as this may seem, the field has tended to discount women’s economic contributions.“When we think about the fact that women spend, on average, more time outside the labor force and spend more time with children, we’re like: ‘Oh, well the gender wage gap is because women have different preferences, and this is their choices’,” Low said. But women aren’t “just having these feelings and preferences that are perpendicular to economic realities”.Historically, the work women did at home was drastically undervalued compared to the salaries that their husbands earned. Low and other economists have pointed out that “home production” – childcare, laundry, cleaning and cooking – is a full-time job.When a woman specialized in home production, it meant that her husband could fully focus on his career and earn a salary that could support the entire family. On the surface, it appears to make sense. Two people for two full-time jobs.But economists have noted that this setup only works when the relationship remains intact. It’s no coincidence, Low points out, that women entered the workforce right as unilateral divorce laws were introducedin the US in the 1970s, and getting a divorce became easier in most states. Low cites a paper that traces the connection between these divorce laws and rising college graduation rates for women and is aptlytitledDegrees Are Forever.“Men could walk away from their marriages, taking their paycheck with them,” Low writes. “Wives could have spent years investing in home production and easing the path of someone else’s career that they now couldn’t benefit from.”Low notes that poorer women and women of color have always been working because their households could not afford only one person with a job. Being a stay-at-home mother, for a time, was actually seen as a privilege.But, among other factors, the possibility of divorce pushed women to develop their own “human capital”, a term used to describe the skills and expertise a person has to earn an income, which allowed for economic freedom in case something went wrong in their relationship.There were a few catches. First, just as women were starting to make their way into the workplace, expectations around parenting started to become more intensive. Instead of outsourcing breastfeeding to powdered formula and meals to microwave TV dinners, parents were expected to be present with their children.But while data shows that many women are now earning just as much, or sometimes even more, than their partners, the time men spend on home production hasn’t budged.“If you understand women entering the labor force as a gender revolution that came in and changed our attitudes about women’s role in society, then of course, men’s role would change, too,” Low said. But “there was no force acting on men requiring them to do something different.”Instead, much of the societal focus has been about how women can adapt to workplaces that were built and designed for men, rather than encouraging men to take on home production tasks, especially things like childcare or cleaning a home. While men fix windows and mow the lawn, these “exterior maintenance” tasks take less time than the tasks more often done by women.Books like Lean In by former Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg’s and Sophia Amoruso’s #Girlboss in the early 2010s ushered in a new era where women were told to take up space in the workplace and show their male colleagues they can keep up and work harder.The consequences of this have manifested in what appears to be the modern “feminist” movementagainstwork – a backlash, Low said, to the “girl boss” era.Low argues that the advice of Sandberg and co falls short. “It ignores the structural realities that put the onus on women,” she said. “It’s rational to say well, because the structural barriers are standing in my way, maybe I don’t feel like pursuing a career where I’m going to feel like I’m … a battering ram against these structural forces.”Where the Lean In ideology can ignore gender differences, under the guise of achieving equality, Low writes that some gender differences are important to acknowledge. When she was pregnant with her son, three of her male colleagues’ wives were also pregnant. “I bitterly clocked the ways in which our investments in this miracle of creation diverged,” she writes. “Whereas I was exhausted all the time and often bent over a toilet with morning sickness, they were merrily skipping (so it seemed to me) down the office halls.”The ongoing gender divide has seeped into the dating sphere, where women often complain about how men on dating apps are uncommitted and balk at the idea of non-casual dating. Low notes that women who want kids are on a much more constrained timeline than men, amping up the pressure of dating just as they are supposed to be building up careers.Because the girl boss era didn’t resonate with all women, Low worries that in defiance to the massive effort it takes to fight the headwinds, women have started to believe they would be happier not working at all. The so-called “tradwife” movement has taken hold of many spaces on social media, where couples romanticize traditional gender roles. Women become unburdened by careers, while men can focus on their work.But Low said there may be a sense of “amnesia” about how bad the arrangement was for women.Women were once warned by their mothers about the impact of divorce on women without an independent source of income. “That generation went to school at high rates. But the generation coming up under me did not get that message. The message they’re getting is: ‘Your moms are really stressed out. Wouldn’t it be nice to not be so stressed out?’” she said. “I don’t think they have the historical context to understand how risky that is. You are not protected, divorce laws have changed.”So, where does this leave women? Low’s solutions are two-fold. First, there needs to be societal changes that address the ongoing gender gaps at work and at home. For example, the US does not have a federal mandate for employers to offer paid maternity leave. When a government does not require companies to offer paid maternity leave, it can actually disincentivize companies from hiring women.But societal changes take time. Instead of happiness, the elusive goal of so many advice books, Low suggests women start thinking about their unique “personal utility function” – the sum total of what makes their life full and content that may look very different from what’s promoted on social media.“You have 24 hours in a day, being the Instagrammable tradwife or being Sheryl Sandberg are two separate full-time jobs,” Low said. “You cannot do those two together, but you can have elements of both of those – it is not all or nothing,”Low insists balance is possible, but it requires some forward thinking – and some tough conversations with partners.‘Too loud’, ‘too messy’, ‘too much’ … why should women be expected to shrink and shut up?Read moreAfter her time in “the squeeze”, which was exacerbated by Covid-19 shutdowns, Low divorced her husband and moved to Philadelphia, where the lower cost of living allowed her to hire an au pair. With more time to focus on her work, Low was eventually able to get tenure, which eventually led to a better work-life balance.“I do have a career, but I also like spending time with my kids,” Low said. “I try to be a very involved mom.”For some women, things may look different. In the book, she cites women who have made all sorts of choices that ended up working for them because they were intentional, grounded in their own unique set of values.“You’re not failing and you’re not bad at this. Thisisthat hard, itisdifficult.” Low said. “Once you have the tools to make those decisions with data and information, then whatever you choose is okay. There’s no wrong way to navigate the life that you choose and that works for you.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersEconomicsWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)Parents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And does your boss have any right to ask?According to arecent story in the New York Post,one manager warned workers of the company’s “five-minute rule” which required work-from-home employees to “notify the team” if they stepped away from their desk for any reason, including to use the bathroom.“This helps us stay aligned and ensures nothing is missed. Thank you for your co-operation,” the manager said in an email shared online by an irate worker. Not surprisingly, this policy did not go over very well with some.“5 min?” one commenter wrote. “Are you saving lives through that keyboard?”Other comments on the post ranged from “This is crazy” to “Oh I’d be so gone.”AI tools churn out ‘workslop’ for many US employees lowering trust | Gene MarksRead moreOf course, this manager’s demand is outrageous. No one can do anything – let alone relieve themselves – in under five minutes. Asking work-from-home employees to “notify the team” whenever they need to step away from their desks is completely unreasonable. However, the incident highlights what I’m observing among many of my clients who are trying to determine the best way to implement work-from-home policies.For employers – particularly small business owners,most of whom areover the age of 50 – working from home is often a tough concept to swallow. I’ve seen a number of these owners resist these policies because they don’t believe that their employees are as productive at home as they are in the office. And it’s not just a small business thing. Many corporate CEOs – fromJPMorgan Chase’s Jamie DimontoAmazon’s Andy Jassy– have been outspoken in their position that workers get more work done when they’re in the office.They may be wrong, they may be right. Over the past few years we’ve seensome studiesthat say workers do get more done when working remotely. Just as many reportsconclude the opposite. Clearly, we’re still too close to the pandemic and to this kind of working arrangement to truly know what’s best for businesses. More time and data are needed. In the meantime, employers – like the manager above – oftentimes go overboard when supervising employees that they can’t see in the office. We still haven’t figured this out.Most, however, are trying. That’s because they understand that working from home can be liberating for many of those employees. It gives them balance, more freedom and more flexibility, especially if they’re caring for others. But for this type of arrangement to be successful, both employers and employees need to meet somewhere in the middle.For employees, it must be understood that being allowed to work from home is a benefit not unlike health insurance and retirement. It needs to be earned and rules need to be followed. Five-minute bathroom breaks are, of course, ridiculous. But it’s not unreasonable for a manager to expect that their remote team member is as accessible as they are when they’re in the office and that they’re getting their jobs done, whatever and whenever that requires.Employees need to understand that their employers are rightly suspicious if their remote working days fall on a Monday or Friday. They need to understand that their company’s IT team will need access to their devices in order to ensure security. They need to dress professionally, make sure the dog is fed and that their kids are being watched.Employers also have to meet their workers halfway. Stop the micromanagement and don’t get monitoring software. Understand that even if they were in the office, you can’t keep tabs on someone all the time. After all, they may be taking a bathroom break!Explore more on these topicsUS small businessWorking from homeUS work & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

He sought help from fans of the Jets and Ohio State, where he was a star in college.“In 2006, I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that has led to chronic kidney disease. After a rough summer, I’m undergoing dialysis as we look for a kidney transplant,” he wrote at the time. “I always knew this day would come, but I thought I would have had more time.“Unfortunately, I do not have any family able to donate at this time, so this is why I’m reaching out to you, our NY Jets and Ohio State communities. I am in need of a kidney donor with type O blood.”Mangold was a first-round pick out of Ohio State for the Jets in 2006. He spent his entireNFLcareer with team, earning seven trips to the Pro Bowl and was an All-Pro twice before he retired in 2016. During that time, the center anchored an offensive line alongside D’Brickashaw Ferguson that helped the Jets reach two AFC championship games. He is currently a nominee for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Mangold’s toughness was widely admired and he missed only four games in his first 10 seasons in the NFL.“Nick was more than a legendary center,” Jets owner Woody Johnson said in a statement. “He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick’s wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.”Mangold was a huge favorite with fans, known for his long hair, beard, charitable work and outgoing personality. He was active on social media and was rarely seen without his backwards baseball cap. He was a regular visitor to Jets game after his retirement – he chugged a beer while being inducted into the team’s Ring of Honor in 2022 – and stayed in the area when his playing days were over, becoming an assistant coach for Delbarton High School in Morristown, New Jersey.“You get to mold boys into men and teach the game of football, but also teach them a little bit about life as you go along,” Mangold told the New York Post in 2024.Rex Ryan, who coached Mangold at the Jets, was in tears as he remembered his former player on ESPN’s Sunday NFL Countdown. “It’s brutal,” Ryan said. “Such a great young man. I had the pleasure of coaching him for all six years with the Jets [from 2009 to 2014]. I remember it was obvious I was getting fired, my last game, Mangold’s injured – like, injured – and he comes to me and says, ‘I’m playing this game.’ And he wanted to play for me.”Hall of fame cornerback Darrelle Revis, who was Mangold’s teammate for eight years, paid tribute on X. “I was fortunate to have the opportunity to lace them up with you every Sunday,” Revis wrote. “I will miss you and forever cherish our moments in the locker room. Love you buddy.”Mangold was married to his childhood sweetheart, Jenny, with whom he had four children, Matthew, Eloise, Thomas, and Charlotte. His sister, Holley, represented USA at the 2012 Olympics in weightlifting.When he announced his illness he paid tribute to his family, saying they had “been my rock every step of the way. This situation has reminded me how lucky I am to have such an amazing family, friends, and community behind me.”Explore more on these topicsNew York JetsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

His victory at the Mexico City Grand Prix with a consummate drive from pole to flag has catapulted him into the lead of an intense title fight at exactly the right moment. Norris has momentum at the very point the championship enters its decisive phase.With his title rivals Oscar Piastri – Norris’s McLaren teammate – managing only fifth and Red Bull’sMax Verstappenthird at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Norris has the edge at a crucial juncture with four meetings remaining. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finished in second, while Britain’s Oliver Bearman took a career-best fourth place with a superb drive for Haas.‘I could have killed them’: Lawson’s fury after narrowly missing hitting marshalsRead moreFor Norris, dominant and unchallenged from the moment he held the lead through turn one, this was a huge result – the first time he has held the lead of the championship since before the Saudi Arabian GP in April. After Piastrimoved ahead in Jeddah, the Australian has maintained a grip on the front but Norris has made his comeback at an enormously significant moment.Norris now leads Piastri by one point with Verstappen in third, 36 behind. The twoMcLarenteammates lead the charge then but the defending champion is still very much in the game and all three are likely to take the title to the wire in the season finale at Abu Dhabi.It represents a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for Norris, who had been left disconsolate after he endured a mechanical failureat the Dutch GPin August. The DNF dropped the 25-year-old driver to 34 points behind Piastri, at which stage Verstappen was 104 points in arrears and the Australian appeared to hold all the cards.F1 driver standingsNorris said after the race at Zandvoort that he would likely have to throw caution to the wind in order to catch his teammate and it appeared a reasonable stance. However, what followed was a controlled and measured response that has proved hugely effective.“Zandvoort is still very clear in my head,” he said. “You forget about that as much as you can and you just focus on every race coming up. This has easily been my best performance but there’s still a long way to go. I just have to keep doing what I’m doing, keep trying to be consistent against some very quick guys around me and I think that’ll be good.”As Verstappen andRed Bullfound their form with a series of upgrades, Norris kept his head down and returned a string of solid podium finishes, marred only by a costly poor qualifying in Baku. He was assisted in no little part by Piastri experiencing his worst form of the year after having been on the podium for every race bar one between the second meeting of the season and Monza.View image in fullscreenOliver Bearman finished in a career-best fourth place at the Mexico City GP.Photograph: Héctor Vivas/Getty ImagesPiastri made a false start in Baku and then crashed out with an unforced error, could manage only fourth in Singapore and fifth in Austin. A similarly lacklustre weekend in Mexico has led to his lead being erased. Poor qualifying was costly and starting in seventh he found himself mired in a midfield struggle from which he could make little impact.With 116 points still on the table, where the two McLaren drivers stand in relation to each other could yet become a decisive differentiator.The team principal, Andrea Stella, has said they would prioritise one driver should it be required to ensure they seal their first drivers’ championship since 2008. If Verstappen makes further inroads in the forthcoming rounds and the team choose to head off the threat, they will favour the pedaller in front. Having the lead in these late stages then is, potentially, more important than ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He held his lead in a breathtaking run on the drag to turn one as the leaders went three abreast, and within several laps he had opened a seven-second gap from which, in clean air, he was relentless to the flag.Piastri had a shocking start, however, dropping amid the jostling down the straight from seventh to 10th. He had to fight back across the remaining 70 laps and did well to make it to fifth, including a decisive move on George Russell on lap 61. But it was at best damage limitation of the form he can no longer afford.Verstappen, too, eked out the maximum from fifth on the grid, on a counter strategy. Indeed he might have taken second at the death but for a virtual safety car being called on the penultimate lap. Nonetheless with the Red Bull not at its best in Mexico he considered he had extracted all he could.Quick GuideMexico City GP resultsShow1Lando Norris(GB) McLaren1hr 37min 58.574sec2Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrari+30.324s3Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull+31.0494Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F1+40.9555Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren+42.0656Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedes GP+47.8377George Russell(GB) Mercedes GP+50.2878Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrari+56.4469Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas F1+1min 15.464sec10Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Kick Sauber +1:16.86311Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull +1:19.04812Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams+1 lap13Isack Hadjar(Fr) Racing Bulls+1 lap14Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin+1 lap15Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpine+1 lap16Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine+1 lapNot classified:Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams (lap 67),Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martin (lap 34),Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauber (lap 25),Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bulls (lap 5)Fastest lap:George Russell1:20.052 on lap 50Drivers' standings:1Lando Norris357pts, 2Oscar Piastri356, 3Max Verstappen321, 4George Russell258, 5Charles Leclerc210, 6Lewis Hamilton146, 7Kimi Antonelli97, 8Alexander Albon73, 9Nico Hülkenberg41, 10Isack Hadjar39, 11Carlos Sainz Jr38, 12Fernando Alonso37, 13Oliver Bearman32, 14Lance Stroll32, 15Liam Lawson30, 16Esteban Ocon30, 17Yuki Tsunoda28, 18Pierre Gasly20, 19Gabriel Bortoleto19, 20Franco Colapinto0, 21Jack Doohan0Constructors' standings:1McLaren713pts (champions), 2Ferrari356, 3Mercedes355, 4Red Bull346, 5Williams111, 6Racing Bulls72, 7Aston Martin69, 8Haas62, 9Sauber60, 10Alpine20Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For McLaren, to defeat Verstappen so comprehensively will give them encouragement that their car still has an advantage in certain conditions. On a surface which punished the rubber the ease with which their car handles its tyres, an area where they have excelled this season, once more proved to be vital. Norris was able to push the car harder and faster and will feel his tilt at the title is now well and truly on, while his teammate is left wondering how the lead he held for 15 rounds has slipped from his grasp within sight of the finishing line.Lewis Hamilton might have been fighting for his first podium with Ferrari but for a 10sec penalty for gaining an advantage by leaving the track when competing with Verstappen and he finished in eighth.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

Hall finished with 18 carries for 133 yards. The Jets (1-7), who trailed 31-16 after three quarters, rolled to 502 yards of offense in their highest scoring game of the season, including a season-high 254 on the ground. Joe Flacco passed for two touchdowns and rushed for a one-yard score, but the Bengals (3-5) lost for the fifth time in six games. Ja’Marr Chase had 12 catches for 91 yards in his third consecutive game with double-digit receptions.New York Giants 20–38 Philadelphia EaglesSaquon Barkley ran for a 65-yard score on his first carry of the game and topped 100 yards rushing for the first time this season in the Philadelphia Eagles’ victory over theNew York Giants(2-6). Barkley finished with 150 yards rushing and caught one of Jalen Hurts’ four touchdown passes before he left the game with a groin injury. The Eagles (6-2) evened the season series against their division rivals. The Giants’ run at their first season sweep of the Eagles since 2007 and first win at Philadelphia since 2013 suffered a serious blow when rookie Cam Skattebo suffered a dislocated ankle and was taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Skattebo was carted off the field after he took a hard hit over the middle and went down. His foot appeared to twist backward, and players from both teams huddled around the standout running back until he was taken off the field.Dallas Cowboys 24–44 Denver BroncosBo Nix threw for four touchdowns, rookie RJ Harvey scored three times and the Denver Broncos routed the Dallas Cowboys. The Broncos (6-2) have won five straight overall and nine in a row at home. That’s the longest home winning streak in theNFL. JK Dobbins ran for 111 yards on 15 carries and the Broncos also got big performances from rookies Pat Bryant and Jahdae Barron. Bryant scored his first touchdown and Barron picked off Dak Prescott for his first career interception. The Cowboys (3-4-1) got two touchdown runs from former Broncos running back Javonte Williams.Chicago Bears 16–30 Baltimore RavensDerrick Henry ran for two touchdowns, Tyler Huntley made a big third-down throw late in the fourth quarter and the Baltimore Ravens finally won without Lamar Jackson. The Ravens snapped a four-game skid and ended Chicago’s four-game winning streak. The Bears (4-3) dominated the first quarter but managed only two field goals in that period and didn’t score again until the fourth. Although Jackson returned to practice this week, he was ruled out Saturday for a third straight game because of a hamstring injury. The Ravens (2-5) had lost 11 of their previous 13 when their star quarterback didn’t play.Buffalo Bills 40–9 Carolina PanthersEverybody hates Russ: how the NFL’s nicest guy became its most resented | Andrew LawrenceRead moreJames Cook ran for a career-high 216 yards and two touchdowns, Josh Allen accounted for three touchdowns and the Buffalo Bills (5-2) returned from their bye with a resounding win over the Carolina Panthers (4-4). Allen improved to 8-0 following the bye week and established an NFL record by becoming the first player to run and throw for a touchdown in 46 games, breaking the mark previously held by former Panthers QB Cam Newton. Allen’s 77 career rushing touchdowns (including playoff games) tied Newton for the most all-time. Cook had touchdown runs of 64 and 21 yards.Cleveland Browns 13–32 New England PatriotsDrake Maye passed for three touchdowns as the New England Patriots extended their winning streak to five games by beating the Cleveland Browns.Maye completed 18 of his 24 pass attempts for 282 yards. He was intercepted once. Each of his three TD passes came in the third quarter. The Patriots (6-2) were helped by three field goals from Andy Borregales. Cleveland (2-6) defensive end Myles Garrett recorded a franchise-record five sacks in the loss. Garrett passed Reggie White and set the NFL record for career sacks by a player under the age of 30 with his first sack in the game. Garrett has 10 sacks this season and 112.5 for his career. Cleveland’s Dillon Gabriel was 21 of 35 for 156 yards. He threw two touchdowns and was intercepted twice.Tennessee Titans 14–38 Indianapolis ColtsJonathan Taylor rushed for two touchdowns and caught another in a milestone game, and Daniel Jones threw for two more scores to help the Indianapolis Colts (7-1) continue their surprising start with a rout over Tennessee (1-7). Taylor also scored three TDs against the Titans in each of their previous two meetings, making him the first player in league history to have three touchdowns in three consecutive games against the same team. He finished with 12 carries for 153 yards, the fourth 100-yard game this season for the league’s rushing leader.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23–3 New Orleans SaintsTampa Bay edge rusher Anthony Nelson had an interception for a touchdown to go with a forced fumble and two sacks, Sean Tucker ran for a one-yard touchdown on fourth down and the Buccaneers (6-2) beat the hapless New Orleans Saints. Antoine Winfield Jr recovered a fumble and intercepted a pass for the Buccaneers, who forced four turnovers and also played a role in forcing Saints second-year quarterback Spencer Rattler out of the game. First-year Saints coach Kellen Moore inserted rookie QB Tyler Shough late in the third quarter. But the switch did little to improve matters for New Orleans, now tied for the worst record in the NFL with the New York Jets and Tennessee at 1-7.Miami Dolphins 34–10 Atlanta FalconsTua Tagovailoa threw a season-high four touchdown passes and the Miami Dolphins ended their three-game losing streak by dominating the short-handed Atlanta Falcons. The Dolphins (2-6) held the Falcons (3-4) to 213 yards. Tagovailoa completed 20 of 26 passes for 205 yards with scoring passes to De’Von Achane, Malik Washington, Jaylen Waddle and Ollie Gordon II. The Falcons were without quarterback Michael Penix Jr, top wide receiver Drake London and sacks leader Zach Harrison, among others, due to injuries. Atlanta veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins made his first start of the season. Bijan Robinson was held to 25 rushing yards.San Francisco 49ers 15–26 Houston TexansCJ Stroud threw for a season-high 318 yards with two touchdowns and the Houston Texans got off to a quick start and held on for victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Stroud completed passes to nine different players with star receiver Nico Collins out after sustaining a concussion Monday night. Xavier Hutchinson led the group with 69 yards receiving and a score to help the 3-4 Texans bounce back after a loss to Seattle. Mac Jones had trouble getting San Francisco’s offense going. He threw for 193 yards and two touchdowns in his fourth straight game and sixth this season filling in for the injured Brock Purdy. The Niners fell to 5-3.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsNew York GiantsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a big opportunity as well, with the things that happened during the weekend.Arsenal move four points clear at top as Eze strike sees off Crystal PalaceRead more“But I knew we were playing against a team who have, in my opinion, been one of the best in terms of organisation and how frustrated they can make you. The moment you lose concentration they will punish you.”Manchester City, aftera 1-0 loss at Aston Villaon Sunday, find themselves six points behind Arsenal. Arteta was keen, however, to pour cold water on any title talk. “We are where we are,” he said. “It’s a credit to us, because we’ve been very, very consistent knowing the difficulty of every match as well. It is early and doesn’t mean anything other than, ‘let’s keep doing a lot of things like we’re doing really well.’ But there are things to improve to give us better margins.”Eze’s goal was his first in the Premier League since joining from Crystal Palace for £67.5m in August. “He did it very similarly last year, but against us,” Arteta said smiling. “We know against a team that defends with so many bodies, doesn’t allow any space, you have to generate chaos or open spaces to generate big chances. He took the goal really well.”Arteta could not confirm the extent of the injuries that forced off William Saliba and Declan Rice. The substitute Gabriel Martinelli was also “a bit uncomfortable” by the end.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So long. This is my experience. There are many teams there and we have a good test against Bournemouth [next weekend], who are doing very well. We will try to do our game.“I was worried before the [September] international break when we were 14th in the table and they were seven or eight points in front. Our job is not to look at the table. If they win all their games and win the Premier League, congratulations to them, that’s all we can do. But I have the feeling the team is alive, the team is good.”Guardiola, whose side travel to Swansea in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday night, added: “I don’t know how many teams can come here and play the way we played, with the courage, possession and chances. We have to be stable with that. I don’t live in October and November thinking: ‘Oh what is going to happen if we don’t win the Premier League?’ So it’s game by game now.”City lost at Villa for the third successive season asErling Haaland, who has 11 league goals this season, failed to score for the first time in 13 matches. Guardiola pointed to the quality of Unai Emery’s side. “They are a Champions League team – unfortunately they are not there this season – but they are a top, top team and compete very well,” he said. “I admire them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here was one last chance to salvage something, theBarcelonamidfielder somehow hauling himself up the pitch in search of a final twist; instead, as he reached the other end, a tired touch and a desperate lunge saw him take out Aurélien Tchouaméni – the world upside down – and get sent off. And so theclásicowas over, bar the shouting and the pushing.There was plenty of that, players squaring up then and again when the final whistle went a few seconds later, Thibaut Courtois and Lamine Yamal confronting each other; so too Vinícius Júnior, who had stormed off when he was substituted, and Raphinha, who had not even played.Real Madrid 2-1 Barcelona: La Liga – live reactionRead moreIn the midst of it all, Madrid celebrated. The match that never lets you down was 105 minutes long and featured 37 shots, three goals scored, three more disallowed, a penalty given and taken away again and another saved. It also had a new winner, Madrid beating Barcelona fiveclásicoslater.First-half goals from Kylian Mbappé and Jude Bellingham brought revenge and maybe even some redemption afterfour defeats last season, Fermín López scoring for Barcelona. For 70 minutes, it had been frantic, players pouring through wide spaces from one end to the other; then Madrid had found a way to cede territory but not control, holding on to the lead they established early and might have established even earlier.When they scored the first of the day’s three goals, it was the third time this stadium had erupted; the difference, 20 minutes into a wild, noisy first half, was that the celebrations were not cut short by the video assistant referee.They had been playing just a minute and 57 seconds when César Soto Grado pointed to the spot, only to be called to the screen where he saw that it had, in fact, been Vinícius Júnior, running into the area and swiping at a shot, who had made contact with Lamine Yamal, not the other way round.Less than 10 minutes after that, Mbappé sent a superb shot flying beyond Wojciech Szczesny and into the net. Again, though, the replay rescued Barcelona, the Frenchman was fractionally offside.The tone was set for a match in which the best chances, of which there were many, came when Madrid were able to run, which they did often. Barcelona were unable to exercise the control they have become accustomed to. Uncomfortable when they were pushed back, nor did they look secure stepping up, the space behind them opening: the timing of their line is not what it once was, nor is the pressure applied on the passer.When the breakthrough came, when the line was breached, it was Bellingham who did it. Turning superbly away from Pedri, he slotted through for Mbappé to score.View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Pedri was sent off in the 10th minute of stoppage time.Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty ImagesA storm had started: Bellingham’s shot was deflected wide, Federico Valverde struck over, Mbappé was stopped by Szczesny, Álvaro Carreras was too, and Eric García had to slide in to stop Mbappé racing clear once more. All that inside nine minutes. Next came another opportunity for Vinícius Júnior and one for Bellingham, both saved by Szczesny.Yet Barcelona suddenly had a great chance – Ferran Torres’s shot was weak from near the penalty spot – and then the equaliser. Under pressure, Arda Guler lost it and Pedri, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Balde and Rashford again set up López to finish.It was Rashford’s seventh assist inblaugranabut it was not sufficient. Madrid led again when Vinícius Júnior beat Jules Koundé and played a long, looping cross, which was headed back across by Éder Militão. Waiting by the line to score was Bellingham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First, he put the ball in the net from close range just before the break but was offside. Then, García handled early in the second half but his penalty was saved superbly by Szczesny’s flashing right hand.The game was not showing any sign of slowing, the spaces still wide, and at the other end López wasted another collective stampede when he chose to go it alone and curled a shot straight at Courtois.Madrid though would not relinquish their lead, some of the frenzy finally slipping from the match as it went into the final quarter of an hour. Bit by bit, Barcelona got the ball but Xabi Alonso’s side waited, contained and continued to break. They, in fact, threatened more than the visitors did.Brahim Díaz, on for Guler, set up Bellingham to find the net, but the flag was up again. Mbappé had two chances to run, one stopped by Ronald Araújo and the other pulled wide.Still there was more: Koundé was unable to control a glorious ball from Lamine Yamal, which might have levelled it, Rodrygo was denied twice by Szczesny and then, with heavy legs, Pedri went off on that last run.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé celebrates putting Real Madrid 1-0 up against Barcelona.Photograph: Bernat Armangué/APExplore more on these topicsLa LigaReal MadridBarcelonaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Three headed goals condemned Everton to a first defeat at their new home and elevated Spurs to third in thePremier League. A ­correction of their home form and Frank’s team can contemplate ­staying up there.The disconnect at Tottenham ­Hotspur ­Stadium stands in stark contrast to the ruthless efficiency and resilience of Spurs away from home. Victory on the banks of the River ­Mersey made it 13 points from a possible 15 on the road. The outstanding Micky van de Ven led the way.Captain in the absence of Cristian Romero, the Spurs defender made it five goals in 13 appearances this season by converting two first-half corners. The substitute Pape Matar Sarr banished any prospect of anEvertonrecovery with another close-range header in the 89th minute. Given the glaring absence of a quality striker in David Moyes’s squad, the prospect of an Everton comeback always appeared remote despite the intelligent probings of Iliman Ndiaye, James Garner, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish.View image in fullscreenPape Matar Sarr heads home Tottenham’s third goal from close range.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“Going here to Everton, a very good team and unbeaten here so far, and winning 3-0 away is a very good result,” said Frank. “I’m very happy with the set pieces and the clean-sheet mentality is a good foundation. We need to do more but it is an inexperienced Champions League squad so to go every three or four days and keep the energy and focus showed a lot about the mentality.”The contest was shaped by corners and Van de Ven’s domineering presence at both ends of the pitch. Everton matched Spurs for enterprising approach work but had no answer to the quality of the visitors’ set-piece delivery or their captain’s aerial strength. The boos that greeted the half-time whistle were aimed squarely at the referee, Craig ­Pawson, however.Everton v Tottenham: Premier League – live updatesRead moreGrealish almost started where he left off last time out at Hill Dickinson Stadium by putting Everton ahead. The impressive Ndiaye scorched past Djed Spence to set up Beto but, after the hapless centre-forward failed to connect, Grealish arrived at the back post and saw a goal-bound drive blocked in front of the line by Pedro Porro.Rodrigo Bentancur and Xavi Simons both troubled the Everton defence as an open, flowing game allowed the respective midfields to impress. But it was a central defender who took centre stage. From a Mohammed Kudus corner swept high to the back post, ­Bentancur directed the ball back across goal with his shoulder for Van de Ven to nod in from a yard out.It was the first goal Everton have conceded from a set piece all season. A second followed in first-half stoppage time when the visitors’ accuracy punished Moyes’s team again. Porro was the provider, this time from the left with a brilliant, vicious corner that demanded a finish. Van de Ven applied it once the inswinging ­delivery sailed over James Tarkowski and before Jordan Pickford’s fists could connect.The defender’s two first-half headers must have come from a combined distance of two yards out. “I told him at the start of the season he should be scoring more goals with his head,” said Frank of Van de Ven, who did not score once for Spurs last season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Everton defender thought he had equalised from a Dewsbury-Hall corner, and a header that gave Guglielmo Vicario no chance in the Spurs’ goal. Everton celebrations were diluted when the video assistant referee sent Pawson to the pitch-side monitor. They were spoiled completely when the match official deemed that Ndiaye and ­Grealish were both offside and interfering with Vicario. The pair were clearly in offside positions when O’Brien connected but the extent to which they interfered with the goalkeeper was debatable. Pawson’s on-field explanation was inaudible amid the jeers.Moyes had no complaints. “I think the goal we got chalked off for offside was the correct decision,” said the Everton manager. “We have been undone by set pieces. I’m not happy about it but overall there were some positives to the performance.”Everton responded well to the blows, particularly after the restart when Vicario’s superb reflexes were required to preserve a clean sheet from a Beto overhead kick. But the hosts were exposed late on when the former Everton striker Richarlison cushioned a header from Porro’s delivery back across goal for Sarr to convert beyond Pickford.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The home team’s win means the champions have lost back‑to‑back league games and taken only 17 points from a possible 27 in their latest title defence.Rodgers denied he has lost appetite for the battle. “I’ve never worked harder in all my time here,” theCelticmanager said. “So the motivation is there to try and flip the levels that we’re at. It’s absolutely fine, it’s still so early. I think that’s the key point in it all.Hearts move eight points clear at top after Shankland spot-kick sees off CelticRead more“Hearts have made a fantastic start, got the points on the board, but there’s so much football to play. We’ve just got to hang in there at this moment, find those performances, find the results and hopefully our levels will improve as the season goes on.”Rodgers did admit he faced a challenge in changing the mentality of his squad. “We have to fill the players with confidence,” he said. “The context of today is obviously disappointing in the game and the result. But there are 29 games left.”Derek McInnes again played down the prospect of a first championship flag at Tynecastle since 1960. No team other than Celtic or Rangers has won the league since Alex Ferguson’s Aberdeen in 1985.“Celtic spend millions and they pay millions in wages, a lot more than we can ever do,” the Hearts manager said. “They, hands down, have got so many advantages over every other team in the league at the minute including ourselves. But we do feel as if there’s improvement in us.“There is a long way to go. If this was after the second round of games and we were sitting in the position then it might be a wee bit more difficult for me to sit here and say what I’m saying.

I understand the frustration, when you are there in 90 minutes trying to help the team and the team gave everything on the pitch to win, but in the end you concede a goal.“What I must say to them is if we fight with them, united, we can win games. We can compete and achieve our targets. If not, without them, it’s impossible. It’s normal in football: if we win two or three games in a row, everything changes. Two months ago they sing my name because of the work we did last season [that meant] we are competing in the ­Premier League and not in the ­Championship. Now without results – it’s football – now they sing my name maybe to sack me.View image in fullscreenMarshall Munetsi scores a header past Martin Dubravka at half-time.Photograph: Godfrey Pitt/Action Plus/Shutterstock“At the end of this game, if I am a supporter, I feel proud of my team. The players showed a mentality, the ambition, the spirit to win the game. Even losing 2-0 we scored two goals, and in the second half we deserved to score more goals.”In 2013 there was a pitch invasion of home supporters here, calling for the then owner Steve Morgan to leave, when defeat by Burnley sent Wolves tumbling towards the third tier of English football. This time, it was Burnley staff and substitutes sprinting on to the pitch to celebrate Foster’s last-gasp goal, after a fine pass from his fellow substitute ­Hannibal Mejri invited a winner that looked unlikely as Wolves dominated the second half.Burnley set up this second succes­sive victory, their first away win of the season, with two goals from Zian Flemming in the opening half‑hour. Scott Parker had done his homework and got in behind Wolves with diagonal passes: the first, from Quilindschy Hartman on the halfway line, invited ­Flemming to volley from the edge of the ­penalty area. The ­second, after Josh Cullen spread the ball wide left, came when ­Hartman volleyed across for the Dutchman, who scored 14 times for Burnley last season, to tap in.“I thought he was brilliant today,” Parker said. “His first was ­incredible. The second was exactly what we worked on this week in terms of how to exploit their back line, and he executed it really well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Few doubt the qualities of Pereira, the manager who saved them from relegation after arriving last December, but the club starting a season with another winless run of nine games leaves the owners between a rock and a hard place, even if it is of their own making.

Martin Dubravka saved from Bellegarde’s belter, before Foster’s goal, and then, spectacularly, at the death, from Santi Bueno.With two games against Chelsea, first in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, either side of a visit to Fulham, Wolves’ future needs to be about more than just the manager’s.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Though not every opposing team will play like Bournemouth; Andoni Iraola’s team climbed to second in the Premier League, delivering portions of the football from the gods that makes their manager one of the game’s hottest properties.After scoring directly from a corner through Marcus Tavernier – set pieces continuing to haunt Forest, with this the 12th conceded from this season – there was further evidence of Bournemouth’s elite talent scouting. Eli Junior Kroupi, 19, from the Cherries’ sister club, Lorient, followed up last week’s double at Crystal Palace with a lashing finish.Arsenal move four points clear at top as Eze strike sees off Crystal PalaceRead more“I would like to have more points,” said Iraola, repeating his frequent claim that he ignores thePremier Leaguetable. “The league is so compact. It’s about the performance and how competitive we are. It’s nine games into the season. Eighteen points is a very good amount … it’s not enough, as many as we can.”It was a familiar disappointment for Sean Dyche at the site of his final Everton match. Beating Porto on Thursday already banks one more win than Ange Postecoglou managed but the demise of his predecessor shows the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, does not shirk Liz Truss-length managerial reigns. Dyche, his reputation made in survival missions, suits Forest’s current plight; they remain in the bottom three.“I didn’t come here naively – the table does tell a story,” said Dyche. “I didn’t think there wasn’t work to be done, but the first half showed it. They were the better side overall so there’s no excuses here.”Morgan Gibbs-White, who had Forest’s lone creditable effort of the first half, and Elliot Anderson found space squeezed to a premium. Only seven touches in the Bournemouth box over 90 minutes told a tale. As his team endured heavy pressure, there came the familiar boom of Dyche’s voice; should Forest not work out, a career as a black metal vocalist beckons. “We have crammed three weeks’ work into five days,” he said, trademark croak yet more raspy. “When you are not at it, you’re going to get hurt.”View image in fullscreenMatz Sels fails to stop Marcus Tavernier’s corner looping over him for Bournemouth’s opening goal.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersForest’s frustrations were borne out in a flashpoint between Douglas Luiz and Justin Kluivert that resulted in both being booked. If that failed to halt Bournemouth’s momentum, so did Forest’s go-slow, as prescribed by their bellowing tracksuit manager. Neither skinny jeans nor flares for a manager dressed for business.Dyche shook his head after Matz Sels flapped at Tavernier’s corner. The goalkeeper, baulked by Tyler Adams though not enough for the video assistant to intervene, forlornly swung off the bar following what South Americans call a “gol Olimpico”. Dyche, unhappy a corner had been awarded in the first place, was booked for his complaints. “The linesperson gives it as a goal-kick and the referee overturns the decision from a position he can’t see.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kroupi, seizing on the ball after the excellent Adams had robbed Anderson, forging onwards unchallenged, doubled the lead. “If he smells a chance – left foot, right foot – he will take it,” said Iraola.Second-half improvement in the shape of solidity followed from Forest, the previous flow of Bournemouth chances stemmed. Not much else besides. There was still an absence of the creativity lacking since Nuno Espírito Santo had them in the top four.“The second half was not as brilliant,” said Iraola, though the twinkling toes of David Brooks and his fellow Bournemouth sub Ryan Christie might have finished Forest off in the closing moments. Entertaining football is part of the package for a team going places. For Forest fans, their latest manager unapologetic over his methods, a grind awaits.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Oh my god, are you kidding me? Did you just see that?” he said to his engineer on team radio. “I could have fucking killed them.”After the race he was outraged that the marshals had been placed in such danger apparently without being informed that he was out of time with the rest of the field after pitting early. “I honestly couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” he said.“Boxed, came out and then I got to turn one and there were just two dudes running across the track. I nearly hit one of them, honestly, it was so dangerous. Obviously there’s been a miscommunication somewhere but I’ve never experienced that before and I haven’t really seen that in the past.“It’s pretty unacceptable. We can’t understand how on a live track marshals can be allowed to just run across the track like that. I have no idea why, I’m sure we’ll get some sort of explanation, but it really can’t happen again.”The FIA issued a statement afterwards stating it was investigating what had happened as instructions for marshals to enter the track had been revoked. “Following a turn one incident, race control was informed that debris was present on the track at the apex of that corner. On lap three, marshals were alerted and placed on standby to enter the track and recover the debris once all cars had passed turn one,” the statement read.“As soon as it became apparent that Lawson had pitted, the instructions to dispatch marshals were rescinded, and a double yellow flag was shown in that area. We are still investigating what occurred after that point.”Norris also brushed off booing he received from the crowd after his victory, apparently aimed at the British driver because Mexican fans perceived it had been unfair that he had been given back a place he lost to Piastri after a slow pit stop under team orders at Monza. In a poll Mexicans had voted that he should return the three points.“They have the right to do it if they want to do it, that’s sport sometimes,” he said. “I don’t know why I can’t stop laughing when I get booed. I think it makes it more entertaining for me, so they can keep doing it if they want.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

After months of speculation over whether he would recover in time,CricketAustralia on Monday finally confirmed that the quick would have to sit out the game at Optus Stadium.‘Team togetherness is crucial’: David Gower on how to win the AshesRead moreThe 32-year-old’s acumen with the ball in hand and his presence as a leader on the field will be sorely missed, and with uncertainty remaining over when he will be able to feature again, his absence comes as a blow to Australia’s hopes of retaining the Ashes urn.The 32-year-old has resumed running and “expects to return to bowling shortly”, CA said on Monday, although an exact date has not been put on any return to full fitness.Cummins has previously indicated he would like a full four weeks of bowling before returning to the starting XI, meaning the second Test in Brisbane starting on 4 December would be a realistic target, if he can resume bowling in the next week or so.Smith, who was stripped of the captaincy in the wake of the sandpaper scandal in 2018, has since filled in for Australia six times as Cummins’s vice-captain since the bowler assumed the role in November 2021. Smith boasts a better batting average as captain (68.98), compared with when not in the role (49.9).After spending six weeks in New York, Smith will have two chances to get his eye in ahead of the Ashes after being included in NSW’s Sheffield Shield squad. He will make his first appearance for the Blues in 12 months against Queensland at the Gabba this week, before facing Victoria on home soil at the SCG starting 10 November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 36-player squad, including 19 forwards and 17 backs, gathered at Pennyhill Park in Surrey on Sunday night.‘Exciting’ Noah Caluori could make England debut this autumn, says BorthwickRead moreCaluori made his second Prem start for Saracens in thedefeat by table-topping Northamptonon ­Friday. He had a considerably quieter night than the phenomenal display against Sale, and was given a severe defensive test by the Saints’ all-court attacking game.However, his remarkable aerial ability was in evidence at Franklin’s Gardens and, by turning to Caluori for his autumn squad, Borthwick has ­signalled that he sees potential for him to play at the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. The head coach found no place for Adam Radwan of Leicester, who shone in the Tigers’ win against Sale on Saturday and was chosen in Borthwick’s training squad last week. Radwan’s 23-year-old club colleague Emeka Ilione misses out because of a shoulder injury.The Sale flanker Tom Curry returns, having had surgery on a wrist ligament problem after the British & Irish Lions tour in the summer, and his scrum-half clubmate Raffi Quirke is also back from injury.Quick GuideEngland squad for the Autumn Nations SeriesShowForwardsFin Baxter (Harlequins), Ollie Chessum (Leicester), Alex Coles (Northampton), Luke Cowan-Dickie (Sale), Chandler Cunningham-South (Harlequins), Tom Curry (Sale), Theo Dan (Saracens), Ben Earl (Saracens), Ellis Genge (Bristol), Jamie George (Saracens), Joe Heyes (Leicester), Maro Itoje (Saracens), Nick Isiekwe (Saracens), Jack Kenningham (Harlequins), Asher Opoku-Fordjour (Sale), Guy Pepper (Bath), Henry Pollock (Northampton), Will Stuart (Bath), Sam Underhill (Bath).BacksHenry Arundell (Bath), Noah Caluori (Saracens), Fraser Dingwall (Northampton), Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (Exeter), George Ford (Sale), Tommy Freeman (Northampton), Ollie Lawrence (Bath), Alex Mitchell (Northampton), Cadan Murley (Harlequins), Max Ojomoh (Bath), Raffi Quirke (Sale), Tom Roebuck (Sale), Henry Slade (Exeter), Fin Smith (Northampton), Marcus Smith (Harlequins), Ben Spencer (Bath), Freddie Steward (Leicester).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There is good news for the Harlequins forward Chandler ­Cunningham-South, who takes his place in the squad despite a recent ankle ­problem, while Elliot Daly of ­Saracens and Leicester’s George ­Martin and Jack van ­Poortvliet will join the squad to work on injury rehabilitation.“Our focus is on making the most of the time we have together as we approach what will be a fiercely ­competitive series,” Borthwick said. “Facing Australia in the opening match will be a great test against a team that has been training and playing together for some time and is one of the in-form teams in the world.”The uncapped Caluori will be pitched into a fierce battle for ­starting spots in the back line: Tommy Freeman scored four tries in Northampton’s win against ­Saracens and, while the 24-year-old may be ­switching to outside-centre, there are several other world-class wing options available to Borthwick.Immanuel Feyi-Waboso scored his seventh try of the Prem season in Exeter’s victory against Gloucester on Saturday and leads the ­try-scoring charts, with Sale’s Tom Roebuck on five and Henry Arundell of Bath on four.Feyi-Waboso’s Exeter ­colleague Henry Slade, meanwhile, has scored a league-leading 70 points in five Prem rounds, roaring back into top form at 32. Slade has started the past two matches in the centres alongside Exeter’s new signing Len Ikitau of Australia, and they may now face each other at Twickenham on Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fin Smith, who ­stylishly pulled the strings for Northampton on ­Friday, was on Lions duty in ­Australia and the stock of the 32-year-old Ford rose in his absence.Tom Willis of Saracens is left out, as expected, after announcing his decision to return to France having established himself as Borthwick’s first-choice No 8. The 20-year-old Henry Pollock, another player who starred for Northampton on Friday, will be an option for the No 8 jersey ­leading into the World Cup.Australia defeated Japan 19-15in Tokyo on Saturday to begin their autumn schedule but after the ­forwards Lukhan Salakaia-Loto and Josh Canham were injured, Joe Schmidt said he may be forced to call up reinforcements, with the second row being an area of concern. “With England’s strong pack, it just means that we are light in the second row, and we may need to get some reserves dug out from ­Australia,” the head coach said. “That’s probably our first thought.”Australia’s visit to Twickenham on Saturday is followed by fixtures for England against Fiji a week later, New Zealand on 15 November, and Argentina on 23 November.View image in fullscreenGeorge Ford has staked a claim for the fly-half shirt.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAExplore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionSaracensnewsShareReuse this content"

An agreement with the players’ association is necessary and sponsor deals could be impacted.The Blue Jays flipped the World Series script on baseball’s biggest spendersRead more“I am positive about it. I think that the owners have kind of crossed the line in terms of, we’d like to do it if we can possibly make it work,” Manfred said Saturday before Game 2 of the World Series. “There are logistical issues that still need to be worked on.”At the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, the baseball tournament took place over 11 days, including a four-day group stage followed by knockout rounds and culminating in gold and bronze medal games.Baseball at the LA Games is likely to have a more compressed format.“We have made a lot of progress with LA 2028 in terms of the calendar,” Manfred said. “Right now we’re in discussions with the players’ association about that set of issues.”Participation in 2028 is likely to be a one-off. The 2032 Olympics are scheduled for Brisbane, Australia.“The logistics of LA as evidenced by how long we’ve been talking about it are difficult,” Manfred said. “The chances that we’re playing in Brisbane – difficult, right? Even way more difficult than being in LA.”There has been focus on postseason payroll disparity and whether a second straight World Series championship for the Los Angeles Dodgers would increase the likelihood of management proposing a salary cap in talks for a labor contract to succeed the current deal with players, which expires in 2026.Los Angeles entered as baseball’s top spender this year, projected at $509m in payroll and luxury tax, more than seven times the $69m of the major league-low Miami Marlins. The Blue Jays are No 5 at $266m.No small-market team has won the title since the 2015 Kansas City Royals.“I don’t think who wins this World Series is any more relevant than who won the last five or six,” Manfred said.Manfred said MLB is moving “as fast as we can” in investigations that led to Cleveland pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz being placed on paid leave.Ortiz didn’t pitch after 27 June and Clase after 26 July as part of an MLB probe into sports betting.“Obviously, our No. 1 priority is to protect the integrity of the game. We think we have great systems in place that allow us to do that,” Manfred said. “We’ve worked really hard to provide resources to players to make sure that they are comfortable and have an outlet when they have a problem with respect to issues related to sports betting.”The head coach of the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers and a player for the Miami Heat were arrested Thursday along with more than 30 other people in a federal gambling investigation.“The most important thing that we can do is make sure that we have systems in place that give us access to data which puts you in a position to determine if there’s something aberrational going on,” Manfred said. “When you get that, you need to conduct a thorough investigation, make sure that you understand exactly what caused that aberration and then you need to discipline.”Manfred sounded content with 12 of 30 teams making the playoffs. The size was expanded from 10 as part of the 2022 labor agreement after the players’ association rejected MLB’s 14-club plan.Best-of-three wildcard series started as part of the larger postseason, all played at the ballpark of the higher-seeded team.“I really like the way 12 has played out,” Manfred said. “I think the wildcard round, playing a series like we’d normally play baseball, was a big improvement.”Manfred has said he hopes MLB can select two expansion teams before his term expires in January 2029, but he won’t move forward until the Tampa Bay Rays and the team’s new owners have a deal for a new ballpark.“We’re not going to be on the field, obviously, but I’d like to have the teams picked,” he said. “I’m pretty comfortable with the idea that something good is going to happen in the Tampa Bay region.”Montreal has discussed bidding for an expansion team to replace the Expos, who became the Washington Nationals for the 2005 season.“There’s certainly other cities in Canada that would be viable expansion candidates,” Manfred said.MLB’s contracts remain in the legal drafting phase with Comcast’s NBCUniversal for the wildcard series and Sunday night regular-season games, with Netflix for the All-Star Home Run Derby, and with the Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN for a regular-season package plus in-market rights for Arizona, Cleveland, Colorado, Minnesota and San Diego.“We have agreements. We’re just working on long forms and as I have learned over the years, long-form broadcasting agreements take a long time to get done,” Manfred said.Tampa Bay played home games this year at the New York Yankees’ spring training home, Steinbrenner Field, following damage to Tropicana Field caused by Hurricane Milton. Repairs are ongoing, and the Rays play their home opener on 6 April after starting with a nine-game trip.“We’re hopeful that it will be ready for the opening home set,” Manfred said. “It’s certainly going to be open very early in the year.”Shohei Ohtani has helped the Dodgers reach the World Series in consecutive years, sparking record viewership in Japan.“Shohei, it just absolutely has been the greatest benefit to the game that you can imagine throughout the year. In the LCS he had probably the greatest game of all time and we’re fortunate to have him here in the World Series,” Manfred said.Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028MLBBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead more“Artificial intelligence presents significant opportunities for Australia and our economy; however, it’s important that Australian creatives benefit from these opportunities too,” she said.The attorney general will convene the government’s copyright and AI reference group on Monday and Tuesday to canvass other options for responding to the challenges posed by the evolving technology.That includes whether a new paid licensing framework under the Copyright Act should replace the existing voluntary regime.The Australian Recording Industry Association, which was among the creatives campaigning against the exemption, welcomed the announcement as a “critical step in the right direction”.“It is a win for creativity and Australian culture, including First Nations culture, but it’s also a win for common sense,” said its chief executive, Annabelle Herd. “Current copyright licensing structures work.“They are the foundation of the creative economy, the digital economy, and the technology industry.

Inside the fragile system holding the modern world togetherBehind every meme and message is creaking, decades-old infrastructure. Internet experts can think of scenarios that could bring it all crashing down …Aisha DownSun 26 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 19.26 EDTShareIt is the morning after the internet went offline and, as much as you would like to think you would be delighted, you are likely to be wondering what to do.You could buy groceries with a chequebook, if you have one. Call into work with the landline – if yours is still connected. After that, you could drive to the shop, as long as you still know how to navigate without 5G.A glitch at a datacentre in the US state of Virginia this week reminded us that the unlikely is not impossible. The internet may have become an irreplaceable linchpin of modern life, but it is also a web of creaking legacy programs and physical infrastructure, leading some to wonder what it would take to bring it all down.The answer could be as simple as some acute bad luck, a few targeted attacks, or both. Extreme weather takes out a few key datacentres. A line of AI-written code deep in a major provider – such as Amazon, Google orMicrosoft– is triggered unexpectedly and causes a cascading software crash. An armed group or intelligence agency snips acouple of undersea cables.Amazon Web Services outage shows internet users ‘at mercy’ of too few providers, experts sayRead moreThese would be bad. But the real doomsday event, the kind that the world’s few internet experts still worry about in private Slack groups, is slightly different – a sudden, snowballing error in the creaky, decades-old protocols that underlie the whole internet. Think of the plumbing that directs the flow of connection, or the address books that allow one machine to locate another.We’ll call it “the big one” and if it were to happen then at the very least, you would need your chequebook.The big one could startwhen a summertime tornado cruises through the town of Council Bluffs, Iowa, laying waste to a low-slung cluster of datacentres that are an integral part of Google’s offering.This area, called us-central1, is a Google datacentre cluster, critical to its Cloud Platform as well as YouTube and Gmail – a 2019outageheredownedthese services across the US and Europe.Dinners burn as YouTube cooking videos sputter to a halt. Workers across the world furiously refresh their suddenly inaccessible emails, then resign themselves to interacting in person. Senior US officials notice some government services have slowed, before returning to planning a new blitz over Signal.All this is inconvenient, but nowhere near the end of the internet. “Technically, if we have two networked devices and a router between them, the internet is running,” says Michał “rysiek” Woźniak, who works in DNS, the system involved in this week’s outage.But there is “absolutely a lot of concentration happening on the internet”, says Steven Murdoch, a professor of computer science at University College London. “This happens with economics. It’s just cheaper to run all things in the same place.”But what if then a heatwave in the eastern US takes out US East-1, part of a Virginia complex that hosts “datacenter alley”, a key hub for Amazon Web Services (AWS), the focus of this week’s outage – among a handful of its neighbours. Meanwhile, a cyberattack hits a major European cluster, say inFrankfurtor London. In the wake of this, networks redirect traffic to secondary hubs, lesser-used datacentres, which like frontage roads in a Los Angeles traffic jam become quickly unusable.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of an Amazon Web Services datacentre known as US East-1 in Ashburn, Virginia.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersOr, if we stray from disaster movie to the perils of automation, the heightened traffic could trigger a bug in AWS’s internal infrastructure rewritten by artificial intelligence months ago – perhaps one that went unnoticedafterhundredsof AWS employees were let go this summer as part of the company’s larger push towards automation. Overwhelmed by unfamiliar requests, AWS starts to tumble.Signal goes down. So does Slack, Netflix and Lloyd’s bank. Roomba vacuum cleaners fall silent. Smart mattresses gorogueand smart locks malfunction.WithAmazonand Google taken out, the internet would look largely unfamiliar. AWS, Microsoft and Google together account for more than 60% of the world’s cloud services market – and it is almost impossible to approximate how many services depend on them.“But the internet at its very most rudimentary level is still working,” says Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who studies disruptions. “You just can’t do anything that you’re used to on the internet because that’s all posted out of these metacenters.”You may think that the biggest threat is an attack on an undersea cable. This excites Washington thinktanks, but otherwise achieves little. Undersea cables break regularly, says Madory – in fact, the UN estimates there are 150 to 200 faults a year.“You’d really have to take out a bunch to affect communication. I think the submarine cable industry would tell you: dude, we do this all the time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Verisign, for example, handles every online site that ends with a certain “.com”, or “.net”. Ultranet, another one, handles “.biz” and “.us”.Madory says it is extremely unlikely that one of them could ever be taken out. “If something were to happen to Verisign, .com would be gone. They have a huge financial incentive to make sure that never happens.”View image in fullscreenAWS, Microsoft and Google together account for more than 60% of the world’s cloud services market.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesBut it would take an error of that scale, one that implicates more fundamental infrastructure than Amazon and Google, to truly devastate the broader ecosystem. If it happened, it would be unprecedented – the closest analogy could be the 2016attackon Dyn, a smaller DNS service provider, whichdownedthe Guardian, X and others.With .com out, banks, hospitals, financial services and most communication platforms would be out. Some government internet infrastructure would still be there, such as the US’s secure messaging systemSiprnet.And – at least to a wonkish community of experts – there would still be the internet. There are self-hosted blogs, after all, and decentralised social platforms such as Mastodon, and niche domains including “.io”, for the British Indian Ocean, and “.is” for Iceland.The Guardian view on the cloud crash: an outage that showed who really runs the internet | EditorialRead moreMurdoch and Madory can think of scenarios that would devastate the rest. Murdoch suggests a bug in BIND, the softwarelanguagethat supports DNS. Madory points attestimonyfrom a group of Massachusetts hackers who in 1998 told the US Congress about a vulnerability that could “take down the internet in 30 minutes”.That vulnerability involved a system one level up from DNS: the border gateway protocol, which directs all traffic on the internet. This is extremely unlikely, says Madory – such an event would be an “all hands on deck” scenario, and the protocol is “super resilient, otherwise it would have crashed by now”.If the internet were ever fully shut down, it is unclear if it could be started up again, says Murdoch. “No one has turned off the internet after it’s been turned on. No one is really sure how it could be turned on again.”In the UK, there is a non-virtual contingency plan, or at least there was. If the internet shuts down, the people who know how it works will meet up in a pub outside London and decide what to do, says Murdoch.“I don’t know if this is still the case. It was quite a few years ago and I was never told which pub it was.”Explore more on these topicsInternetComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleAmazonMicrosoftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it provides a powerful symbol of wanton destruction – and, as Trump himself knows full well, images matter greatly in politics. It also curiously combines so many elements of a distinctly Trumpian approach to government: shameless falsehoods about the proposed ballroom (“It won’t interfere with the current building. It’ll be near it but not touching it”); complete disregard for legislation (in this caserules about preservation), and unprecedented levels of cronyism (with CEOs trying to curry favor with the president through donations to a grotesque project of self-aggrandizement). There is also something very poignant about the destruction of an edifice which had providedan office of one’s own for first ladies. For all these peculiarities, Trump’s disfiguring the White House fits into a larger global trend: far-right populist leaders in many countries have used spectacular architecture to advance their political agenda and, more particularly, to set their vision of a “real people” – as in “real Americans”, “real Hungarians” et cetera – in stone.Just before Christmas 2020, in the dying days of his first administration, Trump had already taken time off from his busy schedule promoting the big lie about having won the election in order to issue an executive order entitled “Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture”. The order made “classicism” the preferred style for new federal buildings, stopping just short of banning modernism entirely. Biden rescinded the order; Trump broughta versionof it back right on inauguration day this year. What is almost entirely forgotten is that the 2020 order had belonged together with Trump’s “1776 commission”, the ill-fated attempt to whitewash US history; both the architecture orders and the instructions for history teaching were meant to promote an image of the US as pure and “beautiful”.In his use of the built environment, Trump is less an example of American exceptionalism than is suggested by credulous accounts of “Trump, ever the developer.” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has had massive structures erected, from agigantic mosque in Istanbulto a newpresidential palace in Ankara; he has also promoted the Ottoman-Seljuk style as reflecting his neo-Ottoman understanding of Turkey. Viktor Orbán’s reconstructions ofhistorical edifices on Budapest’s Castle Hillare supposed to present a correct understanding of Hungarian history; India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been reconstructing Hindu temples – most controversially on the ruins of thedestroyed mosque in Ayodhya.The pattern is usually this: one layer of history – be it the Mughal period or, in Hungary, state socialism with its modernist buildings – is removed and a reconstruction is celebrated as a return to a people’s authenticity and greatness. But beyond this symbolic message about “the real people”, large construction projects demonstrate dominance; the implicit claim is: “We won and now the country is ours!” And that claim is inevitably in citizens’ faces: one might avoid all kinds of propaganda online and on TV, but one cannot avoid buildings in everyday life. Even if such autocratic figures were removed from office – and of course they do everything to avoid that outcome – their edifices and monuments will remain.True, in one sense Trump’s case is unique: he already had a portfolio of buildings before assuming office – though most of his own buildings had never been particularly classical; instead, they are modern on the outside, while on the inside one finds a nouveau riche fever fantasy of Versailles – which has now also spawned anengoldened Oval Office, displaying what an astute critic, Kate Wagner, has called “regional car dealership rococo”. And while size matters for all far-right leaders on one level (just think of Erdoğan’s enormous palace in Ankara), hardly anybody else would have fixated on a ballroom. Perhaps the reason is as banal as the fact that banquets and catering wereone of the few business venturesin which Trump ever had genuine success; more likely, it is a space for unlimited adulation of the president and for plenty of occasions for “deal-making”.Architects promoting traditional styles have been happy to go along with Trump’s ideas. To be sure, style is never just reducible to a particular politics; modernism is not automatically progressive (some fascist edifices in Italy are modernist marvels). But the way some promoters of classicism have talked about “beauty” and insisted that “classical public buildings make us feel proud of our country” is not only backward-looking; it easily legitimizes a Magalomaniac architecture of little aesthetic value.The architect in charge of the ballroom, James C McCrery II, trained with, and worked for, Eisenman, one of the great proponents of the “deconstructivism” in architecture thatone of Trump’s executive ordersexplicitly derided for its “disorder”. McCrery came to regard non-traditional architecture as “ungodly” and started to specialize in church architecture. Eisenman in turn has called the ballroom plans “bonkers” and observed that “putting a porticoat the end of a long facade and not in the center is what one might say is untutored”.This monstrosity might well be empty most of the time (unless it can be re-purposed to store classified documents). It is not too early to think about how it could either be modified or perhaps removed altogether. Of course, the Maga activists who opposed every removal of a Confederate statue in the name of “preserving history” would not be happy. But then again, they had nothing to say about the destruction of the East Wing – a building of which citizens who have visited the White House are likely to have fond memories.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionWashington DCcommentShareReuse this content"

But we must not give up hopeSun 26 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 14.54 EDTShareOne year ago, everything was so different. In late October 2024, before the US presidential election, thoughtful Americans could certainly acknowledge the deep flaws of their country – its injustices and inequality – but they could still recognize it as the United States. A democracy. A place where the rule of law meant something. A nation led by a dignified and decent public servant, despite his advanced age and increasing frailty.These days, in late October 2025, many of us barely recognize the nation we live in. People suspected of being illegal immigrants are rounded up and shoved into vans, sometimes denied due process. The East Wing of the “people’s house” – the White House – is being destroyed for an obscene ballroom. Donald Trump is persecuting his political rivals or supposed enemies anddemanding the justice department hand over $230m. Armed military personnel are being sent into American cities on false pretexts. The Pentagon, relabeled the Department of War, has – in effect –rid itselfof day-to-day journalistic scrutiny as it spends what could amount tonearly $1tn of taxpayer money. Universities, law firms, news companies are buckling under the president’s threats, and billionaires are treated like members of the royal family.Democrats are captive to outdated etiquette. It’s endangering democracy | Ryan W PowersRead more“The United States, just months before its 250thbirthday as the world’s leading democracy, has tipped over the edge into authoritarianism and fascism,” Garrett Graff, the American historian and author,wrote in August. “In the end, faster than I imagined possible, it did happen here.”One awakes to new horrors each day. And it is difficult to grasp – and painful to realize – just how far gone we are, and how quickly it has happened.Yet, we know that Trump was duly elected. Even after his deeply disturbing first term and even after the warnings that came with the knowledge of Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint for an authoritarian second term – even after Trump himself said publicly he wouldbe a dictator just on day one– enough Americans chose him over Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent.Frightening as the current reality is, it’s even scarier to realize that we’re only nine months into this presidential term. Where will three more years of this decline leave us? And what if the three years turns into something even longer, since there is no one to restrain this president from deciding that a third term is necessary, perhaps for national security reasons?Granted, all is not lost. There will be midterm elections next year that could bring a different balance of power, if Democrats regain one or both houses of Congress. There are elected officials who are trying to exert some accountability, like the Democratic congressmen Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, ranking members, respectively, of the House judiciary and oversight committees, who arelaunching an investigationinto the attempted money grab from the justice department.And a presidential election in 2028 could start us down the road to recovery just as last year’s election put us on this regrettable path.There are millions of Americans protesting in the streets of their cities and communities, as they did last weekend in the No Kings rallies.Robert Reich, the former labor secretary,wrote recentlythat “the great sleeping giant of America is awakening”, just as it did after the Communist witch-hunt era in the 1950s or during the Vietnam war protests or during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.On those occasions, the listing ship eventually was righted.Reich says he knows the signs of that awakening and sees it happening now. As evidence, he cites the recent massive protests, the widespread, bipartisan pushback against late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s removal from television and the near-unanimous refusal by journalists to sign the defense department’s demands they report only what is sanctioned.“The sleeping giant always remains asleep until some venality becomes so noxious, some action so disrespectful of the common good, some brutality so noisy, that he has no choice but to awaken.”It’s an optimistic take, and I respect Reich’s experienced view. Maybe he’ll prove to be right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Can it reclaim its status in the world and its adherence to the rule of law?Or must we acknowledge that the 250-year-old experiment worked for a while, and then – suddenly, utterly – failed?My pessimistic brain tells me that the latter is true; that all may indeed be lost. My hopeful heart, however, tells me that we must try, in whatever ways we can.For me, as a media critic, that’s about urging journalists to live up, more fully, to their mission of holding power to account. For others, it may be working on congressional campaigns, or organizing rallies, or finding ways to protect voting rights.Less than a year ago, we were in a very different place. A year from now? Or three years from now? The truth is, we don’t know. All we can do is try to not give up.What’s giving me hope nowThe contact I have in the classroom with young journalists, who are both idealistic and realistic, always lifts my spirits. I’m also hopeful about the journalism I see from the crop of startup news organizations, many of them non-profits, that are helping to fill the gaps left by the tragic decline of local newspapers. And I’m heartened by the recent No Kings protests, where millions of Americans peacefully gathered and showed their patriotism and love of country.Explore more on these topicsUS newsFighting BackDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

When will the PM realise that his strategy just isn’t working?Sun 26 Oct 2025 10.04 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 13.58 EDTShareThis result was never particularly in doubt. Lucy Powell continually polled ahead of her rivalBridget Phillipson, and now she has won. What made her triumph so predictable is just how patently unhappy people, including members of the Labour party, are with Keir Starmer and his progress after more than a year in government.Pollingfrom the end of September has his approval rating among members at -11. As I never tire of saying, a core thing to remember about internal Labour party contests is that party members – who, along with members of affiliated unions, form the voter base for such races – are fairly bog standard left liberals who like public services and Europe, and nationalising the railways and Ed Miliband. “Tough on immigration” doesn’t do so much for them. They are also often less politically engaged than you might expect, and should be understood separately from the party’s hardened activist class.Powell was the right person at the right time to be the vehicle for this discontent. Before entering parliament, she was an aide to Miliband during his time as leader: she is on the soft left. She entered parliament in 2012, becoming the MP for Manchester Central, and when Angela Rayner resigned there was a strong sense that her successor should be a woman from the north of England. And, whilePowell has decried as sexistdescriptions of her as a proxy for the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, a whole bunch of headlines linking her name to one of the most popular figures in the party doesn’t exactly hurt. She was sacked from cabinet in the post-Rayner resignation reshuffle that took the top team unambiguously to the right: that left heravailable to run and, presumably, not delighted with the leadership herself.That the result was comparatively close –54% for Powell, 46% for Phillipson – is testament to the latter’s strength as a candidate. Being the leadership’s pick, in the circumstances laid out, was always going to be a poisoned chalice. Phillipson did about as well as anyone could have. As education secretary (and also, of course, a northern woman – as the MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, technically even more northern, but out of the powerful Greater Manchester orbit), she has been doing exactly the kind of work that Labour members like,giving teachers pay risesandproposing to apply VATto private school fees. Traditionally on the right of the party –she addressed the conferenceof the Blairite groupingProgressive Britainearlier this year – her plans forgreater control of academieshave drawn ire from some in that part of the political world, and sheranks highlyin members’ polls of preferred cabinet members.The overall campaign – compressed into the drizzly post-conference mid-October blur – was not one for the ages. There was a graveyard shift hustings at conference after most people had gone home.Reports appearedthat Phillipson was putting pressure on the government to lift the two-child benefit cap, probably the single policy most hated by Labour members. Powell said Labour couldn’t “sugar-coat” how badly things were going. Party members got a lot of texts.1:45Lucy Powell is elected as Labour deputy leader – videoDespite the low-energy campaign,bad feelingwithin the party did grow. Some on the party’s right drew attention to the fact that the Corbynite campaign group Momentum had, after aballot of members, “strongly recommended” a vote for Powell. This strikes me as a bad attack line, in part because it is out of date – Momentum is not the force it was and Jeremy Corbyn is long gone from the party – and in part because of Powell’s reputation as a fairly staid character. She has served in the shadow cabinet and the cabinet; unlike, say, the Socialist Campaign Group’s deputy leadership nominee, Bell Ribeiro-Addy (who didn’t get the nominations needed to make it on to the ballot paper), there is little chance that Powell will use her new position to become a wholesale anti-government outrider.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Powell, fairly enough, objects to being seen as a proxy for Burnham, but she is certainly a proxy for anti-Starmer sentiments, and now she is possessed of both an independent mandate and a seat on Labour’s national executive committee, the party’s powerful governing body (which adjudicates on, among other things, candidate selections). Inher acceptance speech, she said that Labour must “give a stronger sense of our purpose, whose side we’re on, of our Labour values and beliefs. That’s what I’ve heard loudly and clearly around the country these last few weeks. As deputy, my job will be to bring those voices to the heart of our party”. She added that she thinks “people feel that this government is not being bold enough in delivering the change we promised”.Overall, this isn’t good news for Starmer. Despite the fact that he and his new deputy profess much the same politics, her election signals serious opposition. She was able to get around a better-resourced and better-endorsed opponent through sheer force of popular feeling. Thebyelection in Caerphillylast week, in which Labour came a distant third in its former safe seat behind Plaid Cymru and Reform, was only a taste of what the party can expect in next May’s local elections. At that point Starmer – already a beleaguered figure – will undoubtedly face some calls to stand down. It’s hard to picture Powell as the smiler with the knife – but equally difficult to imagine her being hugely energetic in any endeavours to keep Starmer in No 10.Morgan Jones is the co-editor of Renewal: A Journal of Social DemocracyExplore more on these topicsLucy PowellOpinionKeir StarmerLabourBridget PhillipsoncommentShareReuse this content"

I can’t continue a friendship with someone like that.”Sam and Chris* had weathered disagreements over the course of their decade-long friendship. But Chris’s decision to not join their broader friendship group at a protest caused a rupture that, in Sam’s eyes, was irreparable.Disagreements between friends are as old as friendship itself. But the frequency and ferocity of discord seem to have grown exponentially amid current geopolitical crises and the avalanche of social stressors. The weight of an increasingly fractured world is pressing on many individuals and, by extension, friendships. Nerves are frayed, tensions are high. Our threshold to withstand differences or to work through these in a constructive manner seems at a low ebb.Growing up, Bianca could never predict her father’s moods: the disorientation of an emotionally immature parent echoed into her adulthood | Carly DoberRead moreSam’s resolute stance on the protest was not surprising, given his strong interest in politics. Still, thoughts of abruptly ending the friendship with Chris seemed out of character. The issue of the protest seemed so dominant that it was difficult for Sam to consider other aspects of Chris and their friendship. Suggestions from other friends to“let it go” or to “agree to disagree”only served to compound Sam’s frustration.I wondered if “parts work” might be helpful in clarifying Sam’s thoughts and feelings about the friendship. This therapy approach, based oninternal family systems, recognises the complexity of the human psyche by acknowledging the separate but interconnected “parts” of the self.All individuals contain multitudes; some aspects of the self are congruent and support each other, but others are invariably in conflict and at times may seem irreconcilable. The discomfort arising from this can propel us to seek to cut off a part of ourselves. Usually applied to internal conflict within individuals, the model is also helpful in thinking about interpersonal conflict. For Sam, discomfort and incongruence motivated him to consider cutting off a friendship, rather than parts of the self.But before I had a chance to introduce the concept of parts work, Sam put to me the same question vexing his friendship with Chris: would I be attending the protest? It was a potential juncture in our therapeutic relationship, similar to the juncture threatening Sam and Chris’s friendship.This interaction demonstrates that the therapy room is a microcosm of the patient’s broader world; events here mirror the patient’s external world and, perhaps more importantly, can cause change in the patient’s external world.I wondered: did the continuation of our therapeutic relationship hinge on my protest plans? Might Sam be contemplating walking out on me, too?I leaned into the discomfort, knowing this was a chance to explore Sam’s thoughts and feelings about friendship in the safe confines of our therapeutic relationship.“What if I wasn’t planning on attending the protest?”I treated Sam’s question as hypothetical. Whileit can sometimes be helpfulfor therapists to communicate their political views with patients, entering into a discussion about politics with Sam would not have aided the therapeutic focus on disagreements and friendship dynamics.Sam said he would be shocked, angry, disappointed. He felt he knew me and could anticipate my stance on political and social issues. He would find it hard to continue our work together, such were his strong feelings about the issue.We agreed that this sounded similar to his position on the friendship with Chris. Did a difference of opinion on this issue nullify or void the entire friendship? Was there a way to sit with differences while also appreciating other parts of their friendship? Sam listed a dozen or more of Chris’s attributes, representing parts of their friend and their friendship that Sam appreciated and found more challenging. Sam also reflected on his own parts, recognising the internal conflict around valuing friendship while being true to his own principles and values. While we’d not talked about the protest directly, there had been a softening around the topic.Over time, parts work provided an opportunity to explore Sam’s thoughts and feelings about his friendship with Chris, but it was by no means a panacea. He remained ambivalent about the friendship and his thoughts about the protest remained strong. But the structure of parts work tempered Sam’s initial impulse around discarding the friendship, instead allowing time and space for different aspects to be considered.Viewing ourselves and others in this way discourages rigid thinking, promoting curiosity over judgment. For Sam, this was infinitely more interesting and useful than biting his tongue or agreeing to disagree.* Sam and Chris are fictitious amalgams to exemplify similar casesDr Bianca Denny is a clinical psychologist based in Melbourne.

The leftwing, independent TD (member of parliament) with the quiet composure and austere appearance of a contemplative nun has won anoverwhelming victoryto succeed the outgoing national treasure, 84-year-old poet Michael D Higgins. Her choice as the republic’s 10th head of state in a contest so bizarre it might have been scripted by Basil Fawlty has left the two government parties reeling.Fianna Fáil’s candidate, Jim Gavin, hand-picked by the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, for his accomplishments in sport and the cultural bastion of the Gaelic Athletic Association,withdrewafter it emerged he had failed since 2009 to refund €3,300 owed to a former tenant. Gavin’s name remained on the ballot paper as a ghost candidate. How Martin must rue the day Live Aid founderBob Geldofphoned him last summer seeking the party’s nomination and he demurred because he already had Gavin in mind.There is egg dribbling down the established media’s face too. Sinn Féin, the biggest opposition party, announced last month that it was supporting Connolly’s candidacy. When the party’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, promised that this decision would be an election “gamechanger”, commentators scoffed, “some gamechanger”.The five leftwing parties in the Dáil – Sinn Féin, Labour, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and the Greens – forged an unprecedented collaboration to support Connolly’s independent candidacy. Her triumph has therefore exploded the shibboleth that the fractured left is an immovable obstacle to Sinn Féin ever forming a government.Connolly’s election is also counter-cultural in an EU increasingly moving to the right and a climate of racism, anti-feminism and militarism.Connolly was not a perfect candidate but she had two big advantages. For the past 35 years, since Mary Robinson became the first woman and first leftwing president of Ireland, the electorate has relished plumping for the edginess of an outsider – a hint of idiosyncrasy, even – in the country’s first citizen. It seems to satisfy a national self-image of nonconformism, albeit never manifested in parliamentary elections. One of the hottest-selling gift items during the current presidency was a Higgins look-alikeknitted tea cosy.Connolly’s bigger advantage, though, was the ABH (Anybody But Humphreys) factor. Heather Humphreys, a genial former government minister of the keep-talking-but-say-nothing old school – was lured out of retirement to represent Fine Gael after her party’s first choice, former EU commissionerMairead McGuinness, dropped outfor health reasons. When Humphreys’ vaunted potential to unify the island as a Presbyterian living beside the Irish border failed to find traction, Fine Gael launched an American-stylenegative campaignin a desperate attempt to stop her sliding further down the polls. An internet video accused Connolly of hypocrisy for attacking the banks’ role in Ireland’s catastrophic housing crisis when she had represented the banks in court as a barrister before her election to the Dáil in 2016. The tactic backfired when many voters objected to Fine Gael’s Trumpian tactics.Connolly is the eldest of 14 children. She grew up in a local authority house in Galway. She is anti-war, anti-imperialist, pro-Ireland’s reunification and an advocate of disability rights. Like her predecessor, she has been critical of theEU’s inertiaduring Israel’s human slaughter in Gaza. Her more reckless pronouncementsthat France and the UK could not be trustedbecause of their arms industries, and likening Germany’s rearmament to the situation that prevailed in 1939, made many voters wary of what she might say as president. That risk, however, has proved preferable to the alternative of returning to old-style, pre-Robinson presidencies when the incumbents unfailingly toed the government line to the point of public irrelevance.A psychologist and a lawyer, Connolly was often evasive during the campaign when questioned about acontroversial visit she made to Syriaduring the Assad regime andher employment in the Dáil of a dissident republicanwho had been jailed on firearms charges. The latter, she said, was an exercise of her commitment to prisoner rehabilitation.At 68, she is older than Humphreys but she had stronger appeal for younger voters who latched on to her civic society-style peacenik campaign. Her fluency in Irish, the state’s first official language, sharply contrasted with Humphreys’ inability to speak it in public. After decades of resisting the native tongue, speaking Irish has become cool for a generation tuned into Kneecap.While her election is being feted by her backers, there is too a sense of a country holding its breath. An extraordinarily high number of spoilt votes in Friday’s election – exceeding Humphreys’s votes in some areas – coincided with two consecutive nights ofviolent riotingoutside a Dublin accommodation centre for asylum applicants and war refugees last week. Leftwing parties, having coalesced under Connolly’s candidacy, will be at loggerheads again once the byelection is called to fill the Dáil seat she leaves vacant. Yet the seeds have now been sown for future cooperation on the left by way of a vote-transfer pact at the next general election which could offer the electorate a plausible choice between a government leaning right or one leaning left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The result is an emphatic humiliation. Mutterings of discontent in both parliamentary parties are already generating speculation about how long the two leaders can survive before the next general election – to be held by January 2029 at the latest.For a position that is largely ceremonial and devoid of political power, the ramifications of this presidential election are likely to rumble on well past Connolly’s formal inauguration at Dublin Castle next month.Justine McCarthy is a columnist with the Irish TimesExplore more on these topicsIrelandOpinionEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

But I ended up thanking himSun 26 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 14.00 EDTShareWhat do vicars do in their spare time? Last week, I went with two friends, both fellow vicars, to see thenew film I Swear. I knew from the trailer that it was about a man with Tourette syndrome (TS). What I didn’t know was that it was about a real person: John Davidson who was the subject of a 1989 BBC documentary calledJohn’s Not Madand who laterreceived an MBEfor his efforts to educate people about the condition and support others who have it.Before that programme, most people had never heard of TS. Nearly 40 years later, everybody (sort of) knows what it is, but it’s still often treated as a punchline – particularly on the comedy circuit.From the trailer, it seemed clear that the film was going to try to have its cake and eat it by both capitalising on the undeniable comic potential of someone shouting the most inappropriate things (“I use spunk for milk”) at inopportune times and attempting to continue Davidson’s work of raising awareness in a respectful and sensitive way. I hope it’s not a spoiler to say it was successful on both counts – but of course I only knew that by the end.As the film was starting, a young man sitting in the row in front of us suddenly shouted out a string of obscenities. For a minute, I thought it was a joke – albeit one in very poor taste. However, it quickly became apparent that this was a real-life person with TS: a teenager accompanied by his father.And as the film continued, so did the boy – with no apparent intervention from either his dad or anyone in the audience. I felt somewhat conflicted. Clearly, it was a big deal for this family to see their no doubt incredibly difficult life depicted on the big screen, and I was pleased that they were having that opportunity. But was it OK that I (and everyone else in the auditorium) could hardly hear the film as a result? Could the cinema not have put on a special screening – as most of the chains regularly do for neurodiverse people in general?View image in fullscreenJohn Davidson signs copies of his memoir, I Swear, about living with Tourette syndrome, at Wigtown book festival, Galloway, 4 October 2025.Photograph: Steven May/AlamyI’m ashamed to say that I actually considered saying something – not to the boy’s father himself (I’m not a monster), but to the manager of the theatre. However, both of my clearly more charitable fellow vicars seemed to have resigned themselves to what was happening. Plus, in the back of my mind was the (admittedly fictional) incident in Extras when Ricky Gervais’s Andy Millman complains about a child making too much noise in a restaurant, unaware that he has Down’s syndrome. He barely survived the resultant bad press – and my offence would have been far worse because I knew the boy literally couldn’t help it.Fortunately, my better nature prevailed and something extraordinary happened over the following hour and a half. First, I simply became accustomed to the once-intrusive noise. Then, as the film reached its climax and we saw the incredibly liberating effect that Davidson’s Tourette’s camps have had on so many people, I felt humbled and very privileged to be sharing this moment with people who’d actually lived it not just as actors – although Robert Aramayo’s performance as Davidson was superb and, in my view, award-worthy.I’ve had similar experiences in the cinema before – watching The King’s Speech with a friend with a stammer and his speech therapist wife, or bumping into actual veterans of the Normandy landings in the foyer after Saving Private Ryan – but this was on another level. It was like a 4D screening, but instead of the chairs moving about and sprays of water hitting you in the face, the characters were sitting next to you saying, “This isn’t just a movie. It’s my reality.” And then swearing. Spunk for milk.So I didn’t complain. As the credits rolled, I actually went and thanked Joe – who was 14 – and Mark, his father, for the gift of their presence, which undoubtedly made our experience even more profound than it would have been anyway. We then had a long chat and took a selfie together – during which we all shouted a rude word in solidarity with Joe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No, it isn’t. The violence is much reduced. Yet Israeli forces havereportedlykilled about 100 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more since the 10 October ceasefire began. Food aid supplies are stillheavily restricted. The occupation continues, in Gaza and the West Bank. US officialsfearprime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his accomplices may renege on the deal, as in the past.Likewise,Hamaselements and rival gangs have kept fighting. The terrorist group is not disarming; Israeli forces have not fully withdrawn to the agreed lines. US-framed security, governance and reconstruction proposals remain vague, hypothetical and contentious. The war’s root causes, principally the denial of Palestinian sovereignty and statehood, are not addressed. Unless that changes, it will all kick off again, sooner or later.Yet for the sake of argument, let’s pretend – and hope – that Trump is right, and sustainable peace somehow slowly emerges from Gaza’s ruins. What happens next? Justice is what must happen next. As in other “post-conflict” situations, the living and the dead in Israel andPalestineare owed a reckoning.All who committed, or oversaw, war crimes on or after 7 October 2023 must answer for their actions. Lest we forget, there are multitudes of victims, on both sides, whose suffering cries out for recognition, resolution and reparation. If only to reduce the risk of resumed warfare, it’s imperative that there be accountability and an end to impunity.Genocidemust never go unpunished. How extraordinary, then, that Trump’s “historic”, supposedly Middle East-transforming20-point peace planmakes no mention of, and offers no path towards, any sort of official, postwar public investigatory process. Senior European, Arab and UK politicians are silent on this issue, too, apparently keen to draw a veil over the shaming events of the past two years.One explanation is that, in different ways, their governments were complicit. Another is that the war exposed their lack of influence – and a societally damaging failure, exploited by Netanyahu and some Jewish diaspora leaders, to distinguish between crude antisemitism and legitimate anti-Israel, anti-war sentiment.It’s even suggested that looking back jeopardises efforts to move forward. Nonsense. The restorative quest for justice, truth and reconciliation in Sierra Leone,Argentina,Rwanda, South Africa, Cambodia and formerYugoslaviademonstrates the opposite can be true. Lessons learned in such places have universal application.A reckoning is necessary and urgent. So let’s start at the top. Netanyahu and Israel’s former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, were charged last year by the international criminal court (ICC) with war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder and starvation. The late Hamas chief, Mohammed Deif, was also indicted.It’s shameful these two fugitives from justice remain at large. Israel must surrender them – or face punitive sanctions. The wartime words and actions of Netanyahu’s far-right accomplices, notablyItamar Ben-Gvirand Bezalel Smotrich, senior Israeli military chiefs and surviving Hamas leaders also require expedited ICC investigation.Netanyahu must face the consequences at home, too. The unblocking of an independent commission of inquiry into 7 October security failures is essential. And now “peace” has broken out, Netanyahu’s oft-delayed corruption trial must quickly conclude. Trump’s demand that he be pardoned is itself deeply corrupt.Israel Defense Forces (IDF) actions in Gaza have shocked world opinion and permanently harmed Israel’s reputation. The global verdict is already in: the IDF knowingly and systematically violated international humanitarian law (including the Geneva conventions) and routinely committed war crimes bydeliberately targeting civilians.If this verdict is unfair to what Netanyahu, in all seriousness, calls the world’s “most moral army”, then an independent, external investigation might clear its name. Hamas must answer for its crimes, too.It’s hard to keep track of all the atrocities, let alone prosecute those responsible. In March, 15 Palestinian medics and rescue workers were executed, the UN said. In April, photojournalist Fatma Hassouna and six family members diedin an airstrikeon their Gaza City home. In June, civilians seeking food aidwere shotin one of many such incidents. These are three recent instances of alleged IDF war crimes, chosen at random.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By some legal definitions – weaponisation of food and forcible transfer – “genocidal acts” are continuing despite the ceasefire. After South Africa and others challenged Israel’s actions, the international court of justice (ICJ) found in January that there was ademonstrable risk of genocide. Yet a final rulingmay not come until 2028. That’s an unacceptable delay – and in any event, the court cannot enforce its decisions.What’s urgently needed now is a UN-sponsored international criminal tribunal forGaza, modelled on those in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. It should be empowered to examine all aspects of Israel’s and Hamas’s conduct of the war, especially their shared disregard for civilian lives and their killing, torture and mistreatment of hostages and detainees.The tribunal, complementing the ICC and ICJ, should also scrutinise wartime political decision-making, and whether third parties such as the US and Iran, which actively aided and abetted the combatants, share responsibility for the unlawful consequences. The culpability of countries such as the UKthat armed the IDFmust also be assessed. To kickstart this process, all of Gaza should be immediately opened up to UN investigators and international journalists.An international tribunal with power to punish perpetrators and compensate victims is an essential antidote to Gaza’s world-shaking horrors. It’s not about revenge. It’s about justice – and political will. A tribunal cannot change what happened. Yet it could help ensure it does not happen again. Until there’s a full and honest accounting, the war will never be truly over.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuOpinionInternational court of justiceHamasGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

I was two years old and have no conscious memory of life before that. I can remember walking around our little apartment in East Orange, New Jersey, singing those songs.The first album I boughtI grew up in a fundamentalist Christian conservative family. Remember Footloose? It was exactly like that. No dancing, no movies, no records. My aunt bought me Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants and I fell in love with Send One Your Love.The song I inexplicably know every lyric to[Sings]: “Of war and peace the truth just twists / Its curfew gull just glides / Upon four-legged forest clouds / The cowboy angel rides.” I learned Gates of Eden by Bob Dylan when I was really young. I was mesmerised by this voice of an Old Testament prophet who had reincarnated itself into modern times.The song I do at karaokeI’ve never been drawn to karaoke. I was talked into it in Japan, after copious amounts of whatever the hell was being drunk, and doing Tiptoe Through the Tulips by Tiny Tim. Japan is fascinating.

My cousins lived two blocks down the road. One day my mother got a call: they had something to show me. I cycled over and they played me Superstition by Stevie Wonder.

Can they maintain their hardcore ethos?Tom BreihanSun 26 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareOn a Wednesday evening in September, about 6,000 people cross footbridges to reach Brown’s Island, a bucolic park in the middle of the James River in Richmond, Virginia. They’re here to see Turnstile, the Baltimore band who came from the hardcore punk underground but whose reach expands far outside that world.Turnstile take the stage to a shimmering swell of keyboards – the intro from Never Enough, the title track from their new album. It’s a slow song by Turnstile standards, a tender confession of self-doubt that builds into a cathartic singalong. The moment that the song ends, Turnstile jump directly into TLC (Turnstile Love Connection), a frantic fist-pumper from 2021’s Glow On, and the crowd become a mass of flailing limbs. For the next hour-plus, bodies fly in all directions, as strangers scream lyrics into each other’s faces. Every new riff, every change in tempo, brings a fresh wave of sweaty euphoria.Turnstile gigs have been like this for years. In the early days, the band played dive bars and church halls, and the shows never took place entirely on stage. Frontman Brendan Yates would dive balletically into the crowd, and the stage would be a constant blur of people from the audience running up, grabbing the microphone to belt out a line or two and then leaping back off.View image in fullscreenStiling it out … Turnstile.Photograph: Trevor RobertsIn 2009, a teenage Yates dropped out of college to become the drummer for the mythically tough Baltimore hardcore band Trapped Under Ice. He formed Turnstile with close friends a year later, and the band had a tremendous underground buzz from the very beginning. By the time they released their full-length debut Nonstop Feeling in 2015, they were one of the biggest bands in hardcore. Where many of their peers went for heavy extremity, Turnstile’s dizzy hooks and colourful aesthetics set them apart. Before long, they started to attract fans far outside their subculture.When I saw my first Turnstile show at a Washington DC church hall in 2018, drummer Daniel Fang played in a hospital gown. He’d missed one Turnstile show because he’d injured himself while training for the tour. Fang tells the story as the band checks in on a Zoom call from a Mesa, Arizona hotel room a few weeks after the Richmond show. “The doctor was like: ‘You will have kidney failure if you go play the show. Don’t do that,’” Fang recalls. But he refused to miss the show, so he checked out of the hospital and drove himself. “I was delirious in pain, but then felt the kind of amplified beauty of it, too. It was so, so joyous.”The joy was what really struck me – not just the dedication it must have taken for Fang to check himself out of the hospital, but the rapture that Fang and his bandmates all clearly felt that night. It was one of the greatest performances I’ve ever witnessed. An image has lived in my head ever since: Yates jumping off the stage during the first song and seemingly hanging in the air for hours before completing a full flip and landing in the crowd. Gigs like that turned fans into evangelists, and the band’s momentum kept growing.Turnstile’s third album, 2021’s Glow On, was the breakout moment. For that album, the band worked with veteran pop producer Mike Elizondo and moved toward a sunnier sound, with shimmering hooks and percussive breakdowns, that was still rooted in hardcore catharsis. The record arrived just as Covid lockdowns ended, and its charged energy was infectious. Turnstile’s audience grew exponentially. They got Grammy nominations, toured arenas with Blink-182 and served as the sole rock band at rap festivals such as Rolling Loud in Miami.Earlier this year, just before the release of Never Enough, many thousands of people came to Turnstile’s free daytime show at Wyman Park Dell in their home town. Every moment was marked by friends and well-wishers rushing the stage, only to cartwheel or backflip right back off. These days, however, every Turnstile set can’t be like that. The crowds that come to see them are simply too big. They need to play venues with barriers between them and the fans, so they find ways to convey all that frenzied energy on their own. They always figure it out.Much of the magic of a hardcore show is in the lack of distinction between performers and crowd – the way the audience themselves become the show. When Turnstile play to thousands every night, they can’t recreate the feeling in the same way, but they find other ways to channel and direct that collective energy. “The biggest transition was learning how to make the show happen on the stage instead of us just being a part of the show,” says bassist Franz Lyons. “You start learning that you need to create the energy with all five of you, to just band together and display that right on the other side.”View image in fullscreenBassist Franz Lyons.Photograph: Trevor RobertsOnstage, the five members of Turnstile are always in motion: jumping, spinning, stomping, calling for the crowd to give them more. They sweat buckets, with dazed and victorious looks in their eyes. It’s exhausting just to watch, but when you’re near the front at a Turnstile show, you can’t really watch. You’re too busy careening around and crashing into people yourself.You don’t see a lot of upraised phones at Turnstile shows. People need to be alert. In the old days, someone could always jump offstage and land on your head. Even with the barriers preventing stagedives, a Turnstile gig is still a full-body immersion experience. But it’s welcoming, not forbidding. The giant screen at the back of the stage doesn’t often display what happens onstage. Instead, it shows the giddy, ecstatic faces of the people in the crowd: people of different backgrounds, races, ages and genders, all caught up in the moment.That utopian vision can’t always be maintained. Turnstile end the Richmond show with Birds, a community-minded rager from Never Enough: “Finally, I can see it! These birds not meant to fly alone!” During the breakdown, Yates demands: “Get up here!” People finally scramble over the barrier, joining the band on stage. But amid the rush of bodies, a sheriff’s deputy sprays one fan, a teenage boy, with a stream of pepper spray to the face in what appears to be a completely unwarranted display of force. Fumes from the spray visibly affect Lyons, who stops playing his bass and covers his face. Video of that moment goes viral. In the days that follow, Richmond’s sheriff claims that the incident is under internal investigation while refusing to answer reporters’ questions about it.View image in fullscreenSticky situation … drummer Daniel Fang.Photograph: Trevor RobertsYates still sounds upset when he reflects on the way the Richmond show ended. “A cowardly action from an officer coming in and spraying a 15-year-old kid and then walking away – I don’t think that’s an isolated event,” he says. “But at our shows, it was a new thing. It’s something that we strive to keep away.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Sometimes, it’s the nature of big events and people coming together.”At this point, every Turnstile show is a big event. Their North American tour is a labour of love. They have sought out venues without seats, sometimes developing whole new venues when those spaces don’t exist in those cities. “The Denver show was just a stage under a bridge, and it was the first time they’d done a show there,” says Yates. “In LA, we just built a stage in a big park.” The band carefully curated the tour lineup, which covers a wide spectrum. The glitchy pop experimenter Jane Remover and the swaggering Australian heavy hardcore band Speed are on board for the entire run, with groups such as Melbourne’s Amyl and the Sniffers and Philadelphia’s Mannequin Pussy jumping aboard at different points. In November, the band will take a version of the tour to the UK and Europe, with heart-on-sleeve London rockers High Vis and experimental California thrashers the Garden opening.View image in fullscreenString theory … guitarist Meg Mills.Photograph: Trevor RobertsYates says that Turnstile always seek out tourmates that share “a connected thread” with the band: “Sometimes, it’s sonic threads. Sometimes, it’s an ethos thread, or something that’s sonically exciting that pairs together and creates something that feels like it could be really interesting. It gives everyone an opportunity to come and bring different people out and experience new things – but not in a random way, in a very intentional way.”Turnstile: Never Enough review – flute solos and formidable tunes from hardcore punk’s great crossover bandRead moreThat intentionality extends to Turnstile’s music. It’s still rooted in that explosive catharsis of hardcore, but lots of other sounds shine through: dance music, synthpop, funk. Never Enough has flute from London jazz great Shabaka Hutchings, vocals from Paramore’s Hayley Williams and singer-songwriter Faye Webster, and production from Charli xcx collaborator AG Cook. One highlight is Look Out for Me, an expansive, seven-minute odyssey that veers from crisp, mosh-ready riffage into the homegrown house subgenre known as Baltimore club music. Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes contributed to the last two Turnstile albums. At the Richmond show, Hynes plays an opening set and gets a roar from the crowd when he joins Turnstile for Alien Love Call, his 2021 duet with Yates.Even as Turnstile venture further afield from the hardcore underground that birthed them, their live shows still stand as expressions of community. It’s not easy to maintain that feeling when you’re playing to thousands every night, but Turnstile remain rooted in the city and the scene where they started. Other than new guitarist Meg Mills, a veteran of UK punk bands like Big Cheese and Chubby and the Gang, all of them still live in Baltimore. Yates still plays drums for his old band Trapped Under Ice whenever he gets the chance, and Lyons often joins them on stage.View image in fullscreenFeeling blue … singer Brendan Yates.Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty ImagesLyons’ bandmates marvel that Lyons is “in the mix all the time”, that he’ll still have the energy to hit a local punk show right after returning from a tour. “These are the things that I actually love to do, just like everybody else [in the band] loves to do,” says Lyons. “The passion for that, it doesn’t stop at being in our band.”That passion extends outward. It’s infectious. “I’m continuously seeing them do new things that I’ve never seen,” says Trapped Under Ice and Angel Du$t frontman Justice Tripp, a big-brother figure to the members of Turnstile, calling in from his tour van. “I’ve seen every young band from Baltimore brainstorming what they can do to have an impact like that. It causes waves. It causes people to step outside what they know and redesign what it means to be an artist and contributing to our culture or your city.”Yates insists that Turnstile don’t have a gameplan: “We try to maintain a level of appreciation for the present. Focusing too far ahead doesn’t really do much for you.” It makes sense. Nobody could’ve plotted Turnstile’s rise from church halls to festival stages. It’s the kind of thing that can only happen through sweat, dedication and an absolute belief in what they’re doing.When Turnstile members talk about playing live, they sometimes speak in almost mystical terms. Lyons says: “It’s been years in the making – learning how to really work on that chemistry and togetherness, making the energy onstage so much that it can touch the people who are on the other side.”Turnstile tour the UK and Ireland from 1 to 5 November; tour startsDublin.

And even if the reason for their disappearance is infinitely far removed from the things themselves – as far removed, say, as the crimes of the German Wehrmacht are from German coffee, which is always far too weak, served in those pear-shaped pots it always tried to trickle down until it was held in check by the drip catcher, a little roll of foam rubber on an elastic band decorated with a butterfly, a doll, or a pearl perched atop the lid of the pot, a little thing that protected white tablecloths in Germany from coffee stains until the mid-1970s – even then, no matter how far removed the thing itself might be from the custom, the invention, or the revolution that leads to its disappearance, that disappearance creates a bond that could not be tighter. For example, the Berlin painter Heinrich Zille once said that you could kill a person with an apartment just as easily as with an axe.So the little roll of foam rubber and its elastic bridle end up in the trash, which means that now Germans are rich enough to afford vacations in Italy again and to bring back espresso makers in their luggage when they return. Just as every thing, no matter how simple, contains within it all the knowledge of its time, just as everything you can’t touch is contained in a spool of darning thread, for example: in the same way, whenever a thing disappears from everyday life, much more has disappeared than the thing itself – the way of thinking that goes with it has disappeared, and the way of feeling, the sense of what’s appropriate and what’s not, what you can afford and what’s beyond your means. We don’t have darning thread any more! Really, why? People shouldn’t darn their tights, they should buy new ones!View image in fullscreenJenny Erpenbeck.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty ImagesThingsEach time I take a long trip, I lose at least one scarf or hat, sometimes even a pair of sunglasses or a watch. I’ve also lost a number of things when moving house: a piece of moulding from an old rustic wardrobe, a few blinds, and once I even lost the typewriter I used to write my first works. Although the hotel rooms I left were small, and the apartments I left were clearly empty, the things were still missing later; somehow, somewhere, they had disappeared in the no man’s land between departure and arrival, it happened so regularly that I began to expect it when packing my suitcase or my boxes, as if it were a sacrifice, a price I had to pay for the change in my circumstances, and in that respect, despite all the randomness, it was still appropriate. However, in the course of my everyday life, the number of things around me never decreased, but rather increased, the piles grew higher, the folders thicker, I could imagine that a fire would break out and I would tuck my diaries, letters, and photo albums under my arm and run out of the house, but fortunately no fire broke out.Recently, a Russian woman came to visit me. She moved to Germany a year ago with four children. A piano, how lovely! she says as she enters my apartment. Books, how lovely! A few steps further on, she points to a few of my son’s drawings hanging on the wall and says: Lovely! She adds: It’s lovely to have something like that. At first, I don’t understand what she means; after all, she has four children herself. Well, she says and smiles, you can’t take it all with you. Sure, sure, I say. So, she says, still smiling, we made a big bonfire, we all sat around it, then we took page after page in our hands, we looked at everything again and remembered who drew this or that, how old he or she was at the time, we enjoyed it together one last time, and then we burned it all. It was a lovely bonfire, we were singing. I don’t say anything now. You can’t take it all with you, she repeats and says with a smile: We left with four children and two large suitcases. That was all.A Better World“How often in grey hours, O glorious art, / When life ensnares me in its circle wild, / Hast thou enkindled love within my heart / And raptured me into a better world!” – these are the words to one of Schubert’s songs. But I have to: call the insurance company, go to the doctor, the car has a red emissions sticker, do you want digital cable? Sign a form for the child, book the flight to X, which hotel, have you ever played the lottery? Photos for my passport, please submit the direct debit authorisation in writing by mail or fax, buy plants for the balcony, take out the trash, do the laundry, load the dishwasher, pack my suitcase.What are you working on at the moment?This is the phone company, Mr Müller speaking. Pick up a book at the bookstore, buy stamps, buy hay for the animals, someone will be picking up the key, register the child for the swim meet, take out the trash, do the laundry, load the dishwasher, pack my suitcase. Buy water. Where’s my car? Where’s the key to the apartment? Why won’t the cassette player eject the cassette? Get a hepatitis A booster, make an appointment with the ophthalmologist, make an appointment with the gynaecologist, make an appointment with the pediatrician.You must be writing something new by now, right?Pack my suitcase. Which hotel? Where are my sunglasses? The bread is mouldy. My car has a red emissions sticker. Take out the trash, do the laundry, load the dishwasher, pack my suitcase. Buy potting soil. Plant flowers. It’s his birthday, it’s her birthday, please pay the bill within 7 days, and a parking ticket, you can contest it, where’s the school trip going, pick up a book, pick up photos, buy water.You’ll have something new for us to read soon, right?Trash, laundry, dishes. Who’s going to water the flowers? Get the summer clothes out of the cellar, leave the key, pack the suitcase. Which city? Forgot my cellphone charger.Do you know what your next book will be called?Why doesn’t the video camera show the picture when it’s recording any more? Good evening, Meier speaking, we’re doing a survey. Gas up the car, a package for you, call the bank, book the babysitter for Friday, pay the bill, change the lightbulb, hang up the wet towels, book the flight, sign here, please fill out the application by hand, why is my bike rattling, buy stamps, buy hay for the animals.When is your new novel coming out?My new novel, I’d say, right, right, I’m in the thick of it right now, in the new novel, head over heels, working, working on the new novel, I mean. Because what else can it mean when life’s wild circle is whirling around me with its two demented circular knitting needles, when it’s been whirling around me for some time now, when life’s wild circle has almost completely knitted me up, what else can it mean but that the moment of rapture has in fact long since arrived, that the rapture has long since been as deep inside me as possible.This is an extract from Things That Disappear: Reflections and Memories by Jenny Erpenbeck, translated by Kurt Beals, published by Granta on 6 November.Explore more on these topicsFictionShort storiesextractsShareReuse this content"

But while that idea lacks coherence, the sketches and medleys are buoyantly performedMark FisherSun 26 Oct 2025 10.31 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 10.32 EDTShareThe piano is full of feathers to keep the noise down.Irving Berlinliked to write at night and the feathers were his way to dampen the strings so as not to annoy the neighbours. It is also full of feathers, in Jane Livingstone’s play about the writing and impact ofWhite Christmas, to suggest an imminent snow fall – although, oddly, when the singalong finale comes, it is to a flurry of regular stage snow.Also odd is that a play about the world’s most famous Christmas song should be staged in October. No matter: April Chamberlain’s production has the feel of a show that will be revived in festive seasons to come.Is that a good thing? Well, it is an innocent enough excuse to run through the Berlin songbook, pluckily sung by Frances Thorburn and Ross Forbes-MacKenzie with some lovely harmonies by musical director Hilary Brooks. From the plangent When I Lost You to the polemical Supper Time, with detours to the patriotic God Bless America and the light-hearted Sisters, there is much here to enjoy.As a play, though, it is all over the place. First we get a false start in which Thorburn appears as Moneta, the Roman goddess of memory, introducing a theme about the past that is forgotten as quickly as her white robes. Then Forbes-MacKenzie enters through the auditorium, meek and apologetic with suit and briefcase, but takes an age to declare his purpose. Having arrived at New York’sTin Pan Alley, he eventually admits to being the human embodiment of White Christmas.View image in fullscreenJolly medley … Frances Thorburn and Ross Forbes-MacKenzie.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicIt is a novel idea, but inconsistently applied. Structured as a series of sketches, Livingstone’s play is sometimes the story of the song itself, with its “27 simple lines”, and sometimes the story of the composer, an impoverished immigrant who could play only the black notes on the keyboard.Coming across like an illustrated Wikipedia page, A Piano Full of Feathers is too piecemeal either to be dramatically coherent or to give its sentimental moments emotional weight. Frequently, the pretence of a story is abandoned altogether in favour of a jolly medley of songs which, along with the buoyant performances, are the production’s chief strength.At Perth theatre until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

God-fearing Alannah (Rachael Rooney, her angular movements like a frightened bird) is scrubbing the cooker with a toothbrush when her muddy-booted, foul-mouthed, IRA-recruited little sister Fianna (Meghan Tyler, also the play’s writer; wildness written all over them) bursts in through the window of their childhood home. This fearless revenge play has a taste for chaos, transforming a biting domestic drama into a surreal, gruesome horror.First performed at Edinburgh’s Traverse in 2019 and set over one stormy night in 1980s southArmagh, this new production is a revelatory character study of these two troubled sisters. Tensions start high and keep climbing. Gun-wielding Brits roam the streets outside, while inside, Alannah tiptoes under the rule of their abusive, now-paralysed father (Stephen Kennedy, with a slippery, sinister entrance, the fear of him built up before he even gets on stage).View image in fullscreenSinister … Meghan Tyler as Fianna and Rachael Rooney as Alannah, with Stephen Kennedy as Da.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAfter serving time for a crime both women feel guilty over, Fianna’s reappearance sets off a tornado of violence in Alannah’s small and pious life, in which she cleans every speck of dust and slurps alcohol like air. Under Mehmet Ergen’s direction, we recognise both sisters entirely; when Fianna tries to get Alannah to loosen up, the younger sibling is easy and free, the older tight-hipped, ever inward. Through piercing, bitterly comic conversation, they reveal the damage done to them by patriarchal, colonial powers – here, their father and the soldiers (James Pedley-Holden) are rolled into one monstrous enemy – and in the tipsy haze of hatred, agree to put things right.Tyler’s black comedy is unafraid to take wild, deadly leaps. The sisters drink the house dry, their father’s beastliness is fully realised, and Merve Yörük’s attentive design of a pristine kitchen-living room is quickly covered in a mess far harder to clean up than Fianna’s dirty boot prints. Though some of the carefully won clarity and tension slips as the hallucinatory final scenes flirt with the ridiculous, the merciless guts, macabre humour and justice-driven bloodlust create a vice-like hold on our attention. Gloriously gory, Crocodile Fever offers the dark delight of watching these sisters tear their past limb from limb.At Arcola theatre, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Later, when Rawlings straps on a harmonica, his musical partner quips: “That’s all you get by way of costume changes from us.” The “show” comes in the playing, the performance and 23 songs which cast a magical spell for (including interval and encores) just short of three hours.After playing on each other’s albums for years, last year’s stellarWoodlandalbum cemented the pair’s more recent emergence as a classic American acoustic singing duo. They complement each other perfectly. Stetson-topped Rawlings fingerpicks and grapples with his vintage guitar as if it is a wriggling animal, while Welch strums purposely in a flowing dress that could be straight from a spaghetti western. Rawlings’s voice is beautifully plaintive with shades of Cat Stevens while Welch’s stirring vocals evoke mountain ranges, open skies, railroads.Occasionally joined by upright bassist Paul Kowert (the stool is for him to rest his bow), the duo share lead and harmonies to deliver largely sad themes such as loss, the songs’ yearning power interspersed with jokey banter. When Rawlings is tuning up, Welch quips: “Oh, God. Do I have to tell a joke now?”View image in fullscreenEncore follows encore … David Rawlings and Gillian Welch with bassist Paul Kowert.Photograph: Mike AinscoeNumerous highlights include Rawlings’s aching Ruby, Welch’s wistful What We Had or the mesmeric, pointed The Way It Will Be, about the effects of war. The pair aren’t known for political statements, but a sudden segue into Woody Guthrie’s This Land Is Your Land feels pointed and is rapturously received.Encore follows encore — Elvis Presley Blues, Look at Miss Ohio – as neither crowd or artists want the show to end. With the house lights up, Rawlings asks for “one more diddy one”, which turns out to be a sublime rendition of Jefferson Airplane’s psychedelic-era anthem White Rabbit. An unforgettable evening from two artists in love with what they do and at the peak of their powers.At London Palladium, tonight and 27 October, and Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicAmericanaGillian WelchDavid RawlingsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But, when made with care, the crunchy meat, tangy sauce and sweet fruit will remind you why you fell for it in the first place.Prep20 minMarinate30 min+Cook10 minServes2For the marinade200g pork loin or lean shoulder1 garlic clove1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp rice wine, or dry sherry½ tsp salt¼ tsp Chinese five-spice powder(optional)To cook1 onion, peeled1 green pepper, stalk, seeds and pith discarded1 mild red chilli1 egg60g cornflour, plus extra to coatNeutral oil, for frying100g pineapple chunksFor the sauce2 tbsp apricot jam– the lower in sugar, the better1 tbsp cranberry sauce– ditto1 good squeeze lemon or lime juice25-40g soft light brown sugar2½ tbsp Chinese red vinegar, or rice vinegar1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp cornflour, or potato starch1 Alternatives to porkView image in fullscreenI’ve chosen to make this with pork (spare ribs also work well, if you don’t mind a bone; if possible, get your butcher to chop them up), but chicken thigh or breast, chunks of firm white fish or firm tofu would also work well. Anything that can be battered and fried without giving off too much water is a safe bet.2 Marinate the meatView image in fullscreenCut the pork into strips about 1cm wide, then peel and crush the garlic. Put both in a bowl, toss with the soy, rice wine, salt and five-spice powder (if using), cover and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes (cover and put in the fridge if you’re leaving it to sit for longer).3 Mix the sauceView image in fullscreenWhile the pork sits, prepare the sauce by stirring the preserves, then add the citrus juice and sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then mix in the vinegar, soy and 90ml water. Season to taste, adding more sugar, if you like. Use another small bowl to stir the cornflour into a teaspoon of cold water.4 Chop the vegView image in fullscreenCut the onion and pepper into chunky diamonds, separating the onion layers as you go. Slice the chilli into rings. If you like, add other vegetables to the mix, too (Tenderstem or mangetout would be nice); just make sure they’re sliced thinly enough to stir-fry without overcooking the other ingredients.5 Prepare the batterView image in fullscreenBeat the egg in a bowl, gradually whisk this into 60g cornflour until you have a smooth batter, then season. Spread some more cornflour on a plate, then put both the bowl and plate near the hob. Add another tablespoon of cornflour to the marinated pork, and toss until the meat is coated.6 Heat the oilView image in fullscreenPour enough neutral oil into a large pan, wok or fryer to fill it by a third, then heat it up to 180C (digital thermometers are cheaper than oil and will ensure you get good results). Once the oil is nearly at temperature, dunk the pork in the batter, then shake off any excess and roll it in the plate of cornflour to coat.7 Fry the porkFry the pork in the hot oil for three minutes, until golden (it will be fried again later, so don’t go too dark at this point or you’ll overcook the meat), then lift out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Keep the oil warm on a low heat while you make the sauce.8 Cook the sauceView image in fullscreenHeat a tablespoon of neutral oil in a wok until smoking, then stir-fry the onion, pepper and chilli until softened. Tip in the sauce mixture, bring to a boil, then stir in the cornflour-and-water mixture and cook until the mix thickens. Add the pineapple, turn down the heat to low, and keep warm.9 Finishing touchesView image in fullscreenHeat the same pork oil to 190C and fry the meat again, this time for just 30 seconds, until golden brown. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and transfer to the sauce. Turn up the heat, toss to combine, then tip out on to a platter. Serve with egg-fried rice and perhaps something fresh and green.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassPorkMeatMain courseChinese food and drinkSauces and graviesVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Quaint isn’t a word I use often, but nor do I eat at many places with a spacious upstairs bar area that doubles as a yoga studio. Go for the spice bag potatoes with tropea onions and roast chilli, stay for the 45-minute flow yoga with Amanda.Actually, scrap that: do not even dream of pulling shapes after eating too many spiced onions. Leave it a couple of hours. Still, whatever it is that chef Tobias Godfrey and his co-owner and partner, Laura Day, are offering, the locals are clearly loving it, because on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago, the place was orderly bedlam. Word has clearly spread that Fête was last month named runner-up restaurant of the year in Essex Life’s 2025food and drink awards, and ladies wearing Friday-night tops were dining in droves and ordering rounds of matcha margaritas and maple martinis.View image in fullscreenFête’s bowl of ‘balm-like’ burrata also features figs, hot honey, pistachios and beetroot.Fête’s road to taking the Chelmsford dining scene by storm has been largely ignored by nearby trendy London, which is a scene that celebrates only itself. Essex is only a few miles away, but the great and the good are scarred by too many stories of local restaurants boasting helium balloon arches, bottomless brunches, walls of plastic greenery andGemma from Towiedrinking Aperol spritz, not to mention too many old-fashioned, and definitely “old hat” country pubs serving venison on celeriac puree to lads with new hair from Turkey. The cool, metropolitan crowd avoid these places unless a London chef takes the helm.For what it’s worth, Iloveboth these aspects of Essex, which may explain why I was so pleasantly jollied by Fête’s eclectic menu, where Taiwanese chicken bao sits side by side with Kashmiri scallops, and where duck-fried rice with kimchi and mac and cheese with guanciale nestle cosily together on the small plates menu, all casual like, as if they aren’t from entirely different continents.Perhaps Fête, which is open all day, and serves this lengthier, more complex menu on Friday and Saturday evenings, has caused such a stir because it absolutely dares to be different, focusing on big, hearty, pan-global flavours, rather than any narrow theme. For so-called “small plates”, the portions are whopping, too, and we ordered far too much. Take the bowl of pale, wobbly, balm-like burrata laden with figs and hot honey, which also featured generous amounts of pistachio and layers of beetroot, and came with a slab of sourdough toast. Next up, a giant-sized beef tartare, made rather strangely with wholly unnecessary mayo, that had a great, acidic bite of capers and cornichons, and turned up on another big slice of bread. Godfrey clearly sets out to throw as much flavour on a plate as possible, so this tartare also came with crispy kale and wobbly egg yolk.View image in fullscreenFête’s ‘irresitible’ and ‘ridiculously generous’ portion of duck-fried rice.The idea of that duck-fried rice proved irresistible and was, again, ridiculously generous, and came topped with a fried egg, kimchi, XO sauce, chilli and kimchi furikake. One cannot doubt Godfrey’s devotion to taking his customers on a whistle-stop tour of the entire culinary cosmos, but hang on to your hats for the gear changes when your battered sausages with mustard are followed by a Taiwanese bao with a side of winter tomatoes in cashew cream. There’s something so endearingly adventurous and devil-may-care about this menu that makes me love the place.The front-of-house are jolly, friendly and, above all, clearly happy. The kitchen zings with an enthusiasm that speaks of a bunch of mates having the time of their lives, and who can’t quite believe that their dream of serving scallops in Kashmiri curry alongside a French-style vegan courgette cassoulet is actually paying dividends, and that they’ve become the hottest place for miles around as a result.Is the cooking perfect? No. By doing so much on every plate, there are flaws, and tweaks to be made, if you’re being picky. A piece of kingfish with burnt butter, preserved lemon and capers, for instance, was overcooked and the mega-chunk of beef tartare wasn’t hugely balanced. Yet I was still smiling by the time we were handed the dessert list and its banana parfait, sticky toffee pudding and house sorbet, before opting for the chocolate fondant with honeycomb and burnt butter ice-cream. Sure, by this point, we’d eaten far too much, but we still found room for this piece of hedonism.Fête is a welcome slice of unpretentious hospitality happiness. The only way isn’t Essex, but if it were, I wouldn’t complain.Fête10-13 Grays Brewery Yard, Chelmsford, Essex,hello@fetegraysyard.co.uk(no phone).
