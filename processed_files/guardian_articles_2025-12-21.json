It’s a crass affair with a thin, half-hearted performance from SharpeLucy ManganSun 21 Dec 2025 17.00 ESTShareHere’s my position. If you are going to create a miniseries about the life, death and music of one of the defining geniuses of the last 1,000 years of western civilisation, and if you are going to use as your source material a script for a great play that was made into a near-perfect film beloved by almost everyone for its wit and immense, profound themes rendered accessible and moving, and for the fact that it had two of the most extraordinary performances ever committed to what may still then have been celluloid – well, you had better be pretty damn sure that you are bringing something new, exciting, different, richer, cleverer, even more illuminating to the table. Otherwise you are going to look like a bit of a berk.And so, my friends, to the new six-part drama Amadeus, about the life, death and music of Wolfgang A Mozart, one of the defining geniuses of the last 1,000 years of western history. Co-creators Joe Barton and Julian Farino have retained parts of Peter Shaffer’s 1979 play and the 1984 film starring Tom Hulce as Mozart and F Murray Abraham as his rival composer Antonio Salieri, reworked them into lesser forms, and surrounded them with lesser – flat, airless, banal – scenes. Shaffer’s driving interests in the corrupting power of envy, the survival of religious faith under duress, the mystery of talent and what we expect to come from genius are mostly reduced to pale, petty versions of themselves. The performances – well, we’ll come to those.View image in fullscreenOne of the defining geniuses of the last 1,000 years … Will Sharpe as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Amadeus.Photograph: Sky studios/PAThe main narrative is told as a confession by an aged Salieri (Paul Bettany) to Mozart’s widow, Constanze, instead of the film and play’s priest. He is clearing his conscience, not endangering his soul. It is an early, telling, lowering of the stakes. When the main narrative does begin, we meet Mozart (The White Lotus’s Will Sharpe) as he falls out of a carriage and pukes in the street in front of the daughters of his landlady-to-be. It is 1781 – 10 years before his death, a caption tells us – and he has arrived in Vienna from Salzburg, leaving his furious father behind, keen to make a name for himself in the new city and confident that he will.And he’s right to be. Soon he is playing in front of the emperor (Rory Kinnear) and enthralling all with his talent while Salieri stares in incredulity and embryonic despair, then goes home to try to compose something that will rival what this new boy can do. But Salieri’s tragedy is of course that he knows, even before days spent toiling at his harpsichord, slaving over an empty stave, that he cannot – that the life he knew is effectively over. That he is the only one at court with the talent to recognise Mozart as a world-changing genius is only the bitter icing on an already poisonous cake. The rotting cherry on top is that Mozart is not the sophisticated, semi-ethereal being he should be but “a repulsive creature” who, in the court composer’s disbelieving eyes, cannot deserve this gift from God.View image in fullscreenNo more reworkings in 2026 please … Will Sharpe as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Gabrielle Creevy as Constanze Mozart.Photograph: Sky studios/PAFrom there, we watch Salieri’s bitterness and his work to undermine Mozart increase, while Mozart enjoys initial success then falls into penury – partly thanks to Salieri’s machinations and partly thanks to his own arrogance and idiocies.There is so little to grab on to throughout, let alone to love. Emblematic of its crassness – de facto, but more so in comparison to the film – is the famous moment when Constanze brings Salieri the manuscripts of Mozart’s work that he has asked for. Can he keep them for a while, he asks? And she says no, because they are originals and he doesn’t make copies. Do you remember the speech from Salieri that originally accompanied this moment? “Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase and the structure would fall” – that one? Here, the camera simply pans from Mozart’s immaculate pages to Salieri’s papers full of crossings-out. And that, at best, is where we are throughout the six episodes – ever striving to make the ineffable effable. “Diminishment” does not begin to cover it.Bettany as Salieri does well with a script that offers him no chance to compete with F Murray Abraham’s Oscar-winning performance. Sharpe as Mozart is, likewise, hampered, but even controlling for the script’s banality, his performance is a thin, half-hearted thing. His Mozart looks and sounds for all the world like Richard Ayoade’s Moss in The IT Crowd – effectively a milquetoast with a drink problem, which in turn makes Salieri’s “repulsive creature” sound like an overreaction and his abandonment of God over choosing to let genius reside there faintly ridiculous.It makes you hope that 2026 will be the year of new thoughts, new dramas and no more reworkings. Especially not of Amadeus.Amadeus aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK, and can be streamed on Binge in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewWolfgang Amadeus MozartPeter ShafferreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is just one problem: for the most part, it has not happened.Apart from a very concentrated spike in bike use during Covid, the level of cycle trips in England hasstayed broadly staticfor years, and things do not appear to be changing.In December, Bromptonreported thelowest annual sales of its eponymous folding bikes since 2021. Statistics from the Bicycle Association, the trade body for the bike industry in Britain,show that in 2024, fewer conventional bikes were bought than in any other year this century.View image in fullscreenA Brompton bike in the City of London. The company reported its lowest annual sales since 2021.Photograph: Richard Baker/Alamy“If you look at the sales of pedal cycles since 2010, there isn’t a year except the Covid year when sales haven’t declined. I’m always puzzled that people in the industry aren’t more alarmed about that,” says Phillip Darnton, executive chair of the Bicycle Association.It is, however, not a picture of unqualified gloom. London is experiencing asustained cycling boom, now at nearly 1.5m trips a day, 43% higher than 2019. A handful of other places have seen increases in bike use, albeit less spectacularly.Buried within this mix of statistics are a handful of apparent lessons. To find them, it helps first to think about the different types of cyclists on our roads.Leisure riders – the fabled middle-aged pedallers snaking through the Surrey Hills or Peak District in DayGlo Lycra come rain or shine – can only ever be a small part of what makes a cycling nation.Others include those who cycle every day for transport, and experts agree these people will only cycle if they feel it is safe, which requires long-term investment in infrastructure. Finally, with the advent of ebikes and dockless hire networks such as Lime, cycling is changing at speed – but some say the government is not, as yet, keeping pace.View image in fullscreenMountain biking in the Peak District national park.Photograph: jonpic/Getty ImagesAdam Tranter, who runs a PR agency that works with cycling brands and was formerly the walking and cycling commissioner for the West Midlands, points to the gradual shift in higher-end bike sales from traditional road bikes to so-called gravel bikes, designed to be ridden off-road, and to sophisticated indoor trainers, where people race against each other virtually.“All this is a code for people saying, ‘I don’t like being near cars as I don’t feel safe’,” he says. “Whichever way you look at it, you can’t reach the potential of cycling without making it much more safe and hospitable to cycle. It all comes down to that basic fact.”While Westminster governments have see-sawed between a relative enthusiasm for cycling under Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer to thetransport culture warsandconspiraciesof Rishi Sunak, in contrast, London has seen more than two decades of support under the mayoralties of Ken Livingstone, Johnson and then Sadiq Khan.“For things to really change you need strong, consistent political leadership over a sustained period of time,” a senior figure in the cycle policy world says. “If you have consistent investment you can also attract and keep the talent and skills you need to make cycling work in somewhere as ancient and tightly packed asLondon. These people aren’t easy to find.”This year, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain will sell more than 5m electric bikes between them. We’ll be lucky if we sell 150,000Phillip Darnton, Bicycle AssociationLondon does, of course, also have a concentrated population and disincentives to driving, including the congestion charge and a network of low-traffic neighbourhoods in many boroughs.As anyone who has been in London recently will know, as well as growing in size, the swarms of cyclists are also changing in type, including more people on electric-assist bikes, including hire versions such as the ubiquitous Lime models.Within this are a distinct breed of machine: often startlingly rapid electric contraptions powered by vast rear-wheel hub motors and a collection of zip-tied batteries, many ridden by gig economy riders for delivery companies. These are not ebikes, which are strictly defined by law. They are in effect a form of electric motorbike, entirely illegal but rarely challenged by police.“It’s a massive image problem for cycling because more or less everyone conflates the two things,” Tranter says. “You could tackle this more or less overnight by forcing delivery companies to make checks, for example monitoring riders’ speeds. But it seems we’d rather just moan about it.”This new technological world means sales of conventional bikes are falling throughout Europe. The difference is that in many other countries, the balance is being made up by sales of legal ebikes.View image in fullscreenA Lime rental electric bike in London – some see the popularity as ‘a problem to solve, not a huge success story for active mobility’.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPADarnton says: “This year, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain will sell more than 5m electric bikes between them. We might be lucky if we sell 150,000 here.”Much of this is down to other countries having safer road conditions for cycling, plus subsidies to help people buy sometimes expensive ebikes, the sort of scheme thus far only applied to electric cars and motorbikes in the UK.But beyond this, ebikes have something of an image problem, something shaped by a mix of personal experience or media coverage.Tranter says: “With hire bikes, the issue is mainly their sheer popularity – as numbers grow so does the number of idiots, like any other transport mode. But we have ended up with their popularity being seen as a problem to solve, not a huge success story for active mobility.”Chris Whitty says culture-war coverage of cycling could harm nation’s healthRead moreAdded to this is the near-unchecked use of illegal electric bikes, many made in China, which are often dangerously quick and, unlike legal models, can havealarmingly combustible batteries.Darnton says: “People read that ebikes are dangerous and they believe it. And if your landlord says you can’t bring it on to the property, or your employer says you can’t park it in the underground car park, which is increasingly the case, then you won’t get one.“In London, if you ask someone under about 35 if they are thinking of buying a bike they’ll say, ‘Why? I’ve got one at the end of the road.’He adds: “Existential is this rather ghastly word, but it’s true: unless we can do what Europe does, what is going to happen to the UK cycle market is it’s going to be a leisure market, like golf or tennis or badminton or anything else.”Explore more on these topicsCyclingLondonHealthTransport policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Using the built-in features and easily available additional apps, there are plenty of clever things you can do with your smartphone.Turn your phone into a tape measureThe iPhone’s Measure app uses augmented reality and the device’s camera to calculate everything from ceiling heights to room dimensions – handy for those DIY tasks that require a quick decision. And, good news for parents,Applealso points out that you can use it to measure a person’s height: the digital equivalent of etched markings on the wall.Become a detectoristMetal detectors cost a pretty penny, but many modern devices have built-in magnetometers designed to help improve the accuracy of GPS within apps. Those magnetometers are also used in metal detectors, and some apps can harness that tech to detect metal. These apps are never going to be as accurate as tailor-made products, but if you are looking for a way to entertain the kids on a day at the beach, they will more than suffice in seeking out small bits of treasure.Turn it into a remote controlView image in fullscreenRemote control … smartphones can operate your other connected media devices.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesLost the television remote down the back of the sofa again? ManyAndroidphones include an infrared blaster that can mimic the signals from your TV, set-top box or air-conditioning remote, while others can talk to smart devices over wifi or Bluetooth. Download a remote control app, point your phone at the screen, and you can adjust the volume, switch inputs or change channels. Link in smart lights, speakers and streaming sticks and your handset becomes a control centre for the whole living room … though it does make it easier for teenagers to prank you by changing channel mid-episode.Digitise your old holiday snapsGot a load of old photographic negatives that you never got round to having developed – or worse, lost the prints for?Appssuch as FilmBox, available on iOS and Android, can turn your negatives into digital photos (provided you shine light through them). Even better, you can then use image-editing apps to fine-tune the colour balance on old, washed-out pics.Don’t get stuck on hold to companiesSome companies now offer a callback service so you don’t have to stay on hold for ages, but if they don’t, you can use your phone to do the same thing. TheHold Assist feature, available on iPhones running iOS 26, gives you a notification when it hears a human voice on the other end of the line, so you can get back to work safe in the knowledge you won’t miss your turn.Create 3D scans of objectsNewer iPhones and some Android handsets have depth sensors such as lidar (light detection and ranging) that can map the world in 3D. Install a scanning app, slowly walk around the object or room you want to capture, and your phone will stitch those readings into a detailed 3D model. You can then export it for 3D printing, game design or simply to keep a precise digital copy of bulky items before you sell or recycle them. It is also a neat way to document the contents of a rented flat for insurance purposes, or capture awkward corners when planning renovations.Map and record hikes without mobile signalIf you are an outdoorsy type, phones can help keep you on key routes and out of danger. Make sure you download offline maps before you go somewhere remote, and your phone’s GPS will still work without reception. Hiking and cycling apps can track your route, elevation and distance, then save it so you can retrace your steps – or share it with friends later.Create a stethoscopeCombined with smartwatches, smartphones have become a boon for those wanting to keep track of their health, but it’s possible to go even further. A2022 trialto see whether a smartphone’s microphone could accurately measure heartbeats – similar to how a stethoscope works – demonstrated that “mobile technologies are aviable way of recording heart sounds”. A commercial “cardiac screening tool” app isalready availablein the US.Help yourself get to sleepSome people spend money on white noise machines and then cart them around in their suitcase when they are travelling. But it’s possible to achieve the same benefit with your iPhone. Simply go to the accessibility section in your device’s settings, then tap on audio & visual. You can then turn on a variety of sounds, from white noise to ocean waves to crackling fire, to lull you to sleep.Match that tricky paint colourTrying to repaint a wall without the original tin to hand can feel impossible. Instead of juggling paper swatches, use your phone’s camera and a colour-matching app to sample the shade directly from the wall, or cushion, or curtain, or whatever you like. The software will suggest the closest equivalents from major paint ranges, and some apps also let you preview those colours on a photo of your space, combining paint matching and augmented reality in one go.Live translate menus, signs and handwritingOn a foreign holiday and not sure what to eat or where to go? Live translation capabilities in apps such asGoogleTranslate mean that it need not all be Greek to you. A combination of image recognition and live translation tools can identify foreign symbols and transpose English-language translations over the top of them, so you should never end up with an unexpected surprise for dinner.Identify unknown plantsView image in fullscreenPlant-spotter … apps can identify plants, animals and other objects.Photograph: Evgeniia Siiankovskaia/Getty ImagesNot sure what is growing along your boundary wall, or what kind of cactus you have just bought? AI-powered insights from your smartphone’s camera lens can identify plants, animals and other objects, with surprising accuracy. Specialist apps abound for identifying plants, but the catch-all service provided by Google Lens is a surprisingly accurate way to distinguish your hydrangeas from your hosteas.Amp up your webcamBuilt-in cameras on all but the most expensive laptops and PCs are low-resolution and cope poorly in low-light conditions, meaning you’re blighted with the curse of blurry Zoom calls. Smartphone cameras are way more souped-up, and have automated processing that constantly tries to improve your image quality, making them ideal for replacing your webcam. On iPhones and Mac computers, you need tolook for the Handoff feature. On Android devices and Windows, follow the instructions in the “Link to Windows” app to set it up.Measure sound levelsIf you have noisy neighbours or need to keep track of how much noise builders are subjecting you to, a slew of decibel-measuring apps are available. They are surprisingly accurate thanks to plenty of training, and some councils will even encourage complainants to download them and log intrusions if they are in dispute with neighbours.Make an ad hoc smart homeNear-field communication (NFC) is mostly associated with tap-to-pay transactions, but cheap NFC stickers (you can get 50 for less than £10 online) can act as programmable buttons for your life. Stick one by the front door and set your phone to turn on the wifi and lights when you tap it; put another on your bedside table to start a sleep playlist and enable Do Not Disturb. With a little experimentation, you can build simple smart home routines without buying a hub.Hang paintings straightIf you have ever hung a picture, stepped back and realised it is slightly wonky, your phone can spare you constant tinkering. Many handsets include a built-in spirit level tucked away in the compass or measurement tools. Lay your phone on the top edge of a frame or shelf and it will show when you have hit level, down to a fraction of a degree. It’s ideal, too, for levelling bookshelves, curtain poles and even sorting out a wonky table leg.Scan documentsBuying a house or getting a mortgage often involves having to sign contracts. Some companies will let you do this digitally, but if you are someone who prefers putting pen to paper, you can still do so – with the help of your device. Even most entry-level smartphones now include functions that allow you to turn a photograph into a perfectly serviceable scan by pinpointing the corners of a document when you hover your camera over it.Turn physical photos into animated ‘memories’Family prints stashed in shoe boxes don’t have to remain static. Scan them into your phone and apps, including Google Photos and Apple Photos, and shots can automatically be grouped by people, places and dates, then stitched into short “memories” complete with music and transitions. Some tools even add subtle motion effects to still images, making them feel more like miniature films than dusty snapshots.Measure your blood oxygen saturation and predict problemsView image in fullscreenSignalling issues … Sensors on your smartphone help health apps to estimate blood oxygen saturation.Photograph: Trevor Williams/Getty ImagesHealth apps increasingly tap into sensors on your phone or connected watch to estimate blood oxygen saturation, a useful signal for issues such as breathing difficulties or altitude sickness. While they aren’t a replacement for clinical-grade monitors, they can function as an early warning system, highlighting unusual trends over time and prompting you to seek medical advice if something looks off, rather than ignoring a nagging feeling.Empower your PowerPoint presentationsDitch the dodgy clickers and install the companion app for PowerPoint, Keynote or Google Slides, and you can control your presentation remotely, swiping between slides and seeing your speaker notes on your handset. Some apps turn the screen into a virtual laser pointer, letting you highlight key details on a big display while roaming the stage, instead of being tethered to a laptop. At a pinch, you can even mirror your phone’s screen to a TV or projector and present straight from the handset if your main computer misbehaves.Share your live location to stay safeMost phones let you share your real-time location with trusted friends or family for a set length of time through apps such as WhatsApp. It is a low-effort safety net when walking home at night, travelling alone, or meeting someone new, and beats the old “text me when you get there” ritual.Keep track of your dietView image in fullscreenCalorie counting … ‘Phones make food diaries far less of a faff’.Photograph: Sorrasak Jar Tinyo/Getty ImagesFor those who want to monitor what they are eating, phones make food diaries far less of a faff. Nutrition apps enable you to scan barcodes or search databases to log meals, automatically tallying calories and nutrients across the day. Many sync with your step counter or smartwatch, so you can see the balance between what is going in and what you are burning off, without being nose-deep in a spreadsheet. They are just as useful for people trying to eat more fibre, reduce salt or spot foods that trigger symptoms as they are for anyone counting calories.Turn your phone into a mini podcast studioWith a cheap plug-in microphone and a basic editing app, your phone can record and trim surprisingly high-quality audio. It’s enough to start a podcast, capture interviews on the go or simply send better-than-voice-note updates to friends and family.Control your phone with your voiceWant to take a photo just by saying “click”? You can create voice-activated commands for your iPhone in the accessibility section – although it’s not super-straightforward. Tap on voice control > commands > custom, then select “create new command”. From there, you can type in a voice trigger (such as “click”), which then takes you into a recording of your screen. Everything you tap (like jabbing where the camera button is) will then be repeated whenever you say that phrase. So now when you open your camera and say “click”, hey presto! This can be useful, for automating all manner of repetitive tasks, although it only works when voice control is activated.Supercharge your shopping listPaper scribbles stuck to the fridge are no match for dedicated shopping list apps. Apps such as Bring!, AnyList or Listonic let you share a live list with housemates or partners, tick off items in real time as you walk the aisles, and even add products by scanning barcodes or importing ingredients directly from online recipes.Explore more on these topicsMobile phonesSmartphonesAppsAppleGoogleAndroidiOSfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive photograph: courtesy of Joe WicksJoe Wicks in 1987 and 2025Born in Epsom in 1985,Joe Wicksis a health and fitness coach and author. He studied sports science at St Mary’s University and started posting recipes and workouts on social media in 2014, while working as a personal trainer. His Lean in 15 videos went viral, leading to a bestselling publishing career. During the pandemic, Wicks hosted daily livestreamed PE lessons, raised more than £1m for charity and earned an MBE. His 13th book, Protein In 15, is out now.I was always covered in food as a kid– a real messy eater. This was probably readymade spaghetti from a tin. Our family didn’t have the greatest diet – we were on benefits, a lot of our money went on Dad’s heroin addiction, and Mum was young and didn’t know much about nutrition.Mum left home at 15 and was living in a squat when she met Dad. They had my older brother, Nikki, when she was 17. A year and a half later, I came along. We lived in a one-bedroom council flat in Epsom, and I was straight on formula milk and weaned on pre-made jars. As I grew up, my diet consisted of ultra-processed foods like potato waffles, baked beans, spaghetti hoops, crispy pancakes and frozen pies. There wasn’t a lot of fruit and veg at home, but I had unlimited access to a cupboard full of chocolate, crisps, Iced Gems and Wagon Wheels. I would raid it as soon as I came in from school. Even as an adult, I really struggle to eat junk food in moderation.I was definitely an anxious little kid. As well as Dad’s addiction, Mum had her own mental health issues – eating disorders, anxiety and OCD. We had a very clean house – it was like an Ikea showroom. She was strict about everything – I’d get told off if I didn’t put my shoes in the cupboard or hadn’t made my bed in the morning. It felt like most days I’d come in from school and she would be deep-cleaning the cupboards. I wasn’t allowed to make much noise and there weren’t any sleepovers or birthday parties at ours. I was quite on edge, and me and Mum would row a lot.At school I was hyperactive, loud, very cocky, always swearing, screaming, shouting; generally climbing the walls and looking for attention. I don’t know if it was my diet, or how my brain was wired, but I was useless when it came to academic subjects like maths, English and science. Unless it was technology or PE I was a pain in the arse. There were a lot of detentions.My teen years were the hardest– that was when I started acknowledging the reality of my family situation. I could tell when Dad was relapsing and felt let down every time he’d disappear or lie. I worried it was going to go on for ever; that he would never get clean. Puberty was also the time I realised movement helped me process what I was feeling. I used to run two miles to school. I would turn up sweating, but I didn’t care as it was my release. Nobody talked about mental health back then, but I knew I was calmer once I’d done some exercise.My childhood definitely shaped my approach to drinking and drugs – I was really worried that it was going to affect me in a similar way as Dad. Thankfully, it didn’t, but it has made my attachment style quite anxious. I was never single, because I always wanted the security of being in a relationship. I loved feeling close to somebody.It’s my biggest fear, losing my family. I don’t want to realise I’ve spent too much of my life distracted by workI started running boot camps in my mid-20s. I was determined to be my own boss, and I didn’t want to work in a leisure centre for a tenner an hour. At the time, I was living at my dad’s flat in Surbiton and would leave the house at 5.15am to get to Richmond. Some mornings I’d set up; it would be freezing and raining and not a single person would arrive. But it didn’t put me off. I’d show up every Tuesday and Thursday morning at 6am. I always had this positive voice in my head that kept saying: “Keep going and someone will come next week. The week after they might bring a friend.” Eventually it became a decent business. At its peak I was earning £1,000 a month.I was 25, happy and pursuing something I loved. Then: boom! Social media came along and my career turned into something bigger. My intention was never to be an influencer, but by 2014 I had 50,000 followers on Instagram. That’s when a publisher reached out and said: “I love what you’re doing and I really believe you could do a great book.” I didn’t have any confidence that I could be a successful author – especially considering what I was like at school – so I was amazed when Lean in 15 ended up selling 1.4m copies.The week that lockdown was announced, I was supposed to go on a tour of schools in the UK. I was chatting to my brother Nikki and said: “I’ve got an idea. I’m going to do a live workout on YouTube on Monday and I’ll call it PE With Joe.” A few days before I was due to go live, I was on my motorbike and smashed into a brick wall. I broke my hand. Even though I had a brace on, I had to see PE With Joe through. The first workout had nearly a million live connections. From then on, I did it every day, without fail, even though sometimes I was exhausted and I wanted a day off.Now, success to meis stability and connections.Having nice food, and the heat and gas on; the things that I didn’t experience as a kid. I want to be an honest, loyal husband. I used to think that I would never get married as all I’d ever seen growing up was divorce and affairs. But everything changed when I met Rosie.Being a good dad is my main focus, too. With four kids, life can be exhausting. Recently I’ve started going to bed at 9pm, which means I wake up naturally at 5am and I’m energised. I can do my workout before the kids are up. Getting ready doesn’t take long – I don’t put any products in my hair, just coconut oil on my skin and a bit of chamomile conditioner. Then after 7am, it’s full-on until bedtime. The kids don’t stop talking, asking questions, especially as we’re home schooling them.Athlete Harry Aikines-Aryeetey looks back: ‘By five, all I wanted to be was a Gladiator’Read moreI’ve done a lot of healing when it comes to my relationship with my parents. They are separated, so I spend time with them individually, but I am very conscious that one day they will be gone and I don’t want to have any regrets. I am probably quite needy, but I am always trying to pull them aside and saying: “Come on, let’s hang out and create a memory.” It’s my biggest fear, losing my family. I don’t want to realise I’ve spent too much of my life distracted by work, and that I’ve run out of time.When I look at that picture, I think about the care and love a kid needs, and what a chaotic house I grew up in. But my memories of that time aren’t of sadness and misery; it was normality. I now have a better understanding of everything my parents were going through. I know addiction wasn’t a choice for Dad, and Mum has been on her own journey, too. She can even cook now – because she’s got all of my books!Explore more on these topicsJoe WicksFlashbackFitnessFamilyHealthFoodPhotographyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But those hoping to pitch up at their local pub for a restorative pint with colleagues and constituents may find festive cheer is in short supply. In fact, some may not be allowed through the door.For the past few weeks, pubs across the countryhave been putting up signsdeclaring “No Labour MPs” in protest at changes to business rates announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in her latest budget.The campaign means, for many Labour MPs, there is one less place to escape the bruising reality of their party’s unpopularity. Backbenchers now say they frequently encounter hostility in public spaces after a difficult first 18 months in which the party’s ratings have plummeted from about 34% to 18%.“It can be hard being the MP of the area you have always lived in,” said one. “The local pub is where we used to go with the kids and just be a normal family. But the last few times we’ve just ended up being shouted at by other customers. Now I’m not even sure we’ll be able to get in.”That sense of dismay is palpable in arecent videoposted by Tom Hayes, the Labour MP for Bournemouth East, about being banned from one of his local pubs, the Larderhouse.“It’s the Christmas season, it’s meant to be the joyful season,” he said. “But the Larderhouse and other businesses with a No Labour MPs sticker in the window, they are undermining the inclusive culture that business owners locally have helped to nourish.”He went on to add: “We have to get politics off the high street full stop, but especially at Christmas.”As well as denying politicians a port in the political storms that are so commonplace, the row threatens to taint the broadly positive reaction to last month’s budget, at which Reeves won the support of backbenchers and the financial markets by raising taxes and scrapping the two-child benefit cap.Reeves herself may struggle to get served once she returns to her constituency of Leeds West and Pudsey, with the Daily Mail reporting that the Marsh Inn pub in Pudsey has barred her, citing the impact her budget has had on the industry.Its landlord, Martin Knowles, who posed for a picture with the chancellor in July, told the paper: “I thought I’d ban them all, including the local MP, as they are not doing our industry any favours at all. Our clientele seem quite happy with the ban.”One minister admitted: “The pubs row is the one weak spot in the budget. That’s the thing we may need to backtrack on.”‘Pubs have a special place in the British psyche’After a difficult few years in which pubs have been hit by high costs, the pandemic and the impact of younger people going out less, publicans were optimistic this budget might bring some relief – specifically with a long-promised revamp of business rates.But the chancellor poured cold water on those hopes, choosing instead to reduce headline rates and commit £4.3bn over three years in financial support for the retail and hospitality industries.It may have seemed a gesture of goodwill, but the value of that support package has been dwarfed by the impact of a three-yearly property revaluation that has caused the taxable value of pubs and restaurants to spike from their Covid-affected lows.Starting from next April,rates will riseby 115% for the average hotel and 76% for a pub, compared with 4% for large supermarkets and 7% for distribution warehouses. Whitbread, which owns pubs, restaurants and the Premier Inn hotel chain, says it will have to pay between £40m and £50m in tax as a result.Joe Butler, the landlord at the Tollemache Arms in Northamptonshire, said: “Literally overnight, the click of a finger, the value of our business has doubled. That’s going to be a huge increase for us.”And pressure on publicans is inevitably reflected in the price of a punter’s pint.“The price of a pint is now unaffordable. When we first took this pub on 10 years ago, we charged £3.40 a pint. We’re now verging on being £7 a pint,” Butler said.At the same time, Covid-era tax reliefs are falling away, while hospitality operators are still absorbing the rise in national insurance and the minimum wage from last year’s budget.“If you wanted to write the worst possible budget for pubs and consumers, you wouldn’t have got far away from what came out,” said Ash Corbett-Collins, the chair of Camra, the campaign for real ale.Many in the Labour party believe this is one fight they should not have picked, not least because of the role the local pub plays in British culture.Richard Quigley, the Labour MP for the Isle of Wight West, who also runs a chip shop on the island, said: “We said for two years to pubs and hospitality businesses that we are going to help you out but then they get hit by this revaluation. We can’t have rates going down for large multinational companies but up for small restaurants and pubs.”Some point out that Keir Starmer himself has long been a regular at his local pub, the Pineapple in north London, and frequently speaks of their importance to local communities. “There’s nothing any of us like better than going to the local for a pint, myself included,” the prime minister said in February.But pollsters liken picking a fight with pub owners as doing so with NHS workers.Joe Twyman, co-founder of the public opinion consultancy Deltapoll, said: “From the Queen Vic [in EastEnders] to the Rovers Return [in Coronation Street], pubs have a special place in the British psyche.“For many people the local pub is perceived to be an important part of the community, even if a good proportion of those same people will rarely actually drink there.“The political risk with making an enemy of pubs is that your opponents will easily be able to accuse you of attacking at the very heart of this country and its history, particularly in rural areas. And they will be able to produce many emotive examples to prove their point.”‘Not a personal vendetta’One of those examples is Andy Lennox, the landlord at the Old Thatch pub in Wimborne, Dorset, and the organiser of the “No Labour MPs” campaign. Lennox says he has handed out stickers to nearly 1,000 establishments and is sending out 100 more every day.He has received support fromthe presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who runs a pub called the Farmer’s Dog, andRick Astley, who part-owns the Mikkeller brewpub in north London – though the pop star has said he will not actually ban Labour MPs.“We have been asking for relief for a very long time,” said Lennox, who is calling for a temporary VAT reduction. “The government is dressing this up as a relief package but that’s not what people are experiencing, and that is the thing that has aggrieved so many people.”Some in the industry think a protest targeting individual Labour MPs is likely to backfire. “I’m not sure it’s a good idea to ban the exact people we should be trying to invite in and speak to,” said Corbett-Collins.When asked this week, the Treasury spoke of the support being offered to hospitality. “We’re protecting pubs, restaurants and cafes with the budget’s £4.3bn support package. This comes on top of our efforts to ease licensing to help more venues offer pavement drinks and put on one-off events, maintaining our cut to alcohol duty on draught pints, and capping corporation tax,” a spokesperson said.The landlords, however, are in no mood to back down, even if losing MPs means losing one more loyal customer.Referring to his local MP, Butler said: “We know Rosie Wrighting well and she is a customer of ours.“This is not a personal vendetta against anyone personally, this is not aggressively throwing anyone out. We would politely ask her to leave. It’s nothing personal. This is just a stand that we’re taking collectively as an industry.”"

Withalmost 1 million young peoplenow outside education, work or training, critics say the government has failed to articulate a plan to brighten their prospects before the next election.Francis praised government policies on devolution and housing, but said welfare reform and other proposals had been “stop-start”.“We’ve got other policies like growth, educational improvement where we’re just not sure where we’re going,” he said.Francis said Labour’s skills policy and its industrial strategy were a step forward but that there was “no overarching narrative” to pull all these strands together. Without an overall strategy, he said, the government would “struggle to address some of those issues and have a clear-headed view about what we might do to improve things”.He also warned that without a “universal view” of what social mobility means, it risked being subsumed by diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) policies – an agenda that Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has characterised as “woke” and promised to dismantle. “To some degree it’s dropped into being a part of DEI because it does have some of those aspects,” he said. “But [social mobility] isn’t really a DEI policy. It’s more about an economic and social policy that’s about bringing the benefits to everybody.”The SMC’s annual report,published last week, came as official statistics showed an increase of 85,000 young people unemployed in the three months to October. The risk of not being in education, employment and training is more than double for those from a disadvantaged background with low qualifications. This group is proportionally highest in the north-east and north-west of England, followed by the East Midlands and West Midlands.Alan Milburn, the former health secretary, said this was a “national outrage … a social injustice and an economic catastrophe”. He willlead a review into the causes of young people being out of work or education, it was announced last week.Francis, who was appointed by the Cabinet Office in January 2023, said successive governments had become too focused on “quick fixes” and the frenetic pressures of Westminster, leading to “constant changes of direction”. He added: “Without that narrative on social mobility, what you tend to have is lots of disconnected aspects of policy without a way of bringing them together into one coherent whole.”A government spokesperson said: “Nearly 1 million young people in Britain are not in education, employment or training – and that number has been rising for four years.“This is a crisis we cannot ignore, and we have asked Alan Milburn to help us build a system that supports young people and understand the root causes of youth unemployment. We are bringing forward the biggest employment reforms in a generation and Alan Milburn’s review will ensure every young person is provided an opportunity to make something of their lives.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mobilityYouth unemploymentEnglandKeir StarmerLabourYoung peopleUnemploymentnewsShareReuse this content"

Its unexplained removal on Saturday triggered a chorus of accusations from Democrats about evident political interference in favor of the president, aformer friendof Epstein.“Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review,”the department said on X.“After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.”Sister of Epstein victim reported him in 1996, but FBI failed to investigate, files revealRead moreEarlier on Sunday, deputy US attorney general Todd Blanche saidthat removing photos from Friday’s Epstein files release, including one of Trump, has “nothing to do” with the president – and maintained the images would likely go back up after it is determined whether they need redactions.Blanche said the 16 removals came at the request of victim advocacy groups. “We don’t have perfect information,” Blanchetold NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday.“And so when, when we hear from victims-rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate.”As Blanche put it, an investigation into the photos was ongoing, and they “will go back up,” with the only question being “whether there will be redactions”.Victims rights advocate Gloria Allredtold CNNon Saturday that the “system has failed the survivors”, including with the release of files that may have been “under-redacted”.“I saw a number of survivors’ names which should never have been published, because the whole point is to protect the survivors,” she told the outlet.“The other concern I have also has to do with the images of some of the potential victims and survivors, that some of those images were not redacted, should have been redacted, and in some cases, the images may be of women unclothed. And that is completely unacceptable”.In a letter to the justice department on Sunday, one Epstein victim who had reported the sex offender to the FBI in 2009 said their name had been wrongly exposed in the DoJ document dump, but she had not been allowed to view her FBI file previously.“The contradiction is extraordinary,” the victim wrote in a redacted letterposted to X. “The DOJ asserts that my own file requires prolonged review to determine whether redactions are appropriate – yet it had no difficulty publicly releasing my identity in a mass disclosure.”Blanche’s and Allred’s comments came as theTrump administrationfaced criticism over its handling of Friday’s partial release when a complete one had been required by congressional act.The release of justice department files related to Epstein – who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor and died while awaiting sex-trafficking charges – otherwise dominated the Sunday talkshows. Democrat officials claimed the government had fallen short of its legal obligation to release the investigative documents in full.“This initial documents release is inadequate,” said House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, on ABC’s This Week. “It falls short of what the law requires.”The DoJ failed to comply with Epstein files law. Can Congress do anything?Read moreJeffries argued that legal statutes require the justice department “to provide a written explanation to Congress and to the American people as to why they’ve withheld certain documents” within 15 days.The comments come after California representative Ro Khanna, Jeffries’ fellow House Democrat, said there should be impeachment proceedings against attorney general Pam Bondi for the failure to release the Epstein documents in full by 19 December. That date was set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act co-authored by Khanna.On Sunday, Blanche argued the government did not have time to review all the files to make redactions needed to protect victims.“It’s very simple and very clear,” Blanche said. “The statute also requires us to protect victims. And so the reason why we are still reviewing documents and still continuing our process is simply that – to protect the victims.“So the same individuals that are out there complaining about the lack of documents that were produced on Friday are the same individuals who apparently don’t want us to protect victims,” he added.View image in fullscreenA photo released by the Department of Justice as part of the Epstein disclosure included images of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul on a desk.Photograph: Department of JusticeImages removed from the DoJ disclosures page on Saturday included a photograph of Epstein’s desk in his New York mansion in which two photographs of Trump were visible. The images were also removed from downloadable folders.“This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includesDonald Trumphas apparently now been removed from the DoJ release,” Democrats on the House Oversight committee posted on X on Saturday.“Pam Bondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public,” they added.“This is a White House cover-up,” the Democrat members of the committeesaid in a later post.In a statement, the justice department said: “Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.”Criticism of the file alteration speaks to the highly-charged political nature of the congressionally-ordered document dump, with Democrats claiming that the files released so far have been heavily redacted and selected to paint Democrats, including former president Bill Clinton,in a bad light.Republicans on the committee responded,sayingthat earlier, Democrat-selected releases “have repeatedly posted cherry-picked edited photos to try to score political points and create a hoax against President Trump. They chase headlines at the expense of victims. They can NEVER be trusted to run serious investigations.”Bill Clinton spokesperson says White House is using him as scapegoat after Epstein files releaseRead moreDemocratic senator Tim Kaine of Virginia told NBC that if there are unanswered questions about Clinton’s relationship with Epstein, “he should address them, and I suspect he will”.Kaine added: “Let’s put all the facts and all the material out on the table, and then folks can reach their own judgments about anybody connected with this horrible, horrible case.”Arguments over redactions, removals and politically-inspired editing have put Clinton back in the frame of the scandal, after pictures of the former president luxuriating in a hot tub with Ghislaine Maxwell and what appeared to be a young woman were included in the release.“It’s obvious what the Republicans in the White House and at Justice and their desperate congressional cronies are doing,” a Clinton spokesperson said. “What they’re hiding is not obvious. But it must not be good.”Bill and Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and former first lady, are under pressure to testify before the committee.Trump-aligned Republicans calling for “transparency” are also sounding alarm. US House member Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, said she is concerned about “unnecessary redactions” – but added that she is “also concerned about making sure we are protecting the faces of potential victims and their names”.But it is clear justice department redactions may also have been too aggressive in some instances. A picture of Clinton, Michael Jackson, and Diana Ross on a plane released on Friday was also redacted to obscure a child’s face. The child later turned out to Jackson’s son, and the unaltered image readily available from commercial photo archives.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The two are the latest of eight prisoners who have been admitted to hospital since the hunger strike action began on Balfour day, 2 November, according to Prisoners for Palestine.Gib was provided with a wheelchair on Friday and taken to hospital on Saturday.The prisoner-led collective in Britain said hunger strikers will die unless there is urgent government intervention. “They are in the custody of the state and any harm that comes to them is a deliberate outcome of the government’s negligence and the politicisation of their detention,” the collective said.MPs have written to the government expressing concerns over the delay in medical assistance and limited communication with families. Lawyers representing prisoners have criticised the justice secretary, David Lammy, for refusing to meet them.A friend of Gib’s and next of kin, Jessica Dolliver, was due to visit Gib in prison on Sunday morning, when a call came from the prison. “I just wasn’t surprised because I could see that Amu was deteriorating and I could also hear on the phone,” said Dolliver, 28.On Friday Gibwrote in the Guardianof their solidarity with Palestinians.It is understood Gib is on remand on suspicion of being involved in the break-in at Brize Norton airbase in June, when two military aircraft were defaced with spray paint.Gib is one of three prisoners, along with Qesser Zuhrah and Jon Cink, who has been admitted to hospital.A HMP Bronzefield spokesperson said: “We cannot provide information about specific individuals. However, we can confirm that all prisoners have full access to healthcare, including attendance at external medical facilities if needed.“Any prisoner refusing food receives regular medical assessment and support from clinicians, as well as being offered mental health support.”The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is Gib’s MP and has visited the 30-year-old in detention, on Sunday wrote a letter to the prisons inspectorate raising concerns over “inconsistent and unreliable” health treatment to those on hunger strike.The letter was also signed by MPs John McDonnell and Barry Gardiner. “We are dismayed to learn that, as they near their eighth week on hunger strike, their treatment remains inconsistent and unreliable,” the letter says.Last week, Corbyn and more than 50 MPs urged Lammy to meet the lawyers of those on hunger strike. “Our inquiries have either gone unanswered or, when answered have been vague reassurances that all policies and guidelines are being followed. However, we continue to hear from the prisoners and their loved ones daily that this is not the case,” the letter said.The prisons minister, Lord Timpson, has previously said the service is “very experienced” at dealing with hunger strikes and has “robust and working” systems in place and the Prison Service “will not be meeting” any prisoners or their representatives.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

There have been maritime interdictions to enforce sanctions, and the recently announcedUS blockade of sanctions-busting ships in Venezuela.Earlier this month US special forcesrappelled from helicopters to board the Skipper,a tanker off Venezuela that the US treasury had placed under sanctions in 2022 amid allegations it had been smuggling oil on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah.Loop of US special forces boarding a tanker off VenezuelaFootage shows US special forces boarding a tanker off VenezuelaMap of tankers around VenezuelaOn SaturdayUS forces apprehended a second merchant vesselcarrying oil off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, even though it does not appear to be on the list of vessels under US sanctions.The US seizures follow incidents this year where Estonia and Franceinterdicted vessels suspected of belonging to Russia’s shadow fleet, and recent attacks by Ukrainian air and sea drones on Russian shadow tankers accused of being involved in sanctions evasion.The increasingly aggressive efforts to police the shadow fleet and evidence thatRussiais willing to use military assets to protect tankers, has led experts to warn of the risk of confrontation.That was dramatically underlined on Friday when Ukraine announced ithad struck a Russian tanker with aerial dronesin neutral waters off the coast of Libya, after previous similar attacks in the Black Sea.A source in the Security Service ofUkrainesaid it was a “new, unprecedented special operation”, Kyiv’s first attack on a Russian tanker in the Mediterranean, carried out 1,200 miles (2,000km) from Ukraine’s borders.Map showing Ukrainian attacks on tankers in the Black Sea“The shadow fleet itself is not a new threat,” said Gonzalo Saiz Erausquin, a research fellow at the finance and security centre at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. “But [it] has expanded drastically after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. That saw what we call the shadow fleet explode to some 900-1,200 vessels globally.“It is not highly structured or homogeneous. These are vessels that Russian interests are able to purchase secondhand, opaquely owned tankers or owned by companies prepared to engage in illicit activity.”The shadow fleet has spawned a whole illicit network to support it, including a recent proliferation of fake flag registration websites, unscrupulous brokers and a cast of opaque companies that will facilitate the trade.View image in fullscreenThe vessel Boracay, off the coast of Saint-Nazaire in France.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersThe tanker Boracay, which was interdicted by Estonia and France earlier this year, is a case in point.It was acquired in 2020 by a so-calledbrass plate company– meaning one that exists in name only – in Seychelles called Baaj Shipping. It was blacklisted by the UK and EU for its suspected links to transporting Russian oil products, “irregular and high-risk shipping practices” and allegations of operating under a fraudulent Benin flag listing, following several other false flag listings in the Gambia and Malawi.According to Lloyd’s List, the ship – a “textbook example of deceptive shipping practices” – had also been investigated by Denmark’s intelligence services over its possible use to launch drones against Copenhagen’s airport, while operating under a different name. The ship had itself allegedly been targeted at one point with a limpet mine.Map of Boracay’s sailing routeCountries that have sought to counter the shadow fleet are forced to rely on international laws and conventions over seaworthiness, insurance and safe navigation practices to put pressure on the vessels.But an increasing international appetite for enforcement – including the Trump administration’s announcement in December that it would enforce a blockade against ships under sanctions visiting Venezuela – has brought it own risks.It is not only Washington that has indicated it is prepared to intercept shadow fleet tankers. In October, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, signalled a greater willingness from Europeans to tackle vessels in its waters.“We have decided to take a step forward by adopting policies to impede suspicious ships,” said Macron at a meeting in Copenhagen.The risks implied in such a policy were underlined by an incident involving an oil tanker known in quick succession as Jaguar, Blint and then finally as the Russian-flagged Nasledie. An attempt by the Estonian navy to intercept the vessel in the Gulf of Finland in Mayprompted an incursion by a Russian Su-35 jet into Estonian airspace.For Erausquin that suggests a more direct interest from the Kremlin in the shadow fleet, as demonstrated by Russia’s willingness to protect it.As Chris Kremidas-Courtney, a senior fellow at the European Policy Centre argued in November, the shadow fleet poses greater threats than its key role in economically sustaining Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.Kremidas-Courtney said:“Recent incidents underscore this threat. Russia-linked vessels have been implicated in drone incursions, cable disruptions and reconnaissance of critical infrastructure. The Eagle S [a suspected shadow tanker]severed undersea cables after cycling through multiple flags, and Estonia’s attempted interdiction of the Jaguar crude oil tanker prompted the scrambling of Russian fighter jets – proof that Moscow sees this fleet as a strategic asset and is willing to protect it. Europe cannot afford to let these incidents pass unanswered.”Despite the tougher language from Europe, including discussion of seeking permission to board suspect tankers, some analysts do not detect a huge appetite for maritime confrontation with Russia.“It is one thing for the US to board a sanctioned and stateless tanker off Venezuela because what is Venezuela going to do?” said one. “It feels like a very different calculation for the Europeans with Russia. It risks upping the stakes in what has become a game of chicken.”If the shadow fleet, in particular the Russian element of it, has flourished in the past three years, it is partly due to US resistance to imposing sanctions on the major Russian oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, and through the continued reliance of China and India on Russian oil.Russia has moved quickly to try to evade the US sanctions, with several new companies emerging who are suspected of exporting Rosneft and Lukoil crude.Despite the recent US sanctions, one of Russia’s most important markets for its crude appears to have been largely unaffected, despite pressure from Trump: Indian imports of Russian crude have increased since October.In part that has been because of both Russia’s adaptability to sanctions over the past three years and the complex structuring of its shadow fleet operations, mirrored by similar activities over the years by Iran and Venezuela.How Russia has operated in recent years was made clear this month in new EU sanctions announced against nine businessmen and entities, including shipping companies based in the UAE and Vietnam as well as Russia, accused of involvement in the shadow fleet.UAE-owned tankers mapTomer Raanan, a specialist reporter for Lloyd’s List who closely follows developments in the shadow fleet both in the trade in Iranian energy products and Russia, believes it remains attractive to shipowners because of the potential profits that can be earned operating the sometimes dilapidated ships.“Earlier this year, we noticed several sanctioned tankers suddenly began broadcasting AIS messages indicating that they are registered with Malawi.“We found a website purporting to be the Malawi Maritime Administration which did not have a Malawi government domain and was later confirmed by Malawi officials as fraudulent. Since then, Lloyd’s List has uncovered an elaborate fraudulent flag operation linking over 20 separate fake registry websites, many of which are using the same holding text.”Such “scam” registrations were being used by ships in the shadow fleet, he said.Raanan also believes the proliferation of fraudulent flags and falsely flagged ships highlights a critical problem with the shipping industry’s registry system.In the meantime, he expects the sanction-busting trade in oil to continue despite the efforts to police it.“Sanctioned oil is often sold at a discount, while shipowners moving these cargoes typically earn premiums for taking on the risk. I think that as long as market participants view the economic incentives as outweighing the risks, sanctions evasion will likely continue.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeCommoditiesUS foreign policyVenezuelanewsShareReuse this content"

He later acted alongside Alexander Skarsgård inGeneration Kill, also helmed by Simon.In Generation Kill, Ransone played real-life marine Cpl Josh Ray Person across all seven episodes of theHBOshow.Ransone more recently appeared inIt Chapter Twoas the fictional character Eddie Kaspbrak.News of his death prompted an outpouring of condolences on social media from fans of the various productions in which he participated. One tribute in particular hailed how his work on It Chapter Two stood out on a cast whose members included Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy and Skarsgård’s brother, Bill, who portrays the antagonist Pennywise.Among those to weigh in was Ransone’s fellow actor François Arnaud, a prominent cast member ofHeated Rivalry, which is on the HBO Max platform.“RIP James Ransone,” Arnaud wrote Sunday on Instagram. “Unique actor that I was continuously impressed and inspired by.”Ransone was born in Baltimore in 1979. He attended the Carver Center for Arts and Technology in Towson, Maryland, from 1993 to 1997. He got his break co-starring in the 2002 teen drama Ken Park before landing his role onThe Wirea year later.In 2021, Ransone shared that he was sexually abused by a former tutor who worked in Maryland public schools, as theBaltimore Sunreported. He wrote on Instagram that the abuse was a factor in alcohol and heroin addictions with which he later grappled.The celebrity news sourcePage Sixreported that Ransone in 2020 reported the abuse he described, but authorities declined to pursue criminal charges.Ransone in 2016spoketo Interview magazine of how he would “wrestle with the catharsis of acting”.Some of his roles called on him to humanize characters who were not likable, “so I find myself living in a lot of unlikable skin”, he said. “As a result of that, I don’t always feel good.”In the US, you can call or text the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifelineat 988 or chat at988lifeline.org.

Trump praised the decision by the broadcaster ABC. It came after pressure from the White House on the broadcaster and its owner, Disney.But the move sparked a backlash from viewers, fellow late-night TV hosts and free-speech campaigners, which led toKimmel being put back on airdays later.In his alternative Christmas message, Kimmel is expected to pay tribute to those who criticised his suspension. AChannel 4insider said: “He says the reason that he is back on air is because people spoke out and people protested.”On his show last week, in afinal monologue of the year, Kimmel also praised viewers. He said: “On behalf of all of us at the show, I just want to say that we appreciate your support, your enthusiasm, and not just for watching. This year, you literally pulled us out of a hole and we cannot thank you enough.”He also spoke of the importance of reminding the rest of the world about the internal dissent against the Trump administration. He said: “It’s important that we as Americans let our friends in other countries … know that a lot of us are not OK with what is happening.“There is still much more good in this country than bad, and we hope that you will bear with us during this extended psychotic episode that we’re in the middle of.”Kimmel’s alternative Christmas message will be broadcast on Christmas Day at 5.45pm, less than two hours after the king’s Christmas message.A Channel 4 spokesperson said: “Donald Trump’s return to the White House and wide-ranging impact on the world has been the story of 2025 and it would be hard to think of a better person to address it than Jimmy Kimmel, who has found himself on the frontline of America’s battle over free speech.”Channel 4 has been broadcasting often provocative alternative Christmas speeches for more than 30 years. Speakers have included the former president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the whistleblower Edward Snowden, the cartoon character Marge Simpson and the late self-styled high priest of camp Quentin Crisp.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelChannel 4Television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Each time such images surface is a reminder to the public, and, surely, a source of great discomfort to the royal family.They suggest the late convicted sex offender Epstein and his then girlfriend, Maxwell – nowserving 20 years in a US prison for sex trafficking offences– paid numerous visits to the UK to see their once-royal friend.Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now styled, is pictured in bow tie and dinner jacket lying across the laps of five women, their faces redacted, in the saloon room of the royal residence in Sandringham, reportedly to mark Maxwell’s 39th birthday in December 2000.In another photo, Epstein and Maxwell peer out of the royal box at Ascot with Mountbatten-Windsor, who invited them as personal guests on Ladies’ Day in June 2000 – an event attended by both the queen and the queen mother. The former prince reportedly invited the couple to stay at the Balmoral estate in 1999, and they are pictured on the moorland, dressed for the part.View image in fullscreenAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Ghislaine Maxwell at Sandringham, in the company of six women whose identities have been redacted.Photograph: US Department of Justice/PAThese are not the first images to emerge of the couple at royal locations. A photograph of them in a Balmoral cabin was released by the court during Maxwell’s trial in the US, while one of Maxwell and the actor Kevin Spacey sitting on thrones in Buckingham Palace, reportedly taken in 2002, had previously found its way into the public domain.Released together, however, the latest pictures reinforce the incredible access Epstein and Maxwell enjoyed through this friendship.According to the royal biographer Tina Brown,the late financier considered the former duke to be an “idiot”, but a “useful” one. In her 2022 book,The Palace Papers, she wrote that Epstein confided to a friend that he used to fly Mountbatten-Windsor to obscure foreign markets, where governments were obliged to receive him, with Epstein going along as his investment adviser. “With Andrew as frontman, Epstein could negotiate deals with these (often) shady players,” she wrote.Brown argued that Epstein “deftly exploited” Mountbatten-Windsor’s “sense of grievance” at being Charles’s spare. Epstein, she wrote, “made Andrew feel he had joined the big time – the deals, the girls, the plane, the glittering New York world, where he wasn’t seen as a full-grown man still dependent on his mother’s privy purse strings or on the harsh pecking order of the palace”.Epstein files: which royals, politicians, musicians and actors are in the photos?Read moreThis year, inEntitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, the biographer Andrew Lownie described Mountbatten-Windsor as “easy prey for a rattlesnake like Epstein”. He wrote: “Epstein played Andrew. The prince was a useful idiot who gave him respectability, access to political leaders and business opportunities. He found him easy to exploit.”Lownie also quoted the US businessman Steven Hoffenberg, a convicted fraudster said to be Epstein’s “mentor”, as saying Andrew was Epstein’s “Super Bowl trophy”.As the latest tranche of “Epstein files” was released, Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed out riding at Royal Lodge, Windsor. Soon to be evicted from this home, he is due to move to a private house on the Sandringham estate next year – another privilege lost as a result of his ultimately destructive friendship with Epstein and Maxwell.The former duke has always denied allegations he had sex with Epstein’s employeeVirginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April. He has since facedcalls from Democrats in the US Congressto give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein’s activities, but had not replied to the request bythe end of their deadlinelast month.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorJeffrey EpsteinGhislaine MaxwellKing Charles IIIMonarchyUS crimeanalysisShareReuse this content"

So too did al-Qaida, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which used the platform to help bankroll its operations in the years leading up to the 7 October attack in Israel. Binance was not accused of directly financing these groups, but prosecutors found that it knowingly allowed its exchange to function as a conduit – enabling extremist organisations to shift funds, evade scrutiny and frustrate investigations.At the centre of it all was Binance’s founder and chief executive, Changpeng Zhao. By 2024, the self-styled “king” of crypto had fallen from grace,pleading guiltyto money laundering charges and entering prison, while Binance agreed to pay a record $4.3bn penalty for its role in facilitating terrorist financing. The case was hailed as a rare victory for regulators willing to take on the industry’s biggest players – and for victims of the violence linked to those financial flows. Among them were the families of US citizens killed on 7 October, who are nowsuingBinance in a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of “pitching itself to terrorist organisations”.But in late October, Donald Trump announced that he waspardoning Zhao. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, framed the decision as a corrective to what she called the Biden administration’s “war on cryptocurrency”, insisting that Zhao’s crimes had produced no “identifiable victims”.It was a familiar refrain, dressed up for a new audience: that corruption is somehow a “victimless crime”. The claim is absurd. Terrorist organisations do not exist in a vacuum. They depend on white-collar criminals capable of building and maintaining secretive financial pipelines. The victims of bombings, shootings and mass casualty attacks are, all too often, also the victims of bankers, executives and financiers who made that violence possible.Zhao’s pardon sent a clear signal about who stands to gain most from a Trump presidency. As those concerned with environmental collapse, economic instability and the spread of authoritarianism find themselves increasingly sidelined, white-collar criminals – Zhao among them, and Trump himself – are enjoying a political moment unlike any they have known before.For this coterie of fraudsters and tax evaders, the past year has been a cresting wave of successes: the abandonment of seeming slam-dunk prosecutions, presidential pardons for even the most egregious crimes, and a steady hollowing out of the agencies tasked with holding them to account. Trump’s not wrong when he rails about a surge in crime. But “the crime wave,” as journalist Jacob Silvermanwrote earlier this year, “is white collar”.But why would theTrump administrationchoose to set aside consequences from criminals whose actions threaten the stability of the broader American economy?View image in fullscreenThe pardon presidentTrump’s preferred tool for aiding white-collar criminals is simple: the pardon. Where previous presidents deployed that power sparingly, often at the end of their terms, Trump has wielded it promiscuously – issuing clemency even when it results in something completely anathema to his administration’s stated goals.Take Trump’s supposed focus on combating narco-traffickers. Trump has been explicit about wanting to control the influx of narcotics and fentanyl into the US from South America – and is close to waging war on Venezuela despite the fact that it is not among the primary direct traffickers of cocaine to the US. At the same time, Trump haspardonedJuan Orlando Hernandez, the former Honduran president.Hernandez may not appear as a typical white-collar criminal, given that he was a head of state. But just look at what he was accused of, and who he used his legal, financial and political power to aid. In 2024, Hernández was convicted by a US jury of an extraordinary catalogue of crimes, including conspiring to import roughly 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States. As the US attorney generalsaidat the time, Hernández stood “at the centre of one of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking conspiracies in the world”, entwining his finances with the cartels and transforming Honduras into a key transit hub for narcotics bound for American streets and, in the process, one of the most dangerous countries on Earth.His guilty verdict and 45-year sentence were among the most spectacular blows against these drug-smuggling networks over the past decade and a far more meaningful interception against narco-trafficking rings than anything Trump could hope to gain from war in Venezuela. It was also a stark illustration of how white-collar crime is anything but victimless: a mechanism through which narco-states are built, violence is normalised and entire societies are destabilised.Then, as with Zhao, it unravelled. Trump announced in early December that Hernandez was “treated very harshly and unfairly” and would walk free. Hernandez spent months lobbying Trump acolytes and conservative media personalities,pitching himselfas a pro-Trump “ally on migration and security” and casting himself as a victim of political revenge by the Biden administration that he said had also been used to target Trump. The play worked. And it would not be the last time.One by one, white-collar criminals have marched to the White House, bleating their fealty to Trump – and watching their prison sentences evaporate as a result.There wasCharles Scott, a Virginia businessmansentenced earlier this yearfor manipulating stock values and defrauding investors at a lighting company – and who Trump later freed. A pair of reality television stars,Julie and Todd Chrisley, were caught out evading taxes, sentenced to three years in prison as a result – before Trumpdecided to pardon them. David Gentile was a former private equity head,convicted last yearfor conspiring to defraud investors (along with his partner) to the tune of some $1.6bn, receiving a seven-year sentence as a result. But just days into his prison term,Trump announcedGentile’s sentence would be commuted, and that he could walk free.The latter decision was remarkably galling. Gentile and his colleague had defrauded a staggering 10,000 different victims: parents and grandparents with little to their names, some of whom saw their entire life savings wiped out. “I’m totally disgusted, because it wasn’t only myself,”one of Gentile’s victims saidafter Trump’s move. “It was my elder mother in her nineties and my sister as well… We all got defrauded.”Nor were Trump’s pardons confined to financial crime alone. In the political realm, he used them to dismantle the already-fragile idea of public accountability, turning American public squares into carnivals of bribery and fraud.He pardoned Alexander Sittenfeld, a former member of the Cincinnati city council,convictedby a jury on both bribery and extortion charges, John Rowland, a former Connecticut governor, caught out inmultiple corruption casesand Jeremy Hutchinson, a former Arkansas state legislator and scion of one of Arkansas’s most prominent political families. In 2023, Hutchinsonpleaded guiltyto accepting over $150,000 worth of bribes, receiving a four-year sentence as a result – a sentence thatTrump wiped awayearlier this year.Just this month Trumpannounced the pardonof Henry Cuellar, a Texas representative and the first member of Congress in US history formally accused of acting as a foreign agent,allegedly overseeing multiple bribery schemesfrom Mexico to Azerbaijan. Cuellar had allegedly become an Azeri mole, working for a regime known for its kleptocratic brutality, routinely jailing dissidents, journalists and political opposition figures. Cuellar allegedly served as an Azeri agent while the regime wasengaged in ethnic cleansingagainst Armenians, constituting,as Freedom House detailed, “war crimes and crimes against humanity”.None of that mattered. Cuellar was pardoned anyway, permitted to remain in Congress and transformed into a potential political ally. The message to lawmakers was unmistakable: loyalty to Trump now offers protection from consequences. The message to foreign strongmen was equally clear. The United States, once again, is open for business.View image in fullscreen‘Gutting enforcement against corporate lawbreakers’Yet pardons are only one part of the arsenal Trump has deployed to help white-collar criminals escape justice. Pardons are generally used only for those already convicted of crimes. It’s far easier to simply drop any and all investigations into potential malfeasance, before any convictions ever come.Public Citizen, the nonprofit consumer rights group, has been keeping a record of the enforcement actions – that is, either prosecutions or investigations – against corporate defendants that have now been paused or scuttled outright, all as a direct result of Trump’s decisions. Out of 480 corporations targeted in previous enforcement actions, the Trump administration has already thwarted approximately one third of them. As Public Citizen summarized, “President Trump talks tough on crime, but his administration is gutting enforcement against corporate lawbreakers.”The examples are sprawling. After years of deadly crashes linked to systemic negligence at Boeing, the Department of Justice launched a felony case, charging the company with conspiracy to defraud the United States, and tying its conduct to the deaths of hundreds of people. Boeing initially agreed to plead guilty and pay nearly $700m in fines. But after donating about $1m to Trump’s inauguration fund, the agreement collapsed. The prosecution was dropped. Lawyers for victims’ families called the decision “unprecedented” and “obviously wrong for the deadliest corporate crime in US history”. A judge last month noted that the agreement “fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public”.Unregistered brokers trading unregulated securities. Pharmaceutical price-fixing conspiracies. Corporations operating factories that presented “imminent and substantial endangerment to public health”. Case after case evaporated – often following political donations or business arrangements benefiting Trump, his family or his allies.No sector better encapsulates this dynamic than cryptocurrency. Major crypto players like Crypto.com and Coinbase saw investigations quietly shelved. Binance and Zhao, mentioned above, stood at the center of one of this corrupt carousel.Months before Trump pardoned Zhao, Binance had begun helping Trump’s personal crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, craft its own stablecoin – a coin that a separate firm controlled by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) later used to bankroll a $2bn investment back into Binance. (For good measure, the UAE then received access to high-end American chips – despite all the rampant national security worries.)All of it generated potentially tens of millions of dollars for the Trumps in the process – and ended up resulting in Zhao walking free. It was a single, sordid web of crypto pay-offs, presidential profiteering and white-collar convictions undone, with rising national security concerns thrown in for good measure. Unsurprisingly, these crypto organizations, and the broader crypto industry as a whole, have become perhaps Trump’s biggest corporate boosters – and that there are now spiraling worries that this unregulated industry will be at the center of America’s next economic collapse.View image in fullscreenLetting the world’s criminals know: the US is open for businessAt one level, Trump’s dismissive approach to financial crime is easy to explain: it pays. But his widespread support of white-collar criminals seems to be about more than just his bottom line. Why is it that the Trump administration wants to help people who risk the destabilization of the American economy writ large?Part of it is grievance. It’s no secret that Trump has viewed himself as a victim of the Biden administration’s apparently overweening focus on financial crime – and on the supposed “weaponization” of the justice system.Part of it is about amassing further power – beating back democratic forces in places like Honduras, or ensuring support from those that owe Trump their freedom. If Trump, for example, attempts to retain office beyond constitutional limits, he will not do so alone. He will be backed by the men he freed, the corporations he shielded, and the regimes he reassured – all with a shared incentive to keep him in place. A future administration could, after all, put them back behind bars.Part of it is ideological, part of a broader suite of Republican-led policy decisions to dismantle the so-called “administrative state”. Any notion of independence at theSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC) andFederal Trade Commission(FTC) has effectively collapsed. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is starved of authority and funding, with the Trump administrationopenlyquestioning its legality. The Environmental Protection Bureau has a name that is noweffectively an oxymoron, with the administrationrolling backeverything from limits on pollution to obliterating restrictions on things likeformaldehyde. And the Department of Justice has become thepersonal plaything for Trump, which he’s used to target his enemies and aid his allies.And these are only the topline developments. The US’sForeign Corrupt Practices Act– which previously prevented American corporations from bribing crooked foreign officials, entrenching dictatorships around the world – is being effectively neutered. The newshell company registry- which would have ended the US’s role as the greatest home for dirty money around the world - is now, for all intents and purposes, dead. Autocrats and oligarchs, narco-traffickers and arms dealers, anyone relying on criminal proceeds to finance their malign activities - they’re all now realizing that they can rely on the US to act as their wallet, and to help them make the world safe for dictatorship once more.All of this makes not just the poisoning and desecration of American landscapes far likelier, but accelerates the likelihood of corporate failure, and even economic collapse. If these same dynamics – rolling back regulations, foregoing investigations, allowing corporate fraud to flourish – led to everything from ecological devastation to the Great Recession over the past few decades, there’s every reason to think it will happen again.Authoritarian systems do not emerge spontaneously. They are financed, lubricated and sustained by precisely these kinds of quid-pro-quo arrangements. The end point is not merely corruption, but entrenchment: a political order in which crime is rewarded, enforcement is optional and loyalty is currency.This dynamic not only rewards crime butincentivizesit. How stupid a corporate leader do you have to be to continue complying with rules and regulations that are no longer even enforced?It’s a race to the bottom for corporate crime, all of which will – one way or the other – blow up in our faces, through ecological catastrophe, a redux of the Great Recession, or a terrorist attack on American soil. Whatever it is, it will be something that puts paid to the idea that this kind of corruption or white-collar criminality was ever a “victimless” crime – because, by that point, all of us will be victims as well.Spot illustrations by Igor Bastidas"

Tree and decorations, check. Teachers’ presents, nativity costumes and a whole new ticketing system for the PTA’s Santa’s grotto, check. But the Christmas cards remain unwritten, the to-do list keeps growing, and thatLabubu dollyour child desperately wants appears to have vanished from the face of the earth.If you’re feeling frayed in the final days beforeChristmas, you’re not alone. But research suggests this festive overload doesn’t just leave parents tired and irritable – it may also make it harder to be emotionally honest with their children.A longitudinal study tracking nearly 300 UK parents through the Christmas period found that as burnout rises, parents are more likely to suppress how they really feel in subsequent moments, with potential consequences for their own wellbeing and for how children learn about emotions.Parental burnoutis a relatively new concept, describing chronic exhaustion, emotional distancing and loss of fulfilment tied specifically to parenting. It has been linked to depression, relationship conflict and impaired parenting, but most previous studies have relied on one-off surveys, offering only a snapshot of a problem that can fluctuate from day to day.To better understand how burnout unfolds, Dr Ziwen Teuber at the University of Luxembourg and colleagues recruited 293 UK parents – chosen in part for the country’s cultural and socioeconomic diversity – and tracked their experiences in real time across the festive season using brief smartphone surveys sent several times a day.“We were particularly interested in the Christmas period because it’s a time when parenting stress often intensifies,” said Teuber. “Routines change, social expectations increase, financial pressure rises and parents often feel responsible for creating enjoyable holiday experiences for their children – amplifying stress, while simultaneously reducing the resources parents usually rely on for recovery.”Teuber expected that parents who expressed their real feelings would be better protected against burnout. She found that the more burned-out parents felt, the more likely they were to put on a brave face for their children.“Instead of sharing how they really feel, parents tend to suppress their emotions or display emotions they don’t actually feel – for example, pretending to be happy when they are exhausted or overwhelmed,” she said.While this may feel helpful in the short term, “in the longer term it’s not beneficial – either for parents’ mental health or for parent-child interactions”.For instance, parents may risk storing up more stress for themselves, while their children miss out on learning that all emotions – including difficult ones – are normal and manageable, she explained. The research was published inCommunications Psychology.View image in fullscreenA study found no significant gender differences in parental burnout, despite mothers carrying more of the cognitive load.Photograph: Tero Vesalainen/Getty ImagesA separate analysis of the same dataset, published as apreprint,found no significant gender differences in overall levels of parental burnout. However, mothers carried more of the cognitive load. “They did more of the planning, organising and thinking about everything related to Christmas,” Teuber said.Patrik Bogdán, a psychologist at the University of Pécs in Hungary, who recently co-authored a review of the impact ofparental burnout on family wellbeing, said the research challenged the assumption that good emotion-regulation skills alone protect parents. Even parents who know how to manage their emotions can struggle when stress accumulates faster than they can recover.“Christmas is often portrayed as a time of love, togetherness and slowing down, but for many families it is more accurately characterised by haste and increased demands,” Bogdán said.The myth of the “perfect Christmas”, he added, can further fuel self-criticism and emotional exhaustion. Burnout is not a personal failing but “a natural response to prolonged life stressors”, Bogdán said.Anita Cleare, a UK-based parenting coach and author of The Work/Parent Switch, described parental burnout as an “occupational hazard” of modern family life. “When pressure to perform outstrips our resources, burnout is highly likely,” she said.The run-up to Christmas brings an endless list of expectations – Elf on the Shelf, nativity plays, teacher gifts, Advent calendars – yet the emotional detachment and disconnection that accompanies burnout “is the complete opposite of the happy family time we are trying to create”, said Cleare.“The point of Christmas is to relax and enjoy each other’s company and yet parents are so busy with the trimmings that we have no emotional bandwidth left with which to connect with our kids.”Her advice is blunt: do less. “Take the short cuts that save time so that you have time to relax and enjoy being with your family.Childrenwould rather snuggle on the sofa with you eating toast than have to sit at a table eating brussels sprouts.”How to get through Christmas without burning outDo less:Cleare said one of the biggest drivers of parental burnout is the pressure to “do Christmas properly”. “Parents don’t need every tradition. You don’t have to have Christmas pyjamas and festive duvet covers just because other people do,” said Cleare. “Choose the traditions that have meaning for you, that create the experiences you want, and which embody your family values. And just do those.”Acknowledge stress instead of masking it:Teuber, said parents often suppress their real emotions to try to protect their children, but this can backfire. Calm, age-appropriate honesty – such as saying you feel tired or overwhelmed – helps children learn that difficult emotions are normal and manageable, while reducing emotional strain on parents themselves.Build in moments of recovery:Burnout tends to worsen when parents have no opportunity to recover. Even short breaks – a walk, a lie-down, a few quiet minutes – can help prevent stress from accumulating across the day. “If it all gets a bit much, have a sentence you can say and a place you can retreat. For example: “I’m feeling a bit stressed, I’m going to go lie down for a few minutes and rest,” suggested Cleare. “Modelling to our children healthy coping strategies supports their emotional regulation as well as our own.”Share the emotional and mental load:Both Teuber and Cleare emphasised the importance of partner support. Sharing Christmas planning, shopping and organising – or simply feeling emotionally supported – can significantly reduce pressure.Lower self-imposed standards:Bogdán said parental burnout often affects those who place the highest demands on themselves. “It is essential to understand that parental burnout is not a problem of “bad parents. On the contrary, it often affects those parents who strive hardest to meet the ideal of the perfect parent and who consistently place high demands on themselves,” Bogdán said. “Over time, this persistent pressure to meet unrealistic standards can lead to exhaustion and burnout. Reducing excessively high self-imposed expectations is therefore a crucial step.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthChristmasParents and parentingChildrenPsychologyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But unanswered questions and archival silences are at the heart of the new Africa Hub atManchesterMuseum, north-west England, which is inviting people around the world to help fill the gaps.The museum holds more than 40,000 items from across Africa, many of which were traded, collected, looted or preserved during the era of theBritish empire.As a result, the names of makers, the cultural significance of objects and the people to which they once belonged are largely unknown to curators in Manchester; in many cases, only the name of the donor or the collection from which an item came is recorded.The newAfricaHub will display “beautifully crafted” items that have been in storage for years, the museum says.View image in fullscreenA view of a carved wooden figure, one of the objects at Manchester Museum.Photograph: Manchester Museum/ReutersIt is inviting visitors to the collections on Oxford Road, in the city’s university district, as well as those exploring the collections online, toshare stories about the objects’ provenance.Curators say this could lead to the restitution of items, as well as new partnerships in the African diaspora. And community collaboration has already begun. A display at the heart of Africa Hub draws on the knowledge of Manchester’s Igbo community, one of the oldest Nigerian diaspora communities in the UK.Lucy Edematie, the curator of African collections from colonial contexts at Manchester Museum, worked with the Igbo CommunityGreater Manchester(ICM) organisation to research objects and celebrate Igbo heritage.Sylvia Mgbeahurike, the vice-chairof ICM Women, said: “Some of these objects were given, some were stolen, some were taken forcefully out of conquest. It is important that we start bringing them together again. It shows inclusiveness. It shows there is strength in diversity. It shows we are one people, irrespective of our colour or where we are from.”Edematie said: “Unlike most galleries or exhibitions, which represent the culmination of years of research and collaboration, Africa Hub is the beginning. It builds on work the museum has already been doing to engage with both diasporic communities and communities in Africa but provides an opportunity to extend this even further.“It is a chance to do our thinking in public, with honesty and transparency, and to involve people in that process from the start.”The museum says the Africa Hub will be an “evolving space for reflection, dialogue and shared learning and its future direction will be shaped by public contribution”.View image in fullscreenThe objects from across Africa include animals, cultural heritage items, minerals and plants.Photograph: Manchester MuseumA spokesperson added: “We’re supposed to know everything there is to know about the collections we care for, ready to communicate the wisdom of the world through a series of carefully written object labels.“Well, sometimes the reality is slightly different. And, on this occasion, we need your help, as visitors and communities, to uncover the stories that museum records cannot tell or have suppressed.“Mostly,Africa Hubmeans being honest about what we don’t know. Manchester Museum holds over 40,000 objects from across Africa, cultural heritage items, plants, animals and minerals … much of their story remains untold.“We’re laying our lack of knowledge bare and extending an invitation to you, to come and view these collections, either in person or online, and share your own knowledge, experience and perspectives to create richer narratives.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterGreater ManchesterMuseumsBritish empireColonialismArtSculpturenewsShareReuse this content"

As a senior foreign producer for Newsnight, she reported on Iraq and Afghanistan. Just two years ago, she was filming mass graves in Ukraine.But burnt out by wars, and after a detour farming ducks in Tanzania, Wharf has now settled on the quiet northNorfolkcoast. Here, alongside her life and business partner, Willie Athill, she has embarked on a different kind of mission: the creation of Europe’s largest natural oyster reef.The Luna Oyster Project, a collaboration between Norfolk Seaweed and Oyster Heaven, aims to restore 4 million oysters to the North Sea, using the first-ever mass deployment of mother reef bricks.These fired clay structures provide the skeleton of a lost world. Centuries of bottom trawling and human impact have stripped historical oyster reefs bare, leaving only scattered fragments of what was once a teeming underwater landscape across Britain and Europe. These reefs, long absent, are now poised to anchor a new era of marine life along the coast.View image in fullscreenThe project rebuilds reefs with fired clay bricks, giving oysters structures to cling to.Photograph: Michael Leckie/PA Media AssignmentsLuna’s new mother reefs have recently been installed 2 miles out to sea. In April, millions of baby oysters from Morecambe Bay will be rehoused in their nooks and crannies, slowly forming their own natural reefs that could one day connect with smaller restoration projects to the north and south, forming a living lattice of biodiversity along England’s North Sea coastline.“It’s been very expensive and time-consuming,” Wharf admitted. “Our licence application was 280 pages and cost six figures.” Securing the licence took more than three years. George Birch from Oyster Heaven said: “None of the licences care that you’re restoring biodiversity. We had to jump through the same hoops as oil and gas platforms.”Beyond the paperwork, the job itself demands delicate attention. “You have to tend to oysters like babies,” Wharf said. “It’s like a sweet nursery. We’re even considering whether to play the music of the sea to them; it has to be recorded locally because they’re very sensitive to different sea sounds.” Birch called the reefs “living soil”, sparks of life on an otherwise barren seabed.Oysters are astonishingly fecund. Across multiple spawning seasons, over a lifespan of 10 years or more, a single female can release tens of millions of eggs, even though the vast majority perish before they ever find a surface to cling to.The oysters are not for eating, but the restoration is more than a purely ecological exercise. It is also a community endeavour. The project has employed local ecologists, project managers and crew, reviving skills and livelihoods that once thrived around oyster and mussel farming.Birch said: “Historically, the North Sea was crystal-clear, unrecognisable compared to today’s muted waters, because trillions of oysters were filtering the waves, each little creature cleansing 200 litres of water every day.”Native oyster reefs also act as natural wave breaks, stabilising coastlines, fostering biodiversity and transforming flat seabeds into complex, three-dimensional ecosystems teeming with life.“A reef will create an entire ecosystem out of a barren seabed,” said Birch. “We did a trial run on a virtually bare seabed in the Netherlands and after one year, there were 12.7 million brand-new crabs, worms, fish, microbes and fungi on the reefs.”That is why the project is largely funded by Purina, the pet food company. “What they are buying from us is supply-chain resilience,” said Birch. “Purina source fish from the North Sea for their products and need to know that resource is going to be sustainable and high-quality. By improving the marine environment, that’s what our oysters are doing for them.”Greek tragedy: the rare seals hiding in caves to escape touristsRead moreOysters themselves are exquisitely sensitive, responding to light, pressure and sound. Not only can they change sex but Birch described realising that his hatchery female oysters were only spawning eggs on Mondays.“We were, like, ‘How do they know it’s Monday?’” he said. “Then we realised that Mondays come after the two quiet weekend days, showing they were aware of the peacefulness in the room around them at the weekend and so felt safe enough to mature their eggs. How awesome is that?”From the chaos of war zones to the meticulous care of microscopic life, Wharf, Athill and Birch are cultivating tiny, perceptive lives that will quietly transform the seabed into vibrant ecosystems – hopefully reshaping the North Sea.“One of the most beautiful things that I’ve discovered about oysters is how sensitive they are,” said Birch. “They can sense pressure changes in the air outside the water: if you open a door into the hatchery room, they’ll all shut their shells. They know you’ve come in.”Explore more on these topicsNorfolkOystersEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Experts say it’s helping them growResearchers warn generative tools are helping militant groups from neo-Nazis to the Islamic State spread ideologyBen MakuchSun 21 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 08.01 ESTShareWhile theartificial intelligenceboom isupending sections of the music industry, voice generating bots are also becoming a boon to another unlikely corner of the internet: extremist movements that are using them to recreate the voices and speeches of major figures in their milieu, and experts say it is helping them grow.“The adoption of AI-enabled translation by terrorists and extremists marks a significant evolution in digital propaganda strategies,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. Webber specializes in monitoring the online tools of terrorist groups and extremists around the world.“Earlier methods relied on human translators or rudimentary machine translation, often limited by language fidelity and stylistic nuance,” he said. “Now, with the rise of advanced generative AI tools, these groups are able to produce seamless, contextually accurate translations that preserve tone, emotion, and ideological intensity across multiple languages.”On the neo-Nazi far-right, adoption of AI-voice cloning software has already become particularly prolific, with several English-language versions of Adolf Hitler’s speeches garnering tens of millions of streams across X, Instagram, TikTok, and other apps.According to arecent research postby the Global Network on Extremism and Technology (GNet), extremist content creators have turned to voice cloning services, specifically ElevenLabs, and feed them archival speeches from the era of the Third Reich, which are then processed into mimicking Hitler in English.Neo-Nazi accelerationists, the kinds who plot acts of terrorism against western governments to provoke a societal collapse, have also turned to these tools to spread more updated versions of their hyper-violent messaging. For example, Siege, an insurgency manual written by American neo-Nazi andproscribed terroristJames Masonthat became the veritable bible to organizations like the Base and the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, was transformed into an audiobook in late November.“For the last several months I have been involved in making an audiobook of Siege by James Mason,” said a prominent neo-Nazi influencer with a heavy presence on X and Telegram, who stitched together the audiobook with the help of AI tools.“Using a custom voice model of Mason, I re-created every newsletter and most of the attached newspaper clippings as in the original published newsletters.”The influencer lauded the power of having Mason’s writing from “pre-internet America” and turning it into a modern-day voice.“But to hear the startling accuracy of predictions made through the early eighties really puts a milestone on the road and it changed my view of our shared cause on a fundamental level,” he said.At its height in 2020, the Base held a book club on Siege, which was an instrumental influence on several members who discussed its benefits in a hypothetical war against the US government. A nationwide FBI counterterrorism probe eventually swept up over a dozen of its members on various terrorism related charges in the same year.“The creator of the audiobook has previously released similar AI content; however, Siege has a more notorious history,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, “due to its cultlike status among some in the online extreme right, promotion of lone actor violence, and being required reading by several neo-Nazi groups that openly endorse terrorism and whose members have committed violent criminal acts”.Webber says pro-Islamic State media outlets on encrypted networks are currently and actively “using AI to create text-to-speech renditions of ideological content from official publications”, to supercharge the spread of their messaging by transforming “text-based propaganda into engaging multimedia narratives”.Jihadist terrorist groups have found utility in AI for translations of extremist teachings from Arabic into easily digestible, multilingual content. In the past, American-imam turned al-Qaeda operativeAnwar al-Awlaki, would personally have to voice English lectures for recruitment propaganda in the anglosphere. The CIA and FBI haverepeatedly cited the influenceof al-Awlaki’s voice as a key contagion in the spread of al-Qaeda’s message.On Rocket.Chat – the preferred communications platform of the Islamic State, which it uses to communicate with its followers and recruits – a user posted a video clip in October with slick graphics and Japanese subtitling, remarking on the difficulties of doing that without the advent of AI.“Japanese would be an extremely hard language to translate from its original state to English while keeping its eloquence,” said the pro-Islamic State user. “It should be known that I do not use artificial intelligence for any related media, with some exceptions regarding audio.”So far, not just the Islamic State, but groups across the ideological spectrum, have begun using free AI applications, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify their overall activities. The Base and adjacent groups have used it for the creation of imagery, while also acknowledging, as far back as 2023, the use of these tools to streamline planning and researching.Counterterrorism authorities have always viewed the internet and technological advancements as a persistent game of catch-up when it comes to keeping pace with the terror groups who exploit them. Already the Base, the Islamic State and other extremists have leveraged emergent technologies likecrypto to anonymously fundraiseand share files for 3D printed firearms.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NazismUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The basic answer probably touches on a few aspects of the 21st-century experience. One is the horror and conflict that seem to define the news almost every day. Another centres around the material pressures that increasingly grip supposedly peaceful countries: the never-ending cost of living crisis, and the impossibility for millions of people of a secure job, a dependable home and some halfway viable idea of the future.Something else demands a mention: the all-pervading mixture of absurdity, nastiness and anger fostered by the internet. Bigotry runs rampant. What we still rather laughably call social media now seem to operate on the basis that the ideal story mixes wildly improbable elements with the kicking-up of moral outrage (witness that ghoulish “online content creator” Bonnie Blue, who,having claimedto have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, ended the year byannouncing her supportfor Nigel Farage). You can check your feed in a mood of mild curiosity, but find yourself instantly pulled into what this results in: great storms of mockery, loathing and polarised shouting.The biggest prizes seem to go to the high-profile figures who cynically manage to turn all this to their advantage – which is the essential story of everyone from latter-day porn stars, through extremist “influencers”, to the current president of the US. And the resulting noise seems only to increase people’s feelings of anomie and disorientation, particularly among the generation that was born into a world remade by the internet, and then came of age amid the aftershocks of the crash of 2008. I get emails three or four times a week that paint this picture, crisply summed up in a press release from September,sent bythe British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy: “Young people are surviving, not thriving, with many feeling disconnected and pessimistic about their future.”Journalism can perhaps only scratch the surface. Really evoking and exploring the whole surreal mess is the job of novels, plays, films, TV dramas and records. And when it comes to music, this year has delivered an absolute peach: Euro-Country,the third albumby the Irish singer-songwriter Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, better known as CMAT.To quoteits 29-year-old creator, “Every song touches on an emotional detail of what it’s like to have come up in this era of capitalism and what it’s done to us all.” It is an album replete with visions of people becoming more and more lonely and alienated, but that also makes a stand for a basic humanity: itaches, basically, and combines its portraits of an increasingly bleak world with an implied insistence that we could all play our part in something better.Now, you do not necessarily need to know any of this to appreciate CMAT’s brilliance. Plenty of her best songs are about matters of the heart. If you are one of the tens of thousands of people who watched her and her band play over the summer (not leastat Glastonbury, where she achieved what music-biz cliche would call a career-defining performance), you will know that she is a flamboyant, funny and self-confident onstage presence, and the pleasure of watching her play live is more about dizzying entertainment than social commentary. But the basic point still stands: the best musicians are always lightning rods for their time, and she is easily 2025’s best example.Some of the album’s most incisive lyrics are focused on her home country. Fittingly, the cover of Euro-Country portrays Thompson emerging from a fountain at a retail destination near her home town of Dunboyne, in County Meath: where she comes from, she has said, is increasingly a place characterised by “shopping centres and cement and roads”, where “There’s been years and years of basically no social services … and everyone’s just been by themselves on Facebook, scrolling and getting radicalised by the far right.” These things, of course, are evident in lots of other countries. But if you really want to understand how raw economics can be an offence to the human spirit,Irelandmight be the perfect prism.View image in fullscreenThe Waterways, an empty and unsold housing development, in Keshcarrigan,County Leitrim, pictured in 2012.Photograph: Cathal McNaughton / Reuters/REUTERSSeven years ago,the Guardian sent me to reporton the housing crisis that was then gripping Dublin, and still does. Amid the European HQs of Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and what was then known as Twitter, I experienced a place where, to quote one stock line I heard all over the city, “Homeless families stay in hotels, and tourists stay in houses.” Everyone I met also talked about the “ghost estates” that peppered the country beyond its capital, built in the midst of the so-called Celtic Tiger boom, that were still vacant and had left no end of human wreckage.This is whatEuro-Country’s title trackis all about. “It was normal,” Thompson sings, “building houses / That stay empty even now.” She also makes reference to what happened to some people who bought into the dream and were left wrecked: “I was 12 when the das [ie dads] started killing themselves all around me.” That is quite a line to write and sing.There are other songs that fuse the personal and political. Iceberg is about how insecurity – both financial and personal – breaks people, and about a friend who “used to wanna pick fights and scream about any ol’ thing”, but is now “drowning”. There is a bracing, unsettling examination of the modern male gaze and its sinister consequences titledTake a Sexy Picture of Me. But Euro-Country’s key moment of triumph isThe Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, which perfectly captures the queasy, accelerated whirl of the 21st century, and how much it can warp how we relate to each other.As the writer and critic Dorian Lynskeyrecently put it, it’s about something quintessentially modern: “the tragicomedy of misdirected anger”. It portrays Thompson pulling in on the motorway for a sandwich, finding an outlet branded with Oliver’s name, and collapsing into a rage that even she doesn’t understand. “I’m wasting my time on seething,” she sings. Her phone is an implied presence: the most barbed lines (“I needed deli but God, I hate him”) might easily have been posted online. And though the lyric is often hilarious, it hints at something incontestably true: the fact that as we rant about other human beings, what really puts us in that mood – which takes us back to housing, jobs and all the rest – grinds on.I first sawCMATplay almost two-and-a-half years ago. She was performing in a big top at a festival in Shropshire, to an audience of a few hundred. As the show went on, more and more people began to realise the level of talent right in front of us, and responded accordingly. But I now appreciate something else: Thompson does what the best singers and songwriters do, perfectly crystallising their time while inspirationally making a stand against it. In a lot of great art, after all, there is always a sense of defiance. Hers is full of it, which is why it is such a brilliant carrier of something that this year sometimes threatened to snuff out: a very human kind of hope.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

How can Britain ignore Beijing’s provocations and human rights abuses?Sun 21 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 13.36 ESTShareThe UK pushed hard to secure the release of Jimmy Lai, the newspaper publisher and British citizen who was a leading light in Hong Kong’s brutally suppressed pro-democracy movement. So, too, did press freedom and human rights campaigners. But the Beijing-appointed high court judges in the former colony convicted him anyway, finding Lai guilty last week on fake charges of trying to“destabilise” the Chinese Communist party(CCP). For Xi Jinping, China’s dictator-emperor, there is no greater crime.Protesting to China’s ambassador, the UK’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper,condemned the trialas “politically motivated”. She’s right, of course – but her angry words will make no difference. Beijing’s contempt for Britain’s views is as painfully obvious as the UK’s weakness and indecision in the face of Chinese hubris. The breaking of its solemn promise to respect Hong Kong’s freedoms after the 1997 handover typifies the arrogance and untrustworthiness of Xi’s CCP.The Lai travesty forms a sombre, unpropitious backdrop to Keir Starmer’s planned trade and business-focused visit to Beijing and Shanghai in January. Any half-decent Chinese fortune-teller would deem it ill-starred and suggest he stay home. Yet speaking at a City banquet this month,Starmer said it was his “duty” to go, to improve relations with a country he called “a defining force in technology, trade and global governance”. While admitting China posed “national security threats”, he downplayed them.This was typical Starmer, pursuing a balancing act amid overwhelming imbalances, seeking firm middle ground in a plashy bog. It’s true Britain’s stagnant economy badly needs foreign investment. It’s true China is a major export market. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, visiting China in January, spoke of a£1bn opportunity for jobs and growth.Yet in terms of Britain’s security and democracy, the global order and national self-respect, the price of doing business with this predatory authoritarian regime, in uncertain hope of future, dependency-creating economic, financial and tech benefits, is too high – and potentially undermines UK sovereignty. Starmer risks walking into a bear trap in Beijing like the one he blundered into this year in Washington set by Donald Trump,another powerful authoritarian bully.China’s hostile regime is Britain’s undeclared enemy. The threat it poses takes many forms. Warnings about espionage,cyber-attacksandintimidation of exiled dissidentsare heard almost daily. Yet another hack was revealed on Friday, this time at theForeign Office, reportedly by China. MI5 says businesses,parliament and MPsare routinely targeted by Chinese intelligence agents. Yet a strange reluctance to act is discernible in Whitehall.It’s still unclear, for example, why the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying for Chinacollapsed this autumn. The Commons intelligence and security committee complained last week the government was“dragging its heels”over designating China a major threat to national security. And in a very political public debut, MI6’s new chief, Blaise Metreweli,deftly skirted the China question.Here’s what Metreweli didn’t say. China’s CCP leadership fundamentally challenges Britain’s values and interests around the world through its gross human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet;persecution of its Christian minority; aggressive trade polices (such ascurbs on rare earth mineral exportsand the“dumping” of subsidised steel); military threats to Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines;partnerships with Russia, North Koreaand Iran; and through itssupport for Moscow’s illegal war in Ukraine.China’srecord-level global export incomeandrapid nuclear and conventional weapons buildupsunderpin its ambition to replace the collaborative international rules-based order with a“great power” systemit seeks to dominate. A world remade in the CCP’s totalitarian image would be the antithesis of the liberal, lawful democratic model ostensibly championed by Britain.Starmer surely knows all this, yet tries to have it both ways – by separating politics and security from business and trade in much the same futile way people try to separate politics from sport. “Protecting our security is non-negotiable – our first duty. But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas,” Starmer argued. That’s why officials disingenuously downplay the threat. They worry untimely criticism could spoil his pitch.It’s a naive approach. The CCP has a hand in everything Beijing does. China’s security state, economy and commerce are intimately intertwined and ultimately inseparable, as a previous UK government recognised whenbanning Huawei from Britain’s 5G telecoms network. That’s how authoritarian regimes work. And centralised party control has tangibly increased under Xi. Any deals Starmer makes will inevitably have national security implications.Beijing is already demanding a down payment. It wants to build abig fortress-embassynear Tower Bridge. If permission is not granted by mid-January, Starmer’s as yetunconfirmed trip may be canned. How crushing a snub that would be. And revealing of how, in China, politics and security intersect.Starmer should have learned his lesson by now. His urgent need for favourable post-Brexit trade deals with another predatory regime – the Trump administration – has become inextricably mixed up with the repulsive politics of Israel-Gaza and UK defence policy – for example, its recent decision tobuy US combat jets. And like Xi, Trumpcannot be trusted: see howhe just renegedon Starmer’s much-trumpeted £31bn US-UK “tech prosperity deal”.All is not lost. A commonsense geopolitical alternative is available. Instead of kowtowing to hostile Xi andtreacherous Trump, Labour could and should be more energetic and braver in rebuilding ties with Europe. In facing shared security threats, tackling economic challenges and upholding democratic values, Europe is Britain’s natural home.In navigating the world, Starmer should follow a simple rule: hug friends close – and know your enemy. In this spirit, he should make his China visit contingent on the priorrelease of Lai.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsChinaOpinionKeir StarmerXi JinpingPress freedomEconomic growth (GDP)International tradeGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

Here are fourHeather StewartBe it better prospects for consumer spending or the tentative signs of rising productivity, the doom and gloom of 2025 could be behind usSun 21 Dec 2025 06.48 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 13.36 ESTShareStalling growth, sticky inflation and fragile bond markets, the UK’s economic record in 2025 has hardly been one to inspire cheer. But in the spirit of the festive season, here are a few reasons to hope for a happier new year.The first is that, barring external forces, 2026 should not involve a repeat of this year’s fiscal drama.Rachel Reevesmore than doubled the margin of error, or headroom, against her fiscal rules at last month’s budget, and that should gift the Treasury a quieter 2026.The chancellor’s spring statement should be a non-event for another reason, too: she announced that while theOffice for Budget Responsibilitywill still carry out a forecast, it will not formally assess her against the rules.Why Labour should target happiness alongside economic growth | Heather StewartRead moreSo as some wise men – and women – advised her to do last year, even if there has been a marked deterioration in the outlook, Reeves intends to stand firm until the autumn budget. That would mark a welcome contrast with the tax and spend saga of the past year (though if Labour MPs choose to change the top team in Downing Street, the drama would be very much back on).A second reason for optimism is that after a gloomy year, recent surveys have included glimmers of hope.Official figures showBritain’s economy unexpectedly shrankin October. But the snapshot is backward-looking, assessing how activity had fared through the rear-view mirror. The latestflash purchasing managers index for December, published by data provider S&P Global, suggests things could be improving. The reading on its monthly index jumped to 52.1, from 51.2 in November – with 50 marking the divide between growth and contraction.In the private sector, S&P said, “the rise in new business was the strongest for 14 months and mainly reflected a solid improvement in demand across the service economy”.It would make sense that if, as many business groups have claimed, the chaotic budget buildup killed confidence, we should get a modest uptick in activity now that it is over.Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says that chimes with what he is hearing from member companies.“There was a general sense that things got quite a lot better from the first week of September, and October, then the brakes went on a little bit in November, because of pre-budget chat.”He adds: “[Hiring] won’t come back this month because it’s December, but quite a few people are quite hopeful about what comes through in January and February.”A third source of optimism is the hope that consumers could respond positively to the latestBank of Englandrate cut, the government’s £150-a-year energy bills relief package, and an end to months of tedious speculation over tax.There are plenty of reasons for caution here. Not least a reluctance at the Bank to cut rates much further, despite weakness in the labour market.But if cheaper mortgages and energy bills do help to ease the squeeze, and – whisper it – restore a bit of feelgood factor, the evidence suggests some consumers could have some financial capacity to respond.The household savings rate – the share of income workers put away for a rainy day – has jumped to well above the long-run average since the Covid pandemic. In the second quarter of this year, it was running at 10.7% – about 2.5 percentage points higher than the 1987-2019 average.Analysis by Michael Saunders, a former Bank rate setter, now of the consultancy OxfordEconomics, suggests a heightened sense of financial insecurity is one explanation. After the jarring shock of Covid shutdowns, the energy price spike, and soaring interest rates, that would make sense.He is concerned this higher propensity to save could “cap consumer spending growth” for some time to come, dampening the economic recovery. But viewed in a festive spirit of optimism, it does indicate a capacity for some households to loosen their belts a little, if the mood should take them.The fourth reason for hope is even more tentative, but potentially significant: recent productivity data has been improving.In what Andrew Wishart of Berenberg bank called recently “the good news story of the year”, the key measure of economic output per worker (vital for lifting wages and living standards) rose by 1% in the first half of 2025. This puts productivity “on course to record one of its better years since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009”.In some labour-intensive sectors, where there have been job cuts following Reeves’s changes to employer national insurance contributions (NICs), that is little more than a mathematical effect – fewer workers for a given level of GDP means more output per worker.But Wishart’s early analysis also suggests productivity gains in other sectors, including IT. “We could plausibly be witnessing the beginnings of a boost from artificial intelligence,” he argues.As Reeves’s former chief economic adviser, the London School of Economics academic John Van Reenenhas long argued, UK businesses have tended to underinvest in technology and innovation, leaning instead on the plentiful supply of cheap workers.Part of the largely unspoken logic of raising the minimum wage and employer NICs – which drove up the cost of hiring – was to tip the balance towards productivity-enhancing investment and innovation, which should be good for growth. Much, though, depends on the labour market’s capacity to re-absorb the workers laid-off in the process.Lower interest rates from the Bank would help here, plus there are some indications that wage inflation is falling away. That could perhaps open the door to more rapid reductions.While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.

It can’t happen soon enoughSun 21 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTShareOne of the great joys of Christmas for me has been being able to share my love of The Nutcracker with my son. Last year, I took him to see a child-friendly version by the Let’s AllDanceballet company. The look of wonderment and recognition on his face when the music started up is a memory that I’ll treasure for ever.I’ll confess that the idea of taking a then two-year-old to a ballet had struck me as faintly ridiculous, one of those painfully middle-class-coded things I find myself doing as a parent (see also Mini Mozart). That kind of thinking, though, is in itself elitist, because who says ballet, or classical music, should be only for rarefied audiences? The popularity of The Nutcracker, not to mention shows such asThe Snowman, which has been running at London’s Peacock theatre for28 years, is testament to how children respond joyfully, and instinctively, to dance.They are also natural dancers themselves. Walking past a school playground recently, I saw a crowd of four- and five-year-olds dancing to Is This Love by Bob Marley and the Wailers with their teacher. The way they jumped and twirled so unselfconciously was beautiful to see.Against a backdrop of cuts to arts funding, though, children are being deprived of the chance to learn more about the dance that comes so naturally to them, whether that’s doing it or watching it. When schools don’t offer dance – and many don’t – this adds a further barrier, especially to pupils from deprived backgrounds who may not have access to the cultural sphere outside school time. A 2023 Ofsted report on physical educationnoted: “Many schools do not match the ambition of the national curriculum. In two-thirds of the schools, dance is not taught to all pupils, or the dance content being taught is not well organised.”That’s why the work of companies such as Let’s All Dance is so important. “Yesterday we held a relaxed performance for some children with special needs in Banbury,” says Orit Sutton, the artistic director. “They were free to come and go as they wished but they didn’t budge for the whole show! They were all totally engrossed and then clapped and cheered at the end … It was incredibly moving and really proves that live, professional ballet should be accessible to everyone, not just an elite, wealthy few.” (To underline this ethos, some of their tickets for The Nutcracker in December 2025 cost as little as £10, and you can alsodonate ticketsto children from low-income families.)It’s easy to feel depressed about access to and funding of the arts, but there is so much hope to be found. London dance space The Place – which isshowing The Magic Flutethis Christmas – has worked with more than 4,000 children from Camden primary schools to let them experience dance as participants, audience and creators, and they do an annual playground tour as well.In a videoabout The Place’s Camden Partner Schools programme, creative learning producer Maria Ryan says: “We have had feedback from teachers who tell us that the children are more focused in class, they can concentrate better, they work better together, they communicate better, and they are more confident in their own abilities – and dance really can encourage all of these developmental processes.”Being in London has huge advantages when it comes to children’s interaction with the cultural sector, but there are similar initiatives elsewhere. Suffolk’sDanceEastalso works with schoolchildren, including those in rural primaries in key stages one and two, through an initiative calledDigital Primariesthat allows them to livestream regular science and PSHE sessions taught through dance. And in the north-west of England,Cheshire Dancedelivers cross-curricular dance projects to schools.It was announced in the summerthat the Department for Education is to continue funding student bursaries for the National Centres for Advanced Training in Dance, a scheme that delivers pre-vocational dance training to 10- to 18-year-olds in 10 dance centres across England on the basis that a career in dance should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background. The outreach portion of their grant funding has been cut, and it was feared that the centres would be forced to close.The big hope is that, after years and years of arts funding cuts and changes to the curriculum, the Labour government will be more committed to creative education in all its forms. The November 2025 curriculum report does show a much better recognition of dance as more than a simple physical activity, but as a “creative discipline”, the teaching of which should involve aspects such as choreography and performance. There are encouraging signs throughout the report that creative subjects are to be made a lot more important.A favourite print I have on my wall is ofa lino cut by the artist Roger Zogolovitch. It shows people blissfully dancing, and the words: “Dance is dreaming with your body. Dance is the hidden language of the soul.” I love it because it captures that very human impulse to express ourselves using movement, regardless of whether it’s in the club, the school playground, or on stage at the ballet.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

He felt overwhelmed by the cacophony of carols, decorations and well-wishes from strangers. But moreover, he anxiously awaited the inevitable question: what are your plans for Christmas?Amid aloneliness epidemic, it’s no surprise Christmas is a challenging time for many. The heavy focus on family events and relationships can compound feelings of loneliness and isolation, especially for people experiencing complex family dynamics or estrangement, bereavement, “empty-nesting” or separation and divorce.Cost-of-living stress and end-of-year work pressures also contribute to Christmas being a time of malaise rather than merry-making.Andrew is not alone in feeling alone. Australians are finding it harder to make new friendsRead moreHarry’s distress was deepened by a colleague’s month-long commentary about Christmas. Her complaints – a hectic social calendar, kids’ end-of-year school activities, competing Christmas Day lunch invitations, the expense of dozens of gifts –served as a reminder that for Harry that Christmas was typified not by togetherness and cheer but isolation and sadness.His reticence was understandable. Childhood Christmases were tense and miserly, owing to his parents’ marital discord, financial strain and geographical distance from extended family. University friends provided holiday companionship during early adulthood but Christmas become an increasingly solitary affair as friends married and created traditions with families of their own.For Harry, Christmas was an annual spotfire. Riding a rollercoaster of anxiety and low mood, he willed the season to pass quickly while also feeling sad for another Christmas wasted. He found himself in a familiar situation each year – isolated, yet feeling it was too late to make Christmas a different experience.Harry was certainly feeling the pang of Christmas loneliness, but we agreed his distress wasn’t unique to December, nor to this particular year. Similar feelings arose around his birthday and other significant days. For Harry, Christmas magnified other times in his life when he felt forgotten, isolated or lonely.Therapy required a multifaceted approach. First, a plan to alleviate acute distress about Christmas. Second, consideration of Christmas in future years. We focused on three aspects of Christmas: past, present and future.Challenging assumptions about ChristmasFirst, we explored Harry’s thoughts about Christmas. Like many of us, his image of Christmas was more Hallmark than reality. He idealised Christmas as perfect and enjoyable for everyone but himself.We evaluated and challenged further thoughts about Christmas: “There are rules around what should happen at Christmas”, “There’s something wrong with me if I spend Christmas alone”, “Everyone else loves Christmas, and therefore I should, too”, and “People only invite me to their Christmas events out of pity”.At some level, he held hope for a Christmas season similarly busy to that detailed by his colleague. But given Harry’s family history and current personal circumstances, this was unrealistic. Being hooked on this idea triggered feelings of sadness and inadequacy, as he blamed himself for not being able to fulfil the Christmas ideal.Here, we also acknowledged the difficulties of Christmases past, allowing space to grieve the idea that those times could have been different.Strategies for this ChristmasDevising strategies around Christmas was a necessary but not sufficient part of therapy. Harry had spent enough Christmases alone to know available options – accept a Christmas Day invitation from friends, volunteer at the local soup kitchen, attend his neighbourhood pub’s annual “orphan’s Christmas lunch” or spend the day on a solo activity such as a hike. Revisiting these possibilities was important to provide some relief from anxiety about this year’s Christmas but was unlikely to alleviate Harry’s longer-term distress.Working towards new Christmas experiencesTherapeutic work beyond strategies to manage the current Christmas would be required for Harry to have a different Christmas experience in future years. Encouraging Harry to challenge his assumptions of Christmas brought a more balanced view, allowing space to think about creating new narratives and fresh ideas. In doing so, we identified Harry’s values relating to Christmas; not prone to materialism, he sought to prioritise social connection, inclusion and kindness.You don’t need alcohol on Christmas Day. It may be far more enjoyable if you stay sober | The modern mindRead moreSocial connectedness next Christmas would be dependent on establishing and maintaining social relationships during the coming year. This included plans to reinvigorate his social life through meet-up groups, reconnecting with old friends and joining community groups. He accepted an invitation for this year’s Christmas Eve celebrations, challenging his assumption that such invitations were extended only out of pity.Harry was also able to reframe his notion of spending time alone at Christmas as an indication of rejection or defectiveness. He recognised his quieter personality and tendency towards introversion, noting he wanted to balance socialising with others with time to rest and recuperate.Therapy with Harry was by no means a panacea for his Christmas dread. While some gains were made, his deep-seated distress would be difficult to shake. Avoiding comparisons with others and challenging his own assumptions around Christmas was key to making the best of this and future holiday seasons.*Harry is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify similar casesIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636 andLifelineon 13 11 14.

The letters charge the businesses, whose names – ShapeShifter Apparel, GenderBender LLC, TomboyX – indicate the nature of their wares, with neglecting to register these products as “medical devices”. “Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice,” the letters warn. “These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure and injunction.”The FDA has a lot of nerve. After all, its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, is helmed by a man who haspromoted fake “cures”for autism,such as chelation, a treatment for heavy metal poisoning thatkilled a childthis year. To headautism and vaccine “research”, Kennedy has appointed thecharlatan David Geier, who, with his father, has published studies backing the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism. To run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, he has named Mehmet Oz, who haspromoted quack treatmentslike green coffee bean extract andraspberry ketonesfor weight loss.This intensified federal regulation piles on more pain for transgender people, a crusade Trump launched on his first day in office with the executive order “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”. The order requires the federal government to recognize only two immutable sexes – male and female – and to issue identity documents such as passports in accordance with that edict. Congress is collaborating:a bill passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesdaywould make providing transgender care a felonypunishable by up to 10 yearsin prison.As the homeland security agency is doing to immigrants, HHS is attempting to disappear its own designated undesirables. But more than driving people into hiding or sending them to undisclosed detention sites, theTrump administrationbelieves it can legislate and regulate transgender and nonbinary peopleout of existence.The president’s definition of acceptable humanity is limited. If he had his way, it seems, all women would be white and blonde.But like women who seek to end their pregnancies in states and countries where abortion is illegal, transgender people will continue to seek hormones and surgery – only they will be forced to do so through black markets and unlicensed providers, risking illness, impairment and death. Transmasculine people who don’t get top surgery will bind their breasts; transfeminine people will tuck their bits. If they want comfort and style, they’ll pay more for it.Criminalization does not stop people from doing all they can to exercise the most fundamental human right: bodily autonomy. It just makes doing so more perilous.Transgender and nonbinary people have always existed and will continue to exist. They may be driven underground, but they will not disappear. The Trump administration knows it cannot eliminate people whose genders do not match their birth certificates. So instead, it will use any means it finds necessary to do what it does best: make them suffer.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

I have long been a surf fan, I regularly write about the World Surf League Championship Tour, and once even tried my handin a local surf competition. And so in recent years, during breaks between top-tier WSL events, I found myself glued to live streams for the second tier,the Challenger Series.Only this year, the WSL wrapped up in September, and the Challenger Series had major gaps in its schedule. And that was how I found myself addicted to third-tier surfing, the WSL Qualifying Series (QS). What started with watching the best surfers in the world on the best waves in the world ended with the Taiwan Open ofSurfing. Jinzun Harbor is not Teahupo’o or Pipeline, but, for the surf-starved, it is better than nothing.Stephanie Gilmore to return from hiatus and surf on next year’s world tour at age 38Read moreThe QS is the lowest rung on the ladder that is competitive surfing. The competition is divided into a regional format, with Australian surfers competing across the country and throughout Asia, for a precious few spots on the Challenger Series. Youthful surf prodigies vie with local stalwarts and nomadic veterans clinging on to the dream of WSL glory. Some events feature more than 100 surfers. Short, four-surfer heats in variable conditions make for frenetic action.The competitive pyramid has a democratising effect on the sport. While there are of course many barriers to the elite level, and an athlete from the surfing heartlands – Australia, Hawaii, the US, and more recently Brazil – has institutional advantages, in theory at least it is a level playing field. Any young surf talent, anywhere in the world, can follow the pathway to the dream tour.View image in fullscreenThe often tricky logistics of the QS don’t stop the WSL streaming to the world in high definition.Photograph: Hannah Anderson/World Surf LeagueThanks to the magic of technology, that pathway is also live streamed. Surfing has been a pioneer of streaming. The variable nature of waves necessitate an event window and the uncertainty about when exactly competition will run makes the sport less desirable for television networks.That reality, according to Will Hayden-Smith, who oversees the QS, has been a “blessing in disguise”. It has forced the WSL to develop to a position where it can “roll up to a jungle in Indonesia, with five suitcases of equipment and a commentary team, and we can be streaming on YouTube around the world”, he says.These logistical challenges are no exaggeration. One popular QS event, the Krui Pro in Sumatra, Indonesia, requires surfers and the WSL’s broadcast team to fly to Jakarta, then to Lampung in southern Sumatra, and then embark on an eight-hour drive to the event site. There is barely internet at the contest site, but somehow the WSL beams a high-definition broadcast to the world – for free.View image in fullscreenChina doesn’t have a reputation as a surf hub but the QS visit helps put it on the map.Photograph: Hannah Anderson/World Surf LeagueView image in fullscreenThe QS is where you go to get a glimpse of surfing’s next big stars.Photograph: Hannah Anderson/World Surf LeagueThe broadcast is important, for at least three reasons. First, selfishly, it provides surf addicts like myself something to while away the time. Hayden-Smith compares it to Test cricket: “That’s one of the beauties of surfing – it’s a perfect sport to have on in the background.” (If any of my bosses are reading this, please be assured that watching third-tier surfing has no impact on my productivity.)‘Dogshit’ waves and no second chances: the cut-throat grind of chasing a World Surf League ticket | Kieran PenderRead moreSecond, it provides an economic model for the events – which are often funded by local tourism authorities. The live streams are effectively advertorials for lesser-known waves, eager to attract surf tourism dollars (the WSL says it has data which shows major surf tourism growth off the back of QS events).Hayden-Smith is in China, at the latest QS event, when I speak with him. It is a case in point: China is hardly a global surf hub, he says, but there are beautiful white sandy beaches, palm trees and a long left-hand point break in front of him. “Surfers love to travel – if you’re watching this event in China, you might have never thought about travelling to China, but maybe it gets added to your bucket list,” he says. “Surfers are curious about new waves.”Third, because everyone starts at QS level, it is a great opportunity for fans to get to know the stars of the future. It is the Drive to Survive effect (at the top-tier level,the WSL had an equivalent, Make or Break, on Apple TV). If fans can follow someone from the QS to the CS to the CT, there is deeper emotional investment in the surfer and their career.View image in fullscreenKana Nakashio competes the QS Wanning International on Hainan Island, China.Photograph: Hannah Anderson/World Surf LeagueSome of the most exciting young Australians, including 19-year-old duo Dane Henry and Harley Walters, have impressed on the QS this year – they are tipped to be future WSL surfers. The Australia/Oceania regional rankings for women are topped by 15-year-old Lucy Darragh, after she won the Nias Pro and the Taiwan Open.That, for me, was a surprise finding of my deep, months-long “investigation” into the QS – the kids are really, really good. The difference in quality between the best surfers in the world, and their semi-professional or even amateur third-tier counterparts, is not vast. Where once the top pros where on another planet, today the gap is marginal. That means good fortune can often be the difference between a Championship career and years slugging it out on the QS.A few decades ago, a major surf brand had a hit campaign with a simple tagline: “Only a surfer knows the feeling.” As I was writing this column a surfer friend messaged me: “[I’m] so pro surfing starved I’m currently watching under-16s at [the International Surfing Association] juniors.”Perhaps only a true surf addict knows that feeling.Explore more on these topicsSurfingAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Still, I’m convinced that I am the true spirit of the festive seasonSun 21 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 13.58 ESTShareMost families have their own unique festive rituals, and my husband and I have spent this December in the manner traditional to us: squabbling. He is fully invested in every possible aspect of the season of goodwill. On the big day itself, he wears his cracker crown until it breaks, like a metaphor; I usually don’t bother unfolding mine, let alone putting it on. We’ve been married for 15 years, and weathered many storms together, but at the moment our relationship is particularly challenging. How do you cope when you’reChristmasincompatible?In my defence, I’m not bah-humbugging at merely a rational amount of yuletide spirit. My husband is perpetually jolly as standard – it’s always the first word anybody I introduce him to uses to describe him afterwards. He’s relentlessly cheerful, endlessly enthusiastic and can be relied upon to put a positive spin on any situation. If we were trapped in a burning building, the last words I’d hear would be, “At least we’re not cold!”This is his ordinary, his base level, and then, as November draws to a close, he turns it up to 11. He makes Buddy the Elf look like Debbie Downer.He loves everything about Christmas. Fittingly, his name is Nick, and although some might argue that he’s a saint, I will only sign off on long-suffering. He actively enjoys the music. Even the second merriest person in the world allows themselves a brief sigh mid-December when All I Want for Christmas Is You starts to playagain. Not my husband. He’s a cross between a goldfish and a labrador – each time he hears Fairytale of New York is like the first time, and he couldn’t be more delighted, or sing along with any more gusto. I wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out that Wizzard had passed him bouncing down the street and been inspired to write their hit song – this man genuinely does wish it could be Christmas every day.I quite like all the twinkly fairy lights, but other than that, it’s a great deal of work, stress and panicBy comparison, I’m the Grinch, but come on, so are the majority of us, surely? I am normal about Christmas. It’s fine. Exciting for our son, and that’s lovely, I quite like the twinkly fairy lights that pop up all over the place, but other than that, it’s a great deal of work, stress and panic. Forced fun, obligation to feel a certain way, a lot of pressure on one day. Ho ho ho, etc.Last week my husband was accidentally within earshot when I mooted to a friend that 25 December should be like 29 February, Leap Day, and happen only every four years so we have a chance to miss it and then appreciate it more. It’s fair to say this did not go down well (with him at least; my friend agreed, which is why she’s my friend.) I honestly believe he would have minded less if he’d overheard me confessing to an affair.In 2026 I might make him an Advent calendar, but instead of chocolate, behind each door is a little picture of the festive facet we will be bickering about that day. This month our arguments have run an exhausting, exhaustive gamut, including which day the tree goes up, cheese, flashing lights: tacky or joyful?, whether it’s acceptable to replace famously unpopular turkey with something that fits in the oven, where to hang stockings, tinsel: tacky or joyful?, when to vacuum, the king’s speech, whether Aled Jones sang the theme song to The Snowman or not (not!), matching pyjamas: tacky or joyful?, and why he hasn’t had a single mince pie yet.The last one illustrates the main problem with being the spectre at the yuletide feast – by Tigger Santa standards – any element that hasn’t completely filled his heart with glee instantly becomes my fault/deliberate intention. I am the face of Christ-meh-as. But maybe, just maybe, he needs me in order to be him? Am I the enabler of this festive addiction? Perhaps he wouldn’t be able to fully lean into his “100% extra Jingle Bells” persona if he didn’t have my eye-rolling to rail against? What if, instead of being Scrooge, I am actually the true spirit of Christmas? No, I don’t think so either, but I’m still going to give it a go during tomorrow’s row.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sir Keir Starmer’s predicament proves that those conditions are not sufficient.The prime minister’s inability to convince voters that he has an agenda for national renewal, and the demoralising effect that has had on the Labour party, make aleadership challengelook plausible after local elections next May. Maybe sooner.Toppling Sir Keir would be consistent with a pattern in recent British politics for short-serving prime ministers.David Cameronwas the last one who managed a full parliamentary term. Since then, the average tenure has been around 20 months. This suggests there is something about governing Britain that defeats all who have tried in recent years.That isn’t to excuse Sir Keir’s personal failings. A more charismatic leader with a more developed plan for government might have fared better. But his mistakes are amplified by structural problems that antedate his arrival in office. Voter dissatisfaction drives MPs to want to replace their leaders, and economic malaise has been driving public discontent since the financial crisis of 2007-08. People have been working harder, without a proportionate rise in their standard of living. That would be a political depressant even without the shocks of Covid, war inUkraineand Brexit.Stagnant wages, a high cost of livingand self-imposed fiscal ruleshave turned policymaking into an exercise in shuffling scarce resources between competing interest groups. Chancellors are always raiding one department’s budget to prop up another one, taxing one group of people to spend on their neighbours. This is zero-sum politics. It generates resentment and makes it easy for demagogues to get traction with claims that migrants take an unfair share of public resources.The government came close to recognising the character of this quandary before November’s budget, when Rachel Reevesaddressed the countryto warn of the need for broad-based tax rises to fund public services. But that would have breached an unambiguous manifesto pledge, so the chancellor and the prime minister flinched. Thebudgetinstead relied on stealth taxes, improbable spending projections and wishful thinking about future economic growth. Hard choices were deferred.That is not surprising when so many political incentives militate against candour. Leaders from all parties cite the virtue of confronting tough decisions and levelling with the public, but the more common practice iscakeism– pretending that voters can have their cake and eat it too. It was Boris Johnson who made that an explicit doctrine for Brexit, claiming Britain would enjoy only benefits and pay no cost for relinquishing EU membership. Since then the spirit of cakeism endures in denial of other awkward questions, on funding social care, for example, or managing the climate crisis.In 2024, Labour won power with acakeist manifesto, promising change within budget constraints that felt more like continuity. In 2025, the impossibility of delivering on that promise became obvious. In 2026, the party will need a more honest account of Britain’s predicament and clearer prescriptions to deal with it. MPs might decide that new leadership will provide those things. Perhaps it can. But they should note also that replacing prime ministers has become a habit in British politics born of systemic failure to address more complex problems.Explore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerRachel ReevesTax and spendingUK cost of living crisisDavid CameronConservativeseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Britain must build NHS capacity so that cures become collective goods, not expensive productsSun 21 Dec 2025 12.25 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 15.53 ESTShareJust asmall fractionof our20,000 genescan cause disease when disrupted – yet that sliver accounts forthousands of rare disorders. The difficulty is: what can a doctor do to treat them? In a common condition such as type 2 diabetes, the underlying biology is similar for millions of patients. The doctor can prescribemetformin. But with a genetic disorder, the mutation might only affect a small number of people worldwide. In many cases,doctorswon’t even know which mutation is responsible, let alone how to fix it.Novel gene-editing breakthroughs are makingheadlines. But therapies are expensive and complex to develop. The cost of bringing any new drug to patients is now around $2bn, in part because, as Brian David Smith notes inNew Drugs, Fair Prices, the “success rate, from discovery to market, is tiny” and there are approved treatments for “less than 10% of the 8,000 diseases that affect humans”. Commercial incentives, he argues, skew innovation towards lucrative cancer drugs and long-term treatments for large populations. Complex gene therapies for very rare conditions are seen as too costly to develop and too small to profit from.Take 2022’srevolutionarygene therapy to treat a young patient with relapsed T-cell leukaemia at Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH) in London. Waseem Qasim, a paediatric immunologist leading that work,warnedearlier this year that “we are going to end up with treatments that work, but that nobody wants to pay for”. Sustaining pioneering work cannot rely on philanthropy alone. His technological advance – “off‑the-shelf” edited T-cells – would require industrial-scale manufacturing to become widely available, and the market alone will not build it. GOSH’sresearchhints at the promise – and limits – of the therapy.Biotech’s boom-time cash has moved on to silicon chips and artificial intelligence. That is why a milestone in prime editing – a DNA “search and replace” technology – was announced this May with a warning. Prime Medicine, the company behind the therapy, had successfully treated a teenager with a rare immune disorder butsaidit would halt future work. The geopolitics of big pharma is also changing. Firms are shifting research and manufacturing toward nations with scale and long-term policy support, such as China and the US. Britain looks exposed.Donald Trumphas already forced the UK to accept higher prices for NHS medicines under threat of tariffs. This means less cash to support patients and for breakthrough therapies.Per-patient costs of gene therapies can go up tosix or seven figures. If the cure exists and the business model does not, the latter must change. Britain needs state-backed manufacturing for medical sovereignty – though it must not ignore the reality that China can already produce some gene therapies considerably more cheaply. What’s needed is a renewed social contract in which innovation is shared, not hoarded. Rare-disease gene therapy could be treated like dialysis or transplants: an NHS service funded collectively, not a market good.Many experimental treatments could remain in long-running NHS research programmes, offered at cost while the science matures. Only a universal, publicly funded health system – withequitable accessand lifelong follow-up – can make gene therapy medicine, rather than merchandise. Without the NHS and charities, the breakthroughs remain in the lab. With it, they become part of the common good.Explore more on these topicsGene editingOpinionGeneticsMedical researchBiologyHealthNHSeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Until Brexit, there were diverse chances for students to sample courses, cultures and environments in unfamiliar settings, enriching their experiences in ways that had lasting benefits. As one example, I looked after the UK arm of a consortium of European universities that enabled up to 10 students each year from each of six participating universities from six European countries to attend a 10-day environmental field course in one of these countries. We were able to continue this arrangement without a break for 12 years from 1997, funded almost entirely through Erasmus, so the cost to students was minimal.The field course venue was hosted by rotation, so each university only had to organise the course once every five or six years. Every year, participating students experienced working closely with peers from each country, and were exposed to different ideas and ways of approaching environmental issues, and environments that included the Mediterranean, centralEuropeand the far north. Lasting international friendships developed that in many cases endured long after the end of the course, and everyone enjoyed the experience, including staff, who developed working collaborations across Europe. These opportunities were only possible through the Erasmus scheme – its reinstatement will allow future students the benefits of similar experiences and life enhancement.Graham WaltersWalthamstow, LondonThe UK needs a globally skilled workforce to negotiate, connect and engage internationally. Student mobility is crucial to achieving this, so it is very welcome news that the government has announced its association with Erasmus+ (UK to rejoin EU’s Erasmus student exchange programme, 16 December).The British Council has a longstanding commitment to supporting international exchange. We were a lead partner in the Erasmus+ UK National Agency from 2014 to 2020, where Erasmus+ made a significant contribution to the UK’s cultural relations activities, funding 4,846 projects, engaging 128,000 UK participants and awarding more than €679m to UK organisations.Erasmus+ has a proven track record in changing lives, opening up new learning experiences, providing insight into different cultures and nurturing the concept of global citizenship, not only among higher education staff and students but also across non-formal education, schools, technical and vocational education and training, and sport. Reassociation with Erasmus+ can only be a good thing for young people throughout the country.Maddalaine AnsellDirector education, British CouncilIt is disappointing to see much of the media fail to recognise that Erasmus has now acquired a “plus”, and it is not solely for higher-education students. The programme might have begun with higher education in 1987 but it now includes schools, youth groups, sports teams, and vocational and adult education. As an organisation supporting schools, we look forward to the reinstatement of eTwinning, teacher job shadowing and in-service programmes, which were taken from the UK in 2020. Indeed, we have already had enquiries from schools in Spain, Denmark and France seeking partner schools in the UK.Ray KirtleyChair, UK Global Learning Association for SchoolsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In that spirit, I always enjoy Jonathan Jones’s reviews, but I must disagree with his particular criticism that Tate has hidden its treasures (Don’t blame Maria Balshaw for Tate’s failings. Its lack of ambition goes much deeper, 12 December). Rothko’s Seagram murals were lent to a landmark exhibition in Paris last year, but they returned to Tate’s walls as soon as they arrived home. The UK’s greatest collection of Picassos is also proudly on display in its entirety at Tate Modern in a show that has already welcomed more than 100,000 visitors.The much-loved greats – from Dalí to Duchamp, and Hepworth to Hockney – are not “out of view”. They are all there to be enjoyed, side by side with new discoveries, underappreciated gems and emerging talent.Roland RuddChair, TateJonathan Jones has described Tate Modern’s current installation in theTurbine Hallby Máret Ánne Sara as “feeble”. My first visit to this installation was swift; first viewed from the balcony, it looked lost within the vastness of the Turbine Hall and I didn’t bother to engage with it.On a subsequent visit, my experience was quite different – entering via the cavernous area of the ramp, the perspective had changed. The installation was, of course, still lost, being surrounded by an immense empty space – but in my opinion that is the point.Sitting on reindeer skins, listening to subtle recordings of wind, reindeer calls and the beautiful voice of the narrator the Turbine Hall was transformed to an atmospheric, cold and remote wilderness.It was a brave decision ofTate Modernto commission this installation. Perhaps its decisions are generally braver than we might at first think.Liz GoddardBrighton, East SussexExplore more on these topicsTate ModernArtTurbine HallInstallationMark RothkoPaintinglettersShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromMichele RyanandMike PenderSun 21 Dec 2025 12.08 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 13.36 ESTShareYour editorial (16 December) rightly calls for collective resistance to Donald Trump’s assault on the BBC. But it is important to name what we are witnessing: “entrumpification” – a political technology that attacks democratic institutions where they are strongest, not weakest.TheBBCmade an editorial error. It acknowledged it and apologised. That should have been the end of the matter. Instead came billion-dollar lawsuits, orchestrated outrage and ritual denunciations of “fake news”. Institutions built on accuracy find accuracy weaponised. A single mistake is reframed as proof of systemic dishonesty. This is the trap.The only viable response is the “both-and” defence: acknowledge error while defending institutional independence with equal vigour. The BBC should state plainly: “This technical mistake does not invalidate the programme’s central thesis, which rested on evidence-based findings. We will continue investigating without fear or favour.”Entrumpification succeeds when institutions stop asking “What is right?” and begin asking “What does he want?” Britain has not reached that point, but it is closer than it was.The pattern is visible. The question is whether we – the BBC, the government, communities, citizens – resist it together while resistance can still succeed.Anthony LawtonChurch Langton, LeicestershireI propose the Guardian sets up a funding campaign for the BBC. Everyone could donate £1 minimum to show our support for democracy, independence and the power of the voice. It would show the BBC is paid for by us, it belongs to us (flaws and all) and is not a business.Michele RyanHaverfordwest, PembrokeshireI wonder if potential visitors to the US could be barred from entry if they admit to be BBC licence payers.Mike PenderCardiffHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While England’s white-ball record under McCullum is poor, with his sideknocked out of the Champions Trophywithout winning a game in February and losing a home one-day international series to South Africa in September, the fact that the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka begins on 7 February could earn him a reprieve.Stokes said in the immediate aftermath of the Adelaide defeat that he “absolutely”wants to stay on as Test captainafter the Ashes, which is likely to come as a relief to the ECB, who will certainly be desperate to retain his services as a player for as long as possible. The 34-year-old signed a new two-year central contract before the Ashes which will expire at the end of the 2027 World Cup.Rob Key’s position as director of cricket will also be the subject of internal discussion given he appointed McCullum and wholeheartedly backed his attacking approach, as well as also giving him the white-ball job at the end of last year, which has not worked out.The former Kent and England batsman had been behind the decision to split the Test and white-ball roles when he replaced Giles following the last Ashes tour, initially appointing Australian Matthew Mott as the limited-overs coach before sacking him last summer following poor performances in 50 over and T20 World Cups in 2023 and 2024. Key’s own decision-making is likely to be scrutinised as a result, including his seemingly dismissive approach to the County Championship, which has left many including players including Jamie Smith and Jacob Bethell short of red-ball practice coming into the Ashes.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamAshes 2025-26Brendon McCullumBen StokesECBThe AshesCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

At that point, as Villa went six without a win, it wasn’t clear whether Rogers’ form was a symptom or a cause of Villa’s more general malaise.There was a volcanic touchline reaction from Emery on Sunday as well, but this was rather more positive. As Rogers swept in his second of the game to restore Villa’s lead, Emery ripped off his thick padded coat, spread his arms and roared. Villa were on their way to a 10th successive win and, having failed to win any of their first six games of the season, are somehow only three points behind the leaders Arsenal.Morgan Rogers double sinks Manchester United and keeps Aston Villa on leaders’ heelsRead moreAre they in the title race? That’s a rather hard question to answer.History, at least in the postwar era, a general sense of the status of the club, suggests not. And they have not been entirely convincing in many games this season, even as the wins have stacked up. In only two games this season have Villa had an xG more than 0.5 greater than their opponents, according to Opta. For a team that have just won 10 in a row, Villa look weirdly vulnerable – but at the moment the margins are falling their way.Their recent policy seems to be to trade blows with an opponent and wait for Rogers to bail them out with a couple of crisp finishes. It happened at Leeds, ithappened at West Ham, and it happened against Manchester United.Rogers’ first goal stemmed from a brilliant finish, arced just inside the post from the corner of the box, but United couldn’t have done much more to guide him into position. He spent a lot of the game drifting left, haunting the space behind Diogo Dalot. As John McGinn found Rogers, Leny Yoro didn’t exactly charge over to close the 23-year-old down, even though the ball was bouncing awkwardly and required some controlling. The England forward had time to wander back on to his right foot, create the angle for the shot and then deposit the ball into the top corner.View image in fullscreenUnai Emery erupts with a volcanic reaction of delight during Villa’s victory.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesWhen he replaced Jude Bellingham in the England side for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia 12 days before that draw at Sunderland, it felt very much that Rogers was being used to make a point. The thought of him starting at the World Cup next summer seemed distant, not with Phil Foden and Cole Palmer also contending with Bellingham for the role behind Harry Kane. But on this form, it’s hard to see how Rogers could be left out.At the moment, Rogers is in one of those golden spells of form in which it seems that he cannot miss. If the ball falls within the arc of his right foot, it will end up in the net. His second goal was essentially a slight scruffier version of his first as he seized on an Ollie Watkins lay-off, took advantage of further dilatory defending from Yoro and clipped his shot past Senne Lammens.Forewarned, you might have thought was forearmed, but perhaps Rogers’ right foot is becoming like Arjen Robben’s left: just because you know he’s going to whip the ball into the top corner doesn’t mean you can stop him. Or perhaps this was just a game againstManchester United, a club whose journey through the wilderness shows no sign of reaching a destination any time soon. They weren’t terrible, but they had nobody with the decisiveness of Rogers, while the tendency towards self-destruction remains strong.View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers is enjoying a golden spell for Aston Villa during their 10-match winning run.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/ShutterstockCan Villa sustain this? Logic says not. United had more shots and more shots on target than Villa. They’ve won each of their last eight games by a single goal. They’ve conceded in all but one of those games. Regression to the mean might be the biggest rival Villa have to face over the coming weeks. Rogers, surely, cannot keep on thrashing the ball into the top corner.Perhaps there is another reality in which, rather than results trending towards performances, performances begin to trend towards results. Maybe Watkins rediscovers his best form and starts scoring again. Maybe Jadon Sancho turns into the player he looked at Borussia Dortmund. Maybe Harvey Elliott rediscovers his form. Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres will eventually return from injury. Perhaps there is in that the possibility of a title challenge, but they surely cannot keep relying on Rogers.But then nobody expected this. Nobody thought Villa would be third at Christmas. And certainly two months ago, nobody thought Rogers by the end of the year would be spearheading a title charge while looking like a vital England player. The current run is to be savoured precisely because it feels so unlikely. As Rogers stood in front of the North End at the final whistle conducting the cheers of the crowd, he seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it. As he deserves to. These spells are rare in football and should be relished.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaManchester UnitedUnai EmeryanalysisShareReuse this content"

There was no snarling and no sullenness from the former champion, just a nod of recognition, an admission that sometimes the other guy just plays darts from the gods. And here the other guy was Wesley Plaisier, the world No 92 from the Netherlands, a player of rich potential, but nothing that would ever have suggested he was capable of a shock of this magnitude.The talent has always been there: last year he joined a select group of players to have won a Pro Tour event despite not holding a tour card.Former champion Michael Smith crashes out of PDC world darts against ZonneveldRead moreAfter making his way through Q-School, this year has been harder. He lost his grandmother in the summer. He barely made a dent on the European Tour or in the majors. But strange things can happen under the Palace roof. And over three lightning-quick sets Plaisier raised hell.He hit nine of his 16 attempts at double, and did not blink even as the world No 9 roared back at him in the third set with consecutive 11-dart legs on throw. “I still can’t believe it,” he said.“My biggest victory ever, I think. I don’t know how I did it. I was so nervous. I can’t explain it in words. I felt like I could get ahead. But I didn’t expect to win it.”As Price smiled and allowed the giant Plaisier to wrap him up in his arms, the Welshman could be forgiven for wondering just what had hit him.He came into this tournament as one of the favourites, convinced he could regain the tournament he won so strangely under Covid conditions in 2021. The Alexandra Palace crowd, for so long a thorn in his side, had been converted into a wind at his back, singing his name, even booing Plaisier as he lined up his match darts.View image in fullscreenWesley Plaisier lets out a huge roar after beating Gerwyn Price.Photograph: Wayne Tuckwell/ProSports/ShutterstockEven though he has not reached a major final, this has still been a cautiously promising year for him, the year he got his swagger back and re-established himself as a genuine contender. He will still be in contention for next year’s Premier League. But perhaps this defeat exposed the major remaining flaw in his game: a softness in the key moments, the ability to play well and still lose.As Plaisier began the match with a 130 checkout and kept up the pressure, Price fumbled his way into the game. His normally reliable tops failed him: just two from eight attempts on his favourite double. At other times, he simply didn’t get a look. Remarkably, in six of the 13 legs Plaisier didn’t even allow him a dart at double. Price’s exit, following that of the No 8 seed, Chris Dobey, on Saturday, further opens up the draw for Luke Littler, who now cannot face another top-16 player until the semi-finals at the earliest. Littler looked briefly mortal in his own second-round game, coming through 3-0 after an uncharacteristically lukewarm performance in which the world No 146, David Davies, missed five darts for the opening set, and 16 in total.Did it matter? Probably not.The great championshave always been occasionally prone to a cold start, and as the format lengthens – we go from best of five to best of seven in the third round – the chances of an ambush recede appreciably.View image in fullscreenThe world champion Luke Littler celebrates winning his second-round match.Photograph: Wayne Tuckwell/ProSports/ShutterstockAfterwards, Littler revealed that Mensur Suljovic had texted him as soon as the draw was made to say: “See you in round three”. And so it is that the teenage titan and the ageing Austrian will meet next weekend, after the latter beat an enraged Joe Cullen 3-1. Enraged at Suljovic’s glacial pace of play and his extravagant celebrations, Cullen accused his opponent of “cheating”.“If that’s darts, I don’t want no part of it,” the former Masters champion fumed on X. The truth is that there has always been a grey area between legitimate tactic and deliberate gamesmanship. But ultimately the responsibility for Cullen’s darts is his alone. Suljovic was certainly happy to play the innocent. “I never ever do this as a provocation,” he says. “Sorry, Joe. I love you, man.”Elsewhere the former champion Rob Cross came through 3-1 against Ian White, the German No 1, Martin Schindler, ended the challenge of Keane Barry in three tight sets and Krzysztof Ratajski continued his impressive start to the competition by comfortably despatching Ryan Joyce. Luke Woodhouse, the world No 25 from Worcestershire, looks in decent nick too, beating Max Hopp 3-0 to set up a tantalising third-round tie against Andrew Gilding. The 16th seed Damon Heta won the final two sets to beat the Swiss debutant Stefan Bellmont 3-2 and will next take on Cross.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsnewsShareReuse this content"

The skid matched the franchise’s worst since moving to Tennessee in 1997.Bears stun Packers in overtime as Eagles top Commanders to clinch NFC EastRead moreWith two games left, the Chiefs (6-9) are assured of their first losing record since 2012 – their most recent season without Andy Reid as their coach. Kansas City have lost four straight, their longest skid since 2017, and six of seven.A week after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL, his backup, Gardner Minshew, was knocked out of the game with a knee injury early in the second quarter.Ward posted his highest passer rating of this season at 122.3, and he overtook Marcus Mariota for the most yards passing by a rookie for the franchise. He helped the Titans roll up a season-high 377 yards of offense against a Chiefs defense that came in as the NFL’s eighth-stingiest in yards allowed.The rookie threw a shovel pass to Chig Okonkwo that went seven yards to put the Titans ahead to stay late in the first half. Ward also found fellow rookie Chimere Dike for a 1-yard TD in the third quarter.Minnesota Vikings 16-13 New York GiantsJJ McCarthy ran for a touchdown before leaving with an injury to his right, throwing hand, and backup quarterback Max Brosmer helped the Minnesota Vikings win their third game in a row, beating the New York Giants 16-13 on Sunday in a matchup of teams eliminated from playoff contention.McCarthy was injured on a strip sack by Brian Burns in the final minute of the first half, when it appeared the Vikings (7-8) were going to let the clock run out. Instead, Burns forced McCarthy to fumble with a crushing hit and Tyler Nubin returned it 27 yards for a touchdown.Brosmer led a go-ahead scoring drive in the fourth quarter that ended with Will Reichard making a 30-yard field goal. The rookie completed 7 of 9 passes for 52 yards in his fourth NFL appearance and first since throwing four interceptions 30 November in a 26-0 loss at Seattle.Before getting hurt, McCarthy completed 9 of 14 passes for 108 yards and had a would-be pick-6 negated by an offside penalty on Abdul Carter. After having his entire rookie year wiped out by a torn meniscus in his right knee, the 2024 No 10 pick has missed time this season because of a concussion and a sprained right ankle.The Giants (2-13) lost their ninth consecutive game and fifth since Mike Kafka took over as interim coach when Brian Daboll was fired on 10 November. They have not won since 9 October.Los Angeles Chargers 34-17 Dallas CowboysJustin Herbert threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score and the Los Angeles Chargers closed in on a playoff spot with a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.The Chargers’ fourth consecutive victory gave them a chance later in the day to clinch their second postseason berth in two seasons under coach Jim Harbaugh. LA (11-4) would be in with a loss or tie by either Indianapolis or Houston.Dak Prescott had TD passes on his first two drives but couldn’t find the end zone again for Dallas, which was eliminated from the playoffs for the second year in a row with Philadelphia’s NFC East-clinching victory at Washington on Saturday.The Cowboys (6-8-1) have lost three in a row since a three-game winning streak that put them over .500 for the only time in coach Brian Schottenheimer’s first season.In his third full game with his broken non-throwing (left) hand heavily protected, Herbert led the Chargers to touchdowns on all three drives in the first half. Omarion Hampton scored on a five-yard run in the second half.Buffalo Bills 23-20 Cleveland BrownsJames Cook rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns, Josh Allen played through a foot injury and the Buffalo Bills drew closer to a playoff berth with a 23-20 victory over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.Ty Johnson also had a rushing score for the Bills (11-4), who have won four straight and five of six.Allen played the second half despite injuring his right foot during the second quarter.The reigning NFL MVP was favoring the foot after being sacked by Cleveland’s Myles Garrett and Alex Wright for a 22-yard loss to Buffalo’s one-yard line with 60 seconds remaining in the first half. The half-sack gave Garrett 22 on the season. He needs one more sack in the final two games for the Browns (3-12) to pass Michael Strahan and TJ Watt for the single-season mark.Allen was 12 of 19 for 130 yards and also rushed for 17 yards on seven carries.New York Jets 6-29 New Orleans SaintsChris Olave caught touchdown passes from Tyler Shough and Taysom Hill, Charlie Smyth tied a Saints record with five field goals and New Orleans extended their winning streak to three with a 29-6 victory over the reeling New York Jets on Sunday.Cameron Jordan had two sacks for New Orleans (5-10), giving him 130 for his career and moving the 15th-year defensive end two ahead of Hall of Famer Rickey Jackson for 17th most in NFL history. Jordan, now with a team-high 8 1/2 sacks this season, has had at least eight sacks in nine seasons.Shough, drafted 40th overall last spring, passed for 308 yards to eclipse 300 for the first time while improving to 4-3 as a starter. Hill accounted for 116 yards with 42 rushing, 36 receiving and his 38-yard scoring pass to Olave in the final minutes.Undrafted rookie Brady Cook made his second start with the Jets (3-12), who’ve lost three straight and five of six.Cook was sacked eight times. He lost a fumble when ex-Jet Nathan Shepherd flattened him and defensive end Chase Young recovered, leading to Smyth’s 50-yard field goal. Cook also was intercepted by rookie safety Jonas Sanker on a fourth-down play in the fourth quarter, leading to Smyth’s final field goal from 39 yards.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20-23 Carolina PanthersBryce Young threw for 191 yards and two touchdowns, Lathan Ransom intercepted Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left and the Carolina Panthers beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23-20 on Sunday to take over first place in the NFC South.The Panthers (8-7) can wrap up with the division title next Sunday with a win over Seattle and a Buccaneers (7-8) loss to Miami. However, if both teams win or both teams lose, the Panthers would need to beat Tampa Bay again on the road in Week 18 to claim their first division title since 2015.Tetairoa McMillan had six catches for 73 yards and a touchdown as the Panthers once again bounced back with a huge win after a potentially devastating loss to the last-place New Orleans Saints.Ransom had a huge mistake in that defeat with a late hit on Saints QB Tyler Shough that led to New Orleans’ winning field goal.But with the Bucs driving for a tying field goal – or a go-ahead touchdown – there was a miscommunication on a second-and-9 pass play between Mayfield and Mike Evans at the Carolina 42 and Ransom got an easy pick to seal the win.Cincinnati Bengals 45-21 Miami DolphinsJoe Burrow rebounded from his first time being shut out to throw for 309 yards and four touchdowns as the Cincinnati Bengals routed the Miami Dolphins 45-21 on Sunday.Miami (6-9) and Cincinnati (5-10) were both eliminated from playoff contention last week, but the teams insisted they were still motivated for the final three games of the season.It appeared that way in the first half. Cincinnati held a 17-14 halftime lead before blowing the game open with 28 points off four straight Dolphins turnovers.Burrow carved up Miami’s defense, completing 25 of 32 throws with a 146.5 passer rating before being replaced by veteran Joe Flacco early in the fourth quarter. Two of Burrow’s touchdown passes went to running back Chase Brown, from 9 and 5 yards out. Brown, who finished with 66 yards rushing and 43 receiving, also had a 12-yard touchdown run. All of Brown’s TDs came in the third, making him the first player this season with three scores in a single quarter.Ja’Marr Chase caught nine passes for 109 yards.Pittsburgh Steelers 29-24 Detroit LionsThe Pittsburgh Steelers pushed the Detroit Lions to the brink of elimination from the playoffs on Sunday, holding on for a 29-24 win when Jared Goff’s touchdown on the final play was negated by an offensive pass-interference penalty on Amon-Ra St Brown.Goff threw a fourth-down pass to St Brown just short of the goal line. The receiver pushed off cornerback Jalen Ramsey to get free, and before the Steelers could bring St Brown to the ground, he threw the quarterback a lateral to set up an apparent score.Officials huddled for some time on the field before announcing the decision to the dismay of the crowd.Jaylen Warren had two 45-yard touchdown runs in the fourth quarter and finished with a career-high 143 yards for the Steelers, who had a 230-15 advantage in rushing yards.The AFC North-leading Steelers (9-6) have won three straight after a midseason slump, surging into the division lead with two games remaining.Jacksonville Jaguars 34-20 Denver BroncosTrevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading the Jacksonville Jaguars to a resounding 34-20 win that snapped the Denver Broncos’ 11-game winning streak Sunday.The AFC South-leading Jaguars (11-4) won their sixth straight game and handed the Broncos (12-3) their first loss since Week 3. It was also Denver’s first loss at home since 13 October 2024, snapping the Broncos’ 12-game home winning streak.The Broncos’ lead over the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC West was sliced to a single game. The teams play in Week 18.After Broncos rookie RJ Harvey pinballed his way for a 38-yard touchdown to tie it at 17 on the opening drive of the second half, it was all Jacksonville.Lawrence scored on a on-yard keeper, then hit Parker Washington for 63 yards to set up Travis Etienne Jr’s 10-yard TD catch. After Bo Nix fumbled his exchange with running back Jaleel McLaughlin, Lawrence drove Jacksonville on its fifth consecutive score, a 26-yard field goal by Cam Little that made it 34-17 early in the fourth quarter.Atlanta Falcons 26-19 Arizona CardinalsBijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.The Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.Arizona’s defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta’s CJ Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett’s pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.Robinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).Arizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.Las Vegas Raiders 21-23 Houston TexansCJ Stroud threw a touchdown pass, Derek Stingley returned an interception for a score and the Houston Texans beat Las Vegas 23-21 on Sunday for their seventh straight victory and the Raiders’ ninth loss in a row.Houston (10-5) has its longest winning streak since a nine-game run in 2018. The Texans remain a game behind first-place Jacksonville – a winner in Denver on Sunday – in the AFC South. The Raiders are 2-13.Stingley’s touchdown came in the first quarter, and Ka’imi Fairbairn made three field goals to help the Texans to the win on a day when their offense struggled.Houston led by two with about eight minutes left when Stroud found a wide-open Dalton Schultz for a 1-yard touchdown strike that made it 23-14. Nick Chubb had a 30-yard run on that drive and a 23-yard pass interference call on Lonnie Johnson Jr against Collins got Houston to the 2 to set up the score.Rauders rookie Ashton Jeanty cut the lead to 23-21 when he scored on a 51-yard run with about five and a half minutes left. The rookie burst through the line before shedding a defender and waltzing into the end zone.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The 26-year-old sustained the problem while scoring the opener against Spurs – his second league goal of an already injury-hit debut season – inthe 2-1 winafter the defender Micky van de Ven slid across and caught his leg as the striker planted it on the ground.‘The game is gone’: Thomas Frank fumes over VAR decisions in Spurs lossRead moreIsak, who had been on for only 11 minutes after appearing as a half-time substitute, left the pitch looking in considerable distress. Many of the Liverpool staff were puzzled as to why the challenge did not merit a further look from the video assistant referee during a match in which Tottenham had two other players sent off.Immediately after the game, Liverpool’s head coach, Arne Slot, referred to the injury as “not a good thing”. “If a player doesn’t even try to come back, that is usually not a good thing but I cannot say anything more than that,” he said. “That is just gut feeling and nothing medical … let’s not be too negative yet. We don’t know yet. Let’s hope he is back with us soon.”Slot will face the media again on Tuesdayas he previews Liverpool’s home game with Wolves on Saturday.It has been a frustrating time for the Sweden international after his protracted summer move from Newcastle, with the striker having no pre-season and then a troublesome groin injury punctuating his campaign. He scored against Southampton in the Carabao Cup and against West Ham in the league but he has found it difficult in an evolving side. Ironically, the link-up between Florian Wirtz and Isak – which set up the goal against Tottenham – looked to have kickstarted his Liverpool career before the crushing blow of the injury.Isak’s extended absence will stretch Liverpool’s forward options, with Mohamed Salah now at the Africa Cup of Nations and Cody Gakpo not ready to return from a muscle injury until early in the new year.It leaves Slot with just Hugo Ekitiké, who has five goals in his past four games, and the little-used Federico Chiesa as his only senior forwards. The academy graduate Jayden Danns is stepping up his recovery from a hamstring injury and could be an option in the new year.Liverpool are hoping to bring in Antoine Semenyo from ­Bournemouth in a £65m deal, with the in-form wide man having reportedly agreed personal terms over a January move. Manchester City and Manchester United are also keen on the Ghana international but he is believed to favour a move to Anfield.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

But Soufiane Rahimi hit the spot-kick straight down the middle, striking the knee of the goalkeeper Yannick Pandor and watching the ball loop away to safety. But they eventually broke down the resistance as Díaz got deserved rewards for his continual probing and El Kaabi’s goal ensured a respectable scoreline.Pandor made several other good stops to keep down the score in the closing stages as his teammates began to tire, although Comoros had a chance for an equaliser four minutes after Díaz’s goal but Rafiki Saïd shot straight at the Morocco goalkeeper Yassine Bounou in their first chance of the match.“The opening game is always difficult but we came good in the second half,” said the Morocco coach, Walid Regragui, after his team extended their record-breaking run of successive victories by a national team to 19. In October they went past the previous best of 15, set by Spain from 2008-09.There will be concern in the home camp, however, after their captain, Romain Saïss, limped off after 18 minutes, the centre-back leaving the field in tears. He spent the first half of the year sidelined by ankle surgery and only last month returned to the national side after a year’s absence.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Morocco football teamComorosAfrica Cup of Nationsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Prêcheur is the second WSL manager to lose their job in the space of four days, followingRehanne Skinner’s sacking by West Hamon Thursday.Chelsea hammer dismal Liverpool 9-1 and storm into Women’s League Cup semisRead morePrêcheur had been in charge of London City since the summer of 2024. He led them to the second-tier title last term during his first season in charge, winning 13 out of 20 Championship matches to pip Birmingham to the title on the final day of the season by a two-point margin.The former Paris Saint-Germain coach’s exit has been described by sources as a purely footballing decision. The 43-year-old is understood to have been popular around the club but the long-term ambitions of the owner Michele Kang, who also owns Washington Spirit and the eight-time European champions OL Lyonnes, are to take the team to the very top.A club statement about Prêcheur’s exit on Sunday said: “Under his leadership, the club achieved a historic promotion and finishes the first half of the season in sixth position.“Following careful consideration, the club believes that now is the right time to begin a new cycle and pursue a different strategic direction for the next phase of its development. London City Lionesses sincerely thanks Jocelyn Prêcheur and his coaching staff for their professionalism, commitment, and significant contribution to the club’s recent sporting success, and wishes them every success in their future careers.“Further updates regarding the club’s coaching structure will be communicated in due course.”Meanwhile West Ham are to appoint the former Juventus head coach Rita Guarino as their new women’s team manager, the Guardian understands.According to sources, talks have been going on between the club and the former Italy striker for several weeks and she should be unveiled before Christmas. It will be the 99-times capped former international’s first managerial role in England.View image in fullscreenRita Guarino won 99 caps for Italy and four consecutive titles as head coach of JuventusPhotograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty ImagesIt is understood a contract until 2027 is most likely for the 54-year-old, who won four consecutive Serie A titles when in charge of Juventus, between the 2017-18 and 2020-21 seasons. She also led the Turin-based side to two domestic cups, making her among the most successful and respected coaches in the history of Italian women’s football.West Ham’s assistant manager, Steve Kirby, the former Bristol City head coach, took interim charge of the club on Sunday. They lost 5-1 in their League Cup quarter-final against Manchester City.Guarino would be only the second female coach to manage West Ham, after Skinner, who had been at the helm for two and a half years.Her first game in charge would be a tricky trip to face the defending league champions, Chelsea, on 11 January, after the WSL’s winter break, before an FA Cup fourth-round trip to face the WSL2 side Newcastle United five days later. She would not have a home fixture until welcoming Tottenham to Dagenham on 1 February.West Ham have won one and drawn two of their 11 games and are two points above the bottom side, Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLondon City LionessesWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite resting several front-liners, including Finn Russell, they ran in eight tries againstNewcastleto bounce back emphatically from last week’s Champions Cup defeat in Toulon.They simply had too much firepower for Newcastle who were shut out for the last 53 minutes of the game.Greg Fisilau double edges Exeter to comeback victory at SaracensRead moreIf there was a disparity between the starting lineups, the bench mis-match was colossal and Bath’s head coach, Johann van Graan, rubbed it in by introducing all eight of his replacements in one fell swoop with 25 minutes to go.It was a shock and awe move with Sam Underhill, Ted Hill and Thomas du Toit emerging from the fog and Bath, leading 33-14 at the time, eased away with three more fine tries to reach their half-century.“I’ve done seven before but it’s the first time I’ve done all eight,” said Van Graan. “Newcastle have come back in a few games if you look at the previous few weeks and once we got 12 up, I knew that if we put them away then, that was the end of the game.“There’s no perfect science in it, but I thought it worked well on the day.Fifty points away from home, topping the league at Christmas, I would have taken that before the game.”For Newcastle the wait for liftoff after the Red Bull takeover in the summer continues.Successive Challenge Cup victories in Europe hinted at a corner being turned but this was their 19th consecutive league defeat, stretching back to 29 November last year, and a bruisingly heavy one in their own backyard.They are no longer short of money but the business of buying in talent is not straightforward. The big movers at present, such as George Martin, are choosing more established top-end clubs.Another sellout crowd at Kingston Park demonstrated the enthusiasm for the revolution amongst the north-east public. When it begins to bear fruit, Newcastle are going to need a bigger ground.View image in fullscreenBath players surround Dan Frost after his try for the champions.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAAnd the sense is that they will get there in the end – it is inconceivable they won’t with the backing they now enjoy – but it is proving not to be a case of simply waving a wand.Newcastle held the lead after half an hour with tries from flanker Ollie Leatherbarrow and No 8 Amanaki Mafi. But Bath had already flexed their forward muscle by then through two tries from hooker Dan Frost and once prop Archie Griffin had thundered his way over from close range to open up a 19-14 interval lead, Bath pulled away. Francois van Wyk secured an all-front-row bonus point three minutes after the break.Then, with Newcastle shorthanded by the loss of centre Sammy Arnold to the sin-bin for ball-killing. Will Butt crossed for Bath’s fifth.The visitors’ heavy mob, plus captain Ben Spencer, rumbled on and pushed the champions out of sight. Tom de Glanville went over in the corner with 13 minutes to go from a lovely pass by Spencer and two minutes later the England scrum-half finished off a flowing length-of-the-field breakout.It was the try of the game from an impressive Bath who added an eighth in the last minute through Hill.Quick GuideNewcastle 14-50 Bath: teams and scorersShowNewcastle Red Bulls:Grayson (Chamberlain 75); Spencer, Hearle, Arnold (Clark 71), Obatoyinbo; Connon, Benitez-Cruz; Brocklebank (Hancock 71), McGuigan (Fletcher 53), McCallum (Palframan 53), Usher, de Chaves (Baker 64), Leatherbarrow, Christie, Mafi (Gordon 53).Tries:Leatherbarrow, MafiCons:Connon 2.Sin-bin:Arnold 53.Bath:De Glanville; Cokanasiga, Harris, Butt, Hennessey (Redpath 55); Carreras, Carr-Smith (Spencer 55); van Wyk (Obano 55), Frost (Dunn 55), Griffin (du Toit 55), Richards (Hill 55), Molony, Bayliss (Barbeary 55), Staddon (Underhill 55), Reid.Tries:Frost 2, Griffin, Van Wyk, Butt, De Glanville, Spencer, HillCons:Carreras 5Referee:Hamish Smales.

They are also known as “snus”.Unlike smoking the pouches do not raise the risk of cancer, but they have caused alarm because of the fear that users could become addicted to nicotine and suffer mouth and dental problems.A survey of 500 teenagers aged 14 to 17 in England,Scotlandand Wales found that 13% have used a nicotine pouch, of whom 30% said they did so at least once a week. Most get them from friends or buy them in shops, which are not subject to any age restrictions as to who they can sell them to.The same survey, by Deltapoll for the Future Health consultancy, found that seven in 10 respondents backed the UK government’s planned crackdown on them.The tobacco and vapes billwill outlaw selling pouches to under-18s, as well as changing the packaging and limiting the use of flavours and the amount of nicotine to make them less appealing to children and young people.Steve Brine, a former public health minister, wrote in a foreword to a new report by FutureHealthon the pouches: “These unregulated products are being heavily pushed at young people, whether it be through shop displays, social media or in partnerships with UK music festivals.”Referencing that most of the main brands were made by cigarette companies, Brine added: “The tobacco industry is constantly looking for the next business opportunity with which to addict a new generation to nicotine.”Almost half (46%) of the teenagers surveyed had seen nicotine pouches advertised, mainly in shops and on social media. Three-quarters (73%) want to see restrictions on their promotion, sale and use, while a majority want it made illegal for under-18s to buy them (63%) and back health warnings (59%).The survey was undertaken for Kenvue, which makes Nicorette, the over the counter nicotine replacement therapy that some smokers use to try to quit. Future Health is run by Richard Sloggett, a former special adviser at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).The report says: “Health concerns have to date focused on oral health issues such as a dry mouth, gum lesions or blisters, unusual jaw sensations and receding gums.“[But] studies have also raised concerns that 30mg nicotine pouches have led to a higher nicotine uptake compared with cigarettes and increased arterial stiffness.”Sales of brands such as Velo, Nordic Spirit and Zyn are growing fast.A group of international health expertswarned in the European Heart Journal this weekthat “nicotine is toxic to the heart and blood vessels, regardless of whether it is consumed via a vape, a pouch, a shisha or a cigarette”. They voiced concern about the recent dramatic rise in use of vapes, heated tobacco and nicotine pouches, especially among adolescents and young adults.Separate researchpublished this weekin the journal Lancet Public Health found that more than 500,000 people in Britain now use nicotine, with the boom driven by members of gen Z, especially young men. The proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds doing so has jumped from 0.7% in 2022 to 4% this year, according to the study led by Dr Harry Tattan-Birch of University College London.“Pouches have a substantially lower risk to health than cigarettes and are likely less harmful than e-cigarettes. However, they are not harmless,” he said.A spokesperson for Zyn, which is made by the tobacco firm Philip Morris International, said: “The reality is smoke-free products such as nicotine pouches have successfully supported millions of adults to leave cigarettes behind. Public health policymakers should be encouraged that, according to Ash, 96% of teenagers have never tried nicotine pouches.”Asli Ertonguc, the head of British American Tobacco in the UK and western Europe, highlighted that last week’s Lancet study also found that more and more smokers are using pouches to help them give up. A ban on advertising snus could put that press at risk, she added.A spokesperson for Japan Tobacco International, which makes Nordic Spirit, said: “We welcome regulation that prohibits sale of nicotine products to minors but have concerns about some aspects of the [tobacco and vapes] legislation that could needlessly damage an emerging category and risk undermining the UK’s success in promoting smoking alternatives if passed.”A DHSC spokesperson said: “We’re acting to protect people’s health and stop young people getting hooked on nicotine. Right now, nicotine pouches are far less regulated than nicotine vapes. This will change. The tobacco and vapes bill will make it illegal to sell nicotine pouches and other nicotine products to anyone aged under 18 to keep young people safe.”Explore more on these topicsHealthTobacco industryMedical researchSmokingYoung peopleEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The event was billed as “a powerful celebration of faith, freedom, and the legacy of our founder, Charlie Kirk”.However, the gatheringmade headlinesfor theinfightingon display among its high-profile participants.“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk’s widow Erika. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”View image in fullscreenErika Kirk, left, and Nicki Minaj  react during AmericaFest, the first Turning Point USA summit since the death of Charlie Kirk, in Phoenix, Arizona, on Sunday.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/ReutersAccording to reports from the festival, the unification seen in previous years has been challenged by interpersonal gripes and disagreement over how big the big tent of conservatism should be and what brands of conservative thinking it can be expected to hold.Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, co-founder of The Daily Wire, set the tone on Thursday when he condemned Carlson for hostingthe white nationalist Nick Fuenteson his streaming show, as well as others he depicted as charlatans and grifters.Shapiro said hosts are “indeed responsible for the guests they choose and the questions they ask”, adding that Fuentes “is an evil troll and that building him up is an act of moral imbecility. And that is precisely what Tucker Carlson did.”Carlson later took the stage and dismissed Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform and denounce” people, according to reports, and said he laughed at Shapiro’s address – “that kind of bitter sardonic laugh that emerges from you and, like, upside-down world arrives. When your dog starts doing your taxes, and you’re like, ‘Wait, it’s not supposed to work this way.’”The pre-eminent split among young conservatives, reported theArizonaRepublic, is over distrust of Israel over its war with Hamas and the embrace of figures like Fuentes, a Holocaust denier. Without Kirk to hold the movement together, the fractures have only become more apparent.“When Charlie Kirk was assassinated, I think that’s when everything split into groypers, the conservative right, constitutional right,” Jack Nichols, 19,told the Arizona Republic. “And I think that’s bad. I don’t think that’s what Charlie would have wanted. I think Charlie would have wanted us to come together instead of dividing.”Former presidential candidate Ramaswamy, who is currently running for Ohio governor, said pockets of the “online right” had become fixated on the idea of a “heritage” right rather than one based on conservative ideals.View image in fullscreenVivek Ramaswamy speaks during the fTurning Point USA summit in Phoenix, Arizona, on Friday.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/Reuters“I think the idea of a heritage American is about as loony as anything the woke left has actually put up,” Ramaswamy said. “There is no American who is more American than somebody else … It is binary. Either you’re an American or you’re not.”In a penultimate speech, House speaker Mike Johnson encouraged attendees to “live as he [Charlie Kirk] lived”.“What I mean by that is, I think there’s two very important things that all of us can and should do. I think we should advance his principles, and I think we should adopt (that) approach.”Speaking at the event on Thursday, Kirk’s widow Erika, who now runs the organization, saidshe endorsed JD Vanceas the next Republican presidential nominee.Vance – who spoke on Sunday – said of Kirk’s assassination, “we got kicked in the teeth, my friends, and there’s no sugar-coating it”. He depicted Kirk’s alleged assassin Tyler Robinson as a crucible of values and behaviors that the left seeks to promote and said it was better for conservatives to have disagreements and to discuss them, than to be “drones for George Soros.”After a long weekend of debates about whether the movement should exclude figures such as Fuentes, Vance came down firmly against “purity tests.”“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to de-platform,” Vance said during the convention’s closing speech.The conservative festival was not short in surprises: rapper Nicki Minaj took to the stage with Kirk on Sunday. Minaj expressed admiration for Donald Trump and Vance, and explained her switch from supporting Democrat candidates like Obama and Clinton. “I just got tired of being pushed around,”she said.“I’m not gonna back down anymore. I’m not gonna back down ever again.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsJD VanceFar right (US)Donald Trump JrSteve BannonnewsShareReuse this content"

Some 50 escaped immediately afterwards, and on 7 December the government secured the release of about 100 more.A statement from President Bola Tinubu then put the number of people still being held at 115 – about 50 fewer than the initial CAN figure would suggest.It has not been made public who seized the children, or how the government secured their release.Though kidnappings for ransom are a common way for criminals and armed groups to make money, a spate of mass abductions in Nigeria has put an uncomfortable spotlight on the country’s already grim security situation.In November, assailants kidnapped two dozen Muslim schoolgirls, 38 church worshippers and a bride and her bridesmaids, with male farm workers, women and children also taken hostage.The kidnappings come as Nigeria faces a diplomatic offensive from the United States, where President Donald Trump has alleged that mass killings of Christians in the west African country amount to a “genocide”.The Nigerian government and independent analysts reject that framing, which has long been used by the Christian right in the US and Europe.The religiously diverse country of 230 million people has myriad security concerns, from jihadists in the north-east to armed “bandit” gangs in the north-west, and its multiple conflicts have seen Christians and Muslims killed.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

On at least one occasion Trump has appeared to be confused about whether or not certain AI videos are real on Truth Social. In early December, the president posted 158 times on the platform in three hours, raising questions not just about his increasingly unusual behavior, but also how he is spending his time.But few Americans will have witnessed this erratic, and revealing, behavior directly because just 3% of people in the US use Truth Social.The relatively tiny number of people using Truth Social, revealed in a Pew Research Centerstudypublished in late November, could effectively cut people off from direct communication from their president. It may also shield Trump, 79, from some questions over his mental state.Trump’s restriction to Truth Social, a company which he owns and whose valuehas contributedto his soaring net worth, means only 3% of US adults have witnessed Trump’s increasingly incoherent rants, frequent sharing of racist posts, and generally odd behavior.On 1 December, heshareda post that referred to Somali Americans as “inbred savages” who are seeking to “impose their Sharia bullshit”. That the president was apparently endorsing racism towards immigrants in this way went largely unnoticed by the media – thankfully for the sake of people who want to know what’s on Trump’s mind, he repeated some of the same framingin public days later.In an example that brings into question the president’s competence, at 5.44pm on Saturday, Trumpannouncedon Truth Social that “the suspect” in the Brown university shooting “is in custody”.No doubt the post came as a relief to the small number of people who saw it, but unfortunately it wasn’t true. Nineteen minutes later Trump was forced to correct his post. “The suspect is NOT in custody,”he wrote.The rants and inaccuracies are mixed in with what is just odd behavior. Trump reposts random videos without comment, includinga 10 second clipwhich features a dance track over a photo of three men in military clothing, and throws up photos of himself with no context provided.In late September, Trump, the oldest person ever to be inaugurated as president, appeared confused about what policies he had or had not announced, and also about which videos are real and which are AI-generated. Hereposted to Truth Socialan AI-generated fake video which promoted “med bed hospitals”, a video which showed an AI version of himself speaking.Setting aside that the idea of “med beds” is a rightwing conspiracy theory – one version of the theory posits that the government and/or a group of wealthy Americans have access to medical bed-like devices that can cure almost every illness, but are withholding the technology – Trump’s post prompted a number of questions.Did Trump believe that the video really showed him announcing med bed hospitals? Did the president think he gave a speech about “med beds” at the White House? Did he believe that his government is about to send “med bed cards” to every US citizen?We will probably never know the answer, and Trump deleted the post, but this was at least an example of his Truth Social confusion breaking through to a wider audience: much of the media picked up on his confusion.Emmitt Riley III, associate professor of politics at the University of the South and the president of the National Conference of Black Political Scientists, said some of Trump’s output is “amplified by mainstream media, and recirculated across various other platforms”.And some things have been big enough to break through: Trump’srantabout Rob Reiner, published on Truth Social a day after the film-maker died, waswidely reported. It may be that even using a sparsely populated social platform cannot hide the behavior of an erratic, seemingly exhausted president from the American public.“Americans have a front-row seat to the decline of Trump, right? So we’re now seeing videos and pictures of himfalling asleepduring cabinet meetings, dozing off doing important international summits,” Riley said.“He spent a lot of time on the campaign trail criticizing the former president’s cognitive decline, and yet we’re watching his age catch up with him in real time.”As the Republican party, which is indelibly tied to Trump and his whims, gears up for crucial midterm elections, the question is whether Trump’s supporters will choose to believe what they are seeing, or opt to bury their heads in the sand.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The people of Land’s End, Cornwall, get just more than eight hours and in Shetland, Scotland, there is only about five and a half hours.View image in fullscreenPeople celebrate solstice at Stonehenge.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAAt Stonehenge, people converged from different corners of the world to celebrate the solstice together on Salisbury plain. Win Scutt, who works as a curator at English Heritage and supervises events around Stonehenge, welcomed people to the gathering.“There’s just such a fantastic atmosphere here, so many different people, different kinds of people as well, many pagans, druids, all sorts of people,” Scutt told Hits Radio.“It’s got that power, hasn’t it, this incredible sight, that it draws people from all different walks of life. There’s something about Stonehenge that appeals to people in so many different ways and it’s lovely to share that.”For Bradley O’Neill, witnessing the solstice was a dream come true. O’Neill, who had travelled to Britain from Australia, told the BBC that experiencing the solstice at Stonehenge had been on his bucket list.“I just like old mysteries. The world is full of questions and I’m not going to get many answers either, but I’m sure going to see something special,” O’Neill said. “Today we get to touch the stones and feel the energy. The presence they have, it’s actually fantastic. I feel special, in my heart.”View image in fullscreenA woman gets close to the stone.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAFor Golnar Pooya, celebrating the solstice at Stonehenge held special meaning. Pooya identifies as a Persian Zoroastrian, which is recognised as one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions, whose members have celebrated the solstice for more than 2,500 years. She said she and her family usually celebrated at home in America, and this was her first time attending the celebrations inEngland.“We stay up all night, we have a lot of pomegranates – which symbolise birth, rebirth and life, and we gather with family, we read poetry until the sun rises, and the celebration is that the darkness is now over,” said Pooya.“For us it’s not a religious event, it’s more a tradition. It’s spectacular to see so many people from so many different cultures coming together, from so many different regions, just to see the sun rise and light come back to Earth.”Explore more on these topicsStonehengeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It went through the cellar, then through into the kitchen, then the higher kitchen, and then before we knew it, in the lower dining room it was up to about here,” Andrea Sholl says, pointing to the windowsill.View image in fullscreenBar 125 owner Andrea Sholl had only been running the restaurant for for eight days when Storm Claudia hit.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianBar 125 – located next to the River Monnow in the shadow of Monmouth’s ancient bridge, dating from about 1270 – had only been trading for eight days when the heavy rains ofStorm Claudia hit.The Monnow burst its banks, sending water surging into the town centre, resulting inthe most severe flooding in decades.Located between the Monnow and the larger River Wye, Monmouth has flooded in the past but many local people describe the recent inundation as the worst since the 1970s.Nearly 200 homes and about 120 businesses suffered significant flooding, according to Monmouthshire county council, while the nearby village of Skenfrith was flooded for the fourth time in five years. After the water was pumped away, the streets and many premises were full of mud and debris.The majority of businesses in Monmouth town centre are independents. The flood came right at the start of the crucial Christmas trading period, when many traders need to earn enough to get them through the lean months of January and February.The Sholls, who own another bar in nearby Usk, considered this year’s festive season especially important, as they had just completed two months refurbishing an empty pub. The couple were forced to cancel more than 1,200 bookings for Christmas parties and lunches. With the help of tradespeople and local residents mucking in, they raced to clean up and restock, managing to reopen just 10 days later.“We needed to get those tills ringing as soon as we could,” says Andrea Sholl.View image in fullscreenThe Sholls managed to reopen Bar 125 after 10 days thanks to help from tradespeople and local residents.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThis fact was brought home to the couple when they discovered their insurance, bought through a broker, did not cover them for flood damage or lost trade.On the Guardian’s visit about a month after the floods hit, it is clear many of the independent retailers and hospitality businesses that populate the high street have not managed to resume trading.The town’s Waitrose supermarket has just reopened, as well as the Marks & Spencer grocery store, along with several coffee shops and retailers, while the lingerie shop Harts of Monmouth is only open on the first floor of its building.Waitrose’s restart has been welcomed with enthusiasm by local residents Gail and Carl, who are chatting in the car park. “You realise how important it is to the town commercially and socially. Older people have somewhere to go again to speak to people,” says Carl. “But I walk past the little shops and wonder if they are going to come back?”Workers in hi-vis remain a common sight on Monnow Street, the main shopping street. Many are still dealing with water damage. The walls of several premises are being replastered and there is an audible hum of power tools and dehumidifiers.Several businesses on the high street have notes pinned to their front doors, explaining when they hope to reopen.Roberto Biba, whose wife owns the restaurant La Piccola Italia, is watching workers carry wood out of the venue. “We are on our own,” he says. “We have had to pay a month’s wages from our own pocket and a full month’s rent.”Biba is not yet sure what will be covered by the company’s insurance and does not believe the restaurant will reopen until late January or early February.Tom Innes, the owner of the wine merchant Fingal-Rock, is back trading, but is still sorting through his stock. All of his wine bottles survived, but the muddy residue left behind tells the tale of the cardboard boxes that began to disintegrate in the water.“Christmas half kills me every year, and I’ve got all this on top,” he says with a smile.Unlike Bar 125, Innes’s insurance will cover the damage and he has already been able to buy some replacement metal shelving and repair the back door.View image in fullscreenWine merchant Tom Innes’s insurance will cover the damage.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianAfter nearly 40 years in the town, and despite being “marooned” in his upstairs flat during the flood, he considers it a “one-off”, but adds: “I’m sure [insurance] premiums will go up in future.”Clearing up and preparing to restart trading are more challenging for small businesses, says Nick Collins, the chief executive of the hospitality group Loungers, which has more than 300 venues across the country including Monmouth’s Estero Lounge.“We are quite fortunate that we are a big business and have teams that are normally building new sites that we were able to divert to the clear-up job,” he says. Estero Lounge reopened on 4 December, and Collins estimates the flood cost “in the low hundreds of thousands”, a figure that should mostly be covered by its insurance.Monmouthshire council and the Welsh government agreed to provide extra financial support of up to £1,000 to affected residents and up to £3,000 to businesses. The local authority has suspended council tax and business rates, while laminated signs stuck to parking machines in council car parks inform drivers that parking charges have been paused.View image in fullscreenThe clearing-up process is still continuing in Monmouth’s Monnow Street.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianPaul Matthews, the chief executive of the council, acknowledges the financial support is a drop in the ocean for some traders.“No matter how hard you try, these sums do not get close to covering the full cost to impacted residents or businesses whether insured or not,” he says. “It is not easy or affordable for many living in challenged areas to secure insurance at all.”Many local residents and businesses are now fearful about what the rest of the winter will bring, adds Matthews: “It takes months to recover from a serious flood. The anxiety it leaves behind never disappears. Every time it rains, people are concerned.”Severe flooding isexpected to occur more frequentlyacross the country as a result of the climate crisis. Towns such as Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire that haveflooded frequently in recent yearsareat risk of becoming uninsurable, with many shop owners no longer able to afford insurance.Homeowners at risk of flooding are able to take advantage of the Flood Re reinsurance scheme, an initiative between government and insurers, which pools risk to make insurance cover more affordable. However, the scheme does not cover businesses.The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says expandingFlood Reinsurance to cover commercial properties “would require an additional significant levy, which would raise costs for small businesses and consumers”.The government is investing at least £10.5bn across England “to better protect businesses and homes, nearly 900,000 properties, from the impacts of flooding”, a spokesperson adds.Explore more on these topicsWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are the world’s largest living rail – a family of small to medium sized ground-dwelling birds with short wings, large feet and long toes. They breed just once a year. While they resemble Australasian swamp hens, or pūkeko inNew Zealand, they are in fact their chunkier, flightless, mountain-dwelling cousin.The birds once roamed the South Island, but were thought extinct at the turn of the 20th century, until they were rediscovered in 1948. Since then they have been part of New Zealand’s longest running endangered species programme, which hasslowly rebuilt their population to 500.The chick’s father Bendigo and mother Waitaa arrived at the sanctuary two years ago as a non-breeding pair. After an unsuccessful nesting attempt in 2024, staff did not expect the couple to breed.But in October, Waitaa disappeared – a clue she may be nesting. Some weeks later staff heard cheeping in a dense patch of bush and set up a trail camera. Its footage confirmed the chick’s existence.“I was gobsmacked,” Jo Ledington, Zealandia’s conservation and restoration manager, told the Guardian. “It’s a miracle, we just weren’t expecting it at all.”The parents were “textbook model parents”, and were doting on their new chick, whose sex is not yet known. Meanwhile, the chick had entered its “dinosaur phase”, Ledington said.“Its legs are really quite long and chunky and its beak is getting that more adult shape, which on its small downy body looks a bit dinosaur-ish.”At three months old the chick will start to look more like an adult takahē, which stand at roughly 50cm tall. The adults are rotund, with red legs and a large beak, and are covered in green and blue feathers. When viewed from the front, takahē look like a model of planet Earth on stilts.View image in fullscreenThe chick’s father Bendigo and mother Waitaa arrived at the sanctuary two years ago as a non-breeding pair. After an unsuccessful nesting attempt in 2024, staff did not expect the couple to breed.Photograph: Linton MillerThe chick’s arrival is significant for thethreatened takahē population. Like many New Zealand birds, takahē evolved without land mammals, and are vulnerable to attacks from introduced predators.“Any chick that we can add to that population is just incredibly valuable,” Ledington said.Native species thrive within Zealandia’s fences and the sanctuary is credited withcreating a bird-life boomin Wellington. The sanctuary does not typically house breeding takahē pairs because it does not have grassland habitat the birds like to nest in.Bendigo, Waitaa and their chick are Zealandia’s only takahē residents but they are not the only takahē to surprise staff with a chick. A former pair were thought to be past breeding age when staff discovered they too had hatched a surprise chick in 2018.When asked if there was something in the sanctuary’s water, Ledington laughed.“Zealandia is a pretty special place, so yes, maybe.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsNew ZealandShareReuse this content"

Dotted along the brackish fringes of the cultivated plots are scatterings of silvery-green bushes – sea fennel.This plant is a member of a group of remarkable organisms known as halophytes – plant species that thrive in saltwater. Long overlooked and found growing in the in-between spaces – saltmarshes, coastlines, the fringes of lagoons – halophytes straddle boundaries in both ecosystems and cuisines. But with shifting agricultural futures, this may be about to change.Once known as the breadbasket of Venice, farmers on the island of Sant’Erasmo are facing a challenge that will soon become commonplace in coastal marshes worldwide. A trifecta of rising sea levels, increases in average temperature and decreases in rainfall is leading to a rise in the concentration of salts in the soil – a death knell for many traditional crops, which can survive only up to a salt concentration of about 1.2% – about one-third that of seawater.Sant’Erasmo’s soil has long held a trace of salinity, just enough to give its prized violet artichokes their vivid hue and delicate flavour. But the balance is delicate: too much is bad news. Last year, theFoodand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimated that about 10% of the world’s total land is currently affected by salinity, and that this may rise to between 24% and 32% of the total land surface because of the climate crisis.“I started to become fascinated by these plants more than five years ago. They’re a bit of a miracle,” says Filippo Grassi, an environmental scientist at the Tidal Garden, a research agency based in the Venice lagoon exploring the edible potential of halophytes for cultural adaptation to climate change.“And then Venice is the perfect playground because you have a very interesting and nuanced environment that has been lived by humans and changed and transformed by humans for centuries.”From Sant’Erasmo, the spires of Venice, majestic – and unavoidably sinking – are just visible across the water. The Tidal Garden’s task is to unite these two worlds.View image in fullscreenPurslane is one of several halophyte species being cultivated.Photograph: Daniel LoberThey work with six or seven species, including marsh samphire, monk’s beard and purslane. For a long time, these crops have been foraged by coastal communities in Venice and beyond – a Tudor record lists three accidental deaths in England linked to samphire foraging in the late 1500s – but never taken seriously as a commercial crop.“Really, a lot of [it] is about telling the story and it’s about piecing it together. The farmers say: ‘Oh this plant? We know people who are now 89-year-olds who used to pick it’,” says Grassi. “Most of these [foraged] plants were eaten at some point and then were forgotten.”Echoing these concerns, Lodovica Guarnieri, a researcher, explains the more complex barriers to embracing these species: “For farmers it’s still seen as a weed, or even worse, as a warning sign. If marsh samphire starts appearing in someone’s plot, it means they’re in trouble.”She is not wrong. While samphire’s specialised glands and internal pump-like channels enable it to move salt through its system efficiently in brackish water of 1-1.6% salinity, such concentrations would be disastrous for the humble tomato, inhibiting its very germination.On Italy’s western coast at the University of Pisa, a team of researchers is using halophytes to address this very issue. Antonella Castagna is an associate professor specialising in eco-friendly solutions to crop fertility problems. Last year, she and her colleagues found that intercropping and rotating tomatoes and glasswort respectively led to more nutritious and bountiful harvests. The researchers envisage planting halophytes on the tracks and fallow land bordering farmers’ fields.They believe this conservative approach would enrich the soil without requiring farmers to sacrifice land already designated for cash crops. The urgency of the problem helps too. “Luckily from the point of view the situation now is so dramatic and salinity is so dramatically increasing that farmers are recognising the problem,” says Castagna.“In one area we’re working, there is a producer of grain, and his yield is progressively reducing, as you move from the internal field towards the sea. They [now] get the same yields in fields that are twice as wide as before, so there is an economic issue.“It’s bad from one point of view, but it’s good from another because people have finally started to trust in our operation. We hope that working together we can try to find some solutions.”The obscurity of halophytes and suspicion of their weed-like ability to thrive in harsh environments is partly why, in Venice, the Tidal Garden has recruited chefs, artists and poets to its cause, aiming to grow a steady awareness and commercial demand. And how do you create a demand?View image in fullscreenA performance created by the Tidal Garden and Gaia Ginevra Giorgi to help grow public awareness of the project.Photograph: The Tidal Garden“Basically, spike people,” says Grassi. “There’s a lot of work going into embedding these plants into the normal food culture of the place. We use them as ingredients in food that people already know, such as pizza. We bring them into the culinary language.”He points to a collaboration with AEDS, an organisation based in Tunisia, where even higher soil salinity and a much drier climate mean halophytes are also being cultivated.“In Tunisia, we’re going to start working in a different way – they don’t really use these plants as food for humans, it’s mostly food for animals. And so we’re going to try and explore local recipes there,” Grassi adds.View image in fullscreenHalophytes are increasingly being used in Venetian cookingPhotograph: Camilla GloriosoIn Venice this approach has saved the herbs from obscurity. The venerated Gelateria Alaska has created a samphire sorbet. One of the city’s most exclusive eateries, the two-Michelin-starred Glam Enrico Bartolini, has an avowed halophyte-lover at the helm in the form of its resident chef, Donato Ascani.“I was very lucky to come to Venice because there are ingredients that are unique in Italy,” he says. “Wild herbs – the soil where they’re grown – our vegetables have a particular savoury taste that’s hard to find in [the rest of the country], so this soil allows us to have an extra edge with what we do in the kitchen.”Ascani is acutely aware of the changes that are already affecting seasonal availability of the lagoon’s offerings.“Every chef knows that every time he changes location, there is a spirit of adaptation to the new place and the crops,” he says. “Similarly, there will also be adaptation to climate change. We’ll go with whatever [nature] has to offer; it’s not like we can just come back and grow crops in the kitchen.”For Ascani, halophytes represent a way to connect his customers to the lagoon, and “understand the importance of all the land offers”, even if those offerings are obscure.And in their resilience, halophytes are important, says Ascani: “We can’t tell the season from the calendar any more. We have to look at it in the morning, when you go to the market to buy groceries.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisVeniceItalyEuropeFood (Environment)Food (global)FarmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is expected to set out her proposals early next year.The authors, however, do suggest a new system focused on earlier detection of modern slavery as a way to eliminate the limited amount of abuse that they say does occur.The founder and executive chair of Bright Blue, Ryan Shorthouse, said: “TheHome Officethinks the modern slavery referral system is being abused because it allows people to stay in the country a bit longer. But while there may be some abuse, we are sceptical that it is widespread.”Theresa May brought in the modern-day slavery rules in England and Wales in 2015, when the then home secretary established a formal mechanism to assess potential victims of slavery and human trafficking.The number of people referred to the system has climbed steeply since, from just over 3,000 in 2015 to more than 19,000 last year.Recent home secretaries have blamed the asylum system for the rise, accusing claimants of seeking to be classified as victims of modern-day slavery to avoid being deported.They point to the fact that some of the nationalities most commonly referred for assessment under trafficking rules are also those that form the bulk of asylum claims. British nationals make up the largest group being evaluated for modern-day slavery, followed by people from Albania, Vietnam and Eritrea.Mahmoodhas accusedasylum seekers of making “vexatious, last-minute claims” after the high courtblocked the deportationof an Eritrean man who was due to be flown to Paris but said he was a victim of trafficking.She has promised to rewrite the UK’s modern slavery rules, but Bright Blue’s report suggests that doing so may not have the desired impact on asylum numbers.It points out that no asylum seeker can demand to be assessed, but can only be referred by third-party organisations, with 97% of claims coming via public bodies such as Border Force, police authorities, local authorities and the Home Office itself.The report found that 90% of those referred were assessed to have reasonable grounds for being classified as victims, suggesting the vast majority of cases were not vexatious.Nor are the vast majority of those found to have been subjected to modern-day slavery granted leave to remain in the UK. The classification more often leads to compensation and only temporary permission to stay.The authors suggest the government should train statutory first-responder organisations such as the Home Office and Border Force to detect signs of trafficking and slavery more quickly. Once that is done, they say ministers could ban those in detention – who will have already been assessed by those organisations – from being referred at all.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Modern slavery referrals are rising. This is why the home secretary announced reforms … to identify vulnerable people and stop misuse.“The statement fundamentally reforms the approach to illegal migration, making Britain a less attractive destination for illegal migrants and harder for people to block their removal from this country.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumModern slaveryHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Poor visibility and less daylight have also been cited as factors influencing the crossings.The most arrivals recorded in December was 3,254 in 2024; 2,163 people have arrived so far this month.The arrivals on Saturday bring the total number of people who have crossed the Channel this year to 41,455. The record annual total was 45,755 in 2022.The data showed 803 people across 13 dinghies from northernFrancehad made the journey from overnight on Friday into Saturday, the largest number since 8 October when 1,075 crossed in a day.A Border Force vessel was seen on Saturday morning bringing people into Dover,Kent. The previous night, a number of boats were witnessed leaving the shores of France.The French maritime prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said 151 people had been rescued by authorities over the weekend and taken back to French shores.The UK government has said it is continuing efforts to grasp the “upstream” causes of the migration crisis, including through work with neighbouring countries.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The number of small boat crossings is shameful and the British people deserve better. This government is taking action. We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally, and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.”France recently indicated it planned tohalt small boats at seabefore they pick people up heading for the UK, after pressure from Keir Starmer.Germany passed a law this week that could see people smugglers face up to 10 years in prison for trying to bring individuals to the UK. The law, which will come into force before the end of the year, aims to give more powers to law enforcement and prosecutors, and to boost information sharing between the UK and Germany.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumKentEnglandHome OfficeFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Now, more than ever, we must invest in hopeLucy KnightSun 21 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 05.04 ESTShareIt’s 2.30pm on a Wednesday afternoon and the Himmah Hub, a community centre in Nottingham, is abuzz with activity. Crates of leftover supermarket food are being carried inside, trestle tables assembled, and volunteers are arriving to prepare meals that will be served in a few hours’ time to anyone who needs one – a queue has already begun to form outside.This is the Salaam Shalom kitchen, known as SaSh, a joint Muslim-Jewish project set up in 2015, and based on one of the core tenets of both faith groups: bringing people together through food. It also draws on a north Indian tradition of community meals, with food prepared collectively and duties shared across the village, Sajid Mohammed, director of the Muslim-led social justice initiative Himmah, explains.Mohammed had previously worked with the then rabbi of Nottingham Liberal synagogue, Tanya Sakhnovich, on a number of community projects when, in 2014, the pair got chatting about their shared concern about the number of English Defence League (EDL) marches that were taking place. “She goes: ‘Look, I’m just dead worried, Saj. Week in, week out there’s these bloody marches, and I don’t know what it means for the Jewish community.’ And I said: ‘Don’t worry, they’ll never get anywhere,’” Mohammed says with a wry smile. But he agreed there was a growing fear of bigotry in both Nottingham’s Muslim and Jewish communities, and that “something deeply unsettling” was happening.Although at leadership level Muslims and Jews had been working together on interfaith projects for years, when it came to “the congregations, the community groups, families, parents, children, our communities were not connected,” the charity leader explains. It just so happened that Himmah had already been considering setting up a hot meal provision in Hyson Green, home to Nottingham’s largest ethnic minority population – and also home to a historic Jewish cemetery. It seemed like the perfect project with which to bring both faith communities together, with Mohammed recruiting in volunteers from Himmah, and Sakhnovich from the synagogue, to provide a service that “demonstrates our shared values of dignity, justice and service to our communities,” he says.View image in fullscreenSajid Mohammed, director of Himmah.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianPeople thought it was bonkers to try to bring together two faith groups that have been so often pitted against each other: when the pair approached a local vicar to apply for a grant from the Church of England’sChurch Urban Fundhe called it “a disaster idea,” Mohammed says. Which only fired them up more – Sakhnovich went directly to the bishop of Nottingham to get the grant signed off, and the SaSh kitchen opened its doors for the first time in June 2015 and has been running ever since, even during the coronavirus pandemic, when it moved outdoors.Initially there were about 50 guests a week, says SaSh’s co-chair, Ferzana Shan. And though anyone is welcome to receive a meal, no questions asked, at first the guests were mostly white homeless men. Over the years, the demographic has diversified, with people of all ages, genders and backgrounds coming along. While the charity is pleased to reach so many people – tonight, they anticipate feeding approximately 130 – it is also “really heartbreaking” that so many people need it, Shan says.While I’ve been talking to the project’s trustees, volunteers have pulled chairs around a trestle table and started chopping vegetables. The food served is always vegetarian, which takes away decisions about whether to make the food kosher or halal. “We’re the chop and chat table,” the volunteers tell me cheerfully when I approach them, and I’m invited to start dicing peppers.View image in fullscreenVolunteers chop vegetables and help prepare the food.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianI meet 91-year-old retired consultant Dr Raoof, who has been given the job of finely slicing garlic, since he is, according to the others, “the best chopper”. I also meet Justyna, 38, a GP practice manager who spends her one day off each week volunteering with SaSh. Though many of the volunteers are from Nottingham’s Muslim and Jewish communities, there are also members of the local Catholic cathedral who heard about the project and wanted to get involved and people of no faith who simply want to help.Justyna, who moved to the UK from Poland in 2006, is passionate about showing the guests who are refugees and asylum seekers that they are welcome. “Frequently they think ‘everyone hates us’ because of what they hear on the news, so it’s nice [for them] to come and feel included knowing that there are people here to support you and like you and want you to do well in this country,” she says.Jews and Muslims working together on this kind of project “in the present climate, is a bloody miracle,” thinks fellow volunteer Daniel, 75, who heard about SaSh via his synagogue. Against the backdrop of the war in Gaza and increasing division in the UK, running the project has been “stressful at times,” says Andrea Chipman, one of SaSh’s Jewish trustees. “We’re really dedicated to the project and the community, and I think that’s helped us work through a difficult situation,” she says.“We share the pain of antisemitism andIslamophobiatogether,” Shan adds – pointing out that both communities have been used as “the scapegoat for any societal issues. So that keeps us together.”View image in fullscreenFerzana Shan, SaSh’s co-chair, (left) and Andrea Chipman, one of SaSh’s  trustees.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianSaSh is being supported by advocacy groupHope Not Hate’s charity arm,Hope Unlimited, one of the recipients of this year’sGuardian charity appeal. The charity believes that community-led initiatives can provide hopeful alternatives to extremist hate. Mohammed says the war in Gaza, along with Brexit and the UK’s cost of living crisis, have created “fertile land” for people with deep political agendas to push ideas. “I don’t think British people are intrinsically racist,” he says, arguing instead for creating spaces where dialogue can happen and people can share their hopes and dreams so they realise “we’ve got so much more in common than what divides us”. Building community bonds, he adds, “is the herd immunity that will protect us from the virus of fascism”.For that reason, SaSh aims to tackle not just food poverty, but social isolation. As 5.30pm approaches, the chop and chat table is cleared, and more tables assembled. They’re covered with colourful tablecloths to make the space look inviting. Sometimes, musicians will come and play as the food is served, the trustees tell me, and during Muslim and Jewish festivals volunteers come along to talk to the guests about their significance. Everything is geared towards making the space somewhere for people to come together and connect – not just receive basic essentials. Many of the guests pick up bunches of flowers alongside their food – it will brighten his home up, says one guest, Danciel. “I met a lot of people here – it’s a good community,” he adds.View image in fullscreenSaSh kitchen guest Danciel.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianJanet, 66, has been coming to the SaSh kitchen since its inception. She tells me it gives her a break, and “some normality”, away from her home, where she is a full-time carer for two of her family members, one of whom has autism and schizophrenia, and the other a spinal injury. “It gives me that time for me,” she says, giving her the energy to return to her caring responsibilities.Of all the projects that Himmah runs, Mohammed hopes if he is remembered for anything it will be SaSh. “It’s a project of immense hope,” he says. “And we live in some dark, dark times. Times that many of us, people of colour, the Jewish and Muslim communities, had thought we would never see again in this country.” As both Islamophobia and antisemitism continue to rise, it has been helpful that “even through the trauma of everything going on, that we have people who are from similar and different backgrounds to share the experience with,” Chipman adds. The strong relationships and the conversations between the Jewish and Muslim communities “never stop” even “when everything’s feeling a bit hopeless,” she says. It’s “a very local hands-on way where you can make a difference”.SaSh’s message is “don’t give up,” Mohammed says. “We know we’re living in tough times, and it’s easy to get demoralised,” and to think the division shown on social media is representative of the world we live in.But “it isn’t: the world is your family, your street, your neighbourhood, your city.” We will get through this moment in history, he says. “As long as we hold the rope of unity together.”Donate to the Guardian Charity Appeal 2025 hereExplore more on these topicsSocietyGuardian charity appeal 2025Social exclusionAntisemitismIslamophobiaPovertyFood povertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some in the cabinet would like No 10 to go further in its ambitions in order to improve the UK economy.Streeting spoke out about the EU, the economy and his own ambitionsin a wide-ranging interview with the Observer, while stressing that he was not after Keir Starmer’s job.He said a deeper economic partnership withEuropewould be the best way of increasing growth, and suggested he would like to go further than the current reset with the EU, which he described as a “good start”.UK failure to seal EU tax exemption hands industry mountain of paperworkRead more“We’ve taken a massive economic hit leaving theEuropean Union. I’m really uncomfortable with the level of taxation in this country. We’re asking a lot of individual taxpayers, we’re asking a lot of businesses. We’ve got a level of indebtedness that we need to take very seriously,” he said. “The best way for us to get more growth into our economy is a deeper trading relationship with the EU.“The reason why leaving the EU hit us so hard as a country is because of the enormous economic benefits that came with being in the single market and the customs union. This is a country and a government that wants a closer trading relationship with Europe.“The challenge is any economic partnership we have can’t lead to a return to freedom of movement.”On his own brief, Streeting said theNHSwas “coping” with resident doctors’ strikes, but he was worried about its recovery as the industrial action enters its final day.The health secretary told the Observer that the NHS was managing to get through thefive-day action by the British Medical Association doctorsin England, but he was concerned about the period afterwards as the health service struggles with flu cases.Streeting has taken a tough stance on strikes. He offered resident doctors a deal that involved more training places but no extra money,which was refused.His position has been criticised by Andrea Egan, the incoming general secretary of Unison, as an “unacceptable” approach to striking workers.Streeting said: “I think the NHS is coping. The period that worries me more is the post-strike period when we have to try and recover the service. That now falls at a time of year which is the NHS’s busiest.“I don’t think that doctors are selfish and don’t care about nurses and other healthcare professionals, but the BMA’s position can be quite hardline and uncompromising.”Streeting, who is considered a top contender to be the next Labour leader, described recent media briefings by allies of Starmer several weeks ago – amid speculation he was preparing to replace the prime minister – as a “bizarre drive-by” and questioned why anyone would want the top job.However, he appeared careful not to rule himself out, saying: “I’m diplomatically ducking the question to avoid any more of the silly soap opera we’ve had in the last few months.” Pressed on whether he thought Britain would be prepared to vote for a gay prime minister, he said: “Yes, but I want to make it explicitly clear that this is not a pitch or a job application. The prime minister’s got my absolute support.”Anna Turley, the chair of the Labour party, was pressed on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips about Starmer’s low approval ratings and she insisted he would still be prime minister next Christmas. She said it was “nonsense” that he may have to resign if local election results are bad for Labour in May and said the whole team was “united behind him”.Streeting said he and the former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner had joked about rumours that they had struck a deal to make a joint bid if there were to be a vacancy, and insisted it bore no resemblance to reality.“The last time I had a conversation with Angela was when I went up to her in the voting lobby and said, ‘I hear you’re putting together a new cabinet, I’ve always liked the idea of the Foreign Office so count me in’ and she turned around and snapped back as quick as a flash ‘oh no you’re behind the times haven’t you heard I’m going on I’m a Celebrity?’,” he says. “We had a good laugh about it because there’s so much idle gossip and tittle-tattle.”He also hinted that he held a different position on banning social media for under 16s than some others in the cabinet, including the prime minister.“We need to think much more radically about how we support young people to navigate this new online world,” he said. “[It] has been a place of bullying, intimidation, sometimes misogyny, even radicalisation. The challenge of social media is that it’s increasingly antisocial media. That’s why I think what Australia’s doing is interesting and we should follow the results closely and see if that’s something we should consider doing here.”Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingEuropean UnionTrade policyBrexitNHSDoctorsHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

But, sadly, no more. We have lost our innocence. Last week took our innocence. And, like the grass here at Bondi was stained with blood, so, too, has our nation been stained.But, he said: “A single act of courage, a single flame of hope, can give us direction and point the path forward … And that’s what we have seen this week.

Resilience is in our veins!”The co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Alex Ryvchin, said he had been at the Hanukah celebration at Bondi every year for the past 10 years, chosen by Rabbi Eli Schlanger,who died in the attack.“And every year I chose to stand there with him and with my daughters, first one, then two and eventually all three, with Rabbi Eli alongside me as I spoke,” Ryvchin said.“I didn’t know I was putting us all in harm’s way. I didn’t know that among us there is evil in its most pure and destructive form.”View image in fullscreenThe crowd listens to the speech from Alex Ryvchin of the Executive Council of  Australian Jewry.Photograph: Andrew Quilty/The GuardianRyvchin said he would return next year despite the “permanent loss of our way of life as Jews in this country [and] of the certain end of our carefree days joining with our friends and family to kindle the lights at this place and celebrate life”.“I am willing to accept that we will now live with uncertainty, even fear. That is a price I will pay.“But I will not hide who I am, an Australian and a Jew, for that would be a price too great.“So I have chosen to return to stand again on that now-sacred ground, on the first night of Hanukah next year, together with my three daughters, and kindle the light, and praise the Almighty, proudly as an Australian and a Jew, because I know that’s exactly what my friend Eli would have wanted.”Aghion said terrorists would not decide the future.“We Australians make that decision. We Australians will not be dictated to by anyone, and especially not those who wield violence and fear in the name of hate.“Our answer to the terrorists, to their knowing or unwitting accomplices and sympathisers is this.

They are accused of taking the objects from the official Paris residence of the French president and trying to sell them on online auction websites such as Vinted.The head steward at the palace alerted authorities to the missing objects, some of which are deemed items of national heritage. The items are estimated to have a combined value of up to €40,000 (£35,000).Most of the pieces came from the Sèvres Manufactory in Paris, a famed porcelain factory that has been owned by the French state since 1759. Investigators began to question Élysée staff after factory personnel recognised some of the missing items on auction sites.The alleged thefts are an unwelcome encore to a string of robberies from the Louvre and other French museums in recent months that have raised concern about lax safeguards at the country’s cultural institutions.The role of silver steward involves storing and looking after tableware and similar items used by presidents, visiting royalty and other dignitaries. Prosecutors said inventory records made by the arrested steward gave the impression he was planning future thefts.According to investigators, the man’s Vinted account included a plate stamped “French Air Force” and ashtrays marked “Sèvres Manufactory” – items not usually available to the general public.They said they recovered about 100 objects in his home, vehicle and personal locker, including Sèvres porcelain, a René Lalique statuette, Baccarat champagne coupes and copper saucepans.The steward and his alleged accomplices appeared in court on 18 December and will be tried on 26 February. The trio were placed under judicial supervision, banned from contacting one another, prohibited from appearing at auction venues and barred from their professional activities, the Associated Press reported.The recovered items were returned to the Élysée – a happier outcome than at the Louvre, which is stillmissing crown jewels worth an estimated €88m (£77m) after a daylight raid in October. Four suspects have been arrested in relation to that case.Other French institutions targeted in recent months include Paris’s Natural History Museum and a porcelain museum in Limoges. Both were raided in September, losingsix gold nuggets worth about €1.5m(£1.3m) andChinese porcelain with an estimated combined worth of €6.55m(£5.7m) respectively.In October,around 2,000 gold and silver coins worth about €90,000(£78,000) were stolen from the Maison des Lumières (House of Enlightenment), a museum in Langres dedicated to the philosopher Denis Diderot.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They took their valuables, including cell phones.”The dead included a driver from an online car-hailing service who was driving past.“It’s pure criminality,” Kekana said. Police launched a manhunt for the attackers and appealed for public assistance.SouthAfrica, the continent’s most industrialised nation, is grappling with a high crime rate, much of it driven by organised networks and gangs. The country is awash with legal and illegal firearms and shootings are common, often fuelled by gang rivalry and competition between informal businesses.Gunmen kill at least 12 people including three-year-old in hostel in South AfricaRead moreThe tavernhit in the Pretoria attack this monthwas an unlicenced outlet in a hostel for migrant workers at Saulsville township. The dead included children age three, 12 and 16.The country was also shocked by the daylight killing in central Johannesburg last week of a popular former radio presenter known as DJ Warras. The 40-year-old, whose real name was Warris Stock, was shot on 16 December outside a building he had been visiting as part of his work with a private security company.In another high-profile killing, a witness in a corruption inquiry was shot dead in front of his family on 5 December just weeks after testifying against a municipal police chief. The murder of Marius Van der Merwe, 41, reignited a debate about the targeting of whistleblowers who provide information related to crime and corruption.South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, with an average of 63 people a day killed between April and September this year, according to police data.In one of the worst mass shootings in recent years,18 relatives were shot dead at a rural homesteadin the Eastern Cape province in September 2024. The victims, who had gathered for a traditional ceremony, were age 14 to 64, and 15 were women.

Those attacks have resulted in at least 100 deaths.Kevin Hassett, the White House national economic council director, said on Sunday on CBS News’sFace the Nationthat the first two tankers taken into custody had been operating illegally and supplying oil to countries under sanctions.“And so I don’t think that people need to be worried here in the US that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,” Hassett said. “There’s just a couple of them – and they were black market ships.”But as the seizures increase geopolitical tensions, they are likely to drive oil prices higher when Asian markets reopen on Monday, an oil trader toldReuters. The trader added that expectations surrounding a potential end to the war in Ukraine could help limit further price increases.US forces on Saturdayapprehendeda second merchant vessel carrying oil off the coast of Venezuela in international waters in the midst of an American blockade against the country’s oil, according to theTrump administration’s homeland security department.That stoppage followed theseizureby US forces of another oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast on 10 December.

Now the pair have teamed up again – but she refuses to get carried away by all the praiseSun 21 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareOne day in July 2021, Renate Reinsve got up, read the Guardian and promptly vomited. It was – mostly – a happy kind of hurl. The Norwegian actor was at Cannes, where The Worst Person in the World had premiered the previous evening. Joachim Trier’s film, which follows Julie, a young woman on a capricious yet uncompromising quest for meaning and happiness, was the first Reinsve had ever starred in. During the screening, she decided “this movie is great, but I amshit!” Hours later she was confronting the possibility that she might be one of the greatest actors of her generation.This newspaper’s verdict– “A star is born” – was, she said, “too much to process, so I just started puking. My whole image of myself and what I could do just changed instantly.”Reinsve went on to win the best actress prize at the festival. Her performance would later be shortlisted for a Bafta and a slew of other awards (the film itself received two Oscar nominations). The accolades certainly helped on the self-esteem front, but the 38-year-old knew she mustn’t let the acclaim go to her head. “I was very overwhelmed and then I sat with it and was like: OK, I need to keep a distance to this somehow,” she recalls, sitting on the sofa in a cavernous hotel suite in Soho, London. “You can’t take criticism too personally and you can’t take praise too personally.” Such affirmation, I imagine, must become addictive. “Yes. And everything in life shall pass. So the aim was to keep everything a little bit even and keep the image I have of myself intact.”Serene, meticulously self-effacing and aspirationally Scandi-chic in brown denim and black loafers, Reinsve is about as far from the archetypal fame monster as you could possibly imagine. For fans of The Worst Person in the World, this will be welcome news. The film’s brilliance hinged on the rare relatability of its protagonist, a combination of the character’s frustrated search for fulfilment – too many professional epiphanies; initially euphoric but ultimately disappointing relationships – and the actor’s unaffectedly vivacious and profoundly layered performance. Her smile alone is a portal to an entire interior universe.View image in fullscreenReinsve and Inga-Ibsdotter-Lilleaas in Sentimental Value.Photograph: Kasper-Tuxen-AndersenIt didn’t take long for Reinsve to notice that people were identifying hard with Julie. On an early press round, she encountered a fortysomething interviewer who “was a little bit agitated [that] someone in her 30s was telling her story. Like: how do you know how I feel? And then the next [journalist] was in his 20s and he was like, I just want to say: This is me.” The actor realised “Oh, this is what the movie is to people, they really feel that it’s them.” Indeed, The Worst Person in the World isn’t merely an astonishingly accurate portrayal of how it feels to be a young woman. Thanks to Reinsve, it’s also an astonishingly accurate portrayal of how it feels to live a life.Following up this once-in-a-lifetime role was always going to be a challenge. The US quickly came calling: Reinsve’s next major (and first English-speaking) role was opposite Sebastian Stan as an actor whose facial disfigurement is miraculously cured in A Different Man. To calm her nerves she opted to embrace failure, deciding “this will be my downfall – this is going to be crap and that’s the way it is. And then it wasn’t that bad!”Pre-empting disaster evidently remains her defence mechanism of choice. In May, Trier and Reinsve returned to Cannes with Sentimental Value, a funny, sad, ambitious film about the tensions between family, art and love. She plays Nora, a depressive actor whose estranged film-maker father (Stellan Skarsgård) saunters back into her life brandishing a semi-autobiographical script he’s written as a vehicle for her talents. When an indignant Nora refuses the role, he casts up-and-coming American starlet Rachel (Elle Fanning) instead, while continuing to discomfit Nora and her sister Agnes with his eccentric presence.I was a quirky kid very interested in everything to do with existentialism and listening to Pink Floyd in secretDuring the shoot, Reinsve deliberately convinced herself the film could never live up to The Worst Person in the World. By Cannes, she was “very open to anything, because it’s really hard to tell if it’s good or not when you’re in the movie yourself”. Sentimental Value is, admittedly, a less immediately irresistible beast than the millennial Bildungsroman that made the pair’s names. But it is also a beautiful, devastating, richly thematic intergenerational tour de force which ended up winning the Grand Prix, generating plenty of Oscar buzz for Reinsve, who has already received aGolden Globe best actress nominationfor her performance, and, reportedly, receiving a 19-minute standing ovation, the third-longest in Cannes history. What was it like to sit through that? “You just feel that your face is really stiff from smiling for so long,” says Reinsve, fully appreciating the absurdity.Like Julie, Nora was written especially for Reinsve by Trier and his collaborator Eskil Vogt. Does this mean those characters are actually based on her as a person? With Julie – who the actor describes as “happy-go-lucky, melancholic but naive” – there was some crossover. Trier “writes something of what he has seen”, she explains. Then, during production, Julie became even “more my perspective, or the way I knew how to be a person in these situations”. For Nora, on the other hand, the director “wanted to challenge me on going even deeper into emotional weight”. Still, one parallel is especially stark. Not only is Nora an actor, she’s a big fish in the small pond of Norwegian theatre who has a film created for her by a director who believes she deserves success on a far greater scale.Reinsve grew up in a remote part of Norway – not even a village, just “a road with some houses” in the forest – where she always felt out of place. She was “a quirky kid very interested in everything that had to do with existentialism” (she later bonded with Trier over both of them being “sentimental and melancholic way too early”). While her preteen peers were fawning over the Backstreet Boys, she was “listening to Pink Floyd in secret. So I knew that I was looking for something else.” She found hints of it in Hollywood icons such as Diane Keaton, who “made it possible for quirky girls to feel accepted” and David Lynch, whose embrace of the subconscious fascinated her. “Through movies, I really found my friends.”Real life wasn’t making sense in quite the same way. The major theme of Reinsve’s youth is rejection: she got asked to leave, in approximate order, girl scouts (for “doing everything wrong”); the family construction business (“I never could follow the rules”); her childhood home (“I was, to put it mildly, too different from my mother”); and eventually school. By that time she was 16 and living alone. “I was not finding a way to organise my life. I didn’t have the skills. So I would not show up if I was sleeping in and I was just a little bit wild.”View image in fullscreenValue added … Renate Reinsve.Photograph: Carlotta Cardana/The GuardianActing had long been a way to subconsciously process the “social dynamics” she was struggling with. When she was nine, Reinsve joined a youth theatre half an hour’s drive away, where her talent was affirmed. “When I was 14 someone came to the back room with a card and said: ‘You should apply for a theatre school.’” The prospect of acting for a living gave her “butterflies”.But first, Reinsve “ran away from everything. I felt I didn’t fit in and was looking for something in a different place.” At 17 she ended up in Edinburgh: she’d fallen in love with the city while performing to tiny audiences with her theatre group as part of the festival fringe (plus the flights were “really cheap” and she had no money). To support herself she worked double shifts in a hostel-restaurant-bar, a destination for international travellers. She loved being exposed to different cultures and enjoyed the “partying” but her English wasn’t great and she struggled to understand British humour (“the last thing you learn in a language”). Back in Norway, Reinsve studied drama and spent the next decade making a name for herself on stage. Norwegian theatre is, she says, “really good” – high-brow, cutting-edge and closely linked with avant garde Berlin institutions – but she soon felt as if she was at a dead end. “I’d done it for so many years, it’s very hard physical work and I had worked with so many great directors. I was like: OK, I think I’m done.” She wasn’t getting offered any film projects that interested her either, so decided to “do something else” – she considered retraining as a carpenter, having enjoyed renovating a dilapidated house she’d bought – and let go of being an actor”..Little did she know that Trier had been busy writing something just for her. The director had been convinced of her superstar potential ever since she’d appeared fleetingly in his acclaimed 2011 film Oslo, August 31st, and was baffled that almost a decade later she was still treading the boards. “One or two days” after she’d decided to pack in acting, “Joachim called me for Julie”.So many exciting things are happening because of Joachim. We all understand: Oh, something’s happening nowIn Sentimental Value, Reinsve returns to her theatre days via Nora. She even got to realise a long-held dream of playing Hamlet (although those scenes didn’t make the final cut). While she is generally wary of improvisation – “because you can lose the layers: you want to say something and you want the audience to hear something else and see something third” – she did make some alterations to the script. “When Nora explains what she loves about acting in the theatre, what [Trier] thought didn’t resonate with me – there were other things that were more important to me.” (In one scene, Nora tells Agnes that immersing herself in the perspectives of different characters “maybe provides me the security to connect to my own feelings”.)View image in fullscreenOslo motion … Renate Reinsve in The Worst Person in the World.Photograph: Kasper Tuxen/APDespite the interest from the US (last year she also starred in Apple TV’s Presumed Innocent alongside Jake Gyllenhaal), Reinsve seems to be sticking around Scandinavia. Last year, she led the Caméra d’Or-winning Armand, directed by Halfdan Ullmann Tøndel, grandson of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, and she recently reunited with Stan for the upcoming film Fjord, about Romanian immigrants in Norway (she has also been cast in Alexander Payne’s Denmark-set Somebody Out There). Is she loyal to the local scene? “Not really, because I started so late and I wasn’t let in!” she laughs. “It’s not loyalty, it’s actually that it’s so many exciting things happening because of Joachim.”It’s true that Trier and Reinsve’s success is putting modern Norwegian film on the map – does she feel like she’s actively contributing to the country’s cinematic identity? “Yes, absolutely. We all understand: Oh, something’s happening now.” As for what makes Norway’s output distinctive, “that’s so hard for me to see because I’m so in it.”Crucially, after a childhood of alienation, Reinsve is now in the thick of things: a linchpin of her homeland’s film industry and a celebrated actor on the world stage. “I don’t know what this feeling is …” she says, with genuine incredulity and one of her trademark multidimensional smiles. “A feeling of not believing that you finally feel you belong.”Sentimental Value is in cinemas on Boxing Day.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now we have the stage adaptation, which puts to music the tale of young Nikolas.Aged 11, he is marooned in grief and loneliness after his mother is killed by a bear and his father takes off on an expedition to the North Pole to find the fabled villages of the elves. Nikolas (Devon Sandell, performing on press night and full of energy) follows his father northwards with his pet mouse Miika (Olivia Dickens), to meet a reindeer called Blitzen (Alexander Solly), the Truth Pixie (Daisy Chapman), the elves, and a bevy of other fantastical creatures.This is the second musical in recent times that this theatre has adapted from a hit film that was itself based on a bestselling book. The first wasThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, a charming adaptation that transfers to the West End next month. Lighting does not strike twice with Philip Wilson’s adaptation, which is not nearly as captivating.View image in fullscreenThe vivid puppets are designed by Charlie Tymms.Photograph: Ellie KurttzIt is performed by the Chichester Festival YouthTheatre, and more than 70 young people do a heroic job. Visually it is delightful, both in its lovely costumes designed by Ryan Dawson Laight and vivid puppets designed by Charlie Tymms. Directed by Dale Rooks and set against Simon Higlett’s mobile stage design of icy wastes and fluttering snowflakes, it is a shame that some grownup professionals do not hold up their part of the bargain.The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry review – life-affirming musical reckons with deathRead moreThe script by Wilson is staid while the songs (music by Tom Brady with lyrics by Brady and Wilson) are strangely humdrum and samey, from the opening number, How Do You Do It, onwards. The choreography stays minimal and almost static, even at times when the story demands movement, such as during a chase involving a sleigh, and there are certainly no show-stopping song and dance numbers.As a result there is little emotional catch or wonder, when the story should be infused with both elements. Nor is there jeopardy, even when the fearsome bear (George Stanbridge) and troll (Jack Walter-Nelson) make growling appearances.In order to make magic, you have toreallybelieve in it, we are told.

He washeld for three months,missing the birthof his first child, by an administration that smeared his opposition to Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza as cheerleading for terrorism, while abusing immigration policy to silence him.At the movies this year, I was repeatedly reminded of Khalil, and others who have seen their altruistic activism reframed as violent threats that need to be snuffed out, in characters whose plights followed similar tracts. InWicked: For Good, Elphaba’s attempts to expose the lies told in Oz are twisted into death threats. InSuperman, Kal-El is investigated for being a foreign agent when he defends a community suffering under violent US-backed occupation. Even inZootopia 2, a bunny cop is framed for attempted murder because she is exposing an attempt to eradicate a marginalized population from their lands and erase their history.‘I think of those I left behind in prison’: Iran’s Jafar Panahi on life as a banned film-makerRead moreUnlike those examples (and there are more), the most compelling – and in my mind, best – movies this year dropped the buffer that science-fiction and fantasy have to offer. They gave us stories of fraught idealism and resistance to oppressive states that more immediately and urgently engage with what people across the globe are witnessing in this moment.Jafar Panahi’sIt Was Just An Accidentis about former political prisoners who think they found the man who tortured them on behalf of the Iranian regime. Kleber Mendonça Filho’sThe Secret Agentfollows a professor in hiding during the 70s military dictatorship in Brazil. And Paul Thomas Anderson’sOne Battle After Anotherstars Leonardo DiCaprio as a stoner former revolutionary on the run from fascist forces in the US, his paranoia not just a byproduct of the substances he abuses.View image in fullscreenWagner Moura in The Secret Agent.Photograph: APThese films form a triptych that have been scoring several critics’ best picture, director and international film prizes in unison, much like the one we celebrated a couple years ago, whenKillers of the Flower Moon,The Zone of InterestandOppenheimerexplored in their own ways how people compartmentalize their humanity to commit or accommodate genocide (incidentally those movies premiered just months before the siege on Gaza). This year’s movies also speak to and reinforce each other, telling stories not of individual heroes but of communities, tied together by systemic oppression, building solidarity. And they all cut through the tension with morbid and absurdist humor: the security guards in It Was Just An Accident busting out portable credit card terminals to take bribes; the dismembered leg in The Secret Agent hopping around, kicking down the gay occupants in a park, standing in for a brutal police force abusing marginalized communities; and almost everything about the white supremacists who call themselves the Christmas Adventurers Club in One Battle After Another. These gags invite us to laugh at how pathetic sinister forces abusing their powers can be, without tempering how scary it is to live in their world.The most righteously infuriating but incredibly empathetic among this batch is It Was Just An Accident, which doesn’t just portray the everyday people who oppose their government but is, in its own existence, an act of resistance, made in typical clandestine fashion (for Panahi) to avoid Iranian censorship. The Palme d’Or-winning film was borne out of Panahi’srecent imprisonment(for making films deemed “propaganda” against the regime), when he absorbed stories from fellow political prisoners that would inspire his characters in It Was Just An Accident.‘Everything is political’: how film can guide us through difficult timesRead moreThe film’s title is uttered in its opening sequence. A man named Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi) is driving his wife and daughter at night along a dark road when he accidentally strikes a dog with his car. The horrified young daughter blames her father for killing the dog. The parents try to reason with her. The dog died because of the poorly lit road and perhaps even the will of Allah. The daughter remains unconvinced by their attempts at shifting the blaming to the infrastructure and belief systems that shape their daily lives, instead of taking individual responsibility.That tension lingers over the rest of the movie, when Eghbal is knocked unconscious, hog-tied and held in the back of a van by an anxious alliance of former political prisoners. They are convinced that he was their torturer but are unsure how to positively identify him or what to do if their suspicions prove true.That’s the desperate set up in a tragicomic road movie that surveys the social landscape in Tehran (notably the progress borne from the Women, Life, Freedom movement as young women roam the streets treating headscarves as optional), while also asking questions for the country’s future. After the regime falls, how do the people carry the trauma? And what to do with those who collaborated with the state? Do they blame the system or follow that young daughter’s instinct, holding individuals accountable for their actions? In moving ways, the film’s moral compass is guided by children, especially after a surprise birth introduces a warm sense of hope for the next generation.That forward looking sentiment is there in The Secret Agent too, a paranoid political thriller that moves like Three Days of the Condor by way of No Country for Old Men to a samba drumbeat. It’s 1977. Carnival is raging. And Wagner Moura’s Armando, a professor, makes plans to escape the country. He is being smeared in local media by bad agents because he dared to criticize a corrupt bureaucrat lining his own pockets with public funds. He is also stalked by an assassin in league with a local police chief.View image in fullscreenJafar Panahi after winning the Palme d’Or at Cannes.Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/Invision/APAll these characters are either fathers or father figures to young men following in their footsteps, a generational thread that hits home when The Secret Agent jumps ahead to the present tense. Young archivists listen to Armando’s recorded testimonies as part of Brazil’s recent reconciliation efforts. Wagner re-emerges, now playing Armando’s son, in a bittersweet coda reflecting on cultural memory (or is it amnesia?), and how threats from the past can just as easily re-emerge for a new generation. Filho and Moura said as much ininterviews, explaining that their collaboration on the film began when the far-right government overseen by former president Jair Bolsonaro (who is currently serving a27-year sentencefor plotting a coup) echoed the 1970s military dictatorship.Re-emerging fascist forces are also the threat inOne Battle After Another, in which DiCaprio’s Bob, a former revolutionary, scrambles to protect his daughter Willa while both are hunted by a wacked-out US colonel from their past (Sean Penn’s celebrated performance needs no further ink here).The revolution will be in VistaVision: what are the politics of One Battle After Another?Read moreAnderson’s exhilarating and monumental girl-dad thriller, packing high-adrenaline action sequences and thorny observations onraceand fetishized radicalism, is remarkable both for its forward moving momentum but also the sense of being stuck (or unfixed) in time. The movie, which borrows liberally from the past (the radical action ofthe Weathermen, the repeated verses of Gil Scott-Heron), opens with a prologue that appears to be set today, as DiCaprio andTeyana Taylor’s revolutionaries break out migrants from an ICE-like detention center. When the movie jumps ahead 16 years, it still seems like it is set today. “Nothing’s changed,” says Taylor’s Perfidia Beverly Hills in voiceover, introducing a second act in which migrants are once again violently rounded up by militant forces whose counterinsurgency tactics (including a soldier manufacturing consent to brutalize civilians by tossing a Molotov cocktail at his own unit) should be a wakeup call for what has been happening on the streets.No wonder Bob is confused and agitated whenever he’s prompted by an operator on a secret revolutionary hotline to answer the question “What time is it?” It’s all a blur, really. The only way to mark the passage of time in One Battle After Another is through Bob’s 16-year-old daughter. Ironically, the wonderful actor playing Willa is namedChase Infiniti.She emerges as the movie’s comforting hope for the future, a sentiment shared not just with It Was Just An Accident and The Secret Agent but also among those of us inspired by the next generation. They resist, onscreen and on college campuses.Explore more on these topicsFilm2025 in cultureOne Battle After AnotherJafar PanahiUS politicsPaul Thomas AndersonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Soon, Salieri’s feverish jealousy towards “this repulsive creature” is leading him down a dark path. Great fun.Phil HarrisonWild Horses, the Rockies and Me7pm, BBC TwoAccording to this nature film, no one has ever attempted to gain the trust of wild horses in Canada’s Rocky Mountains.

Secular music wasn’t the thing. As a three-year-old, I would stare at Jesus Gave Me Water by Sam Cooke going round and round; I’d be hypnotised by the power, dexterity and raw passion of his delivery.The first single I boughtI Feel for You by Chaka Khan had zoomed to No 1. I lost my mind at the “Chak-Chak-Chak-Chaka Khan” bit. Because I was a good girl, and had done all my chores, I begged Mum and Dad to go uptown and buy it from Our Price in Wolverhampton.The song I do at karaokeI Have Nothing by Whitney Houston, because, frankly, I’m a show off. It’s a song that you aspire to do well, because there’s so much technicality involved in it. You need range and breath control. Because I’ve got that in my arsenal, I do it.The song that changed my lifeI lost my mind and heart when I heard Little Red Corvette by Prince when I was nine. I saw the video and thought: He is the most incredible man I’ve ever seen. I’m gonna marry him when I’m old enough. Did I? Sadly, no.The best song to play at a partyGet Ur Freak On by Missy Elliott absolutely bangs.The song I secretly like, but tell everyone I hateI don’t care what anyone says. Who Do You Think You Are by the Spice Girls is an absolute bop.The best song to have sex toThis is appropriate because we just lost him: Untitled (How Does It Feel) by D’Angelo. How does it feel? And it’s a long song.The song that gets me up in the morningI’ll shower, and then loudly sing along to Anotherloverholewn-yohead by Prince, which annoys my eight-year-old black-and-white terrier, Zain, who hates my singing completely. I took him to the studio, but when I started singing, he ran to the door, whining to be let out.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toI can sing every word of You Can Call Me Al by Paul Simon. It went in by osmosis.The song I’d like played at my funeralIt’s another bloody Prince song, I’m so sorry – Mountains. I love how the chord structure ascends and the vocals – “It’s only mountains and the sea / There’s nothing greater than you and me” – feel like an ascension. I’d like to think, when I shuffle off this mortal coil, I’m going to be ascending as opposed to descending.

So why is it still dismissed by critics?Ella RisbridgerSun 21 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTSharePeople buy lipstick when the world is falling apart. This genuine economic theory, known as the “lipstick index”, was first noted by Leonard Lauder (son of the more famous Estée). When the world seems very bleak – in the weeks and months after the twin towers fell, for instance, or after the 2008 financial crash – and spending generally goes down, lipstick sales trend strongly upwards.The psychological truth at the heart of this equation is real: when people have less than they need, they spend more on small, beautiful things. It’s easy, maybe, to dismiss this in the way most feminine-coded things are dismissed: frivolous, wasteful, foolish. But that would be a mistake. A single treasure, bright and gorgeous, is like a talisman; a candle in the night. It is possible, with your small candle, to make your way in the darkness. One delight, against all this. The world crumbles, and lipstick sales go up.And so, too, do sales of romantic fiction. Just as with lipstick, there were clear spikes in the numbers of romance novels sold after 9/11 and the 2008 crash. Perhaps unsurprisingly, in our current climate, sales of romantic fiction are at an all-time high.Print sales of romance fiction in the US have doubled in the last five years. Meanwhile, in the UK the romance and sagas category, which had for two decades made around £20m annually, leapt to a staggering £53.2m in 2022 during the pandemic, growing to £69m in 2024.Romantic fiction, however you define it, is about the things that matter mostThis has been an extraordinary year for romantic writing. Established American romance writers such as Emily Henry – her latest hit,Great Big Beautiful Life, tells the story of two authors vying to write the biography of a reclusive heiress who themselves fall in love along the way – have continued to sell thousands of copies, of course. But 2025 has also seen books such as Jessica Stanley’s widely acclaimedConsider Yourself Kissedsweep bookshops across the UK. Stanley’s book, in which an ambitious political commentator and aspiring novelist try to build a life together, was never conceived of as a romance novel, but it hits every beat of a traditional romcom. Similarly, Alison Espach’sThe Wedding People– in which an accidental wedding “guest” falls, sort of, for the groom – continues to stack up sales on both sides of the Atlantic. And literary fiction is growing more romantic in response; what is the perennially popular Normal People by Sally Rooney but a romcom at heart?Love is everywhere, and while that says nothing good about the state of our world, it says only good things about our desire for connection. Romantic fiction, however you define it, is about the things that matter most. It is about how we create community, and where that starts. It is about love and everything that happens because of it. These are the books that are selling; these are the stories people want to hear. Though you wouldn’t necessarily know it.So-called “romantasy” books such asA Court of Thorns and Rosesby Sarah J Maas and Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros climb to the No 1 spot and remain there for weeks, even months. They are widely read, loved, sometimes hated but always discussed – while being widely ignored by the critics. The genre is seen as too frivolous, or too domestic, to be taken seriously.And yet romantic fiction handles big themes: chronic illness, global warming, divorce, death, betrayal and despair. Depression, anxiety and PTSD often appear – trauma, almost always. Pain, too. There’s the housing market, issues around antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, fatphobia, sexism, classism, all kinds of interdepartmental hatred and fear. All kinds of horror, love and loss.These don’t just exist in booksdesignedto discuss these kinds of issues; these are the books that sell across the board, for pleasure. They are the books that people are really reading, and there is no subject too big or too bleak for there to exist romantic fiction about and around and because of it.View image in fullscreenFrom left: authors Alison Espach, Talia Hibbert, Sarah J Maas and Emily Henry.Photograph: prJasmine Guillory, for instance, writes (delightful) romantic fiction of the fluffiest kind: there are sweet treats and beautiful landscapes and fast cars and lacy lingerie. They are also sharp analyses of what it means to be fat and Black and a woman in the US today: the vulnerabilities, the dangers, the pleasures. UK novelist Talia Hibbert writes about nannies and single dads; artists and grumpy building caretakers; brooding security guards and sexy librarians. She is also writing about chronic pain, racism and complex family trauma. Queer romance (Casey McQuiston, Alexis Hall, Kate Young, so many more) is entering mainstream sales charts for the first time: Mills & Boon didn’t publish an explicitly queer title until – this is unbelievable – 2020.And yet the trick is to hold all this very, very lightly. When romantic fiction tackles the problems of the world it must do so with such grace that you barely notice. It must do so in a way that makes the reader feelbetterabout those things. Not for the romcom the unresolved ending, the unreliable narrator. The romcom must bring everything together, always, to a happy ending.It is the happy ending that throws people. That, critics of the genre like to suggest, is the part that marks these books as simple escapism – even fantasy. But life is full of moments that might function as a happy ending, if anything ever ended. The problem with real life is that it goes on; the joy of a book is that it can stop at the perfect point.The trick, I suppose, is to learn to identify those moments. As Kurt Vonnegut wrote: “notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point: ‘If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.’”The best romantic novels are books, at base, about noticing things: about noticing someone across a crowded room, certainly, but also noticing your friends, your family, the guy at the corner shop who always asks you how you are, a good coffee, a soft new jumper, cushions, crisps, oysters, the sky, the sea, the sunset. A good romantic novel is full of things that feel tangible and tactile.A good romantic novel is full of people and moments and things: not just the central couple, but everyone else, too. A good romantic novel teaches you to notice these things for yourself. I read hundreds of romantic novels last year – I was writing a book about romantic fiction – and by the end of it, I was different. I was softer. I was, I suppose, happier, though very little had materially changed. I had read books about love, and I saw more love in the world than ever before.The lipstick index tells us people want beauty. The romance index, if we can call it that, tells us that people want connection. People want each other, which is all we ever truly have to give.In Love With Love: The Persistence and Joy of Romantic Fiction by Ella Risbridger is published by Sceptre.

In the 16th century, Copernicus and his peers overturned that view with the heliocentric model. Since then, telescopes and spacecraft have revealed just how insignificant we are. There are hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way, each star a sun like ours, many with planets orbiting them. In 1995, the Hubble space telescope captured its first deep-field image: this showed us that there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in our known universe, huge wheeling collections of stars dispersed through space.Let’s take the International Astronomical Union’s definition of space as everything in the universe apart from our planet and atmosphere. Asking the question “who owns space?” seems laughable. Hubris at a whole new level. The idea that we could lay claim to the rest of the universe is beyond conceit. It’s like a group of atoms in my little toe becoming sentient and declaring that they now own my whole body.A few years ago, I postulated that space exploration could be divided into three distinct eras. The first was confrontation. It was the second world war that fuelled our first forays into the abyss, as this proved to be an effective way of lobbing munitions further. The space race was born from military competition – in a bid to establish superiority. The second era brought collaboration. The formation of the EuropeanSpaceAgency in 1975 and that symbolic docking between Soviet and American space vehicles symbolised what humanity could achieve collectively. But now we’re on the verge of a third era: commercialisation. Space exploration is no longer just the domain of nations, but of billionaires, private companies and start-ups promising holidays in orbit.Space should be regarded as a shared domain, similar to the high seas or AntarcticaOf course, the space industry has been commercial for decades – many communications satellites, Earth-observation systems and some launch vehicles are privately funded and operated. But what’s changing is that humans themselves are now part of the business plan, as we move from exploration to possible exploitation. Private space stations, space tourism, lunar and asteroid mining – this is the new frontier. So the question of ownership suddenly has legal, ethical and economic urgency.Legally speaking, the groundwork for managing space was laid long ago. In the late 1950s and early 60s, as rockets first breached Earth’s atmosphere, the United Nations drafted agreements to govern activities beyond our planet. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 set out some remarkably idealistic principles: “The exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind.”I would reword it to humankind, but I do like the sentiment.It’s a beautiful vision, but potentially an increasingly fragile one. As technology advances, these noble principles will come face to face with economic reality. When a commercial company finds a valuable mineral deposit on the moon or an asteroid, who gets to profit?I would argue that commercialisation is necessary – space needs to pay for itself, because without profit, humanity will stay “terra-bound” for centuries. Exploration is expensive, and governments alone can’t afford to foot the bill. If mining helium-3 or capturing asteroids helps fund missions that expand our knowledge, capabilities and improve our husbandry of our planet, that could be a good thing. But commercialisation must come with equity and transparency. Otherwise, we risk repeating the mistakes of our past, but on a truly cosmic scale.The comparison I often like to make is with the East India Company: a private British enterprise that became so powerful it could shape the politics of nations and at times had an army twice the size of Britain’s. It began as trade; it ended in domination. Could a similar dynamic unfold locally in our solar system, where a handful of today’s tech giants and billionaires control access to orbit, communications, and eventually, extraterrestrial resources? A monopoly in space would be dangerous for humanity. The challenge is to encourage innovation and investment without ceding ownership of the cosmos to a few individuals or organisations.The moon is a fascinating case study. For scientists, it serves as a natural laboratory – a place to study planetary history and test new technologies. But it’s also an appealing commercial target. There’s water ice at its poles, which can be split into hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. Its gravity is only one-sixth of Earth’s, making it a sound launch base for deeper space exploration. And some have suggested mining the lunar surface for helium-3, a potential fuel for future fusion reactors. The possibilities are tantalising. But who decides how the moon’s resources should be used, and by whom?The Outer Space Treaty forbids national appropriation, but it doesn’t explicitly prohibit private companies from extracting resources. That ambiguity has prompted countries such as the United States and Luxembourg to pass their own space-mining laws, granting rights to their domestic firms. Yet if each nation makes its own rules, could the result be chaos like the early wild west – or even conflict? Space, by its nature, demands global regulation.That’s why I believe we need to revive the spirit of the early treaties, not just in words but through action. Space should be regarded as a shared domain, similar to the high seas or, perhaps more fittingly, Antarctica. No one owns Antarctica. It is protected for peaceful research under an international agreement. That hasn’t stopped some countries from eyeing its minerals, but the principle remains: collective stewardship. Space warrants the same approach. The way we behave in the third era of space will define not just the future of exploration, but the kind of species we are. Do we carry our old rivalries and greed into the stars, or do we finally learn to act as one planet, united by curiosity and care?As always, I’m hopeful. I trust the new generation to do a better job, and space has a way of putting things into perspective. When astronauts look down at Earth from orbit, they describe a sense of awe, known as the “overview effect”. They see our planet as it really is, fragile and shared. Perhaps if we can hold on to that view, even as we venture further out, we might be able to reach for the stars in a way that benefits everyone.Dame Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock will deliver the 2025 Christmas Lectures from the Royal Institution.Further readingOrbitalby Samantha Harvey (Jonathan Cape, £9.99)Who Owns the Moon?by AC Grayling (Oneworld, £10.99)A City on Marsby Dr Kelly Weinersmith and Zach Weinersmith (Penguin, £11.69)Explore more on these topicsScienceThe big ideaSpaceAstronomyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

JB Priestley’s cosy comedy is easy entertainment on a chilly evening, and Tim Sheader’s chucklesome production conjures the comforting feeling of sinking into an armchair by a fire and rewatching a quaint old classic.Written in 1934 and set in 1908, this shenanigan-filled drama sees three middle-class Yorkshire couples smugly toasting their silver wedding anniversaries. Monied, mannered, and blindingly dressed by costume designer Anna Fleischle (all fine tweed and extravagant puffs of lace cuffs), their unravelling begins with the discovery that a mistake occurred 25 years ago. None of them are married after all.The revelation, beautifully frozen between acts in a tableau set to Beyoncé’s Single Ladies, upends who they are to each other and themselves. Suddenly, the men’s positions of power are smashed alongside the fancy crockery, and the women discover they’re no longer burdened with duty and piles of their husband’s darning. The skill of both Priestley’s prose and this cast’s performances is in the succinct presentation of the characters’ cores. Particularly the belligerent Albert (Marc Wootton), timid Annie (Sophie Thompson) and hen-pecked Herbert (a stand-out Jim Howick), the last of whom gets as much gastric trouble from speaking back to his wife as he does from overdoing it on dinner.View image in fullscreenIncreasingly inebriated … Ron Cook and Tori Allen-Martin.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe port keeps pouring and word of the ruckus gets around town. Noses upturn and lips purse as a host of new, lower-class characters hurl themselves on to the sofa for a slice of the scandal: the chipper charwoman (Janice Connolly), increasingly inebriated photographer (Ron Cook, with delightful physical comedy) and Blackpool gal Lottie (Tori Allen-Martin) who seems a little too familiar with one of the now unmarried men.Priestley’s crisp, playful dialogue bounces every line off the same joke, but does so with charm. All is safe and pleasantly silly in this well-made production, if not uproariously so. The stakes are never too high, the tantrums never too long. As the night draws to a close, the couples are a little shaken, and all the better for it. Priestley’s play reminds us to do better by each other, to make the best of what we have – and, should any wedding days be drawing near, to double-check the paperwork so as to avoid a nasty surprise 25 years down the line.AtDonmar Warehouse, London, until 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreJB PriestleyDonmar WarehousereviewsShareReuse this content"

At 19, she said she was barely eating, and described the period as unhealthy and one she regretted.At the time of the bullying, she said she threw herself into her acting and creative world beyond school. “I wouldn’t let them spoil a trajectory that I was determined I was on,” she said.“And at least I had a lovely family to go home to.”Explore more on these topicsKate WinsletHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Scottish composerJames MacMillanis not among them. His vast catalogue includes multiple symphonies, concertos and two passions –St LukeandSt John– as well as hisChristmas Oratorio, which was premiered in 2021. JS Bach’s 1734 version has become a festive classic, but MacMillan’s piece is no homage: although this 21st-century Christmas Oratorio speaks many musical languages, Bach’s is emphatically not among them.Instead, it flits from delicately scored passages of chamber music to full-throttle climaxes for choir and orchestra, from percussive modernist spikiness to smooth, Brittenish almost-tonality, from pastiche renaissance polyphony to surging Hollywood film score. “I’m getting a lot of Harry Potter,” reported a bemused friend during the interval.While portions of this take on the Christmas story sound disconcertingly innocuous, MacMillan’s choral writing is demanding. In this performance conducted by the composer, theBBC Symphony Choruswere initially tentative. They were at their atmospheric best in the unaccompanied and quieter sections showcasing their excellent diction and silky blend. The upper voices’ slow unfolding of “O magnum mysterium” was especially magical, floating over barely audible passagework in the woodwind and lower strings and the periodic throb of muted brass.View image in fullscreenThe BBC Symphony Chorus conducted by Sir James MacMillan.Photograph: BBC/Mark AllanThe two vocal soloists were ideally matched, withRoderick Williams’ warm, malleable baritone balanced by Rhian Lois’s harder, narrower soprano. The latter provided a luminous gilding in the large-scale ensembles, while Williams’ peerless capacity for storytelling made his second aria a highlight, his declamation a kind of stentorian recitative, compelling amid flutter-tongued flute, dabs of muted trumpet and a sprinkle of vibraphone.There were numerous other moments of fleeting beauty and irresistible forwards momentum from the BBC Symphony Orchestra: a chiming harp; icy string tremolo; orchestral chords balanced to sound uncannily like an organ; a flash of what sounded like Shostakovich performed at double speed, driven along by an off-beat high-hat. Despite such pleasures, MacMillan’s Christmas Oratorio remains a strange shape, its ending peculiarly abrupt. But this was a ferociously committed performance that left the large audience roaring with approval.Explore more on these topicsBBC Symphony OrchestraClassical musicChoral musicBarbicanJames MacMillanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Geoff is still drawn to the UK, and I said to him: “That feels like an emotional decision, not a pragmatic one.” He’s also more sceptical than me about the detail – what would be the likelihood of getting back into Europe if Scotland voted for independence?

I honestly believe that my exposure to the Everyman theatre in Liverpool, via the school, made me think that anything was possible, really.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSun 21 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTShareJason, 63Ally notices the occasional looks people give us, and her response is to ask me to give her a kiss in front of themWhen Ally and I first met, she was 25 and fresh out of uni, and I was 47 and recently separated from my wife. I walked into work every day and saw this beautiful young woman with long dark hair and the most fantastic smile. Eventually I did the cheesy thing and wrote her a note telling her how I felt. I didn’t expect to hear from her. I thought she’d be thinking: what’s this old guy doing?But it was obvious that we had a lot in common artistically, culturally and intellectually. We started having a sexual relationship really quickly. It wasn’t expected, but it happened, and it was amazing.After three years, we broke up because of stress I was experiencing around work. It was the worst decision of my life. I didn’t hear from her for 13 years. This summer we ended up meeting purely by chance at a cafe. I felt a sense of wonderment that I had found her again.Despite the age gap, we understand each other and things work so well. I have better sex than with her than I’ve ever had with anyoneIt’s only since our relationship began again that I started to think about the age difference and the implications. I feel older, so I’m thinking about it more now than I did 16 years ago.There are of course a lot of very healthy, vibrant and fit old people. Many who are still having loads of sex, and I think, good on you. But the age gap does concern me, and I think about this more than she does. Ally notices the occasional looks people give us on the train, and her response is to ask me to give her a kiss in front of them. She doesn’t care.Since getting back together we’ve been more sexually active because we’re better at communicating. It’s not unusual for us to go to bed at nine; I’ll fall straight asleep then wake up a couple of hours later, we’ll have sex, go to sleep, wake up again and have some more sex. That can happen throughout the night.Despite the age gap, we just understand each other and things work so well. I have better sex than with her than I’ve ever had with anyone.

So when we began dating I thought we were just enjoying each other’s company. We went out and we had fun. It wasn’t until afterwards – years after we’d split up – that I realised I had been in love with him.I find it intensely irritating when other people make a big deal about our age difference. It immediately makes me bristle, because age really doesn’t matter. I do believe it is just a number. And these judgments come from other people’s prejudices.I was 25 when we first met, and I’m not any more. My body has changed, and before we reconnected I hadn’t undressed in front of anyone for a long timeWe’re intensely attracted to each other, we love and care for each other, so the age gap has never had an effect on me and I’ve never cared about it – although Jason is more conscious of it. But I’ve always said that the problem isn’t us, it’s everyone around us.This is how we do it: ‘I have an urgent desire to have group sex – and I want Sophie to join me on this journey’Read moreI was 25 when we first met, and I am not any more. My body has changed, and before we reconnected this summer I hadn’t undressed in front of anyone for a long time. I was terrified because Jason is someone who knows exactly what I looked like in my 20s. I worried whether he would still find me attractive? Would he be disappointed?That was a concern at the beginning, but it turned out to not be a problem at all. I’ve always been attracted to him – even after 13 years without contact – that was instant and it has not changed or diminished in any way. And I’m made to feel attractive too; he tells me every day, several times. That means a lot. I just have to look at him and I’m ready to go. That has not been my experience in other relationships.We just understand each other and each other’s bodies so well. We have a deeper sexual connection now that we’re older and our bodies are changing. It even takes longer for me to climax now, but that just means more time to enjoy it.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Twenty-plus years on, the wintry cosiness of a UKChristmashas taken hold. Now, my essentials include perfectly crisp roast potatoes with plenty of gravy, and sprouts (non-negotiable). Even my young niece and nephew love them, which is a small victory I’m quietly proud of.Blue cheese and honey gougèresView image in fullscreenLet there be light: Chantelle Nicholson’s blue cheese and honey gougères.Warm gougerès fresh from the oven are a pretty tricky thing to beat. However, adding blue cheese and honey steps them up another level. The best thing about these gougeres, though, is you can make and freeze them in advance, meaning they’re never more than 25 minutes away.Prep10 minCook40 min, plus freezingMakes2465g unsalted butter, diced3g fine salt1 tbsp honey85g strong flour60g blue cheese, crumbled2 eggs, beaten1 egg yolk, beaten1 tsp honey, to finishPut the 165g water, the butter, salt and honey in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil on a high heat, making sure the butter has fully melted. Tip in the flour all at once, then stir hard until the mixture forms a smooth dough that pulls away from the sides of the pan. Take off the heat and stir in 40g of the crumbled blue cheese until evenly combined.Transfer the dough to a bowl and leave it for a minute or two to cool slightly. Add half the beaten eggs, mix until well incorporated, then add the rest of the eggs and beat until the dough is smooth and glossy. Spoon the dough into a piping bag fitted with a large, plain nozzle, then pipe out 2cm mounds on to a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or greaseproof paper (alternatively, pipe it directly into small financier moulds for neat, even shapes). Freeze until solid (about two hours), then transfer the gougeres to an airtight container and keep in the freezer until needed.To bake, arrange the frozen gougeres 2cm apart on a lined baking tray, then brush the tops lightly with the beaten egg yolk. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, then bake the gougeres for eight minutes. Turn down the temperature to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and bake for 10 minutes more, until puffed and golden.Take out of the oven, brush the tops with the honey and scatter over the remaining 20g blue cheese. Return to the oven for five minutes, until the cheese melts and the tops turn shiny.Roast squash velouté, pickled walnut, Baron BigodView image in fullscreenSmooth operator: Chantelle Nicholson’s roast squash velouté with pickled walnuts and Baron Bigod.A rich squash soup is like a hug in a bowl, and this version suitably dazzles with two of my favourite winter ingredients: pickled walnuts andBaron Bigod. It’s a dish that also uses the whole squash (seeds and skin included), so there’s minimal waste and maximum taste.Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minServes41 onion squash, or red kuri squash2 sprigs fresh rosemary1 bay leaf50g unsalted butter, dicedSalt1 tbsp vegetable oil100g pickled walnuts, chopped100gBaron BigodScrub the squash well, then peel it; keep the peelings. Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Put the seeds in a medium saucepan with the rosemary and bay leaf, cover with two litres of water and bring to a boil. Cook for 30 minutes, then strain into a clean pan and discard the solids.Heat the oven to 220C (200 fan)/425F/gas 7. Cut the squash flesh into large chunks, spread them out on a baking tray, add the butter and a generous pinch of salt, and roast for 20 minutes. Transfer the roast squash to the pot of strained stock, add a little more salt and simmer for five minutes. Blend until completely smooth, then taste and adjust the seasoning.Turn down the oven to 190C (170 fan)/375F/gas 5. Toss the squash peelings with the tablespoon of oil and a little salt, spread out on a baking tray and bake for 12–20 minutes, moving them around from time to time so they cook evenly, until crisp.To serve, divide the chopped pickled walnuts between four warmed bowls. Using a hot knife, slice the cheese into 12 neat pieces and place three in each bowl. Top with the crisp squash skin. Serve the hot velouté in a jug or jugs at the table, so guests can pour it around the garnish.Mushroom and celeriac pithivierView image in fullscreenThe stuff of dreams: Chantelle Nicholson’s mushroom and celeriac pithivier.A showstopper is required for Christmas day, and what better way to do that than with a delicious pie (of sorts)? While there’s a bit of preparation involved, trust me, this is well worth the effort.Prep15 minCook2 hr 30 minChill1 hrServes4with enough for leftovers500g block puff pastryFlour, for dusting1 large celeriac20g miso(red or white)20g bunch thyme10 tbsp vegetable oilSalt and black pepper1kg chestnut mushrooms, quartered4 garlic cloves, peeled and bashed50g unsalted butter250ml vegetable stock, or mushroom stock150ml double cream2 tbsp cream sherry20g bunch parsley, leaves picked and finely chopped1 egg, separatedBegin by rolling the pastry so it has time to rest. Divide the pastry block into two pieces, one weighing about 200g and the other about 300g. Shape each piece into a disc, then roll out into two circles, the smaller piece to about 25cm in diameter and the larger one to about 40cm. Dust both lightly with flour, cover with a tea towel and refrigerate for 25 minutes.Heat the oven to 200C (180 fan)/390F/gas 6. Scrub the celeriac well, then peel it, reserving the peelings. Put the peelings on a baking tray and roast for 15 minutes, until golden. Tip the peelings into a medium saucepan, cover with a litre of water, add the miso and half the thyme, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 20 minutes.Slice the peeled celeriac into 5mm rounds. Brush both sides with oil, season well and roast on a tray for 10 minutes. Turn over the slices and roast for another 10 minutes.To cook the mushrooms, heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large saucepan. Once hot, add a quarter of the mushrooms, along with the remaining thyme and all the garlic, season with salt and cook until golden. Add a quarter of the butter and continue cooking until all the liquid in the pan has evaporated. Leaving the thyme and garlic in the pan, transfer the mushrooms to a tray. Repeat this process three more times with the remaining mushrooms, reusing the thyme and garlic each time. After the third batch, chill the cooked mushrooms. With the final batch, once the mushrooms are golden, pour in the stock and simmer for 10 minutes. Lift out and discard the thyme, add 50ml cream and blend to a chunky puree. Cover and chill.Strain the celeriac peel stock and discard the solids. Pour the liquid into a clean pan, bring to a simmer and add the sherry. Reduce gently for five minutes, then add the remaining cream. Boil rapidly for 10 minutes, to thicken slightly, then taste and adjust the seasoning.To assemble thepithivier, lay the smaller pastry circle on a piece of baking paper. Using a small knife, lightly score a 15mm border all around the edge. Arrange half the roast celeriac slices inside the border, then top with half the mushroom puree. Stir the chopped parsley into the chilled mushrooms, then spoon half the mushrooms on top. Repeat the layers with the remaining celeriac, mushroom puree and chilled mushrooms.Lightly beat the egg white and brush it all around the scored border. Drape the larger pastry circle over the top of the filling, then, using the sides of your hands, press firmly around the edges to seal, keeping the dome as tall as possible. Chill for 15 minutes, then trim neatly into a perfect circle (use a tart ring or cake tin as a guide). The pithivier can now rest overnight in the fridge or be baked straight away.When you’re ready to bake, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Brush the top and sides with the beaten egg yolk, chill for 10 minutes, then repeat the glazing and chill again. Mark a tiny dot in the centre of the pastry with the tip of a knife. Starting from the base of the dome, lightly score curved lines sweeping up towards the centre dot, working all the way around to create a sunburst pattern. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and bake for 10 minutes more, until deep golden. Serve with the warm celeriac sauce.Roast miso brussels sproutsView image in fullscreenSprouts, but not as you know them: Chantelle Nicholson’s roast miso brussels sprouts.I’m firmly team sprout – and team miso – so this combines the best of both worlds. Just ensure you get enough heat on the wee morsels to induce that nutty flavour.Prep5 minCook25 minServes4as a side50g vegetable oilSalt300g brussels sprouts20g miso paste(red or white)Pour the oil into a deep roasting dish, add a good pinch of salt, put the dish in the oven and turn it on to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.Halve the sprouts or, if they’re larger than a 50p piece, quarter them. Once the oven is up to temperature, carefully tip the sprouts into the hot oil – they will spit, so be cautious – then roast for 12 minutes.Meanwhile, mix the miso with four tablespoons of water until smooth. Take the tray out of the oven and carefully stir the miso mixture through the sprouts. Turn down the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then roast the sprouts for six minutes more. Serve hot.Caramelised pear and rosemary puddingView image in fullscreenAlchemy: Chantelle Nicholson’s caramelised pear and rosemary pudding.There’s an alchemy with pears, caramel and rosemary, and this pudding just affirms it. The floral notes in the pear and rosemary match so perfectly, resulting in a wonderful way to wrap up your festive feast.Prep10 minCook1 hr 15 minServes4–63 pears– comice or conference275g unsalted butter, softened150g soft dark brown sugar2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped105g caster sugar3 eggs, lightly beatenA pinch of salt200g self-raising flour, sieved2 tsp vegetable oilCustard, cream and/or ice-cream,to serveHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Peel, quarter and core the pears, keeping the peelings. Press 75g of the butter in an even layer over the base of a 22cm-25cm ovenproof cast-iron pan or deep pudding dish. Sprinkle over 75g of the soft brown sugar, then lay the 12 pear quarters cut side down in a spiral on top (you may need to trim the tops to make them sit neatly). Scatter over the chopped rosemary, then bake for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, cream the remaining butter with the remaining soft brown sugar and 100g of the caster sugar until thick and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, then add the salt and gently fold in the sieved self-raising flour.Spread out the pear peelings on a baking tray. Add one and a half teaspoons of the oil and the remaining 5g caster sugar, and toss with your hands to coat.Remove the pudding dish from the oven and turn down the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Bake the sugared peelings for 20-30 minutes, moving them around occasionally, until crisp.Brush the sides of the pudding dish with a little of the remaining vegetable oil. Spoon the cake batter on top of the caramelised pears and smooth the surface. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.To serve, while the pudding is still warm, gently shake the dish to loosen it from the sides. Invert a large plate on top, then flip the whole thing over and lift off the pudding dish so the pears are now on top. Spoon any caramel left in the dish all over the pudding, scatter with the crisp pear skins, then serve with lashings of custard, cream and/or ice-cream.Chantelle Nicholson is chef/patron ofApricity, London W1Explore more on these topicsFoodChristmasChristmas food and drinkCheeseBakingPastrySnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

Over the lastyear, our relationship has becomestrained, and it feelsas if we’ve grown apart.Nowit feelsas if we aren’t friends, let alone partners. This is complicated by our work shifts. Despite now living together, we still barely seeeach other.We’re both keento figure things out, but feel very unclear about howtostay together. When our relationship works it’sphenomenal, and Imiss the easy companionship, love and sense of adventurethat nowseem to be missing.Any advice to help us move forward together would be greatly appreciated.My first question was: what’s making you want to stay? I wonder if the relationship has run its course, but the time apart has made you feel that now you’re back together you have to make it work? You say it’s phenomenal when it works, but how long ago was that?Psychoanalytic psychotherapist and relationship expert (and author of a great book called Tell Me The Truth About Love) Susanna Abse’s first thought was that “it’s extremely challenging for couples to be in a long-distance relationship. Unless people have a strong emotional need to keep their sense of separateness and autonomy [and some people do], then separations are usually experienced as painful and disruptive, and over time can lead to a lessening of the attachment bond between a couple.”Longed-for reunions between romantic partners often end in a row, because the person who’s been left behind is not ready emotionally to reconnectAbse went on to explain that “just as children display strong reactions to separations from their parents, couples frequently do too. Children who are securely attached to their parents protest in the face of separation and can turn away angrily when the parent returns. Parents can feel hurt by their children’s reaction, but hopefully respond by coaxing them into becoming close again. But between two adults it can be more complicated.”This is when anger and arguments come into play. “In my experience,” continues Abse, “longed-for reunions between romantic partners often end in a row, because the person who’s been left behind is not ready emotionally to reconnect, and the person who left becomes hugely disappointed at not being greeted with unalloyed joy! Although rows can feel challenging, they can also offer the opportunity to work through feelings, but instead of rowing, some couples repress their feelings and withdraw.”I want be a single mum, but feel envious of peers with partners | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead moreAbse felt you may be in the latter category: “To reconnect, you would have to step back into your relationship, acknowledging that it matters and exploring together how the separations really felt to you both. Perhaps you’ve both used your work as a refuge, which isn’t conducive to a close, committed relationship.”The last few years sound very intense professionally. I wonder if you both need to find some stability – regardless of being in a relationship – to acclimatise to where you’re at. I also wonder how balanced your relationship has been, when you were living together, during your separation and now. Did one of you compromise more or hold more of the power? Even now, in this disconnected period, you must have episodes where you get on better. When and where is this?Abse thought you’d benefit from a holiday together to “see how you feel if you make space for this relationship. You might discover what underlies your unspoken ‘decisions’ not to make your relationship your priority.”I think a holiday, or at least some time on neutral ground, would help you see what’s left of your relationship and what you want to save. I had an image of two people who are professionally very driven, but working in opposite directions personally. Somecouples therapycould help to tease out what you both really want, and if that does, indeed, involve each other.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Mum brandished a knife – would whole-family therapy save our Christmas?Isabelle AronSun 21 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 05.46 ESTShareBeforeyou see them …Plan breaks in your scheduleSpending time with difficult family members requires careful planning, says Katie Rose, a therapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and the founder ofTherapEast. “If you’re going to stay with somebody for three or four days, find ways to politely give yourself a break. Go for lunch with friends who live locally, or book a ticket to a museum or a National Trust place so that you have ways of getting yourself out of the house.” Tamara Hoyton, a senior practitioner forRelateatFamily Action, agrees that scheduling breaks is a good strategy. “Arrange a trip out, or offer to cook so that you’re away from the living room where everyone else is,” she says.Practise staying grounded“If we are coping with difficult situations and conversations, it’s important to stay grounded and present, so that our thoughts and feelings don’t spiral,” says BACP-registered counsellorGeorgina Sturmer. Practise grounding exercises in advance, so you can use them in tricky moments. Sturmer recommends the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. “Notice five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste,” she says. “This helps us connect to the environment that we’re in, so we’re more present and less anxious.”Prepare safe topics of conversation (and ones to avoid)From politics to parenting styles, there are all kinds of things you might not want to get into with certain family members. Determine what these are and come up with some non-contentious alternatives. You could even prepare some phrases to say if you’re uncomfortable, says Lucy Blake, the author ofHome Truths: The Facts and Fictions of Family Life and a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of the West of England, whose research focuses on family relationships. “Think about some likely scenarios and ways you could respond,” says Blake. You could try to redirect the conversation and move it on, or say things like, “I find this a difficult topic to talk about”, she suggests. Thinking ahead is key, agrees Rose. “Notice what the difficult conversations are. When you can spot the trap, it’s easier to avoid it,” she says.Bring a silly gameCome armed with distractions, like group activities or games. But choose carefully – now is not the time for potentially controversial games like Cards Against Humanity. “Bring something innocuous or ridiculous to distract people, like trivia cards, a game or some music you want to share,” says Hoyton.Remind yourself what typical actually is. Most people don’t have close, warm and supportive relationshipsGather your support networkAt some point, you’ll probably need to vent about your family. Work out who you can lean on, which Blake describes as “gathering your troops”. This could be one person who understands your situation, or a WhatsApp chat with a group of friends – anything to “wrap as much kindness around you as you can”, says Blake. Also, think about who your allies are at the family gathering. “Have a code word for when you’re struggling,” suggests Hoyton. “So if you say, ‘Have we got any bourbon biscuits?’, you’re trying to say, ‘Can you get me out of the room?’”Fill up your cupPlan some simple self-care activities that will make you feel good ahead of fraught interactions. Think about “how you can create some joy for yourself”, says Blake, whether that’s making your favourite meals or having a stack of great books to read. Rose echoes this and suggests eating nourishing food, limiting alcohol and getting outside for a walk or run, so that you “come into this situation feeling good about yourself”.Manage your expectations“When researchers look at the different qualities of a relationship,” says Blake, “fewer than a quarter of people have those relationships we think of as the ideal – close, warm and supportive. There can be comfort in reminding yourself of what typical actually is.” Look back on previous interactions to “build realistic predictions” of what to expect – think about how you felt last time, what came up and what the trigger points were. According to Hoyton, we place greater expectations on family members than on friends, and should keep things realistic. “Accept that there are limitations in terms of how you get on with that person. Once you’ve made peace with that, your interactions will be different,” she says.Considerthe best-case scenarioIf you’re dealing with relatives who you often argue with or who have opposing views to you, it can feel hard to set that aside. Hoyton suggests asking yourself: what do you want out of this? “Is it more important to try to change them, or do you just want to maintain family relations? You might not like them, but at least you’ll get through it.” Visualisations can be powerful, too, says Hoyton. Instead of thinking about things going wrong, visualise the situation in a positive way.Dig into your feelingsTake some time to reflect on why you find these interactions difficult. “No one wants to spend time with someone who is vindictive, aggressive or judgmental, but when you’re thinking about this person, notice what comes up for you,” says Sturmer. “Those feelings might be anger, frustration, anxiety or embarrassment. Be curious about why they are there. Are they based in the present or the past? Are they rational?” This kind of reflective thinking can provide some perspective, suggests Sturmer. “Once we develop this type of self‑awareness, it can become much easier to understand – and sometimes challenge – our responses.”On the big day …View image in fullscreenLet them do the talkingWhen talking to a tricky relative, consider their interests. “Think about what will appeal to them in order to diffuse the situation,” says Hoyton. You could ask about a holiday they’ve been on, or their new job. “You might not be remotely interested, so zone out by all means, but let them speak,” says Hoyton. Asking open questions will allow the other person to take the lead, advises Sturmer. “A simple ‘What’s new with you?’ or, ‘What have you been up to since we last got together?’ are the easiest ways to start. Responses like, ‘Tell me more about that’ or ‘How did you end up doing that?’ should keep the conversation flowing.”Take deep breaths“It seems maddeningly simple but breathing can make a difference, and the research around it is strong. For example, marines are trained to go into box breathing to change their physiology quickly,” says Blake. Box breathing involves four steps, and you count to four for each one: inhale through your nose, hold your breath, exhale through your nose and then hold your breath. Sturmer is a fan of five‑finger breathing: “Use the index finger of one hand to trace up and down each finger of the other hand, inhaling slowly as you travel up, and exhaling as you move down.”If you feel things getting heated, find a reason to move away, like going to the bathroom or putting the kettle onRate your feelingsWhen things get tense or you can feel your anxiety levels rocketing, Hoyton advises thinking about how you’re feeling on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being “I’m going to scream” and one being “I’m really laid back”. “Check in with yourself,” she says. “If it’s at a seven, think about what will get you to a six or a five. What do you need to do? Is it breathing? A distraction? Fresh air? All of those things are legitimate requests.”Employ exit strategiesSometimes the best way of avoiding conflict or stress is to remove yourself from the situation. “Make up a friend that’s going to call you, so you can say: ‘Oh, I just remembered, I’m supposed to speak to Hannah,’” says Hoyton. Rose also recommends thinking about ways to “politely extricate yourself from situations”. She adds: “If you feel things getting heated, find a reason to move away, like going to the bathroom or putting the kettle on. Give yourself a bit of space to calm down.” Apps like Calm and Headspace can be handy in these moments, for quick meditations and breathing exercises. “If you avoid the argument, then you don’t get into a situation where everybody’s wound up,” says Rose.Acknowledge your feelingsIf you’re feeling angry or upset during a family gathering, try to practise self-compassion, says Blake. “Appreciate that these moments of anger, hurt, disconnection or isolation are common in family relationships, so let’s not shame ourselves for having them.” She recommends looking up Dr Kristin Neff, who specialises in self‑compassion andhas a websitewith various resources. “She has exercises where you place your hand on your heart, give yourself a reassuring, affirmative, gentle touch, and say things like: ‘This is a moment of struggle, and this is a common struggle.’ It can be helpful.”After it’s all over …View image in fullscreenWrite it downAfter a fraught few days with family, you might find you can’t stop thinking about how things went. In these moments, it can help to put pen to paper. “If something evokes anxiety in us, we can keep chewing it over and become obsessive. When you write it down, it’s a way of getting it out of your head. What did you experience? What were the feelings? What helped you?” says Hoyton. Sturmer agrees. “There’s a lot of evidence to show that articulating our feelings in a journal can help us to feel less anxious,” she says.Try therapyIf you’re reeling from the time spent with your family, or you feel you keep repeating the same patterns with them, therapy might help. “Therapy offers a space where you can get to grips with how you feel and how you respond to other people, without fear of judgment,” says Sturmer. “I’m always keen to get to the roots of why we feel the way that we do, to notice why we respond to certain people or situations in certain ways, where these feelings come from, and what it might be like for things to be different.” This could be short-term therapy or a single session, says Rose. “Even a short amount of time spent talking things through can be helpful.”Lean into the things that make you feel good. Connect with your troops – those people with whom you feel safeReflect on your roleOnce the dust has settled, it might be worth digging into exactly what happened and what your role was. “If you’ve stormed into a family environment and created a fuss, sometimes it is about apologising and recognising where you’ve gone wrong, or your part in this interaction,” says Rose. It could be that there was nothing you could do to make things better – in which case, acknowledge that too: “Sometimes, family members are just difficult. Recognise that nothing you do will change the situation, and focus on what you can control, which is your own actions.”Recharge and relax“Lean into the things that make you feel good and like yourself,” says Blake. “Connect with your troops – those people with whom you feel safe.” Blake suggests being very intentional with how you spend the days afterwards, whether that’s making plans to speak to people on the phone or see them in person, or getting back into your regular routine and doing hobbies you enjoy. “Seek out the people and places that make your nervous system feel relaxed,” she says.Explore more on these topicsChristmasFamilyParents and parentingSiblingsHealth & wellbeingMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Aged eight, I devised a cunning plan to catch him in the act, involving a booby trap and a camera. Unfortunately, the joke was on me …Mike WozniakSun 21 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareIt was Christmas Eve, 1987. The cold war was beginning to emit its last frosty guffs, Thatcher hadset her sights on gay children, and Michael Fish waskeeping his head down. In England’s deep south, my sister and I conspired in our bedroom. We are twins: she got the brains; I, being the eldest by a full six minutes, was to inherit the estates and titles, except there were none because my idealistic pinko parents had spent their working lives in public service.Earlier in the year, my sister had attempted to prove the existence of God. Worried about the health of her pet rabbit, Wodger, she penned him a letter pleading for help, with a rather clever “Please tick if you have read this” box at the end.It seemed foolproof – but it turns out God ain’t no fool. By morning, the entire letter had simply vanished. Despite the failure of her ruse, I felt inspired and decided on a target of my own: FatherChristmas. I was to prove him real. Satisfied that my aim was catch-and-release only, not trophy hunting, my sister supported my plan.Aged eight, I was the proud owner of a robust and battle-tested whoopee cushion. I intended to place it at the bottom of my stocking, which would be hung at the end of my bed (top bunk – privilege of the first born). I needn’t even try to stay awake, since the moment the first satsuma plunged to the bottom of the stocking, I’d be whoopeed conscious and ready to photograph Father Christmas, red-gloved. Proof of Santa. My camera of choice: a bright red Fisher-Price View-Master. It wasn’t technically a camera but it looked the part and enabled the operator to spool through pictures of the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty and the BT Tower. I felt confident that Father Christmas’s image would magically find its way into one of these photographs – perhaps feeding a glazed carrot to Blitzen in the Butlin’s Top of the Tower revolving restaurant. I slept the sleep of the complacent.When I awoke, however, it was not to the sound of a whoopee trump but a thunk and a word I had only ever heard once before, when my father sliced the top of his finger off fixing the lawnmower. Was Father Christmas secretly potty-mouthed? In the commotion, I’d completely forgotten that my sister and I had also devised a backup booby trap – a Teddy Ruxpin toy balanced atop our bedroom door, batteries included. I panicked that I had been caught not sleeping, in direct contravention of the Christmas contract. My courage gone, I forgot all about my Pulitzer prize-winning snap and buried my face in my pillow.Worst case scenarios hurtled through my mind: if I was caught awake, would my place on the present list be nullified? And if so, would my sister share her new toys? I had only recently watched Raiders of the Lost Ark – if I saw something no mortal boy should see, would a stumbled-upon Father Christmas melt my face off?Eyes still scrunched shut against my pillow, I heard a quiet rustling at the end of the bed – the unmistakable sound of satsuma against wool. I also detected a faint whiff of Hamlet cigars. Could it be that Father Christmas smoked the same brand as my father? If they had anything more in common I would have to assume that they … had been school contemporaries? I considered getting on Father Christmas’s case about the dangers of smoking but then figured the man works hard and this must be the most stressful night of the year, so I cut him some slack. Once I was sure he’d gone, I waited for five excruciating minutes and then hollered with all my might: “He’s been!”I swung out of bed and, as my foot met the first step of the ladder, I felt and heard the whoopee cushion sing its sassy song. Not only had I failed to outsmart Father Christmas, he had turned the tables on me.When I relayed this to my parents, my mother seemed disproportionately cross with Father Christmas, promising to give him an earful for leaving a whoopee cushion in such a high-risk location. I asked her not to bother. I was freaked out. My close encounter hadn’t been as triumphant as I had hoped, but it was still unsettling. As my sister fed Teddy Ruxpin a segment of satsuma, she wisely suggested that, from this point on, we no longer mess with the Other.Mike Wozniak is on tour with his new show The Bench from 18 January to 12 November 2026; details atmrmikewozniak.com.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I need money. It’s an emergency’: your child’s voicemail that could be a scamSteps to help combat fraud in which criminals use AI-generated replica of a person’s voice to deceive victimsShane HickeySun 21 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 02.02 ESTShareThe voicemail from your son is alarming. He has just been in a car accident and is highly stressed. He needs money urgently, although it is not clear why, and he gives you some bank details for a transfer.You consider yourself wise to other scams, and have ignoredtexts claiming to be from himand asking for cash. But you can hear his voice and he is clearly in trouble.However, the voicemail is the latest way in which criminals are using technology to defraud people. By taking a tiny snippet of real audio – just three seconds is enough – from a person, they can “clone” the individual’s voice using freely available AI technology. From there, they can make an recording of the synthesised voice saying exactly what they want.The criminals can record a voice from videos on social media or by calling someone and saying nothing. A victim just needs to respond with words such as “hello, who is there?” to give them material for their hoax.Oliver Devane, a senior researcher at the online security company McAfee, says this is a sophisticated example of spear phishing, or a personalised, targeted attack.“Having tested some of the free and paid AI voice cloning tools online, we found in one instance, that just three seconds of audio was needed to produce a good match,” he says.“Cybercriminals will often source this information from public social media profiles and other places online where people post about themselves, their families, their travels, and so on in an attempt to cash in.“The cybercriminal is betting on a loved one or family member becoming worried, letting emotions take over, and sending money to help.”What the scam looks likeA phone call or a voicemail, or even a voice note, will come through on your mobile and sound exactly like a loved one or friend.They will have been involved in an accident or they may have been robbed or injured. They will be distressed and there will be a sense of urgency.Whatever the circumstances, they will ask for money. They may not give details of why they need the money but they will say it is urgent. They may ask you to transfer it to an account that belongs to someone else.What to doAs with many scams, if you get a call or voicemail that asks for money, take a moment to stop and think. Does it really sound like the person you know? Are there strange speech patterns that are not accounted for by the fact that there is an emergency.Even if the phone number comes up as coming from one of your children, this is no assurance as the number can also be faked.“Try to remain level-headed and pause before you take any next steps,” says Devane. “Remember that cybercriminals are betting on emotions running high. They will play on your connection to the loved one and create a sense of urgency to prompt you into action.”Call the person who it seems left the message. They may pick up and be able to reassure you that they are OK. Remember the message has come by phone, so even if there is a real emergency they clearly can reach their device and get a signal.To prepare for the possibility of such scams, you can set up a codeword between you and your children so you know for sure when they are in trouble.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsCybercrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to give Minecoins, V-Bucks, Robux and othersShane HickeySun 21 Dec 2025 03.41 ESTFirst published on Sat 20 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTShareWhile cash or a voucher to spend at a local shop used to be a welcome gift, nowadays many young gamers would rather receive virtual currencies under the tree.V-Bucks, Minecoins, Robux and FC Points are some of the most popular in-game currencies that players use to unlock different features within popular titles – from “skins” to personalise your player to new buildings to style your online world.ThisChristmasweek, retailers expect to see many shoppers pick up cards loaded with virtual currencies as last-minute gifts and stocking fillers for kids.Yet in-game currencies can be perplexing to the parents and relatives being asked for them.So if your child is asking Santa for Robux, or a gift card loaded with FC Points, here is what you need to know.The basicsIn order to keep players engaged, developers introduce new items, features or power-ups that personalise a player’s game, and they can be bought using the in-game currency.Gems, tokens, points … the currencies have different names but most work in a similar way. They are typically available to earn within the game but can also be bought.It will usually take a significant period of time to build up the amount that you can buy instantly with a few clicks. With most games, you don’t get a competitive advantage by spending more – instead, money is usually spent on what your avatar looks like.Andy Robertson, the founder of Family Gaming Database, a site that aims to help parents understand gaming, says: “Like the desire for the latest trainers when I was at school, having new outfits or appearances for your character in online games is a popular driver of purchases.”As with real-world currencies, how much you get for £1 varies depending on the game and sometimes on how you buy it.While you can buy 1,000 V-Bucks for £6.99 for Fortnite, for roughly the same price, you get 1,720 Minecoins forMinecraft. And a fiver will buy you 500 Robux for Roblox.View image in fullscreenA fiver will buy you 500 Robux for Roblox.Photograph: RobloxCurrency values can fluctuate, so an add-on or an item in a game may increase in cost or the currency may become more expensive over time, says George Osborn, a consultant in the gaming industry.Buying currencyThere are two main ways to buy currency: on the device you are playing the game on or via gift cards sold in high street shops.These cards, virtual and physical, are sold by the sterling amount – for example, £10 or £20 – or by the amount of in-game currency they give you.It is worth shopping around, as prices can vary a lot. For example, when we looked, a digital gift card of 1,720 Minecoins cost £8.49 at Argos but £5.99 at the online gaming store Loaded.If you are playing the game on a console, you will be able to buy currency through the “storefront” or the digital market on the machine – for example, the Nintendo eShop or the PlayStation Store. Often you can buy through the game itself. Payment will be taken via the method (such as debit or credit card) that is connected to the account.Some games platforms, as well as consoles, have settings that can be changed to ensure that children cannot do this without the cardholder’s permission. The not-for-profitInternet Matterssite has a directory of how to limit controls on whatever way your child games.Buying the currency on a gift card is an easy way to limit how much your child can spend. An Argos spokesperson says interest in the gift cards peaks during the week of Christmas.ProblemsThere has been concern that the differing values of each currency can create confusion about the real-world value for children, and for parents. Vicki Shotbolt, the founder of the parenting group Parent Zone, says: “It’s impossible for parents to quickly understand how much something costs when the price is presented in a virtual currency.”Campaigners say that the value of the unregulated in-game currencies can change at any time, so one item may increase in cost, or you may get fewer coins for your pound.Shotbolt says distancing real money from payments in a game is a way to make it easier for people to spend more. “Using virtual currencies is a classic way to obfuscate value, and it’s done deliberately to encourage spending that feels like gameplay,” she says.The currencies are particular to the game that a child is playing and can’t be transferred between titlesAdam Jerrett, a lecturer in games design at the University of Portsmouth, says the bundles that currencies are sold in mean that kids can often struggle to understand the real cost of them when they are bought.He adds that the amount of currency you buy often does not align neatly with the price of items available for purchase, so players can end up with “stranded currency”.The currencies are particular to the game that a child is playing and can’t be transferred between titles. And they can’t be transferred from one player to another.However, Robertson says buying the currencies can be an opportunity to learn financial literacy. “My kids have sometimes been desperate to buy something in a game that I don’t think is good value,” he says. “Letting them spend some pocket money in this way enables them to learn about value, particularly if spending here means they can’t buy other things they want this week.”Game options and exchange ratesFortniteView image in fullscreenFortnite is developed by Epic Games.Photograph: Epic GamesFortnite is free to play but players buy “skins” and various other items to personalise the game.

The rest can be found in the cosy pubs ofSheffieldand Derbyshire on winter evenings, crooned with pints in hand adjacent to roaring fires.There was a time when all carols were local, sung in only one village, or with lyrics or music varying from place to place. When church carols became standardised in the 1800s, hundreds of local carols died out. But in Sheffield, generation after generation has held on to their tradition, singing those beloved folk songs in pubs to keep them alive.That wholesome heritage is being celebrated on the stage in the Crucible theatre’s adaptation of the Charles Dickens’ AChristmasCarol. When audience members from the city and the surrounding villages watch the show, they are transported to their local pubs by the sound of carols that were once almost lost.“There’s nothing in the show that doesn’t come from the Sheffield carols to some extent,” says Matthew Malone, the composer and arranger of the production. “And we thought that was important, because it’s an aural tradition. It’s important to have the cast do everything.”The director, Elin Schofield, says that, working with a music historian, songs were collected from different pubs and incorporated into places in the show that fitted with the story of miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, who is taught compassion and kindness by a visit from three spirits.View image in fullscreenOne of the missions of the organisers of the Dungworth carol event to revive local carols that are not sung any more.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian“The aural traditions of one pub differ slightly from the aural traditions of another, so the carols have developed and augmented over time.” Sheffielders are “fiercely proud” of their tradition, she says.Nowhere is that more evident than at a carol-sing in Dungworth village hall.“People tend to learn them by osmosis,” says Dave Eyre, a folk music enthusiast who previously had a folk show on a local community radio station. He is among a group of about 100 singers who have gathered to participate on a chilly Wednesday evening, some with songbooks in hand but many, like Eyre and the generations who came before, know them by heart.There is a mix of ages, demographics and singing ability, with some people travelling from outside Sheffield to take part in the tradition. A couple come from Sweden every year to participate, Eyre says; tonight there are visitors from near Leamington Spa.Do the same people come every week? “We’re in South Yorkshire; not only do they come every week but they stand in the same place every week,” Eyre jokes.And they are very committed. “I’ve walked up here in thick snow and then back, people are that dedicated,” he adds.View image in fullscreenMany carol singers in the Dungworth village hall know the songs by heart.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianPaul Horton, one of the organisers, who has been singing the Sheffield carols “for more years than I can remember”, asks for quiet as a soloist gets ready to sing. The chatter dies down as the rest of the singers hush and the organ begins.After a verse, the crowd joins in, many sipping festive drinks as they belt out the familiar tunes.The solos are sung by the same people each year. Some solos are breathtakingly beautiful – in fact, many who come to sing are professionals – but everyone is welcome to join in at the small village hall adorned with glittering decorations and tinsel.Some carols are more folksy, especially when sung in the local dialect. One appeared to be about a woman hiding in a chest on her wedding day who gets stuck and perishes, only to be found when there is nothing left but her skeleton. Another local song, called The Miners Dream of Homem is sung only once a year, on New Year’s Day.“There are dozens we don’t sing any more,” says Eyre. “One of my missions has been to bring back songs that haven’t been sung for a long time.”Horton says the “bangers” are saved for the end – “not that they’re not all bangers!” – and the last few songs are cheerily belted out by the crowd before the doors open and they are out into the cold once again.At the Crucible, the magic of the Sheffield carols carries through to the show, its creators say.Malone says: “I’ve never experienced anything like this, as in this version, I guarantee – I’ll fight to the death about this – you won’t see a version of A Christmas Carol like this.”View image in fullscreenCarols have been collected that are local to the Sheffield area.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianSchofield adds: “It’s for this city. It’s embracing this rich, rich history. And I don’t think you can beat that at this time of year.“I’m really confident that it will really surprise and delight and raise Christmas spirits this Christmas. I think it’s going to be really quite magic.”A Christmas Carol runs at Sheffield Crucible theatre until 10 January. The Sheffield carols are held in pubs across the city every night of the week.Explore more on these topicsChristmasSheffieldTheatreEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some 50 escaped immediately afterwards, and on 7 December the government secured the release of about 100 more.A statement from President Bola Tinubu then put the number of people still being held at 115 – about 50 fewer than the initial CAN figure would suggest.It has not been made public who seized the children, or how the government secured their release.Though kidnappings for ransom are a common way for criminals and armed groups to make money, a spate of mass abductions in Nigeria has put an uncomfortable spotlight on the country’s already grim security situation.In November, assailants kidnapped two dozen Muslim schoolgirls, 38 church worshippers and a bride and her bridesmaids, with male farm workers, women and children also taken hostage.The kidnappings come as Nigeria faces a diplomatic offensive from the United States, where President Donald Trump has alleged that mass killings of Christians in the west African country amount to a “genocide”.The Nigerian government and independent analysts reject that framing, which has long been used by the Christian right in the US and Europe.The religiously diverse country of 230 million people has myriad security concerns, from jihadists in the north-east to armed “bandit” gangs in the north-west, and its multiple conflicts have seen Christians and Muslims killed.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But unanswered questions and archival silences are at the heart of the new Africa Hub atManchesterMuseum, north-west England, which is inviting people around the world to help fill the gaps.The museum holds more than 40,000 items from across Africa, many of which were traded, collected, looted or preserved during the era of theBritish empire.As a result, the names of makers, the cultural significance of objects and the people to which they once belonged are largely unknown to curators in Manchester; in many cases, only the name of the donor or the collection from which an item came is recorded.The newAfricaHub will display “beautifully crafted” items that have been in storage for years, the museum says.View image in fullscreenA view of a carved wooden figure, one of the objects at Manchester Museum.Photograph: Manchester Museum/ReutersIt is inviting visitors to the collections on Oxford Road, in the city’s university district, as well as those exploring the collections online, toshare stories about the objects’ provenance.Curators say this could lead to the restitution of items, as well as new partnerships in the African diaspora. And community collaboration has already begun. A display at the heart of Africa Hub draws on the knowledge of Manchester’s Igbo community, one of the oldest Nigerian diaspora communities in the UK.Lucy Edematie, the curator of African collections from colonial contexts at Manchester Museum, worked with the Igbo CommunityGreater Manchester(ICM) organisation to research objects and celebrate Igbo heritage.Sylvia Mgbeahurike, the vice-chairof ICM Women, said: “Some of these objects were given, some were stolen, some were taken forcefully out of conquest. It is important that we start bringing them together again. It shows inclusiveness. It shows there is strength in diversity. It shows we are one people, irrespective of our colour or where we are from.”Edematie said: “Unlike most galleries or exhibitions, which represent the culmination of years of research and collaboration, Africa Hub is the beginning. It builds on work the museum has already been doing to engage with both diasporic communities and communities in Africa but provides an opportunity to extend this even further.“It is a chance to do our thinking in public, with honesty and transparency, and to involve people in that process from the start.”The museum says the Africa Hub will be an “evolving space for reflection, dialogue and shared learning and its future direction will be shaped by public contribution”.View image in fullscreenThe objects from across Africa include animals, cultural heritage items, minerals and plants.Photograph: Manchester MuseumA spokesperson added: “We’re supposed to know everything there is to know about the collections we care for, ready to communicate the wisdom of the world through a series of carefully written object labels.“Well, sometimes the reality is slightly different. And, on this occasion, we need your help, as visitors and communities, to uncover the stories that museum records cannot tell or have suppressed.“Mostly,Africa Hubmeans being honest about what we don’t know. Manchester Museum holds over 40,000 objects from across Africa, cultural heritage items, plants, animals and minerals … much of their story remains untold.“We’re laying our lack of knowledge bare and extending an invitation to you, to come and view these collections, either in person or online, and share your own knowledge, experience and perspectives to create richer narratives.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterGreater ManchesterMuseumsBritish empireColonialismArtSculpturenewsShareReuse this content"

Germany’s humanitarianbudget of €1.05bn(£920m) for 2026 will beless than half of last year’s, with spending refocused on areas deemed a priority to Europe.“I think we are losing a consensus of solidarity and responsibility which has been established for a while now,” said Ralf Südhoff, director of the Berlin-based Centre for Humanitarian Action.“Germany this year has started to phase out Latin America, decreased engagement in Asia and say they want to focus now on crises which have an impact on Europe,” he said, noting that while Ukraine was in need of funding because of Russia’s invasion, its location in Europe meant it was saved from the cuts developing countries have experienced.The UK also announced earlier this year that it would becutting aid to fund defence spending. Norwayhas increased its civilian support to Ukraineby 2.5bn kroner (£185m), toa quarter of its aid budget, but has been accused ofmaking Africa payfor that rise with a 355m kroner cut (£26m).France’s budget for 2026will also see a€700m cut to aid spending, with a60% reduction in food aid, while increasingdefence spending by €6.7bn.“It’s a broader geopolitical trend and there’s a misleading belief by European actors that they have to play this game now in the same way as Moscow, Beijing, Washington,” said Südhoff, suggesting aid will be more “transactional” and directed to where donors see direct benefits for themselves. “The reaction now is not to fill the gap or attempt to do so but to follow the [American] cuts.”Analysis of Germany’s 2026 aid budget by Venro, a coalition of German NGOs, shows that the country is slashing funding to traditional development and poverty-reduction programmes, with a 20% cut for the World Food Programme and 33% for the Gavi vaccine alliance.One of the few elements of the budget not cut is Germany’s partnerships with the private sector in developing countries.Anita Kattakuzhy, director of policy atNear, a coalition of civil society groups in the global south, said a wider pattern is emerging among donors.“Budgets are being reshaped under political pressure, and the communities who bear the consequences have no way to shape those decisions,” said Kattakuzhy.“Cutting funding in this way may meet short-term priorities in donor capitals, but it destabilises the local systems that are keeping crises from getting worse.”Among the countries most affected by aid cuts is Mozambique, which has suffered from cyclones and droughts as well as aresurgent conflictin the country’s Cabo Delgado province that has displaced more than300,000 people since July.The countryhas received only $31m of $222m funding requiredthis year, leading to food distribution happening only every two months andcovering 39% of caloric needs, according to the UN.The cutting of development funding bySwedenwill directly hit programmes used to rehabilitate and provide healthcare and education to people displaced by the insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region, which began in 2017.All four of the African countries removed from Sweden’s development funding have seencuts for HIV/Aids services, as experts warn there will be areversal of years of progressin fighting the disease.Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Tanzania are among six countries, along with Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia – that could bear the brunt of cuts to health programmes tackling HIV/Aids,according to analysisby the Boston Consultant Group.Ilaria Manunza, country director for Save the Children Mozambique, said aid cuts have already made 2025 very difficult: “Every cut compounds the risk of long-term developmental setbacks, particularly in education and child protection,” said Manunza. “If current trends continue, 2026 will be extremely challenging … there is a real risk that progress made over the past decade could be reversed.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAid cutsAidUSAIDAfricaSwedenGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It disputed reports that Russian troops had occupied the nearby village of Ryasne. Ukraine’s rights ombudsman said Russian forces forcibly moved about 50 people from Grabovske toRussia.US intelligence believes Putin remains intent on capturing all of Ukraine and reclaiming parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet Union, Reuters reported, citing six sources familiar with US intelligence. Last week Putin called Europe’s leaders “little pigs” and said Russia would achieve its goals through diplomacy or force.However, Donald Trump’s lead negotiators, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are holding talks with Russia’s envoy Kirill Dmitriev in Miami in the belief that a peace deal may be close.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said diplomatic efforts were advancing “quite quickly” and that his negotiators in Florida had been working with the American side. The Ukrainian delegation has had separate meetings in the US with American and European diplomats.On Sunday evening, Witkoff wrote on X that the talks held between American, European and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the last three days had been “productive and constructive”.“Particular attention was given to discussing timelines and the sequencing of next steps,” he said. “Ukraine remains fully committed to achieving a just and sustainable peace. Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity.”Zelenskyy backed a US proposal for three-way talks with Washington and Moscow if it facilitated prisoner exchanges and other conditions. However, Ushakov said a proposal for three-way talks had not been seriously discussed.France has welcomed reports that Putin was open to talks with Emmanuel Macron. “As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” the French president’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”Putin extended the apparent olive branch after EU leaders on Fridayagreed to supply €90bn(£79bn) to Ukraine to shore up its economy and military campaign against Russian forces in the run-up to the fourth anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022.Ukrainian drones hit an oil rig and other facilities at Russia’s Filanovsky oilfield in the Caspian Sea, more than 700km (435 miles) from Ukraine’s nearest border, Ukraine’s military general staff said on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They are accused of taking the objects from the official Paris residence of the French president and trying to sell them on online auction websites such as Vinted.The head steward at the palace alerted authorities to the missing objects, some of which are deemed items of national heritage. The items are estimated to have a combined value of up to €40,000 (£35,000).Most of the pieces came from the Sèvres Manufactory in Paris, a famed porcelain factory that has been owned by the French state since 1759. Investigators began to question Élysée staff after factory personnel recognised some of the missing items on auction sites.The alleged thefts are an unwelcome encore to a string of robberies from the Louvre and other French museums in recent months that have raised concern about lax safeguards at the country’s cultural institutions.The role of silver steward involves storing and looking after tableware and similar items used by presidents, visiting royalty and other dignitaries. Prosecutors said inventory records made by the arrested steward gave the impression he was planning future thefts.According to investigators, the man’s Vinted account included a plate stamped “French Air Force” and ashtrays marked “Sèvres Manufactory” – items not usually available to the general public.They said they recovered about 100 objects in his home, vehicle and personal locker, including Sèvres porcelain, a René Lalique statuette, Baccarat champagne coupes and copper saucepans.The steward and his alleged accomplices appeared in court on 18 December and will be tried on 26 February. The trio were placed under judicial supervision, banned from contacting one another, prohibited from appearing at auction venues and barred from their professional activities, the Associated Press reported.The recovered items were returned to the Élysée – a happier outcome than at the Louvre, which is stillmissing crown jewels worth an estimated €88m (£77m) after a daylight raid in October. Four suspects have been arrested in relation to that case.Other French institutions targeted in recent months include Paris’s Natural History Museum and a porcelain museum in Limoges. Both were raided in September, losingsix gold nuggets worth about €1.5m(£1.3m) andChinese porcelain with an estimated combined worth of €6.55m(£5.7m) respectively.In October,around 2,000 gold and silver coins worth about €90,000(£78,000) were stolen from the Maison des Lumières (House of Enlightenment), a museum in Langres dedicated to the philosopher Denis Diderot.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Some in the cabinet would like No 10 to go further in its ambitions in order to improve the UK economy.Streeting spoke out about the EU, the economy and his own ambitionsin a wide-ranging interview with the Observer, while stressing that he was not after Keir Starmer’s job.He said a deeper economic partnership withEuropewould be the best way of increasing growth, and suggested he would like to go further than the current reset with the EU, which he described as a “good start”.UK failure to seal EU tax exemption hands industry mountain of paperworkRead more“We’ve taken a massive economic hit leaving theEuropean Union. I’m really uncomfortable with the level of taxation in this country. We’re asking a lot of individual taxpayers, we’re asking a lot of businesses. We’ve got a level of indebtedness that we need to take very seriously,” he said. “The best way for us to get more growth into our economy is a deeper trading relationship with the EU.“The reason why leaving the EU hit us so hard as a country is because of the enormous economic benefits that came with being in the single market and the customs union. This is a country and a government that wants a closer trading relationship with Europe.“The challenge is any economic partnership we have can’t lead to a return to freedom of movement.”On his own brief, Streeting said theNHSwas “coping” with resident doctors’ strikes, but he was worried about its recovery as the industrial action enters its final day.The health secretary told the Observer that the NHS was managing to get through thefive-day action by the British Medical Association doctorsin England, but he was concerned about the period afterwards as the health service struggles with flu cases.Streeting has taken a tough stance on strikes. He offered resident doctors a deal that involved more training places but no extra money,which was refused.His position has been criticised by Andrea Egan, the incoming general secretary of Unison, as an “unacceptable” approach to striking workers.Streeting said: “I think the NHS is coping. The period that worries me more is the post-strike period when we have to try and recover the service. That now falls at a time of year which is the NHS’s busiest.“I don’t think that doctors are selfish and don’t care about nurses and other healthcare professionals, but the BMA’s position can be quite hardline and uncompromising.”Streeting, who is considered a top contender to be the next Labour leader, described recent media briefings by allies of Starmer several weeks ago – amid speculation he was preparing to replace the prime minister – as a “bizarre drive-by” and questioned why anyone would want the top job.However, he appeared careful not to rule himself out, saying: “I’m diplomatically ducking the question to avoid any more of the silly soap opera we’ve had in the last few months.” Pressed on whether he thought Britain would be prepared to vote for a gay prime minister, he said: “Yes, but I want to make it explicitly clear that this is not a pitch or a job application. The prime minister’s got my absolute support.”Anna Turley, the chair of the Labour party, was pressed on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips about Starmer’s low approval ratings and she insisted he would still be prime minister next Christmas. She said it was “nonsense” that he may have to resign if local election results are bad for Labour in May and said the whole team was “united behind him”.Streeting said he and the former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner had joked about rumours that they had struck a deal to make a joint bid if there were to be a vacancy, and insisted it bore no resemblance to reality.“The last time I had a conversation with Angela was when I went up to her in the voting lobby and said, ‘I hear you’re putting together a new cabinet, I’ve always liked the idea of the Foreign Office so count me in’ and she turned around and snapped back as quick as a flash ‘oh no you’re behind the times haven’t you heard I’m going on I’m a Celebrity?’,” he says. “We had a good laugh about it because there’s so much idle gossip and tittle-tattle.”He also hinted that he held a different position on banning social media for under 16s than some others in the cabinet, including the prime minister.“We need to think much more radically about how we support young people to navigate this new online world,” he said. “[It] has been a place of bullying, intimidation, sometimes misogyny, even radicalisation. The challenge of social media is that it’s increasingly antisocial media. That’s why I think what Australia’s doing is interesting and we should follow the results closely and see if that’s something we should consider doing here.”Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingEuropean UnionTrade policyBrexitNHSDoctorsHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

There have been maritime interdictions to enforce sanctions, and the recently announcedUS blockade of sanctions-busting ships in Venezuela.Earlier this month US special forcesrappelled from helicopters to board the Skipper,a tanker off Venezuela that the US treasury had placed under sanctions in 2022 amid allegations it had been smuggling oil on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah.Loop of US special forces boarding a tanker off VenezuelaFootage shows US special forces boarding a tanker off VenezuelaMap of tankers around VenezuelaOn SaturdayUS forces apprehended a second merchant vesselcarrying oil off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, even though it does not appear to be on the list of vessels under US sanctions.The US seizures follow incidents this year where Estonia and Franceinterdicted vessels suspected of belonging to Russia’s shadow fleet, and recent attacks by Ukrainian air and sea drones on Russian shadow tankers accused of being involved in sanctions evasion.The increasingly aggressive efforts to police the shadow fleet and evidence thatRussiais willing to use military assets to protect tankers, has led experts to warn of the risk of confrontation.That was dramatically underlined on Friday when Ukraine announced ithad struck a Russian tanker with aerial dronesin neutral waters off the coast of Libya, after previous similar attacks in the Black Sea.A source in the Security Service ofUkrainesaid it was a “new, unprecedented special operation”, Kyiv’s first attack on a Russian tanker in the Mediterranean, carried out 1,200 miles (2,000km) from Ukraine’s borders.Map showing Ukrainian attacks on tankers in the Black Sea“The shadow fleet itself is not a new threat,” said Gonzalo Saiz Erausquin, a research fellow at the finance and security centre at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. “But [it] has expanded drastically after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. That saw what we call the shadow fleet explode to some 900-1,200 vessels globally.“It is not highly structured or homogeneous. These are vessels that Russian interests are able to purchase secondhand, opaquely owned tankers or owned by companies prepared to engage in illicit activity.”The shadow fleet has spawned a whole illicit network to support it, including a recent proliferation of fake flag registration websites, unscrupulous brokers and a cast of opaque companies that will facilitate the trade.View image in fullscreenThe vessel Boracay, off the coast of Saint-Nazaire in France.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersThe tanker Boracay, which was interdicted by Estonia and France earlier this year, is a case in point.It was acquired in 2020 by a so-calledbrass plate company– meaning one that exists in name only – in Seychelles called Baaj Shipping. It was blacklisted by the UK and EU for its suspected links to transporting Russian oil products, “irregular and high-risk shipping practices” and allegations of operating under a fraudulent Benin flag listing, following several other false flag listings in the Gambia and Malawi.According to Lloyd’s List, the ship – a “textbook example of deceptive shipping practices” – had also been investigated by Denmark’s intelligence services over its possible use to launch drones against Copenhagen’s airport, while operating under a different name. The ship had itself allegedly been targeted at one point with a limpet mine.Map of Boracay’s sailing routeCountries that have sought to counter the shadow fleet are forced to rely on international laws and conventions over seaworthiness, insurance and safe navigation practices to put pressure on the vessels.But an increasing international appetite for enforcement – including the Trump administration’s announcement in December that it would enforce a blockade against ships under sanctions visiting Venezuela – has brought it own risks.It is not only Washington that has indicated it is prepared to intercept shadow fleet tankers. In October, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, signalled a greater willingness from Europeans to tackle vessels in its waters.“We have decided to take a step forward by adopting policies to impede suspicious ships,” said Macron at a meeting in Copenhagen.The risks implied in such a policy were underlined by an incident involving an oil tanker known in quick succession as Jaguar, Blint and then finally as the Russian-flagged Nasledie. An attempt by the Estonian navy to intercept the vessel in the Gulf of Finland in Mayprompted an incursion by a Russian Su-35 jet into Estonian airspace.For Erausquin that suggests a more direct interest from the Kremlin in the shadow fleet, as demonstrated by Russia’s willingness to protect it.As Chris Kremidas-Courtney, a senior fellow at the European Policy Centre argued in November, the shadow fleet poses greater threats than its key role in economically sustaining Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.Kremidas-Courtney said:“Recent incidents underscore this threat. Russia-linked vessels have been implicated in drone incursions, cable disruptions and reconnaissance of critical infrastructure. The Eagle S [a suspected shadow tanker]severed undersea cables after cycling through multiple flags, and Estonia’s attempted interdiction of the Jaguar crude oil tanker prompted the scrambling of Russian fighter jets – proof that Moscow sees this fleet as a strategic asset and is willing to protect it. Europe cannot afford to let these incidents pass unanswered.”Despite the tougher language from Europe, including discussion of seeking permission to board suspect tankers, some analysts do not detect a huge appetite for maritime confrontation with Russia.“It is one thing for the US to board a sanctioned and stateless tanker off Venezuela because what is Venezuela going to do?” said one. “It feels like a very different calculation for the Europeans with Russia. It risks upping the stakes in what has become a game of chicken.”If the shadow fleet, in particular the Russian element of it, has flourished in the past three years, it is partly due to US resistance to imposing sanctions on the major Russian oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, and through the continued reliance of China and India on Russian oil.Russia has moved quickly to try to evade the US sanctions, with several new companies emerging who are suspected of exporting Rosneft and Lukoil crude.Despite the recent US sanctions, one of Russia’s most important markets for its crude appears to have been largely unaffected, despite pressure from Trump: Indian imports of Russian crude have increased since October.In part that has been because of both Russia’s adaptability to sanctions over the past three years and the complex structuring of its shadow fleet operations, mirrored by similar activities over the years by Iran and Venezuela.How Russia has operated in recent years was made clear this month in new EU sanctions announced against nine businessmen and entities, including shipping companies based in the UAE and Vietnam as well as Russia, accused of involvement in the shadow fleet.UAE-owned tankers mapTomer Raanan, a specialist reporter for Lloyd’s List who closely follows developments in the shadow fleet both in the trade in Iranian energy products and Russia, believes it remains attractive to shipowners because of the potential profits that can be earned operating the sometimes dilapidated ships.“Earlier this year, we noticed several sanctioned tankers suddenly began broadcasting AIS messages indicating that they are registered with Malawi.“We found a website purporting to be the Malawi Maritime Administration which did not have a Malawi government domain and was later confirmed by Malawi officials as fraudulent. Since then, Lloyd’s List has uncovered an elaborate fraudulent flag operation linking over 20 separate fake registry websites, many of which are using the same holding text.”Such “scam” registrations were being used by ships in the shadow fleet, he said.Raanan also believes the proliferation of fraudulent flags and falsely flagged ships highlights a critical problem with the shipping industry’s registry system.In the meantime, he expects the sanction-busting trade in oil to continue despite the efforts to police it.“Sanctioned oil is often sold at a discount, while shipowners moving these cargoes typically earn premiums for taking on the risk. I think that as long as market participants view the economic incentives as outweighing the risks, sanctions evasion will likely continue.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeCommoditiesUS foreign policyVenezuelanewsShareReuse this content"

However, Morrisons is stocking Bernard Matthews-branded turkey from Poland, and Asda is selling a Cherrywood-branded turkey crown from mainlandEurope.Lidl said a small proportion of its branded frozen turkey, sold under the Gressingham label, was sourced from the EU.More than one industry source claimed Aldi was also sourcing turkeys from Europe.The retailer was approached for comment.It is understood that non-British birds will account for less than 10% of those expected to be sold.Retailers often top up their stocks with imported birds to ensure a wide range for customers during the Christmas season, according to a spokesperson for the industry body the British Poultry Council.However, one industry source said: “Only in exceptional circumstances would we consider alternatives [to UK birds] to maintain availability for customers.”View image in fullscreenBird flu has squeezed UK supplies of Christmas birds.Photograph: Magdalena Bujak/AlamyMarks & Spencer said all its turkey was sourced from Britain or Ireland, where it also had a commitment to local sourcing. The Co-op, Sainsbury’s and Tesco said their turkey was entirely British-sourced.Matt Hood, a managing director at the Co-op, said: “We are proud to be selling 100% British turkeys this Christmas, as we work all year round to support farmers, in support of our commitment to backing Britain and to only sell British meat and poultry.“We understand the extreme pressure poultry farmers are currently facing, specifically turkey farms, where the focus is so skewed to this time of year. It is very important retailers support and invest in British farming industry to ensure it can weather the many ups and downs nature throws at it.”UK poultry producers are battling a“bad season” of avian flu, according to the British Poultry Council, with cases significantly higher than at this point last year, squeezing supplies of Christmas birds including turkeys, chickens and ducks.There have been 70 confirmed cases of bird flu across the UK less than three months into this season, the vast majority in England. That figure is close to the 81 cases recorded across the whole of the previous season, which ran from 1 October 2024 to 30 September this year.View image in fullscreenThe UK consumes more poultry than it produces domestically.Photograph: Farlap/AlamyBirdkeepers in England were ordered to houseflocks of more than 50 birds indoorsfrom 6 November. The ruling extended earlier measures covering northern, central and some parts of eastern England amid escalating outbreaks in captive and wild birds. A housing ordercame into force in Waleson 13 November.More than 5% of the UK’s Christmas poultry flock – including turkeys, ducks and chickens – representing about 300,000 birds, are thought to have been culled so far this season.Smaller retailers are likely to find it harder to source birds, or may have to raise prices to cover higher costs.British poultry farmers are not aware of widespread shortages despite the outbreak, according to Will Raw, the chair of the national poultry board at the National Farmers’ Union. The UK consumes more poultry than it produces domestically.“My heart goes out to anyone affected but we have measures in place,” said Raw, who farms broiler chickens in Yorkshire. “We have learned a lot of lessons from 2022-23 experience and we had housing measures in place a lot sooner. We have worked a lot with government to ensure not only the welfare of the birds, but that there isn’t disruption to the supply chain.”He added: “We ask customers always to look out for British or the union jack. What we produce is to the highest standards possible – the welfare and care of the birds is at the forefront of what we do.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryFarmingBirdsBird fluAnimalsWildlifeSupermarketsnewsShareReuse this content"

The latest include two that were previously evacuated during a 2005 disengagement plan.The approval by the security cabinet increases the number of settlements in the West Bank by nearly 50% during the current government’s tenure. In 2022, there were 141 settlements across the West Bank. After the latest approval there are 210, according to Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog group.Settlements are considered illegal under international law.The approval comes as the US pushesIsraeland Hamas to move ahead with the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October. The US-brokered plan calls for a possible “pathway” to a Palestinian state, something the settlements are aimed at preventing.The volunteers putting their bodies between Israel settlers and a Palestinian villageRead moreThe cabinet decision included a retroactive legalisation of some previously established settlement outposts or neighbourhoods of existing settlements, and the creation of settlements on land where Palestinians had been evacuated, the finance ministry said. Settlements can range in size from a single dwelling to a collection of high-rises.The ministry said two of the settlements legalised in the latest approval were Kadim and Ganim, which were two of the four West Bank settlements dismantled in 2005 as part of Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. There have been multiple attempts to resettle them after Israel’s government in March 2023 repealed a 2005 act that evacuated the four outposts and barred Israelis from re-entering the areas.Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza – areas claimed by the Palestinians for a future state – in the 1967 war. It has settled more than 500,000 Jews in the West Bank, in addition to more than 200,000 in contested East Jerusalem.Israel’s government is dominated by far-right proponents of the settler movement, including Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the security minister.Settler expansion has been compounded by a surge of attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank in recent months. During October’s olive harvest, settlers across the territory launched an average of eight attacks each day, the most since the UN humanitarian office began collecting data in 2006.The attacks continued in November, with the UN recording at least 136 more by 24 November.Settlers burned cars, desecrated mosques, ransacked industrial plants and destroyed cropland. Israeli authorities have done little beyond issuing occasional condemnations of the violence.The Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah said two Palestinians, including a 16-year-old, were killed in clashes with Israel’s military on Saturday night in the northern part of the West Bank.Israel’s military said a militant was shot and killed after he threw a block at troops in Qabatiya, and that another militant was killed after he hurled explosives at troops operating in the village of Silat al-Harithiya.The Palestinian health ministry identified the Palestinian killed in Qabatiya as 16-year-old Rayan Abu Muallah. Palestinian media aired brief security footage of the incident, where the youth appears to emerge from an alley and is shot by troops as he approaches them without throwing anything. Israel’s military said the incident was under review.The health ministry identified the second man as Ahmad Ziyoud, 22.Israel’s military has scaled up military operations in the West Bank since the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack that triggered the war in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsPalestineWest BankIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But development campaigners warned at the time that the burden on Sri Lankan taxpayers remained unsustainable.Before the cyclone hit, annual repayments were expected to total 25% of government revenues – a high level by international and historical standards.‘Not normal’: Climate crisis supercharged deadly monsoon floods in AsiaRead moreIn a statement, the group of 120 global experts called for fresh debt restructuring to restore the country’s repayments to a manageable level, given the scale of environmental destruction.Alongside Stiglitz, the signatories include Jayati Ghosh, a renowned Indian development economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US, the inequality expert Thomas Piketty, the former Argentinian economy minister Martín Guzmán, and Kate Raworth, the author of DoughnutEconomics, a widely read book about capitalism and the environment.“Sri Lanka is now confronting a severe economic shock triggered by the recent cyclone, extensive flooding and landslides, which has inflicted extensive damage to infrastructure, livelihoods, and key sectors of the economy,” they said.“This environmental emergency is poised to absorb – and potentially exceed – the extremely limited fiscal space created by the current debt restructuring package. Additional external debt is already being taken on from the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)], and more lending to deal with the impacts of the disaster is likely.”They called for the “immediate suspension of Sri Lanka’s external sovereign debt payments, and a new restructuring that restores debt sustainability under the new circumstances”.Research by the campaign group Debt Justice found that after the 2024 debt restructuring deal, which involved some investors accepting a “haircut” on expected repayments, private sector creditors were still on course to make 40% more profit lending to Sri Lanka than to the US government.Since the cyclone hit last month, the Sri Lankan government hasasked for a $200m emergency loan from the (IMFto help it through the immediate crisis, but disbursements under this “rapid financing instrument” are usually expected to be repaid within three to five years.Scientists at World Weather Attribution, a coalition of climate experts, found thatglobal heating was likely to have exacerbated the severityof Sri Lanka’s flooding, as well as that of other Asian countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, that have also been badly affected in recent weeks.A UK government spokesperson said it recognised the devastating impacts of Cyclone Ditwah on the people of Sri Lanka. “This is why we are committed to supporting Sri Lanka’s recovery through humanitarian assistance and international coordination. We have already provided £1m of humanitarian support via the Red Cross, UN partners and civil society organisations to deliver emergency supplies and life-saving care.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsDebt reliefSri LankaExtreme weatherSouth and central AsiaNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump praised the decision by the broadcaster ABC. It came after pressure from the White House on the broadcaster and its owner, Disney.But the move sparked a backlash from viewers, fellow late-night TV hosts and free-speech campaigners, which led toKimmel being put back on airdays later.In his alternative Christmas message, Kimmel is expected to pay tribute to those who criticised his suspension. AChannel 4insider said: “He says the reason that he is back on air is because people spoke out and people protested.”On his show last week, in afinal monologue of the year, Kimmel also praised viewers. He said: “On behalf of all of us at the show, I just want to say that we appreciate your support, your enthusiasm, and not just for watching. This year, you literally pulled us out of a hole and we cannot thank you enough.”He also spoke of the importance of reminding the rest of the world about the internal dissent against the Trump administration. He said: “It’s important that we as Americans let our friends in other countries … know that a lot of us are not OK with what is happening.“There is still much more good in this country than bad, and we hope that you will bear with us during this extended psychotic episode that we’re in the middle of.”Kimmel’s alternative Christmas message will be broadcast on Christmas Day at 5.45pm, less than two hours after the king’s Christmas message.A Channel 4 spokesperson said: “Donald Trump’s return to the White House and wide-ranging impact on the world has been the story of 2025 and it would be hard to think of a better person to address it than Jimmy Kimmel, who has found himself on the frontline of America’s battle over free speech.”Channel 4 has been broadcasting often provocative alternative Christmas speeches for more than 30 years. Speakers have included the former president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the whistleblower Edward Snowden, the cartoon character Marge Simpson and the late self-styled high priest of camp Quentin Crisp.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelChannel 4Television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The two are the latest of eight prisoners who have been admitted to hospital since the hunger strike action began on Balfour day, 2 November, according to Prisoners for Palestine.Gib was provided with a wheelchair on Friday and taken to hospital on Saturday.The prisoner-led collective in Britain said hunger strikers will die unless there is urgent government intervention. “They are in the custody of the state and any harm that comes to them is a deliberate outcome of the government’s negligence and the politicisation of their detention,” the collective said.MPs have written to the government expressing concerns over the delay in medical assistance and limited communication with families. Lawyers representing prisoners have criticised the justice secretary, David Lammy, for refusing to meet them.A friend of Gib’s and next of kin, Jessica Dolliver, was due to visit Gib in prison on Sunday morning, when a call came from the prison. “I just wasn’t surprised because I could see that Amu was deteriorating and I could also hear on the phone,” said Dolliver, 28.On Friday Gibwrote in the Guardianof their solidarity with Palestinians.It is understood Gib is on remand on suspicion of being involved in the break-in at Brize Norton airbase in June, when two military aircraft were defaced with spray paint.Gib is one of three prisoners, along with Qesser Zuhrah and Jon Cink, who has been admitted to hospital.A HMP Bronzefield spokesperson said: “We cannot provide information about specific individuals. However, we can confirm that all prisoners have full access to healthcare, including attendance at external medical facilities if needed.“Any prisoner refusing food receives regular medical assessment and support from clinicians, as well as being offered mental health support.”The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is Gib’s MP and has visited the 30-year-old in detention, on Sunday wrote a letter to the prisons inspectorate raising concerns over “inconsistent and unreliable” health treatment to those on hunger strike.The letter was also signed by MPs John McDonnell and Barry Gardiner. “We are dismayed to learn that, as they near their eighth week on hunger strike, their treatment remains inconsistent and unreliable,” the letter says.Last week, Corbyn and more than 50 MPs urged Lammy to meet the lawyers of those on hunger strike. “Our inquiries have either gone unanswered or, when answered have been vague reassurances that all policies and guidelines are being followed. However, we continue to hear from the prisoners and their loved ones daily that this is not the case,” the letter said.The prisons minister, Lord Timpson, has previously said the service is “very experienced” at dealing with hunger strikes and has “robust and working” systems in place and the Prison Service “will not be meeting” any prisoners or their representatives.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Poor visibility and less daylight have also been cited as factors influencing the crossings.The most arrivals recorded in December was 3,254 in 2024; 2,163 people have arrived so far this month.The arrivals on Saturday bring the total number of people who have crossed the Channel this year to 41,455. The record annual total was 45,755 in 2022.The data showed 803 people across 13 dinghies from northernFrancehad made the journey from overnight on Friday into Saturday, the largest number since 8 October when 1,075 crossed in a day.A Border Force vessel was seen on Saturday morning bringing people into Dover,Kent. The previous night, a number of boats were witnessed leaving the shores of France.The French maritime prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said 151 people had been rescued by authorities over the weekend and taken back to French shores.The UK government has said it is continuing efforts to grasp the “upstream” causes of the migration crisis, including through work with neighbouring countries.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The number of small boat crossings is shameful and the British people deserve better. This government is taking action. We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally, and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.”France recently indicated it planned tohalt small boats at seabefore they pick people up heading for the UK, after pressure from Keir Starmer.Germany passed a law this week that could see people smugglers face up to 10 years in prison for trying to bring individuals to the UK. The law, which will come into force before the end of the year, aims to give more powers to law enforcement and prosecutors, and to boost information sharing between the UK and Germany.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumKentEnglandHome OfficeFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Her detention comes amid a broader immigration crackdown under theTrump administration, including cases involving individuals with no criminal records who are seeking legal residency.Palacios, 22, toldNola.comthat she was denied release on bond and may be forced to voluntarily return to Honduras, the country she left with her parents at age six, while continuing to wait for a decision on her immigration case.‘We’re back at stage one’: Trump cuts rock Louisiana town plagued by gun violenceRead more“The only thing now that I want is my freedom back,” Palacios told the outlet. “I don’t want to be enclosed in a space where everything is controlled. I have no power to do anything. I feel hopeless all the time. And nothing is moving to help me.”Palacios said she applied for asylum as a child. She had previously been granted a work permit and had requested another when she was arrested in June. She does not have any criminal convictions.According to Palacios, ICE agents arrested her on 26 June while she was attempting to obtain a routine vehicle inspection sticker. She said an unmarked vehicle pulled up behind her and agents approached and informed her that she was under arrest. Palacios said she did not know that her immigration case had been returned to the active docket.She immediately sent two text messages to a former nursing school classmate, stating that she had been detained and was speaking with her lawyer. Her phone was taken shortly afterward.Palacios said she has experienced emotional exhaustion during her months at the ICE processing center, adding that she does not have access to her personal belongings and spends her time in a shared dormitory with other detainees.US immigration crackdown forces teens to caretake after parents are detainedRead moreShe also reported difficulties obtainingbasic hygiene items, including shampoo and menstrual products.

She will receive full due process. To be clear, work authorization does not confer legal status.”In a separate statement to Nola, DHS disputed claims about conditions at the detention facility. “This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” the statement said.Family and immigration advocates have held protests calling for Palacios’ release, pointing to her involvement in the community and her commitment to nursing at a time of nationalworkforce shortages.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationLouisianaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its unexplained removal on Saturday triggered a chorus of accusations from Democrats about evident political interference in favor of the president, aformer friendof Epstein.“Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review,”the department said on X.“After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.”Sister of Epstein victim reported him in 1996, but FBI failed to investigate, files revealRead moreEarlier on Sunday, deputy US attorney general Todd Blanche saidthat removing photos from Friday’s Epstein files release, including one of Trump, has “nothing to do” with the president – and maintained the images would likely go back up after it is determined whether they need redactions.Blanche said the 16 removals came at the request of victim advocacy groups. “We don’t have perfect information,” Blanchetold NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday.“And so when, when we hear from victims-rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate.”As Blanche put it, an investigation into the photos was ongoing, and they “will go back up,” with the only question being “whether there will be redactions”.Victims rights advocate Gloria Allredtold CNNon Saturday that the “system has failed the survivors”, including with the release of files that may have been “under-redacted”.“I saw a number of survivors’ names which should never have been published, because the whole point is to protect the survivors,” she told the outlet.“The other concern I have also has to do with the images of some of the potential victims and survivors, that some of those images were not redacted, should have been redacted, and in some cases, the images may be of women unclothed. And that is completely unacceptable”.In a letter to the justice department on Sunday, one Epstein victim who had reported the sex offender to the FBI in 2009 said their name had been wrongly exposed in the DoJ document dump, but she had not been allowed to view her FBI file previously.“The contradiction is extraordinary,” the victim wrote in a redacted letterposted to X. “The DOJ asserts that my own file requires prolonged review to determine whether redactions are appropriate – yet it had no difficulty publicly releasing my identity in a mass disclosure.”Blanche’s and Allred’s comments came as theTrump administrationfaced criticism over its handling of Friday’s partial release when a complete one had been required by congressional act.The release of justice department files related to Epstein – who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor and died while awaiting sex-trafficking charges – otherwise dominated the Sunday talkshows. Democrat officials claimed the government had fallen short of its legal obligation to release the investigative documents in full.“This initial documents release is inadequate,” said House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, on ABC’s This Week. “It falls short of what the law requires.”The DoJ failed to comply with Epstein files law. Can Congress do anything?Read moreJeffries argued that legal statutes require the justice department “to provide a written explanation to Congress and to the American people as to why they’ve withheld certain documents” within 15 days.The comments come after California representative Ro Khanna, Jeffries’ fellow House Democrat, said there should be impeachment proceedings against attorney general Pam Bondi for the failure to release the Epstein documents in full by 19 December. That date was set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act co-authored by Khanna.On Sunday, Blanche argued the government did not have time to review all the files to make redactions needed to protect victims.“It’s very simple and very clear,” Blanche said. “The statute also requires us to protect victims. And so the reason why we are still reviewing documents and still continuing our process is simply that – to protect the victims.“So the same individuals that are out there complaining about the lack of documents that were produced on Friday are the same individuals who apparently don’t want us to protect victims,” he added.View image in fullscreenA photo released by the Department of Justice as part of the Epstein disclosure included images of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul on a desk.Photograph: Department of JusticeImages removed from the DoJ disclosures page on Saturday included a photograph of Epstein’s desk in his New York mansion in which two photographs of Trump were visible. The images were also removed from downloadable folders.“This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includesDonald Trumphas apparently now been removed from the DoJ release,” Democrats on the House Oversight committee posted on X on Saturday.“Pam Bondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public,” they added.“This is a White House cover-up,” the Democrat members of the committeesaid in a later post.In a statement, the justice department said: “Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.”Criticism of the file alteration speaks to the highly-charged political nature of the congressionally-ordered document dump, with Democrats claiming that the files released so far have been heavily redacted and selected to paint Democrats, including former president Bill Clinton,in a bad light.Republicans on the committee responded,sayingthat earlier, Democrat-selected releases “have repeatedly posted cherry-picked edited photos to try to score political points and create a hoax against President Trump. They chase headlines at the expense of victims. They can NEVER be trusted to run serious investigations.”Bill Clinton spokesperson says White House is using him as scapegoat after Epstein files releaseRead moreDemocratic senator Tim Kaine of Virginia told NBC that if there are unanswered questions about Clinton’s relationship with Epstein, “he should address them, and I suspect he will”.Kaine added: “Let’s put all the facts and all the material out on the table, and then folks can reach their own judgments about anybody connected with this horrible, horrible case.”Arguments over redactions, removals and politically-inspired editing have put Clinton back in the frame of the scandal, after pictures of the former president luxuriating in a hot tub with Ghislaine Maxwell and what appeared to be a young woman were included in the release.“It’s obvious what the Republicans in the White House and at Justice and their desperate congressional cronies are doing,” a Clinton spokesperson said. “What they’re hiding is not obvious. But it must not be good.”Bill and Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and former first lady, are under pressure to testify before the committee.Trump-aligned Republicans calling for “transparency” are also sounding alarm. US House member Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, said she is concerned about “unnecessary redactions” – but added that she is “also concerned about making sure we are protecting the faces of potential victims and their names”.But it is clear justice department redactions may also have been too aggressive in some instances. A picture of Clinton, Michael Jackson, and Diana Ross on a plane released on Friday was also redacted to obscure a child’s face. The child later turned out to Jackson’s son, and the unaltered image readily available from commercial photo archives.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He later acted alongside Alexander Skarsgård inGeneration Kill, also helmed by Simon.In Generation Kill, Ransone played real-life marine Cpl Josh Ray Person across all seven episodes of theHBOshow.Ransone more recently appeared inIt Chapter Twoas the fictional character Eddie Kaspbrak.News of his death prompted an outpouring of condolences on social media from fans of the various productions in which he participated. One tribute in particular hailed how his work on It Chapter Two stood out on a cast whose members included Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy and Skarsgård’s brother, Bill, who portrays the antagonist Pennywise.Among those to weigh in was Ransone’s fellow actor François Arnaud, a prominent cast member ofHeated Rivalry, which is on the HBO Max platform.“RIP James Ransone,” Arnaud wrote Sunday on Instagram. “Unique actor that I was continuously impressed and inspired by.”Ransone was born in Baltimore in 1979. He attended the Carver Center for Arts and Technology in Towson, Maryland, from 1993 to 1997. He got his break co-starring in the 2002 teen drama Ken Park before landing his role onThe Wirea year later.In 2021, Ransone shared that he was sexually abused by a former tutor who worked in Maryland public schools, as theBaltimore Sunreported. He wrote on Instagram that the abuse was a factor in alcohol and heroin addictions with which he later grappled.The celebrity news sourcePage Sixreported that Ransone in 2020 reported the abuse he described, but authorities declined to pursue criminal charges.Ransone in 2016spoketo Interview magazine of how he would “wrestle with the catharsis of acting”.Some of his roles called on him to humanize characters who were not likable, “so I find myself living in a lot of unlikable skin”, he said. “As a result of that, I don’t always feel good.”In the US, you can call or text the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifelineat 988 or chat at988lifeline.org.

The event was billed as “a powerful celebration of faith, freedom, and the legacy of our founder, Charlie Kirk”.However, the gatheringmade headlinesfor theinfightingon display among its high-profile participants.“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk’s widow Erika. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”View image in fullscreenErika Kirk, left, and Nicki Minaj  react during AmericaFest, the first Turning Point USA summit since the death of Charlie Kirk, in Phoenix, Arizona, on Sunday.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/ReutersAccording to reports from the festival, the unification seen in previous years has been challenged by interpersonal gripes and disagreement over how big the big tent of conservatism should be and what brands of conservative thinking it can be expected to hold.Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, co-founder of The Daily Wire, set the tone on Thursday when he condemned Carlson for hostingthe white nationalist Nick Fuenteson his streaming show, as well as others he depicted as charlatans and grifters.Shapiro said hosts are “indeed responsible for the guests they choose and the questions they ask”, adding that Fuentes “is an evil troll and that building him up is an act of moral imbecility. And that is precisely what Tucker Carlson did.”Carlson later took the stage and dismissed Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform and denounce” people, according to reports, and said he laughed at Shapiro’s address – “that kind of bitter sardonic laugh that emerges from you and, like, upside-down world arrives. When your dog starts doing your taxes, and you’re like, ‘Wait, it’s not supposed to work this way.’”The pre-eminent split among young conservatives, reported theArizonaRepublic, is over distrust of Israel over its war with Hamas and the embrace of figures like Fuentes, a Holocaust denier. Without Kirk to hold the movement together, the fractures have only become more apparent.“When Charlie Kirk was assassinated, I think that’s when everything split into groypers, the conservative right, constitutional right,” Jack Nichols, 19,told the Arizona Republic. “And I think that’s bad. I don’t think that’s what Charlie would have wanted. I think Charlie would have wanted us to come together instead of dividing.”Former presidential candidate Ramaswamy, who is currently running for Ohio governor, said pockets of the “online right” had become fixated on the idea of a “heritage” right rather than one based on conservative ideals.View image in fullscreenVivek Ramaswamy speaks during the fTurning Point USA summit in Phoenix, Arizona, on Friday.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/Reuters“I think the idea of a heritage American is about as loony as anything the woke left has actually put up,” Ramaswamy said. “There is no American who is more American than somebody else … It is binary. Either you’re an American or you’re not.”In a penultimate speech, House speaker Mike Johnson encouraged attendees to “live as he [Charlie Kirk] lived”.“What I mean by that is, I think there’s two very important things that all of us can and should do. I think we should advance his principles, and I think we should adopt (that) approach.”The festival is set to conclude on Sunday with an address by Kirk’s widow Erika, who now runs the organization. Speaking at the event on Thursday, she endorsed JD Vanceas the next Republican presidential nominee.Vance – who spoke on Sunday – said of Kirk’s assassination, “we got kicked in the teeth, my friends, and there’s no sugar-coating it”. He depicted Kirk’s alleged assassin Tyler Robinson as a crucible of values and behaviors that the left seeks to promote and said it was better for conservatives to have disagreements and to discuss them, than to be “drones for George Soros.”The conservative festival was not short in surprises: rapper Nicki Minaj took to the stage with Kirk on Sunday. Minaj expressed admiration for Donald Trump and Vance, and explained her switch from supporting Democrat candidates like Obama and Clinton. “I just got tired of being pushed around,”she said.“I’m not gonna back down anymore. I’m not gonna back down ever again.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsJD VanceFar right (US)Donald Trump JrSteve BannonnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s about to get worseEduardo PorterAs Congress cuts healthcare access to pay for tax cuts and poor Americans die earlier, billionaires invest in anti-ageingSun 21 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTShareThere’s a weird disconnect to the public debate about health in the United States. In January, millions of Americans may drop their health insurance aspremiums skyrocketfollowing the Trump administration’s decision to end federal subsidies that helped some 20 million people afford insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces.Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress agreed to cut more than $850bn from the 10-year budgets of Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people, and the Chip health insurance program for children, in order to pay for some tax cuts. Given the US’s budgetary rules, that cut means an additional $500bn in funding for Medicare is at risk.Meanwhile, in some corner of the US, far detached from these concerns, rich people are plowing money into startups researching how to extend life: some $12.5bn over the last 25 years,according to the Wall Street Journal.OpenAI’sSam Altmaninvested $180m in Retro Biosciences, which hopes to reprogram ageing cells. Tech billionaires from Google’s former CEO Eric Schmidt and Sun Microsystems’ Vinod Khosla have sunk hundreds of millions into NewLimit, which is trying to reverse cell ageing. Meta’sMark Zuckerberga few weeks ago reshaped his philanthropic foundation to focus on the intersection of biology and AI to eventually cure all disease.A quick glance at the state of Americans’ health will tell you this mix of priorities is not ideal. American average life expectancy in 2023 was shorter than it was in 2010. It has fallen way below not just the lifespan of people in affluent nations in the European Union, Japan or Canada. Average life expectancy at birth in the US is now shorter than that of Albania and Czechia, Chile and Panama. It is four years shorter than the average life expectancy in Puerto Rico.Chart of life expectancyThis is despite Americans’enormous spending on healthcare, which is in a league of its own – inflated by a large private, profit-driven medical industry that charges patients and their insurers an arm and a leg every time they come into contact with the system, regardless of whether the intervention does any good to their health.Like the US’s disturbinglyprofound poverty, its over-the-top mortality is not due to some technical shortfall or economic constraint. It is a choice. The United States is not only rich. It is better atinventing newfangled drugs and therapiesthan probably any other country in the world. What it is terrible at is ensuring that its people, even the poor ones, have access to the basic building blocks of a healthy life – from decent jobs and humdrum amenities likepotable water, to access tohealth insurance.American death and destitution are intimately connected. From the country’s fentanyl addiction to its obesity and its many suicides, often its most deadly afflictions do not call for fancy healthcare technology. It’s the social contract that must be fixed.Americans’ short lives are not breaking news. Concerned scientists have been trying to draw attention to them for years. In 2013, the National Institutes of Health published a massive study titled “US Health in International Perspective:Shorter Lives, Poorer Health”, in which a panel of experts worked to identify the reasons that Americans were dying younger than people in other countries.The study made recommendations, mostly about opportunities to learn from other countries. What has Washington done about it? Well, Republicans have been trying for years to revoke the Affordable Care Act. Then there were those cuts to Medicaid. And there’s that new stunted vaccine schedule, courtesy of the health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr.The people who are investing in futuristic life extensions are not dying young.Inequality of life expectancyis steeper in the US than in probably every other high-income country.Research some 10 years agoby scholars at Harvard, MIT, McKinsey and the US treasury found that the richest 1% of American men lived 14.6 years longer than the poorest 1%. For women, the gap was 10.1 years. What’s more, the longevity chasm between Americans in the top 5% and those in the bottom 5% widened by more than two years from 2001 to 2014.Across the set of ailments that kill Americans at higher rates, frominfant mortalityto opioid overdoses,Americans’ disproportionate povertyplays a critical role in explaining its deficits.Research by economistsfrom Brown University, Dartmouth College and the University of Southern California found that babies born to well-off American mothers died at about the same rate as babies of well-off European moms. Americans’ disproportionate infant mortality was accounted for almost entirely by the kids of poor people.There’s a long list of reasons why Americans die younger: high infant and maternal mortality, and disproportionatesuicideandhomiciderates – which are unsurprising given the ubiquity of guns in American society. There are theroad accidents– probably due to the fact that Americans drive more – and thelung ailmentsstemming from disproportionatesmoking ratesfrom the 1940s to 1980. There’sthe obesity. And there’s what economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case called “deaths of despair”, which these days usually come at the hand of afentanyl overdose.Yet, perhaps the most significant factor explaining the US’s exceptionally short lives is that nobody really cares to prevent poor, marginalized Americans from dying. Washington is too busy providing tax cuts to rich people, so maybe they can invest in stopping cells from ageing.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareTrump administrationHealthcare industryUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump, the man to whose star Bongino successfully hitched himself, hinted at what’s next for Bongino – a seemingly imminent return to his old life. “Dan did a great job,” Trump told reporters. “I think he wants to go back to his show.”Vince Coglianese, the conservative commentator who replaced Bongino on Westwood One’s daily schedule,confirmed on his Thursday showthat Bongino would return – though he said he would keep his 12-3pm radio show, which has been a “wonderful success”.A veteran of the industry noted that Coglianese’s accompanying podcast was produced by Bongino’s company, Silverloch Productions, suggesting that arrangement kept the door open to his eventual return.“There’s no doubt that Dan gets behind a microphone – that Dan talks to you again,” Coglianese told his viewers, an audience he said Bongino had built. “I’m super pumped that Dan Bongino is rejoining the fight on this side of the microphone. I can’t wait to see it.”Eric Bolling, a veteran of the conservative media space, predicted that Bongino’s government experience – however limited – would be an asset to his media career. “He’s walking back into a space he helped define, and I expect him to be one of the biggest voices in conservative podcasting,” he told the Guardian, adding that “having seen how the sausage is made from inside the administration only adds to his credibility”.Michael Harrison, publisher of the talk radio trade publication Talkers Magazine, said Bongino’s appointment at the FBI was “a terrible choice” and was primarily indicative of the president’s desire to recruit the stars of the conservative media world for his administration.“I think Bongino will learn from this, and he will go back into the game, and he will be better than he ever was because of this experience,” Harrison said. “He’s a very experienced and intelligent man who should not be taken lightly.”But Laura Ingraham, Bongino’s one-time Fox News colleague, appeared to throw shade at Bongino’s impending return on her Wednesday evening show. “After only nine months on the job, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino is stepping aside,” she told her viewers. “Now, this is not surprising. He loved his lucrative media life and he wants to get back to it.”Brian Rosenwald, the author of a 2019 book about the rise of talk radio, said he was not surprised by Bongino’s imminent return, considering how lucrative the business is.Who is Dan Bongino? FBI deputy at center of Maga fallout over Epstein filesRead moreDuring his time at the FBI, though, Bongino faced backlash from conservatives for stating definitively that the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died via suicide, with some noting thathe had once raised questionsabout the circumstances of Epstein’s death while working in radio, asking provocatively in 2023, “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?”Rosenwald predicted that Bongino would have to address some of the inconsistencies between his two careers – but will largely hew to the just-asking-questions formula that dominates conservative talk media. “Realistically speaking, he is going to go back to doing exactly what he was doing before, because it worked for him,” he said. “Bongino is not going to come back and say, ‘Hey, I learned to be much more responsible in my time at the FBI.”Bongino seemed to acknowledge as muchduring a recent appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, when pressed on his past statements about the person who planted pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee in 2021. “Listen, I was paid in the past, Sean, for my opinions. That’s clear,” he said. “And one day I will be back in that space, but that’s not what I’m paid for now. I’m paid to be your deputy director, and we base investigations on facts.”While Bongino’s career got its biggest boost at Fox News, he is unlikely to return to the network – despite his close relationship with Hannity. Bongino’s tenure at Fox ended abruptly in April 2023, though he said at the time that there was “no acrimony” and his exit was not part of “some big conspiracy”, despite coming shortly after Fox’smassive settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. Still, his exit surprised Fox-watchers because he seemed to be a rising star at the network.If nothing else, Bongino’s trajectory provides further evidence of the revolving door between the conservative media ecosystem and the Trump administration.Another conservative media personality who has gone in and out of government service is Sebastian Gorka, a veteran of the first Trump administration who then worked as a radio host for Salem Media Group, before stepping down to join the second Trump White House as deputy assistant to the president.Asked for his thoughts about Bongino’s impending return to the conservative media space, Gorka responded in an email: “The Guardian are scum. And you can quote me.”Explore more on these topicsMediaPodcastingDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But development campaigners warned at the time that the burden on Sri Lankan taxpayers remained unsustainable.Before the cyclone hit, annual repayments were expected to total 25% of government revenues – a high level by international and historical standards.‘Not normal’: Climate crisis supercharged deadly monsoon floods in AsiaRead moreIn a statement, the group of 120 global experts called for fresh debt restructuring to restore the country’s repayments to a manageable level, given the scale of environmental destruction.Alongside Stiglitz, the signatories include Jayati Ghosh, a renowned Indian development economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US, the inequality expert Thomas Piketty, the former Argentinian economy minister Martín Guzmán, and Kate Raworth, the author of DoughnutEconomics, a widely read book about capitalism and the environment.“Sri Lanka is now confronting a severe economic shock triggered by the recent cyclone, extensive flooding and landslides, which has inflicted extensive damage to infrastructure, livelihoods, and key sectors of the economy,” they said.“This environmental emergency is poised to absorb – and potentially exceed – the extremely limited fiscal space created by the current debt restructuring package. Additional external debt is already being taken on from the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)], and more lending to deal with the impacts of the disaster is likely.”They called for the “immediate suspension of Sri Lanka’s external sovereign debt payments, and a new restructuring that restores debt sustainability under the new circumstances”.Research by the campaign group Debt Justice found that after the 2024 debt restructuring deal, which involved some investors accepting a “haircut” on expected repayments, private sector creditors were still on course to make 40% more profit lending to Sri Lanka than to the US government.Since the cyclone hit last month, the Sri Lankan government hasasked for a $200m emergency loan from the (IMFto help it through the immediate crisis, but disbursements under this “rapid financing instrument” are usually expected to be repaid within three to five years.Scientists at World Weather Attribution, a coalition of climate experts, found thatglobal heating was likely to have exacerbated the severityof Sri Lanka’s flooding, as well as that of other Asian countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, that have also been badly affected in recent weeks.A UK government spokesperson said it recognised the devastating impacts of Cyclone Ditwah on the people of Sri Lanka. “This is why we are committed to supporting Sri Lanka’s recovery through humanitarian assistance and international coordination. We have already provided £1m of humanitarian support via the Red Cross, UN partners and civil society organisations to deliver emergency supplies and life-saving care.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsDebt reliefSri LankaExtreme weatherSouth and central AsiaNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

The skid matched the franchise’s worst since moving to Tennessee in 1997.Bears stun Packers in overtime as Eagles top Commanders to clinch NFC EastRead moreWith two games left, the Chiefs (6-9) are assured of their first losing record since 2012 – their most recent season without Andy Reid as their coach. Kansas City have lost four straight, their longest skid since 2017, and six of seven.A week after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL, his backup, Gardner Minshew, was knocked out of the game with a knee injury early in the second quarter.Ward posted his highest passer rating of this season at 122.3, and he overtook Marcus Mariota for the most yards passing by a rookie for the franchise. He helped the Titans roll up a season-high 377 yards of offense against a Chiefs defense that came in as the NFL’s eighth-stingiest in yards allowed.The rookie threw a shovel pass to Chig Okonkwo that went seven yards to put the Titans ahead to stay late in the first half. Ward also found fellow rookie Chimere Dike for a 1-yard TD in the third quarter.Minnesota Vikings 16-13 New York GiantsJJ McCarthy ran for a touchdown before leaving with an injury to his right, throwing hand, and backup quarterback Max Brosmer helped the Minnesota Vikings win their third game in a row, beating the New York Giants 16-13 on Sunday in a matchup of teams eliminated from playoff contention.McCarthy was injured on a strip sack by Brian Burns in the final minute of the first half, when it appeared the Vikings (7-8) were going to let the clock run out. Instead, Burns forced McCarthy to fumble with a crushing hit and Tyler Nubin returned it 27 yards for a touchdown.Brosmer led a go-ahead scoring drive in the fourth quarter that ended with Will Reichard making a 30-yard field goal. The rookie completed 7 of 9 passes for 52 yards in his fourth NFL appearance and first since throwing four interceptions 30 November in a 26-0 loss at Seattle.Before getting hurt, McCarthy completed 9 of 14 passes for 108 yards and had a would-be pick-6 negated by an offside penalty on Abdul Carter. After having his entire rookie year wiped out by a torn meniscus in his right knee, the 2024 No 10 pick has missed time this season because of a concussion and a sprained right ankle.The Giants (2-13) lost their ninth consecutive game and fifth since Mike Kafka took over as interim coach when Brian Daboll was fired on 10 November. They have not won since 9 October.Los Angeles Chargers 34-17 Dallas CowboysJustin Herbert threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score and the Los Angeles Chargers closed in on a playoff spot with a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.The Chargers’ fourth consecutive victory gave them a chance later in the day to clinch their second postseason berth in two seasons under coach Jim Harbaugh. LA (11-4) would be in with a loss or tie by either Indianapolis or Houston.Dak Prescott had TD passes on his first two drives but couldn’t find the end zone again for Dallas, which was eliminated from the playoffs for the second year in a row with Philadelphia’s NFC East-clinching victory at Washington on Saturday.The Cowboys (6-8-1) have lost three in a row since a three-game winning streak that put them over .500 for the only time in coach Brian Schottenheimer’s first season.In his third full game with his broken non-throwing (left) hand heavily protected, Herbert led the Chargers to touchdowns on all three drives in the first half. Omarion Hampton scored on a five-yard run in the second half.Buffalo Bills 23-20 Cleveland BrownsJames Cook rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns, Josh Allen played through a foot injury and the Buffalo Bills drew closer to a playoff berth with a 23-20 victory over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.Ty Johnson also had a rushing score for the Bills (11-4), who have won four straight and five of six.Allen played the second half despite injuring his right foot during the second quarter.The reigning NFL MVP was favoring the foot after being sacked by Cleveland’s Myles Garrett and Alex Wright for a 22-yard loss to Buffalo’s one-yard line with 60 seconds remaining in the first half. The half-sack gave Garrett 22 on the season. He needs one more sack in the final two games for the Browns (3-12) to pass Michael Strahan and TJ Watt for the single-season mark.Allen was 12 of 19 for 130 yards and also rushed for 17 yards on seven carries.New York Jets 6-29 New Orleans SaintsChris Olave caught touchdown passes from Tyler Shough and Taysom Hill, Charlie Smyth tied a Saints record with five field goals and New Orleans extended their winning streak to three with a 29-6 victory over the reeling New York Jets on Sunday.Cameron Jordan had two sacks for New Orleans (5-10), giving him 130 for his career and moving the 15th-year defensive end two ahead of Hall of Famer Rickey Jackson for 17th most in NFL history. Jordan, now with a team-high 8 1/2 sacks this season, has had at least eight sacks in nine seasons.Shough, drafted 40th overall last spring, passed for 308 yards to eclipse 300 for the first time while improving to 4-3 as a starter. Hill accounted for 116 yards with 42 rushing, 36 receiving and his 38-yard scoring pass to Olave in the final minutes.Undrafted rookie Brady Cook made his second start with the Jets (3-12), who’ve lost three straight and five of six.Cook was sacked eight times. He lost a fumble when ex-Jet Nathan Shepherd flattened him and defensive end Chase Young recovered, leading to Smyth’s 50-yard field goal. Cook also was intercepted by rookie safety Jonas Sanker on a fourth-down play in the fourth quarter, leading to Smyth’s final field goal from 39 yards.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20-23 Carolina PanthersBryce Young threw for 191 yards and two touchdowns, Lathan Ransom intercepted Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left and the Carolina Panthers beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23-20 on Sunday to take over first place in the NFC South.The Panthers (8-7) can wrap up with the division title next Sunday with a win over Seattle and a Buccaneers (7-8) loss to Miami. However, if both teams win or both teams lose, the Panthers would need to beat Tampa Bay again on the road in Week 18 to claim their first division title since 2015.Tetairoa McMillan had six catches for 73 yards and a touchdown as the Panthers once again bounced back with a huge win after a potentially devastating loss to the last-place New Orleans Saints.Ransom had a huge mistake in that defeat with a late hit on Saints QB Tyler Shough that led to New Orleans’ winning field goal.But with the Bucs driving for a tying field goal – or a go-ahead touchdown – there was a miscommunication on a second-and-9 pass play between Mayfield and Mike Evans at the Carolina 42 and Ransom got an easy pick to seal the win.Cincinnati Bengals 45-21 Miami DolphinsJoe Burrow rebounded from his first time being shut out to throw for 309 yards and four touchdowns as the Cincinnati Bengals routed the Miami Dolphins 45-21 on Sunday.Miami (6-9) and Cincinnati (5-10) were both eliminated from playoff contention last week, but the teams insisted they were still motivated for the final three games of the season.It appeared that way in the first half. Cincinnati held a 17-14 halftime lead before blowing the game open with 28 points off four straight Dolphins turnovers.Burrow carved up Miami’s defense, completing 25 of 32 throws with a 146.5 passer rating before being replaced by veteran Joe Flacco early in the fourth quarter. Two of Burrow’s touchdown passes went to running back Chase Brown, from 9 and 5 yards out. Brown, who finished with 66 yards rushing and 43 receiving, also had a 12-yard touchdown run. All of Brown’s TDs came in the third, making him the first player this season with three scores in a single quarter.Ja’Marr Chase caught nine passes for 109 yards.Pittsburgh Steelers 29-24 Detroit LionsThe Pittsburgh Steelers pushed the Detroit Lions to the brink of elimination from the playoffs on Sunday, holding on for a 29-24 win when Jared Goff’s touchdown on the final play was negated by an offensive pass-interference penalty on Amon-Ra St Brown.Goff threw a fourth-down pass to St Brown just short of the goal line. The receiver pushed off cornerback Jalen Ramsey to get free, and before the Steelers could bring St Brown to the ground, he threw the quarterback a lateral to set up an apparent score.Officials huddled for some time on the field before announcing the decision to the dismay of the crowd.Jaylen Warren had two 45-yard touchdown runs in the fourth quarter and finished with a career-high 143 yards for the Steelers, who had a 230-15 advantage in rushing yards.The AFC North-leading Steelers (9-6) have won three straight after a midseason slump, surging into the division lead with two games remaining.Jacksonville Jaguars 34-20 Denver BroncosTrevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading the Jacksonville Jaguars to a resounding 34-20 win that snapped the Denver Broncos’ 11-game winning streak Sunday.The AFC South-leading Jaguars (11-4) won their sixth straight game and handed the Broncos (12-3) their first loss since Week 3. It was also Denver’s first loss at home since 13 October 2024, snapping the Broncos’ 12-game home winning streak.The Broncos’ lead over the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC West was sliced to a single game. The teams play in Week 18.After Broncos rookie RJ Harvey pinballed his way for a 38-yard touchdown to tie it at 17 on the opening drive of the second half, it was all Jacksonville.Lawrence scored on a on-yard keeper, then hit Parker Washington for 63 yards to set up Travis Etienne Jr’s 10-yard TD catch. After Bo Nix fumbled his exchange with running back Jaleel McLaughlin, Lawrence drove Jacksonville on its fifth consecutive score, a 26-yard field goal by Cam Little that made it 34-17 early in the fourth quarter.Atlanta Falcons 26-19 Arizona CardinalsBijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.The Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.Arizona’s defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta’s CJ Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett’s pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.Robinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).Arizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.Las Vegas Raiders 21-23 Houston TexansCJ Stroud threw a touchdown pass, Derek Stingley returned an interception for a score and the Houston Texans beat Las Vegas 23-21 on Sunday for their seventh straight victory and the Raiders’ ninth loss in a row.Houston (10-5) has its longest winning streak since a nine-game run in 2018. The Texans remain a game behind first-place Jacksonville – a winner in Denver on Sunday – in the AFC South. The Raiders are 2-13.Stingley’s touchdown came in the first quarter, and Ka’imi Fairbairn made three field goals to help the Texans to the win on a day when their offense struggled.Houston led by two with about eight minutes left when Stroud found a wide-open Dalton Schultz for a 1-yard touchdown strike that made it 23-14. Nick Chubb had a 30-yard run on that drive and a 23-yard pass interference call on Lonnie Johnson Jr against Collins got Houston to the 2 to set up the score.Rauders rookie Ashton Jeanty cut the lead to 23-21 when he scored on a 51-yard run with about five and a half minutes left. The rookie burst through the line before shedding a defender and waltzing into the end zone.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

There is simply no stopping this Aston Villa machine, cylinders pumping, handcrafted by Unai Emery, who reacted to ­Rogers’s second goal againstManchester Unitedby launching his jacket into the night sky. “Birmingham, are you listening?” came the chorus from the home support but this was a victory with far wider implications.Approaching the halfway stage of the season, Villa, third and three points behind thePremier Leagueleaders Arsenal, are ensconced in the title race, two more Rogers goals earning a 10th consecutive win in all competitions and rendering Matheus Cunha’s well-taken equaliser a consolation. The discourse and debate will run wild after this latest Villa win, a seventh in a row in the league, but it was one that undoubtedly belonged to Rogers’s individual brilliance. After his second goal, Rogers spread his arms, screwed up his face and shrugged as if to say: “Well, what am I supposed to do?”Manchester United will not go panic buying in January, says AmorimRead moreAmadou Onana pretended to place a crown on his head, though, remarkably, Emery revealed he was not entirely happy with Rogers until that moment. The England midfielder’s divine opener had been and gone; this is Emery, fastidious and demanding.The last time Villa won seven in a row in the top flight was between December and February in the 1989-90 campaign, another run during which they also dispatched United and went on to finish second under Graham Taylor. If Villa beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday they will equal their club-record 11 wins in a row from 1897, when Villa Park was still known as Aston Lower Grounds.A frustrating defeat for Ruben Amorim was compounded by his captain, Bruno Fernandes, being forced off through injury at half-time with a muscle injury that will likely mean several matches on the sidelines, starting on Boxing Day against Newcastle at Old Trafford. Kobbie Mainoo was absent altogether with a calf injury sustained in training on Saturday. So it was down to Lisandro Martínez to moonlight as an anchor, the Argentina centre-back partnering Manuel Ugarte at the base of midfield for the second half.This was always likely to be a high-octane occasion and within two and a half minutes Cunha sent a rasping first-time effort narrowly wide of Emi Martínez’s left post. Villa’s first opening fell to Ollie Watkins but after chopping inside Leny Yoro his delayed thinking allowed Ayden Heaven to intervene. After Youri Tielemans pinched possession from Ugarte, John McGinn forced a save from Senne Lammens and then the United goalkeeper repelled Watkins’s rebound. From the subsequent corner Ian Maatsen’s throttled volley whistled a whisker wide, via Rogers’s right heel.View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers scores Aston Villa’s second goal.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersThe chances were totting up and it served as a teaser for what was to come. Benjamin Sesko had a couple of big moments; Martínez’s legs thwarted the United striker for the first and for the other his touch after rounding the Villa goalkeeper was too clunky.There were plenty moments for a fervent Villa crowd to get behind. On the half hour McGinn emerged from a cul-de-sac of three white United shirts with the ball and earlier Tielemans charged into Yoro as Emery’s side swarmed in numbers. At a corner there was some pantomime grappling between Yoro and Martínez for good measure. Amid all of that, though, Rogers served Yoro and United notice.It was the 33rd minute when Rogers drove inside Yoro, opened up his body and, encouraged by the locals to take aim, sent a shot at goal. As it happened, it was a little tame and easy for Lammens to claim.It was a different story approaching the half-time interval, when Rogers dispatched a superb curling strike into the far corner of the United goal. This time Lammens swivelled his head only to confirm the ball had rippled his net. Rogers had improbably kept McGinn’s slightly overcooked pass in play on the left touchline and then roamed inside, glancing up briefly to pick his spot. The “ref cam” replays suggested Michael Oliver had arguably the best view in the house.It was the kind of strike worthy of winning any game but a couple of minutes later, in the third minute of first-half stoppage time, Cunha celebrated his leveller by pretending to surf in front of the Holte End. Patrick Dorgu dispossessed a dallying Matty Cash and Cunha, involved in almost all of United’s good work, seized on the loose ball. Ezri Konsa pointed Martínez towards the top corner, his telepathic instincts kicking in, but Cunha’s superb finish gave the Villa goalkeeper no chance.In the second half, Lisandro Martínez smacked the advertising hoardings with a shot from 20 yards and United did not seem too disrupted. But a minute later Villa and Rogers struck again. Tielemans kept the ball alive close to the byline and hooked a cross towards Watkins. The Villa striker could not trap the ball but Rogers was alert and took over the baton. Again, Rogers drifted inside Yoro and, again, he picked out the far corner. Emery put his jacket taking flight down to adrenaline and, really, who could blame him?It was Cunha who missed a golden opportunity to equalise midway through the second half. When he read Dorgu’s cross from the left, time appeared to freeze for a split-second and the away end were primed to celebrate. But, perhaps spooked by the time and space afforded to him a few yards from goal by Konsa and Victor Lindelöf – the former United centre-back making his second Premier League start for Villa – he failed to make clean contact and sent his header off target.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

And then the “goal of the century”, where the Argentinian went on a slalom run, dribbling past half the England team before scoring.Analysis: how prices for the cheapest World Cup tickets have rocketedRead moreIn those days, tickets in Mexico were sold in packages of 13 for about $150 per person to see all 13 games [about $442, or £330, today]. “I have very vivid memories and others that are a little blurry. I remember being afraid of the height of the stands; we were in the cheapest seats,” Zamora says. He also recalls “the explosion of emotion” during the game.When Zamora found out the World Cup would be returning to Mexico, he felt a swell of nostalgia and immediately knew he wanted to buy tickets to go to the stadium again with his father, now 71 years old.Zamora, who has a master’s degree in petrochemical engineering and works at a company that provides services to the state oil firm, knew the tickets would be expensive but was undeterred. Then reality set in. For the past four months he has been trying – and failing – to purchase seats. Through the Fifa website, he unsuccessfully entered three online ballots for the chance to win an opportunity to buy tickets and has no idea how he will be able to attend the 2026 World Cup in his home country.“I’d like to think it’s just bad luck on my part, but the reality is that it increasingly feels like there isn’t actually a World Cup in Mexico,” he says.It is the first time the tournament will be held in three different countries – the United States and Canada are the other co-hosts – with 13 of the 104 matches taking place in Mexico. Seventy-eight of the games will be held in the US. “We feel excluded,” Zamora says.View image in fullscreenDiego Maradona in his way to scoring ‘the goal of the century’ against England at the Azteca Stadium in 1986, the last time Mexico hosted the tournament.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesHis disappointment is echoed widely among Mexican fans, arguably the most ardent of aficionados in the three host nations. The event, which is supposed to convey an international feeling of solidarity through sport, is taking place in an increasingly tense geopolitical environment as the second term of President Donald Trump has confronted the US’s two close neighbours, levying tariffs andramping up an anti-immigrant agenda.The backdrop of unease has been exacerbated by the confusion over who will ultimately be able to attend the games in Mexico. Fifa said it received5m applicationsfor the ballot that opened on Thursday for 24 hours. According to the governing body, 2m tickets have already been sold across the first two early sales phases, leaving fewer than 5m still available. Zamora says he doesn’t know anyone who has secured a ticket.“Right now there’s a lot of confusion. In the Sunday football team I play on, at least 20 people have gone through the same process as me, and I don’t know anyone who has got anything,” he says.Zamora was seeking tickets for the opening match between Mexico and South Africa at the Azteca Stadium on 11 June, which in the final ballot phase cost between $1,290 (£964) and $1,825 (£1,364) for a regular seat, with no guarantee that even putting down that money will secure a ticket. Hospitality options are available, with prices about $10,000 (£7,474). The prices are astronomical in a country where an average professional is paid about7,500 pesos ($416/£311)per monthand faroutstrips prices in previous World Cups.View image in fullscreenTickets for Mexico’s opening fixture at next summer’s tournament start at $1,290, an unrealistic figure for the average fan.Photograph: Héctor Vivas/FIFA/Getty ImagesA ticket for a Liga MX match at the same stadium costs about $15 to $50, before the major renovation that started last year. A luxury box seat at the 2024 Clausura final between América and Cruz Azul reached $2,000.“The prices are not for an average Mexican,” says the Mexican writer Rodrigo Márquez Tizano, author of A Brief History of Almost There, a collection of essays that looks atEl Tri’s participation in the World Cups. “The last World Cup in Mexico in 1986 still smelled of sweat and hope,” he says recalling the excitement of spectators waiting to enter the stands. “Today, before even going to the stadium, we’re in a virtual line. Businessmen have appropriated the ball that used to belong to the people.”Márquez says that after four years of taut anticipation of Mexico once again being on the global stage, the feeling in the country is anticlimactic. “Reality is unfortunately inferior to what we dreamed it would be,” he says, “because there is a feeling that nobody has tickets.” He too has applied to the Fifa ballots without any luck.The World Cup is about places and people. In Seattle, it should be about Pride | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreEven getting tickets for the matches scheduled in the US has been difficult for Mexican fans. Jorge García, a 40-year-old advertising executive in Mexico City, connected promptly at 10am on Thursday using his Fifa ID to join the virtual queue to participate in the latest tickets ballot. He had his credit card out and was ready to pay for a pair of tickets costing about 5,000 pesos ($265) each, hoping to take his son, León, to the stadium in Houston to see Cristiano Ronaldo in action against Uzbekistan on 26 June.García waited for two hours to make his application. He also applied for seven games in Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara, and now has to wait until February to know if he was successful or not.“Everything is very confusing. There’s little communication and clarity here in Mexico regarding the tickets. It seems like this mess is intentional so that you give up and look for tickets on the resale market. This opening match at the Azteca Stadium seems like a rehearsal for what the World Cup will be like,” says a despondent García. He has budgeted up to $700 to pay for a pair of tickets to see Mexico play at home if they become available on the resale market. Fifa said last week it would be releasing a small number of low-price tickets costing $60. They will not be available via the governing body’s official platform but rather through the national associations of the participating teams.García was only a toddler during the 1986 World Cup but has been avidly following the tournaments on TV since 1994. “I’ve never been to a World Cup and I thought with it being close, I would have a chance. But with these prices, it seems even further away. I guess what’s left is to experience what happens in the streets, the atmosphere, and the friends who come and visit us.”This article was amended on 21 December 2025. An earlier version said that 73 games would be played in the US; that should have said 78.Explore more on these topicsMexicoWorld Cup 2026featuresShareReuse this content"

He mentions ‘Europe, Saudi, UAE’ when asked where he may play next.Photograph: Courtesy of Jesse LingardSoccerInterview‘I made such a bond’: Jesse Lingard on life in South Korea and his next challengeDavid HytnerFormer Manchester United player discusses culinary and cultural surprises, feeling more mature and how he learned KoreanSun 21 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTShareJesse Lingard says his Korean is decent, good enough to make himself understood when out for dinner and the shocks do not stop there. The former Manchester United and England midfielder was always going to throw himself into his K-League adventure with FC Seoul and now that it is over after two years, a new chapter beckoning when the January transfer window opens, the 33-year-old certainly has the tales to tell.It was the little things as much as anything else, the cultural quirks. And the bigger ones, of course – such as the time he watched an octopus squirm in front of him before eating it. “The food is different, obviously, and I tried live octopus,” Lingard says. “It was moving. I was scared at first but it was all right.”Lingard loved how the people of Seoul would react to him on the street. “It’s always like: ‘Oh!’” he says, mimicking a sharp intake of breath, putting his hand over his mouth and opening his eyes as wide as possible. “They get very shocked. Then they go: ‘Lingard, Lingard.’ And come over for a photo.”It was not always so innocent when it came to the Seoul fans, Lingard remembering the run of five straight home defeats last season and a number of losses this time out that should not have happened. “They would wait outside the stadium and block the bus in for an hour – and make the coach go and speak to them,” he says. “It was crazy. It’s because Seoul is the biggest club in the country. I always compare it to United. The expectation to win is always there.”View image in fullscreenJesse Lingard acknowledges the fans at his final game for FC Seoul. ‘I think I’ve left a strong legacy,’ he says.Photograph: Courtesy of Jesse LingardLingard is back in his hometown of Warrington, looking forward to Christmas with family and beyond that to his next challenge. He describes himself as “open” as to where it may be. “Europe, Saudi, UAE …” he says.Lingard’s next club will get a player who retains ferocious drive and stamina. In his final four games for Seoul, the last against Melbourne City in the Asian Champions League on 10 December, he ran between 11.4km and 12.4km. He covered between 9% and 10% of those distances at a very high intensity, an elite-level statistic.Lingard has also been changed by Seoul. “I feel that I’m more mature now, more responsible,” he says. A part of that was down to how he grew after being given the captain’s armband midway through his first season. He helped the younger players, in particular, to come out of their shells and communicate better on the pitch. The other reason was the move itself, the boldness of it and how he came to own it.Lingard was at a low ebb at the end of the 2022-23 season with Nottingham Forest, where he had gone on a one-year deal after the expiry of his contract at United. He barely played for Forest over the second half of it, fitness problems a contributing factor, and he could not find a club he wanted to join during the summer transfer window.View image in fullscreenJesse Lingard at Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul.Photograph: Courtesy of Jesse LingardIn effect, Lingard took six months out, biding his time until the European mid-season window, keeping himself ticking over by training with his personal coach. It would also be a time of heartbreak, Lingard’s grandmother dying in November 2023. “It was really hard because I was so close to her,” he says. “I was always at her house when I was younger. But I thought it was God saying: ‘Just be with her, be with your family. And wait until January.’ That was when Seoul came in.”Lingard signed a two-year deal on 8 February 2024; the K-League season runs from the start of March to the end of November. Never before had Korea welcomed such a high-profile foreign player and only six Englishmen had played there: Dalian Atkinson, Jamie Cureton, Andy Cooke, Chris Marsden, Richard Offiong and Jordon Mutch.“I was shocked at first because I didn’t know anything about Seoul,” Lingard says. “But when I started to think about it, I thought it could be a chance to reset, to get away from the noise in Manchester. There’s a lot of distractions [in Manchester]. You can get roped into going out and stuff like that. I just wanted to get away and really knuckle down on the football part.”Lingard endured a false start in the Land of the Morning Calm. He was a substitute in Seoul’s opening three games, then needed surgery on the meniscus in a knee and was out for two months. A crowd of 51,670 had turned up for his debut against Gwangju at the Seoul World Cup stadium, which has a capacity of 66,704. The club’s average K-League attendance during his time with them was about 25,000.Quick GuideEngland's 2018 World Cup team: where are they now?ShowEngland team that faced Croatia in the World Cup semi-finalJordan Pickford:Still first choice for England and EvertonKyle Walker:Mainstay at Burnley after leaving Manchester CityJohn Stones:A Thomas Tuchel favourite but in and out at CityHarry Maguire:On a Manchester United rollercoaster since 2019Jordan Henderson:At Brentford, via Saudi Arabia and AjaxKieran Trippier:Almost always a Newcastle first choice when fitDele Alli:Without a club after Como released him in SeptemberJesse Lingard:Looking for his next club after leaving SeoulAshley Young:Making irregular appearances for Ipswich at 40Raheem Sterling:Frozen out at Chelsea, he last played in MayHarry Kane:Scoring for fun at Bayern, he remains England captainSubstitutes:Marcus Rashford:On loan at Barcelona from Manchester UnitedDanny Rose:Retired in July 2024, having not played since late 2021Eric Dier:Joined Monaco last summer after spell with BayernJamie Vardy:Cremonese striker – November's Serie A player of the monthPhotograph: Tom JenkinsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It was possible to worry about how Lingard would settle, mainly because of his previousexperience of depression and loneliness, which affected him in 2019 and the early months of 2020. Was a move so far from home really wise? That, however, is in the past and when he recovered his physical fitness, he began to make his mark.Lingard found a penthouse apartment with views over the Han River; one of the others in the building belongs to the South Korea captain, Son Heung-min. “I didn’t see him around the place because he was away playing [with Tottenham then Los Angeles FC], although he did come to the training ground a few times, so I met him there,” Lingard says. “My best friend is called Sunny and he came to live with me. He was back and forth for the majority of the first year.”View image in fullscreenJesse Lingard on his Seoul debut in a K-league match against Gwangju in 2024.Photograph: MB Media/Getty ImagesLingard finished the 2024 season with six goals and three assists from 26 appearances as Seoul came fourth in the 12-team league to qualify for the Asian Champions League. This time out, he had 10 goals and four assists from 34 league appearances as the club finished sixth. He also had three goals and three assists in six Asian Champions League games. Seoul, a sleeping giant fighting to regain prominence, are fifth in the 12-team East Region group with two matches to play. The top eight advance to the last 16.There is no doubt Lingard was taken aback by the facilities at Seoul, although he never complained. The training ground does not have a canteen, meaning the players have to go out for their own lunch. There are no seats in the changing room and the lack of under-soil heating at the training ground and stadium is a problem.“If it’s snowing or icy, you can’t train,” Lingard says. “You just have to do gym or run on the Astroturf. We had to do that in the last few weeks of the season because of the cold. We also had a game at the stadium last year where it was freezing and the whole of the left side of the pitch was like ice. We had to play most of the football on the right-hand side.”It was the people who helped to make it for Lingard. There was his translator, Ki Ji-yong, known as Daniel, who took him to training every day. “A great guy, we got on straight away,” Lingard says. And there were the many friends he made in the dressing room.View image in fullscreenJesse Lingard relaxing at his apartment in the South Korean capital.Photograph: Courtesy of Jesse Linagard“Most of the players could speak good English,” he says. “The manager, Kim Gi-dong, spoke to me through a translator, although in the second year he got a few English words. But d’you know what? My Korean was good. I learned off a young player called Ham Sun-woo. When I joined up for my first pre-season, he’d come to my room. He couldn’t speak English but he was there, trying my hats on, looking at my watch. He had a good energy, a good vibe about him and we just clicked.“At first, we’d speak through the translator but he’d pick up little words that I would say and I’d pick up his words in Korean. That’s how I learned – just through him. And he learned English through me. Eventually we’d be able to go for dinner by ourselves because we could communicate with each other.“I’ve got a few stories from dinners out and I remember one from when I first got there and I went to eat with a couple of the young players. Their culture is that they always wait for the oldest person at the table to start eating first. So, my food didn’t come and theirs was there and they’re not eating. I was telling them: ‘Eat. Mine is coming.’ And they were like: ‘No, we can’t.’ I could literally leave my food, not touch it and they wouldn’t be able to touch theirs. That was a shock to me.”In the end, it was emotional. There was a one-year option in Lingard’s contract, which he did not take up, and, days before the Melbourne game, Seoul announced it would be his last dance. Lingard scored in a 1-1 draw, celebrating with a moonwalk, and fought back tears after when he watched a video on the big screen that paid tribute to “Our beloved captain”. It went on to say that Seoul would always be his home, his name forever remembered by the club.“I cried when I left United,” Lingard says. “And I made such a bond over these last two years with the players and fans that it was always going to be emotional again. I think I’ve left a strong legacy.”Explore more on these topicsFootballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

At that point, as Villa went six without a win, it wasn’t clear whether Rogers’ form was a symptom or a cause of Villa’s more general malaise.There was a volcanic touchline reaction from Emery on Sunday as well, but this was rather more positive. As Rogers swept in his second of the game to restore Villa’s lead, Emery ripped off his thick padded coat, spread his arms and roared. Villa were on their way to a 10th successive win and, having failed to win any of their first six games of the season, are somehow only three points behind the leaders Arsenal.Morgan Rogers double sinks Manchester United and keeps Aston Villa on leaders’ heelsRead moreAre they in the title race? That’s a rather hard question to answer.History, at least in the postwar era, a general sense of the status of the club, suggests not. And they have not been entirely convincing in many games this season, even as the wins have stacked up. In only two games this season have Villa had an xG more than 0.5 greater than their opponents, according to Opta. For a team that have just won 10 in a row, Villa look weirdly vulnerable – but at the moment the margins are falling their way.Their recent policy seems to be to trade blows with an opponent and wait for Rogers to bail them out with a couple of crisp finishes. It happened at Leeds, ithappened at West Ham, and it happened against Manchester United.Rogers’ first goal stemmed from a brilliant finish, arced just inside the post from the corner of the box, but United couldn’t have done much more to guide him into position. He spent a lot of the game drifting left, haunting the space behind Diogo Dalot. As John McGinn found Rogers, Leny Yoro didn’t exactly charge over to close the 23-year-old down, even though the ball was bouncing awkwardly and required some controlling. The England forward had time to wander back on to his right foot, create the angle for the shot and then deposit the ball into the top corner.View image in fullscreenUnai Emery erupts with a volcanic reaction of delight during Villa’s victory.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesWhen he replaced Jude Bellingham in the England side for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia 12 days before that draw at Sunderland, it felt very much that Rogers was being used to make a point. The thought of him starting at the World Cup next summer seemed distant, not with Phil Foden and Cole Palmer also contending with Bellingham for the role behind Harry Kane. But on this form, it’s hard to see how Rogers could be left out.At the moment, Rogers is in one of those golden spells of form in which it seems that he cannot miss. If the ball falls within the arc of his right foot, it will end up in the net. His second goal was essentially a slight scruffier version of his first as he seized on an Ollie Watkins lay-off, took advantage of further dilatory defending from Yoro and clipped his shot past Senne Lammens.Forewarned, you might have thought was forearmed, but perhaps Rogers’ right foot is becoming like Arjen Robben’s left: just because you know he’s going to whip the ball into the top corner doesn’t mean you can stop him. Or perhaps this was just a game againstManchester United, a club whose journey through the wilderness shows no sign of reaching a destination any time soon. They weren’t terrible, but they had nobody with the decisiveness of Rogers, while the tendency towards self-destruction remains strong.View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers is enjoying a golden spell for Aston Villa during their 10-match winning run.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/ShutterstockCan Villa sustain this? Logic says not. United had more shots and more shots on target than Villa. They’ve won each of their last eight games by a single goal. They’ve conceded in all but one of those games. Regression to the mean might be the biggest rival Villa have to face over the coming weeks. Rogers, surely, cannot keep on thrashing the ball into the top corner.Perhaps there is another reality in which, rather than results trending towards performances, performances begin to trend towards results. Maybe Watkins rediscovers his best form and starts scoring again. Maybe Jadon Sancho turns into the player he looked at Borussia Dortmund. Maybe Harvey Elliott rediscovers his form. Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres will eventually return from injury. Perhaps there is in that the possibility of a title challenge, but they surely cannot keep relying on Rogers.But then nobody expected this. Nobody thought Villa would be third at Christmas. And certainly two months ago, nobody thought Rogers by the end of the year would be spearheading a title charge while looking like a vital England player. The current run is to be savoured precisely because it feels so unlikely. As Rogers stood in front of the North End at the final whistle conducting the cheers of the crowd, he seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it. As he deserves to. These spells are rare in football and should be relished.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaManchester UnitedUnai EmeryanalysisShareReuse this content"

But Soufiane Rahimi hit the spot-kick straight down the middle, striking the knee of the goalkeeper Yannick Pandor and watching the ball loop away to safety. But they eventually broke down the resistance as Díaz got deserved rewards for his continual probing and El Kaabi’s goal ensured a respectable scoreline.Pandor made several other good stops to keep down the score in the closing stages as his teammates began to tire, although Comoros had a chance for an equaliser four minutes after Díaz’s goal but Rafiki Saïd shot straight at the Morocco goalkeeper Yassine Bounou in their first chance of the match.“The opening game is always difficult but we came good in the second half,” said the Morocco coach, Walid Regragui, after his team extended their record-breaking run of successive victories by a national team to 19. In October they went past the previous best of 15, set by Spain from 2008-09.There will be concern in the home camp, however, after their captain, Romain Saïss, limped off after 18 minutes, the centre-back leaving the field in tears. He spent the first half of the year sidelined by ankle surgery and only last month returned to the national side after a year’s absence.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Morocco football teamComorosAfrica Cup of Nationsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Many of the Liverpool staff were puzzled as to why the challenge did not merit a further look from the video assistant referee during a match in which Tottenham had two other players sent off.Immediately after the game, Liverpool’s head coach, Arne Slot, referred to the injury as “not a good thing”. “If a player doesn’t even try to come back, that is usually not a good thing but I cannot say anything more than that,” he said. “That is just gut feeling and nothing medical … let’s not be too negative yet. We don’t know yet. Let’s hope he is back with us soon.”Slot will face the media again on Tuesdayas he previews Liverpool’s home game with Wolves on Saturday.It has been a frustrating time for the Sweden international after his protracted summer move from Newcastle, with the striker having no pre-season and then a troublesome groin injury punctuating his campaign. He scored against Southampton in the Carabao Cup and against West Ham in the league but he has found it difficult in an evolving side. Ironically, the link-up between Florian Wirtz and Isak – which set up the goal against Tottenham – looked to have kickstarted his Liverpool career before the crushing blow of the injury.Isak’s extended absence will stretch Liverpool’s forward options, with Mohamed Salah now at the Africa Cup of Nations and Cody Gakpo not ready to return from a muscle injury until early in the new year.It leaves Slot with just Hugo Ekitiké, who has five goals in his past four games, and the little-used Federico Chiesa as his only senior forwards. The academy graduate Jayden Danns is stepping up his recovery from a hamstring injury and could be an option in the new year.Liverpool are hoping to bring in Antoine Semenyo from ­Bournemouth in a £65m deal, with the in-form wide man having reportedly agreed personal terms over a January move. Manchester City and Manchester United are also keen on the Ghana international but he is believed to favour a move to Anfield.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Veiga was shown a straight red card six minutes before half-time, and Lamine Yamal was able to return to action after medical treatment.Lamine Yamal netted Barcelona’s second in the 63rd minute, pouncing on a rebound after a flurry of chances that Villarreal’s defence failed to clear.Villarreal continued to put up a fight despite their numerical disadvantage, with Georges Mikautadze breaking clear only to be denied twice by the Barcelona goalkeeper Joan García, who produced sharp saves from both the initial effort and the rebound before a third attempt drifted wide.Atlético Madrideased to a 3-0 victory atGironain La Liga on Sunday thanks to first-half goals from Koke and Conor Gallagher and one in added time from the substitute Antoine Griezmann as they ended the year with a fourth straight win in all competitions.In Germany undefeatedBayern Munichcruised to a 4-0 victory atHeidenheimto go into the winter break with a nine-point advantage at the top of the Bundesliga standings.View image in fullscreenLuis Díaz celebrates with Harry Kane after putting Bayern 3-0 up.Photograph: Stefan Matzke/sampics/Getty ImagesThe Bavarian side, who have gone through 2025 without an away league loss, are on 41 points, with Borussia Dortmund second on 32 following Friday’s 2-0 win at Borussia Mönchengladbach.

Prêcheur is the second WSL manager to lose their job in the space of four days, followingRehanne Skinner’s sacking by West Hamon Thursday.Chelsea hammer dismal Liverpool 9-1 and storm into Women’s League Cup semisRead morePrêcheur had been in charge of London City since the summer of 2024. He led them to the second-tier title last term during his first season in charge, winning 13 out of 20 Championship matches to pip Birmingham to the title on the final day of the season by a two-point margin.The former Paris Saint-Germain coach’s exit has been described by sources as a purely footballing decision. The 43-year-old is understood to have been popular around the club but the long-term ambitions of the owner Michele Kang, who also owns Washington Spirit and the eight-time European champions OL Lyonnes, are to take the team to the very top.A club statement about Prêcheur’s exit on Sunday said: “Under his leadership, the club achieved a historic promotion and finishes the first half of the season in sixth position.“Following careful consideration, the club believes that now is the right time to begin a new cycle and pursue a different strategic direction for the next phase of its development. London City Lionesses sincerely thanks Jocelyn Prêcheur and his coaching staff for their professionalism, commitment, and significant contribution to the club’s recent sporting success, and wishes them every success in their future careers.“Further updates regarding the club’s coaching structure will be communicated in due course.”Meanwhile West Ham are to appoint the former Juventus head coach Rita Guarino as their new women’s team manager, the Guardian understands.According to sources, talks have been going on between the club and the former Italy striker for several weeks and she should be unveiled before Christmas. It will be the 99-times capped former international’s first managerial role in England.View image in fullscreenRita Guarino won 99 caps for Italy and four consecutive titles as head coach of JuventusPhotograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty ImagesIt is understood a contract until 2027 is most likely for the 54-year-old, who won four consecutive Serie A titles when in charge of Juventus, between the 2017-18 and 2020-21 seasons. She also led the Turin-based side to two domestic cups, making her among the most successful and respected coaches in the history of Italian women’s football.West Ham’s assistant manager, Steve Kirby, the former Bristol City head coach, took interim charge of the club on Sunday. They lost 5-1 in their League Cup quarter-final against Manchester City.Guarino would be only the second female coach to manage West Ham, after Skinner, who had been at the helm for two and a half years.Her first game in charge would be a tricky trip to face the defending league champions, Chelsea, on 11 January, after the WSL’s winter break, before an FA Cup fourth-round trip to face the WSL2 side Newcastle United five days later. She would not have a home fixture until welcoming Tottenham to Dagenham on 1 February.West Ham have won one and drawn two of their 11 games and are two points above the bottom side, Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLondon City LionessesWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The scoreboard read 9-1. “At least it wasn’t 10,” one home fan said while trudging back to the car. The truth is, it could have been worse, had Chelsea not rather bizarrely had two set-piece goals ruled out for soft-looking fouls in the box that no Liverpool player seemed to appeal for.Vote to exclude best teams from League Cup shows calendar needs urgent attention | Suzanne WrackRead moreFor Chelsea, it was a very happy end to a calendar year in which theywon a domestic treble, as they cruised to victory with a hat-trick from Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and two goals from an in-form Sam Kerr, setting up a semi-final at Manchester City in January. For the home side, this was a new low in a dismal first half of their campaign.Gareth Taylor, the Liverpool manager, said his team “were punished today for all the errors we made”, adding: “We were naive in some of our play and gifted them goals. You can’t do that against a team like Chelsea.“The levels were off, and then when you don’t perform to an acceptable level of sprinting, competing, reacting, then obviously you’re going to make it really difficult.”It took just 13 minutes for Chelsea to take the lead. Niamh Charles’s low ball into the box found Kerr, who darted in front of her marker with ease and found the near, bottom corner.If Taylor was frustrated at a lack of pressure on the ball for the first goal, Chelsea’s second, just four minutes later, will have infuriated him further. His team gave away possession inside their own defensive third and allowed Kerr to finish neatly.It was three when Wieke Kaptein turned smoothly on the edge of the box and lashed in a good finish. Aggie Beever-Jones’s effort made it 4-0. The only sour note for Chelsea came when the England striker had to be withdrawn with a potential injury before half-time. Sonia Bompastor explained it was an ankle problem, saying: “Hopefully it won’t be too bad, but it doesn’t look great at the moment.”View image in fullscreenAggie Beever-Jones scores her team’s fourth goal before going off injured.Photograph: Ben Roberts Photo/Getty ImagesIn the second half, Rytting Kaneryd began to steal the show, curling in a beauty from distance. Jenna Clark did claw one back for Liverpool from close range but any respite was brief, with Rytting Kaneryd’s deflected effort making it 6-1 just moments later. Sjoeke Nüsken and Millie Bright added further goals for the visitors either side of Rytting Kaneryd completing her treble.Liverpool could scarcely win the ball off the holders and they were slow to react to second balls, most notably as Nüsken’s left-footed shot came back off the crossbar and Rytting Kaneryd was the first to reach the rebound for her hat-trick. In the stands, the atmosphere among the home supporters was increasingly dejected. Surprisingly, the majority of the 2,467 crowd stayed until the end. Taylor’s expression was downbeat, to say the least. His players’ body language even worse.Bottom of the league and now emphatically out of the League Cup, pressure will be higher than ever on the former Manchester City coach, who was appointed in August and has not yet overseen a league win.His injury-depleted squad meant he could name only five substitutes compared with Chelsea’s nine, and he said recruiting players in January would be “really important”.Taylor said: “I always like to think logically and it’s really tough to be super, super critical because we’re working tremendously hard here to improve this thing. But there are a lot of things we need in order to be able to do that.”He felt this had been “a game too far” for his side. Asked what his message had been to his players after the game, Taylor, who was calm and did not seem angry with his team, said: “Just that we’re trying to get help.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballLiverpool FC WomenChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

It was not Lawrence Shankland battering the ball beyond Jack Butland. Instead, the latest indicator that this is aHeartsteam of proper substance arrived as they conceded a 95th-­minute and ultimately immaterial goal to Youssef Chermiti.Frankie Kent, who had misjudged a through ball, was enraged. The Hearts goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow soon threw his gloves on the turf in anger. Derek McInnes, the manager, later only half joked that neither player was as furious as he was. Even losing a clean sheet is a cause for concern at Tynecastle nowadays. A year ago, they were rumbling around in the lower echelons of the league.Liverpool fear Alexander Isak sustained significant injury at TottenhamRead moreHearts’ fairytale continues at vertiginous pace. McInnes and his players were already guaranteed to sit top of the table at Christmas – a feat previously achieved by a non-Old Firm team in 1993 and Hearts themselves two years earlier – but decided to demonstrate their superiority overRangersfor good measure.Rangers have a game in hand but the dozen-point gap between them and a Hearts team who have lost just once in 18 fixtures looks ominous for Danny Röhl. Rangers are not a particularly convincing operation either on or off the field.“I expected us to win today,” said McInnes. This was no intended slight on the opposition. Instead, it was an example of the supreme confidence McInnes has in a group of players who are turning heads way beyond Scotland. The manager also, quite rightly, rails at the notion Hearts are only enjoying this potentially historic campaign because both Glasgow giants are fumbling around in the dark.“I have such huge belief in this team,” said McInnes. “We have a good thing going here. I am not surprised by how we are doing.” Next up, a mouth-watering derby at Easter Road which will bring Hearts to the midway point in their Premiership season.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Fernandez’s header flies narrowly wide of the Hearts goal.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThe pubs of Gorgie were already giddy places before Aberdeen’s Kenan Bilalovic equalised at Celtic Park. Late goals from Kieran Tierney and James Forrest means the Hearts’ lead over Celtic remains at six points. The defending champions hold a game in hand. Hearts, though, may be content that Wilfried Nancy’s first win as the Celtic manager presumably lowers the likelihood of him being removed from office quite yet. Only Celtic’s January spending power is keeping them as title favourites.Hearts are a team with an indomitable spirit. There is no sense that they feel a weight of history when looking to become the first team outside of Celtic and Rangers to win the league for four decades. Hearts have not been champions since 1960. Make no mistake, the class of 2025 quietly believe they can go all the way. Doing so would give the Scottish game such an almighty boost.Hearts’ recruitment has earned plaudits. McInnes is due praise, too, for his rejuvenation of those already in the building. Cammy Devlin was exceptional for Hearts once more in central midfield. Shankland, who endured a dismal season in 2024-25, led the home attack superbly. Kent had no cause to be hard on himself after repelling all before him for 94 minutes.It should be recognised that Rangers actually started this fixture solidly enough. They were denied the opening goal due to Bojan Miovski’s offside position as he latched on to an Emmanuel Fernandez header. A strength of Hearts – one of many – is that they always look capable of steadying themselves from tricky positions.And so it proved. Alexandros Kyziridis and Cláudio Braga played a short corner which had Rangers scrambling. A pinpoint Kyziridis cross found the head of Findlay. Butland had no chance as the ball found the top corner of his net.The former England goalkeeper was more culpable as Hearts doubled their lead just four first-half minutes later. Shankland’s confidence was such that he was willing to shoot from a seemingly improbable angle. Braga had fed his teammate with a knockdown. Butland should still have saved at his near post but instead looked shocked that Shankland had aimed for goal.Quick GuideLate Celtic goals give Nancy first winShowWilfried Nancy welcomed his luck turning as late goals from Kieran Tierney and James Forrest gave the under-fire  Celtic manager his first win of his tenure, a 3-1 victory against 10-man Aberdeen at Celtic Park.The Frenchman was under intense pressure after starting his tenure with four straight defeats but Benjamin Nygren set Celtic on their way on Sunday knocked the ball in from eight yards in the 39th minute.The Dons defender Dylan Lobban was shown a straight red card just before the break for fouling Celtic's Daizen Maeda but in the 74th minute the Dons substitute Kenan Bilalovic stunned Parkhead with an equaliser. However, in the 87th minute Tierney restored Celtic's lead from a few yards out before his fellow replacement Forrest added a third in stoppage time.\"I don't believe in luck but since I've been here I haven't had luck,\" Nancy said afterwards. \"We have hit the post in almost every game, but the most important thing is the resilience of my players.\"I'm really proud of what they did because they had so many big chances and suddenly against 10 men you concede a goal like this. Their heads could have gone down but they didn't. They kept attacking. Attack, attack, attack, waves, waves, waves.\"The result leaves Celtic six points behind the leaders, Hearts, with a game in hand.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Hearts had an advantage their game-management skills meant they were never likely to concede. All of 10 seconds remained when Chermiti delivered a rare moment of cheer in his hapless Rangers career to date.Curiously, for a team who have seemed in a regular state of crisis, this was Rangers’ first league defeat away from home in 2025. “We missed a big opportunity today and that is hard to take,” said Röhl. The German will generally be spared blame. Rangers have no chief executive or sporting director. Umpteen of their players look far too meek to wear this ­particular jersey.“I want us to be relevant,” added McInnes. “I want us to keep playing in important games.” He need have no worries on either front.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipHeartsRangersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There was no snarling and no sullenness from the former champion, just a nod of recognition, an admission that sometimes the other guy just plays darts from the gods. And here the other guy was Wesley Plaisier, the world No 92 from the Netherlands, a player of rich potential, but nothing that would ever have suggested he was capable of a shock of this magnitude.The talent has always been there: last year he joined a select group of players to have won a Pro Tour event despite not holding a tour card.Former champion Michael Smith crashes out of PDC world darts against ZonneveldRead moreAfter making his way through Q-School, this year has been harder. He lost his grandmother in the summer. He barely made a dent on the European Tour or in the majors. But strange things can happen under the Palace roof. And over three lightning-quick sets Plaisier raised hell.He hit nine of his 16 attempts at double, and did not blink even as the world No 9 roared back at him in the third set with consecutive 11-dart legs on throw. “I still can’t believe it,” he said.“My biggest victory ever, I think. I don’t know how I did it. I was so nervous. I can’t explain it in words. I felt like I could get ahead. But I didn’t expect to win it.”As Price smiled and allowed the giant Plaisier to wrap him up in his arms, the Welshman could be forgiven for wondering just what had hit him.He came into this tournament as one of the favourites, convinced he could regain the tournament he won so strangely under Covid conditions in 2021. The Alexandra Palace crowd, for so long a thorn in his side, had been converted into a wind at his back, singing his name, even booing Plaisier as he lined up his match darts.View image in fullscreenWesley Plaisier lets out a huge roar after beating Gerwyn Price.Photograph: Wayne Tuckwell/ProSports/ShutterstockEven though he has not reached a major final, this has still been a cautiously promising year for him, the year he got his swagger back and re-established himself as a genuine contender. He will still be in contention for next year’s Premier League. But perhaps this defeat exposed the major remaining flaw in his game: a softness in the key moments, the ability to play well and still lose.As Plaisier began the match with a 130 checkout and kept up the pressure, Price fumbled his way into the game. His normally reliable tops failed him: just two from eight attempts on his favourite double. At other times, he simply didn’t get a look. Remarkably, in six of the 13 legs Plaisier didn’t even allow him a dart at double. Price’s exit, following that of the No 8 seed, Chris Dobey, on Saturday, further opens up the draw for Luke Littler, who now cannot face another top-16 player until the semi-finals at the earliest. Littler looked briefly mortal in his own second-round game, coming through 3-0 after an uncharacteristically lukewarm performance in which the world No 146, David Davies, missed five darts for the opening set, and 16 in total.Did it matter? Probably not.The great championshave always been occasionally prone to a cold start, and as the format lengthens – we go from best of five to best of seven in the third round – the chances of an ambush recede appreciably.View image in fullscreenThe world champion Luke Littler celebrates winning his second-round match.Photograph: Wayne Tuckwell/ProSports/ShutterstockAfterwards, Littler revealed that Mensur Suljovic had texted him as soon as the draw was made to say: “See you in round three”. And so it is that the teenage titan and the ageing Austrian will meet next weekend, after the latter beat an enraged Joe Cullen 3-1. Enraged at Suljovic’s glacial pace of play and his extravagant celebrations, Cullen accused his opponent of “cheating”.“If that’s darts, I don’t want no part of it,” the former Masters champion fumed on X. The truth is that there has always been a grey area between legitimate tactic and deliberate gamesmanship. But ultimately the responsibility for Cullen’s darts is his alone. Suljovic was certainly happy to play the innocent. “I never ever do this as a provocation,” he says. “Sorry, Joe. I love you, man.”Elsewhere the former champion Rob Cross came through 3-1 against Ian White, the German No 1, Martin Schindler, ended the challenge of Keane Barry in three tight sets and Krzysztof Ratajski continued his impressive start to the competition by comfortably despatching Ryan Joyce. Luke Woodhouse, the world No 25 from Worcestershire, looks in decent nick too, beating Max Hopp 3-0 to set up a tantalising third-round tie against Andrew Gilding. The 16th seed Damon Heta won the final two sets to beat the Swiss debutant Stefan Bellmont 3-2 and will next take on Cross.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsnewsShareReuse this content"

Amorim said he expects the United captain to miss their home Boxing Day game against Newcastle and fears Fernandes will be sidelined “for a while” after being forced off at half-time in the defeat against Aston Villa.Fernandes clutched his left calf after a sixth-minute tackle from Boubacar Kamara and was later fouled by another Villa midfielder, Amadou Onana. He was replaced by Lisandro Martínez at the interval. The Argentina centre-back played alongside Manuel Ugarte at the base of United’s midfield, with Kobbie Mainoo absent with a calf issue sustained in training on Saturday.Morgan Rogers’ golden spell spearheads Aston Villa’s most unlikely title charge | Jonathan WilsonRead more“I will see what we’re going to do,” Amorim said of Newcastle’s visit to Old Trafford. “I think Kobbie Mainoo is out and Bruno is out. So we will see. We are going to find solutions. No excuses. We need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.”Amorim made it clear United cannot attempt to hastily rectify their injury crisis in the transfer market. The United head coach said he would seek solutions from within rather than press the director of football, Jason Wilcox, and chief executive, Omar Berrada, into buying reinforcements.“What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes,” Amorim said. “I’m not going to get [together] with Jason and Omar and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan.“If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in a moment where we need points but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. You can feel in this moment that we are going to struggle, but we will see. We have to deal with it.”Unai Emery revealed he was unhappy with the match-winner Morgan Rogers before he scored his decisive second goal. Matheus Cunha cancelled out his magnificent opener in first-half stoppage time. “I was not happy with how Morgan was performing in the first half, because we needed more,” theAston Villamanager said.“He scored the second goal because he was aggressive for the second action. He is a protagonist, a fighter, a really good guy and his attitude every day is really fantastic. When he is getting numbers like today we are proud of him and everybody.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimAston VillaUnai EmerynewsShareReuse this content"

While England’s white-ball record under McCullum is poor, with his sideknocked out of the Champions Trophywithout winning a game in February and losing a home one-day international series to South Africa in September, the fact that the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka begins on 7 February could earn him a reprieve.Stokes said in the immediate aftermath of the Adelaide defeat that he “absolutely”wants to stay on as Test captainafter the Ashes, which is likely to come as a relief to the ECB, who will certainly be desperate to retain his services as a player for as long as possible. The 34-year-old signed a new two-year central contract before the Ashes which will expire at the end of the 2027 World Cup.Rob Key’s position as director of cricket will also be the subject of internal discussion given he appointed McCullum and wholeheartedly backed his attacking approach, as well as also giving him the white-ball job at the end of last year, which has not worked out.The former Kent and England batsman had been behind the decision to split the Test and white-ball roles when he replaced Giles following the last Ashes tour, initially appointing Australian Matthew Mott as the limited-overs coach before sacking him last summer following poor performances in 50 over and T20 World Cups in 2023 and 2024. Key’s own decision-making is likely to be scrutinised as a result, including his seemingly dismissive approach to the County Championship, which has left many including players including Jamie Smith and Jacob Bethell short of red-ball practice coming into the Ashes.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamAshes 2025-26Brendon McCullumBen StokesECBThe AshesCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite resting several front-liners, including Finn Russell, they ran in eight tries againstNewcastleto bounce back emphatically from last week’s Champions Cup defeat in Toulon.They simply had too much firepower for Newcastle who were shut out for the last 53 minutes of the game.Greg Fisilau double edges Exeter to comeback victory at SaracensRead moreIf there was a disparity between the starting lineups, the bench mis-match was colossal and Bath’s head coach, Johann van Graan, rubbed it in by introducing all eight of his replacements in one fell swoop with 25 minutes to go.It was a shock and awe move with Sam Underhill, Ted Hill and Thomas du Toit emerging from the fog and Bath, leading 33-14 at the time, eased away with three more fine tries to reach their half-century.“I’ve done seven before but it’s the first time I’ve done all eight,” said Van Graan. “Newcastle have come back in a few games if you look at the previous few weeks and once we got 12 up, I knew that if we put them away then, that was the end of the game.“There’s no perfect science in it, but I thought it worked well on the day.Fifty points away from home, topping the league at Christmas, I would have taken that before the game.”For Newcastle the wait for liftoff after the Red Bull takeover in the summer continues.Successive Challenge Cup victories in Europe hinted at a corner being turned but this was their 19th consecutive league defeat, stretching back to 29 November last year, and a bruisingly heavy one in their own backyard.They are no longer short of money but the business of buying in talent is not straightforward. The big movers at present, such as George Martin, are choosing more established top-end clubs.Another sellout crowd at Kingston Park demonstrated the enthusiasm for the revolution amongst the north-east public. When it begins to bear fruit, Newcastle are going to need a bigger ground.View image in fullscreenBath players surround Dan Frost after his try for the champions.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAAnd the sense is that they will get there in the end – it is inconceivable they won’t with the backing they now enjoy – but it is proving not to be a case of simply waving a wand.Newcastle held the lead after half an hour with tries from flanker Ollie Leatherbarrow and No 8 Amanaki Mafi. But Bath had already flexed their forward muscle by then through two tries from hooker Dan Frost and once prop Archie Griffin had thundered his way over from close range to open up a 19-14 interval lead, Bath pulled away. Francois van Wyk secured an all-front-row bonus point three minutes after the break.Then, with Newcastle shorthanded by the loss of centre Sammy Arnold to the sin-bin for ball-killing. Will Butt crossed for Bath’s fifth.The visitors’ heavy mob, plus captain Ben Spencer, rumbled on and pushed the champions out of sight. Tom de Glanville went over in the corner with 13 minutes to go from a lovely pass by Spencer and two minutes later the England scrum-half finished off a flowing length-of-the-field breakout.It was the try of the game from an impressive Bath who added an eighth in the last minute through Hill.Quick GuideNewcastle 14-50 Bath: teams and scorersShowNewcastle Red Bulls:Grayson (Chamberlain 75); Spencer, Hearle, Arnold (Clark 71), Obatoyinbo; Connon, Benitez-Cruz; Brocklebank (Hancock 71), McGuigan (Fletcher 53), McCallum (Palframan 53), Usher, de Chaves (Baker 64), Leatherbarrow, Christie, Mafi (Gordon 53).Tries:Leatherbarrow, MafiCons:Connon 2.Sin-bin:Arnold 53.Bath:De Glanville; Cokanasiga, Harris, Butt, Hennessey (Redpath 55); Carreras, Carr-Smith (Spencer 55); van Wyk (Obano 55), Frost (Dunn 55), Griffin (du Toit 55), Richards (Hill 55), Molony, Bayliss (Barbeary 55), Staddon (Underhill 55), Reid.Tries:Frost 2, Griffin, Van Wyk, Butt, De Glanville, Spencer, HillCons:Carreras 5Referee:Hamish Smales.

They were very clinical in the second half,” said the Newcastle head coach, Alan Dickens.“It’s certainly frustrating off the back of what we thought was a good first half.”Entertainment is the name of the matchday experience at Newcastle under the new owners and the Christmas tunes were trotted out during breaks in play to keep morale up, but for all the seasonal spirit they remain pointless this season.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyNewcastleBathRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It was Chicago’s sixth win this season after trailing in the final two minutes and its most incredible – Green Bay had a win probability of 99%.Chicago moved closer to their first trip to the postseason since 2020 with a rare victory in the NFL’s oldest rivalry. Counting the playoffs, the Bears are 7-30 against Green Bay since 2008. They would clinch a playoff berth if old nemesis Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Detroit Lions on Sunday.Cairo Santos kicked a 43-yard field goal that got Chicago within 16-9 with 1:59 remaining. The Bears had no choice but to try an onside kick, and Josh Blackwell recovered it.The Bears tied it with 24 seconds left when Williams beat an all-out blitz on fourth down and lofted a pass to a wide-open Jahdae Walker in the right corner of the end zone for a six-yard touchdown. Coach Ben Johnson opted to have Santos kick the tying extra point rather than go for the two-point conversion.In overtime, the Packers had fourth-and-1 at the Chicago 36 when backup quarterback Malik Willis fumbled the snap. Chicago took over at the 36 and, four plays later, Moore hauled in the winning TD from Williams with Keisean Nixon draped all over him, setting off a wild celebration. Two weeks earlier, Nixon sealed the Packers’ win when he intercepted Williams in the end zone.Already missing Micah Parsons after the star pass rusher suffered a season-ending knee injury in a loss at Denver last week, the Packers had to get by without Love, who took a helmet-to-helmet hit from Chicago’s Austin Booker in the second quarter. Love jogged to the medical tent and then headed to the locker room.Williams completed 19 of 34 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns. Moore had 97 yards receiving with Rome Odunze missing his third straight game due to a foot injury. The Bears won their sixth in a row at home since a season-opening loss to Minnesota.Love led two field goal drives and completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards before getting hurt. He had nine touchdown passes and only two interceptions in five previous games against Chicago.Willis was 9 of 11 for 121 yards and a touchdown. Romeo Doubs had 84 yards and touchdown catch.Philadelphia Eagles 29-18 Washington CommandersThis was not a terrific performance by the Super Bowl championPhiladelphia Eagles, from a fumble on the opening kickoff to a pair of penalties on the tush push to three wide-left field-goal tries to a halftime deficit.Still, Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and company eventually got going in the right direction and clinched a second consecutive NFC East title by beating theWashington Commanders29-18 on Saturday night. The game included a late brawl after Barkley tacked on a two-point conversion to increase the Eagles’ lead to 19 points.Starting plays under center far more frequently than he did earlier in the season, Hurts completed 22 of 30 throws – with 15 of those caught by AJ Brown or DeVonta Smith – for 185 yards, two touchdowns and no turnovers. He connected with Smith from five yards out in the first half and with tight end Dallas Goedert from 15 to put Philadelphia ahead 14-10 in the third quarter, capping a 17-play, 83-yard, 10-and-a-half-minute drive.Hurts also did plenty of damage on the ground, gaining 40 yards on seven carries for the Eagles (10-5), who have followed a three-game losing streak by winning two in a row. They are the first team to top the NFC East in back-to-back seasons since Philadelphia did it every year from 2001 to 2004; the gap since then was the longest drought without a repeat champ for any division in NFL history.Barkley added a 12-yard TD run for the Eagles, part of his 21-carry, 132-yard performance.With the Commanders (4-11), now losers of nine of their past 10 contests, already eliminated from postseason contention, there was plenty of green in the stands. Chants of “E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!” frequently rang out and cries of “Cooooop!” greeted Cooper DeJean’s interception of Josh Johnson, Washington’s third-string quarterback, who came in when Marcus Mariota went out after the opening drive in the third quarter with an injured right hand while Washington led 10-7.View image in fullscreenTank Bigsby of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates a game-sealing touchdown against the Washington Commanders in the fourth quarter on Saturday.Photograph: Greg Fiume/Getty ImagesMariota started Saturday in place of Jayden Daniels, the reigning AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year who led the Commanders to the NFC title game last season – wherethey lost 55-23 to Philadelphia– but has been shut down in 2025 after dealing with a series of injuries and appearing in only seven games.The chilly evening started inauspiciously for the Eagles: Will Shipley coughed up the opening kickoff when he was hit by Mike Sainristil, and Washington recovered at Philadelphia’s 27, eventually getting a field goal.The Eagles went up 7-3 on a drive that was nearly all Hurts. He was 4 for 5 passing for 53 yards, including a six-yard TD toss to Smith, and added a 14-yard run, too.That’s not to say Hurts was perfect. Hardly. He missed open receivers, including one particularly egregious overthrow of Brown and another miscommunication with Smith.The Eagles’ Jake Elliott managed to send three field-goal attempts wide left in the first half. Elliott entered 17 for 22 on field goals this season and hadn’t missed more than one in a game. But he was off on a 43-yarder in the first quarter. Then, 13 seconds before halftime, Elliott couldn’t get a 57-yarder to go through the uprights – but that one didn’t count, because Washington’s Tyler Owens was flagged for being offsides. Given another chance, now from 52 yards, Elliott went wide left once more.Three players were ejected after a brawl involving plenty of others from the Eagles and Commanders broke out late in the fourth quarter Barkley scored on a two-point conversion to boost his team’s lead to 19 points with about four and a half minutes left.Two members of Washington’s defense – Javon Kinlaw and Quan Martin – and one Eagles player – offensive lineman Tyler Steen – were disqualified after being flagged for unnecessary roughness.There was a ton of pushing and shoving, and a lot of jawing, too, as the scrum spread across the grass. Six flags were thrown by officials as the chaos ensued.Eventually, order was restored, and Barkley, Hurts and Commanders linebacker Bobby Wagner spoke to each other.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsPhiladelphia EaglesWashington CommandersChicago BearsGreen Bay PackersShareReuse this content"

Experts say it’s helping them growResearchers warn generative tools are helping militant groups from neo-Nazis to the Islamic State spread ideologyBen MakuchSun 21 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 08.01 ESTShareWhile theartificial intelligenceboom isupending sections of the music industry, voice generating bots are also becoming a boon to another unlikely corner of the internet: extremist movements that are using them to recreate the voices and speeches of major figures in their milieu, and experts say it is helping them grow.“The adoption of AI-enabled translation by terrorists and extremists marks a significant evolution in digital propaganda strategies,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. Webber specializes in monitoring the online tools of terrorist groups and extremists around the world.“Earlier methods relied on human translators or rudimentary machine translation, often limited by language fidelity and stylistic nuance,” he said. “Now, with the rise of advanced generative AI tools, these groups are able to produce seamless, contextually accurate translations that preserve tone, emotion, and ideological intensity across multiple languages.”On the neo-Nazi far-right, adoption of AI-voice cloning software has already become particularly prolific, with several English-language versions of Adolf Hitler’s speeches garnering tens of millions of streams across X, Instagram, TikTok, and other apps.According to arecent research postby the Global Network on Extremism and Technology (GNet), extremist content creators have turned to voice cloning services, specifically ElevenLabs, and feed them archival speeches from the era of the Third Reich, which are then processed into mimicking Hitler in English.Neo-Nazi accelerationists, the kinds who plot acts of terrorism against western governments to provoke a societal collapse, have also turned to these tools to spread more updated versions of their hyper-violent messaging. For example, Siege, an insurgency manual written by American neo-Nazi andproscribed terroristJames Masonthat became the veritable bible to organizations like the Base and the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, was transformed into an audiobook in late November.“For the last several months I have been involved in making an audiobook of Siege by James Mason,” said a prominent neo-Nazi influencer with a heavy presence on X and Telegram, who stitched together the audiobook with the help of AI tools.“Using a custom voice model of Mason, I re-created every newsletter and most of the attached newspaper clippings as in the original published newsletters.”The influencer lauded the power of having Mason’s writing from “pre-internet America” and turning it into a modern-day voice.“But to hear the startling accuracy of predictions made through the early eighties really puts a milestone on the road and it changed my view of our shared cause on a fundamental level,” he said.At its height in 2020, the Base held a book club on Siege, which was an instrumental influence on several members who discussed its benefits in a hypothetical war against the US government. A nationwide FBI counterterrorism probe eventually swept up over a dozen of its members on various terrorism related charges in the same year.“The creator of the audiobook has previously released similar AI content; however, Siege has a more notorious history,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, “due to its cultlike status among some in the online extreme right, promotion of lone actor violence, and being required reading by several neo-Nazi groups that openly endorse terrorism and whose members have committed violent criminal acts”.Webber says pro-Islamic State media outlets on encrypted networks are currently and actively “using AI to create text-to-speech renditions of ideological content from official publications”, to supercharge the spread of their messaging by transforming “text-based propaganda into engaging multimedia narratives”.Jihadist terrorist groups have found utility in AI for translations of extremist teachings from Arabic into easily digestible, multilingual content. In the past, American-imam turned al-Qaeda operativeAnwar al-Awlaki, would personally have to voice English lectures for recruitment propaganda in the anglosphere. The CIA and FBI haverepeatedly cited the influenceof al-Awlaki’s voice as a key contagion in the spread of al-Qaeda’s message.On Rocket.Chat – the preferred communications platform of the Islamic State, which it uses to communicate with its followers and recruits – a user posted a video clip in October with slick graphics and Japanese subtitling, remarking on the difficulties of doing that without the advent of AI.“Japanese would be an extremely hard language to translate from its original state to English while keeping its eloquence,” said the pro-Islamic State user. “It should be known that I do not use artificial intelligence for any related media, with some exceptions regarding audio.”So far, not just the Islamic State, but groups across the ideological spectrum, have begun using free AI applications, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify their overall activities. The Base and adjacent groups have used it for the creation of imagery, while also acknowledging, as far back as 2023, the use of these tools to streamline planning and researching.Counterterrorism authorities have always viewed the internet and technological advancements as a persistent game of catch-up when it comes to keeping pace with the terror groups who exploit them. Already the Base, the Islamic State and other extremists have leveraged emergent technologies likecrypto to anonymously fundraiseand share files for 3D printed firearms.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NazismUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Using the built-in features and easily available additional apps, there are plenty of clever things you can do with your smartphone.Turn your phone into a tape measureThe iPhone’s Measure app uses augmented reality and the device’s camera to calculate everything from ceiling heights to room dimensions – handy for those DIY tasks that require a quick decision. And, good news for parents,Applealso points out that you can use it to measure a person’s height: the digital equivalent of etched markings on the wall.Become a detectoristMetal detectors cost a pretty penny, but many modern devices have built-in magnetometers designed to help improve the accuracy of GPS within apps. Those magnetometers are also used in metal detectors, and some apps can harness that tech to detect metal. These apps are never going to be as accurate as tailor-made products, but if you are looking for a way to entertain the kids on a day at the beach, they will more than suffice in seeking out small bits of treasure.Turn it into a remote controlView image in fullscreenRemote control … smartphones can operate your other connected media devices.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesLost the television remote down the back of the sofa again? ManyAndroidphones include an infrared blaster that can mimic the signals from your TV, set-top box or air-conditioning remote, while others can talk to smart devices over wifi or Bluetooth. Download a remote control app, point your phone at the screen, and you can adjust the volume, switch inputs or change channels. Link in smart lights, speakers and streaming sticks and your handset becomes a control centre for the whole living room … though it does make it easier for teenagers to prank you by changing channel mid-episode.Digitise your old holiday snapsGot a load of old photographic negatives that you never got round to having developed – or worse, lost the prints for?Appssuch as FilmBox, available on iOS and Android, can turn your negatives into digital photos (provided you shine light through them). Even better, you can then use image-editing apps to fine-tune the colour balance on old, washed-out pics.Don’t get stuck on hold to companiesSome companies now offer a callback service so you don’t have to stay on hold for ages, but if they don’t, you can use your phone to do the same thing. TheHold Assist feature, available on iPhones running iOS 26, gives you a notification when it hears a human voice on the other end of the line, so you can get back to work safe in the knowledge you won’t miss your turn.Create 3D scans of objectsNewer iPhones and some Android handsets have depth sensors such as lidar (light detection and ranging) that can map the world in 3D. Install a scanning app, slowly walk around the object or room you want to capture, and your phone will stitch those readings into a detailed 3D model. You can then export it for 3D printing, game design or simply to keep a precise digital copy of bulky items before you sell or recycle them. It is also a neat way to document the contents of a rented flat for insurance purposes, or capture awkward corners when planning renovations.Map and record hikes without mobile signalIf you are an outdoorsy type, phones can help keep you on key routes and out of danger. Make sure you download offline maps before you go somewhere remote, and your phone’s GPS will still work without reception. Hiking and cycling apps can track your route, elevation and distance, then save it so you can retrace your steps – or share it with friends later.Create a stethoscopeCombined with smartwatches, smartphones have become a boon for those wanting to keep track of their health, but it’s possible to go even further. A2022 trialto see whether a smartphone’s microphone could accurately measure heartbeats – similar to how a stethoscope works – demonstrated that “mobile technologies are aviable way of recording heart sounds”. A commercial “cardiac screening tool” app isalready availablein the US.Help yourself get to sleepSome people spend money on white noise machines and then cart them around in their suitcase when they are travelling. But it’s possible to achieve the same benefit with your iPhone. Simply go to the accessibility section in your device’s settings, then tap on audio & visual. You can then turn on a variety of sounds, from white noise to ocean waves to crackling fire, to lull you to sleep.Match that tricky paint colourTrying to repaint a wall without the original tin to hand can feel impossible. Instead of juggling paper swatches, use your phone’s camera and a colour-matching app to sample the shade directly from the wall, or cushion, or curtain, or whatever you like. The software will suggest the closest equivalents from major paint ranges, and some apps also let you preview those colours on a photo of your space, combining paint matching and augmented reality in one go.Live translate menus, signs and handwritingOn a foreign holiday and not sure what to eat or where to go? Live translation capabilities in apps such asGoogleTranslate mean that it need not all be Greek to you. A combination of image recognition and live translation tools can identify foreign symbols and transpose English-language translations over the top of them, so you should never end up with an unexpected surprise for dinner.Identify unknown plantsView image in fullscreenPlant-spotter … apps can identify plants, animals and other objects.Photograph: Evgeniia Siiankovskaia/Getty ImagesNot sure what is growing along your boundary wall, or what kind of cactus you have just bought? AI-powered insights from your smartphone’s camera lens can identify plants, animals and other objects, with surprising accuracy. Specialist apps abound for identifying plants, but the catch-all service provided by Google Lens is a surprisingly accurate way to distinguish your hydrangeas from your hosteas.Amp up your webcamBuilt-in cameras on all but the most expensive laptops and PCs are low-resolution and cope poorly in low-light conditions, meaning you’re blighted with the curse of blurry Zoom calls. Smartphone cameras are way more souped-up, and have automated processing that constantly tries to improve your image quality, making them ideal for replacing your webcam. On iPhones and Mac computers, you need tolook for the Handoff feature. On Android devices and Windows, follow the instructions in the “Link to Windows” app to set it up.Measure sound levelsIf you have noisy neighbours or need to keep track of how much noise builders are subjecting you to, a slew of decibel-measuring apps are available. They are surprisingly accurate thanks to plenty of training, and some councils will even encourage complainants to download them and log intrusions if they are in dispute with neighbours.Make an ad hoc smart homeNear-field communication (NFC) is mostly associated with tap-to-pay transactions, but cheap NFC stickers (you can get 50 for less than £10 online) can act as programmable buttons for your life. Stick one by the front door and set your phone to turn on the wifi and lights when you tap it; put another on your bedside table to start a sleep playlist and enable Do Not Disturb. With a little experimentation, you can build simple smart home routines without buying a hub.Hang paintings straightIf you have ever hung a picture, stepped back and realised it is slightly wonky, your phone can spare you constant tinkering. Many handsets include a built-in spirit level tucked away in the compass or measurement tools. Lay your phone on the top edge of a frame or shelf and it will show when you have hit level, down to a fraction of a degree. It’s ideal, too, for levelling bookshelves, curtain poles and even sorting out a wonky table leg.Scan documentsBuying a house or getting a mortgage often involves having to sign contracts. Some companies will let you do this digitally, but if you are someone who prefers putting pen to paper, you can still do so – with the help of your device. Even most entry-level smartphones now include functions that allow you to turn a photograph into a perfectly serviceable scan by pinpointing the corners of a document when you hover your camera over it.Turn physical photos into animated ‘memories’Family prints stashed in shoe boxes don’t have to remain static. Scan them into your phone and apps, including Google Photos and Apple Photos, and shots can automatically be grouped by people, places and dates, then stitched into short “memories” complete with music and transitions. Some tools even add subtle motion effects to still images, making them feel more like miniature films than dusty snapshots.Measure your blood oxygen saturation and predict problemsView image in fullscreenSignalling issues … Sensors on your smartphone help health apps to estimate blood oxygen saturation.Photograph: Trevor Williams/Getty ImagesHealth apps increasingly tap into sensors on your phone or connected watch to estimate blood oxygen saturation, a useful signal for issues such as breathing difficulties or altitude sickness. While they aren’t a replacement for clinical-grade monitors, they can function as an early warning system, highlighting unusual trends over time and prompting you to seek medical advice if something looks off, rather than ignoring a nagging feeling.Empower your PowerPoint presentationsDitch the dodgy clickers and install the companion app for PowerPoint, Keynote or Google Slides, and you can control your presentation remotely, swiping between slides and seeing your speaker notes on your handset. Some apps turn the screen into a virtual laser pointer, letting you highlight key details on a big display while roaming the stage, instead of being tethered to a laptop. At a pinch, you can even mirror your phone’s screen to a TV or projector and present straight from the handset if your main computer misbehaves.Share your live location to stay safeMost phones let you share your real-time location with trusted friends or family for a set length of time through apps such as WhatsApp. It is a low-effort safety net when walking home at night, travelling alone, or meeting someone new, and beats the old “text me when you get there” ritual.Keep track of your dietView image in fullscreenCalorie counting … ‘Phones make food diaries far less of a faff’.Photograph: Sorrasak Jar Tinyo/Getty ImagesFor those who want to monitor what they are eating, phones make food diaries far less of a faff. Nutrition apps enable you to scan barcodes or search databases to log meals, automatically tallying calories and nutrients across the day. Many sync with your step counter or smartwatch, so you can see the balance between what is going in and what you are burning off, without being nose-deep in a spreadsheet. They are just as useful for people trying to eat more fibre, reduce salt or spot foods that trigger symptoms as they are for anyone counting calories.Turn your phone into a mini podcast studioWith a cheap plug-in microphone and a basic editing app, your phone can record and trim surprisingly high-quality audio. It’s enough to start a podcast, capture interviews on the go or simply send better-than-voice-note updates to friends and family.Control your phone with your voiceWant to take a photo just by saying “click”? You can create voice-activated commands for your iPhone in the accessibility section – although it’s not super-straightforward. Tap on voice control > commands > custom, then select “create new command”. From there, you can type in a voice trigger (such as “click”), which then takes you into a recording of your screen. Everything you tap (like jabbing where the camera button is) will then be repeated whenever you say that phrase. So now when you open your camera and say “click”, hey presto! This can be useful, for automating all manner of repetitive tasks, although it only works when voice control is activated.Supercharge your shopping listPaper scribbles stuck to the fridge are no match for dedicated shopping list apps. Apps such as Bring!, AnyList or Listonic let you share a live list with housemates or partners, tick off items in real time as you walk the aisles, and even add products by scanning barcodes or importing ingredients directly from online recipes.Explore more on these topicsMobile phonesSmartphonesAppsAppleGoogleAndroidiOSfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, many people seeking a test need to wake up early to snag a date before the bots do and, even then, they are looking at a long and arduous wait.Despitemoves from the government to address the issue, an audit report released this week found plans to cut the wait for a driving test to seven weeks by the end of the year would not be achieved until November 2027.One of the main barriers is an exodus of driving examiners. Only a net 83 more driving test examiners have been hired despite 19 recruitment campaigns since 2021, with the average wait for a practical test now at 22 weeks across Great Britain, according to the National Audit Office.So, why is it so hard to recruit Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) driving examiners, and are instructors – who used to flock to test centres for a more stable career – tempted by the current offer?Leon Woodman, 35, Devon, former driving examinerIn his previous job, kitted out with a bright hi-vis and Battenberg-marked car, Woodman was often mistaken for a police officer. “I was working as a traffic officer for Highways England. I was dealing with everything from hard-shoulder breakdowns to fatal incidents,” he said.View image in fullscreenLeon Woodman: ‘I moved on because of the money. I was growing a family and I was jealous of a few mates of mine who were hybrid working.’Photograph: @theexexaminerAfter a friend suggested he become an DVSA examiner, Woodman took on the advice and joined a local test centre.He said he wanted to bring a “positive attitude” to his new role. “I really enjoyed the job. I remember it took me two goes to pass my driving test. I remember my first one having this really miserable driving examiner and I thought: ‘This is pure torture’. Then my second driving examiner was fantastic. He came out with a smile on his face and I said: ‘That’s the way I want to be,’” said Woodman.But the job did come with challenges. “You quite often get those times where you’ve stopped a crash from happening because you’ve taken control of a vehicle and then you’ve got to do another test within the next five minutes. That’s what people don’t realise about the job,” he said.On the other hand, Woodman said it was “nice to make an impact on people’s lives every day” by telling them they had passed. “Some people break down in tears and other try to give you a hug.”Despite enjoying the job, Woodman left the DVSA in June 2023. “I moved on because of the money. I was growing a family and I was jealous of a few mates of mine who were hybrid working,” he said.As government workers, DVSA driving examiners are paid on a civil service pay scale. They are designated executive officers, maxing out at just over £30,000.“Prices for lessons went up quite a bit after Covid and instructors were earning a lot more than they were previously,” said Woodman . He thinks that has “slimmed down” the DVSA’s pool of people.Jason Sykes, 54, Dewsbury, former driving examiner and current instructorWhen Sykes first switched from being a freelance driving instructor to a DVSA examiner in 2016, he was happy. “At the time, I was taking home a similar amount of money without having to put in nearly as many hours. I was getting holiday pay, sick pay and a reasonable pension. I got my weekends back and I finished at the same time every night. I loved the job,” he said.But, after Covid, things changed. He was vocal to senior DVSA figures about the issues he was experiencing with the job, including, he said, the recently departed chief executive, Loveday Rider.He said he had met her on four occasions and brought up examiner’s poor wages and the “dodgy” booking system which allows bots and less reputable instructors to buy up tests and sell them at a hugely inflated price. “It’s not fair on the learner,” he said.Sykes switched back to being a driving instructor but he still has fond memories of being an examiner. “I had one lady, her name was Jean. She was 82 years old. She had been here five times and she was desperate to pass.“She’d started to learn to drive when she was about 20 and then she met her husband. After this, she had no reason to need to drive any more because her husband drove,” said Sykes.View image in fullscreen‘It’s not fair on the learner’ that a ‘dodgy’ booking system allows bots and less reputable instructors to buy up tests and sell them at a hugely inflated price, says Sykes.Photograph: YouTubeAfter her husband died, she still wanted to get around so she started learning to drive again. “She passed her test when she was 82. It was amazing and lovely giving somebody that age a pass certificate,” said Sykes.On the other hand, there are some close calls, including one instance that left him “drip white”. He recalls one young woman who wanted to do her test in her own car, which she had hardly driven, because “that’s the car that she’s going to be driving when she passes”, he said.“The instructor was sat in the back. As we emerged out at the end of a road, the candidate on test had missed the fact that there was a car transporter with about 12 cars on it hurtling up the road at 30 miles an hour towards us,” said Sykes.Promise of seven-week driving test wait in Great Britain ‘unlikely to happen until 2027’Read more“She tries to pull out but she fumbles at the controls. She reached for a manual handbrake in the car but there wasn’t one, only an electric one she was unfamiliar with. I said: ‘Drive, drive, drive.’ I went drip white, so did the instructor. We just pulled up to the side of the road and I went: ‘I think we’ve seen enough.’”Joshua Ramwell, Stafford, 39, driving instructorRamwell, who runs the YouTube channelJosh the Driving Instructor, has been an instructor since 2019. Before this, he was a teacher. Does being a DVSA driving examiner tempt him? “If I’m completely honest, no,” he said.While Ramwell takes his “hat off to examiners” who have his “complete and full respect”, he thinks it can be quite a thankless job. He said: “When you pass someone, they generally thank the instructor. And if you end up failing someone, examiners end up being blamed for it.”He was a relative late bloomer to driving, getting his licence at 22. He said the most rewarding part of being an instructor was when students get a “lightbulb moment”, whether struggling with a clutch or taking on a daunting roundabout.View image in fullscreenJosh Ramwell: ‘When you pass someone, they generally thank the instructor. And if you end up failing someone, examiners end up being blamed for it.’Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The Guardian“You can see it in their eyes, the cogs working, and next thing you know, they’re absolutely perfect at roundabouts,” he said.Ramwell has had many success stories but, like most instructors, some near-misses as well.“I had this really lovely girl but she suffered a lot from anxiety. We were driving down the road and unfortunately, there was another driver behind us who might have been late for work or something because she was tailgating us a bit closer than you would like.“I told the girl: ‘Don’t look behind you. Just focus ahead, the roundabout’s coming up. In a minute you’re gonna have to press the brake.’“The second I said the word ’brake’, in the middle of the road at 30 miles an hour, she just full-on emergency stopped and I had enough time to shout ‘Noo’ before the person behind hit straight into the back of us. That was a very sad day.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringRoad transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I need money. It’s an emergency’: your child’s voicemail that could be a scamSteps to help combat fraud in which criminals use AI-generated replica of a person’s voice to deceive victimsShane HickeySun 21 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 02.02 ESTShareThe voicemail from your son is alarming. He has just been in a car accident and is highly stressed. He needs money urgently, although it is not clear why, and he gives you some bank details for a transfer.You consider yourself wise to other scams, and have ignoredtexts claiming to be from himand asking for cash. But you can hear his voice and he is clearly in trouble.However, the voicemail is the latest way in which criminals are using technology to defraud people. By taking a tiny snippet of real audio – just three seconds is enough – from a person, they can “clone” the individual’s voice using freely available AI technology. From there, they can make an recording of the synthesised voice saying exactly what they want.The criminals can record a voice from videos on social media or by calling someone and saying nothing. A victim just needs to respond with words such as “hello, who is there?” to give them material for their hoax.Oliver Devane, a senior researcher at the online security company McAfee, says this is a sophisticated example of spear phishing, or a personalised, targeted attack.“Having tested some of the free and paid AI voice cloning tools online, we found in one instance, that just three seconds of audio was needed to produce a good match,” he says.“Cybercriminals will often source this information from public social media profiles and other places online where people post about themselves, their families, their travels, and so on in an attempt to cash in.“The cybercriminal is betting on a loved one or family member becoming worried, letting emotions take over, and sending money to help.”What the scam looks likeA phone call or a voicemail, or even a voice note, will come through on your mobile and sound exactly like a loved one or friend.They will have been involved in an accident or they may have been robbed or injured. They will be distressed and there will be a sense of urgency.Whatever the circumstances, they will ask for money. They may not give details of why they need the money but they will say it is urgent. They may ask you to transfer it to an account that belongs to someone else.What to doAs with many scams, if you get a call or voicemail that asks for money, take a moment to stop and think. Does it really sound like the person you know? Are there strange speech patterns that are not accounted for by the fact that there is an emergency.Even if the phone number comes up as coming from one of your children, this is no assurance as the number can also be faked.“Try to remain level-headed and pause before you take any next steps,” says Devane. “Remember that cybercriminals are betting on emotions running high. They will play on your connection to the loved one and create a sense of urgency to prompt you into action.”Call the person who it seems left the message. They may pick up and be able to reassure you that they are OK. Remember the message has come by phone, so even if there is a real emergency they clearly can reach their device and get a signal.To prepare for the possibility of such scams, you can set up a codeword between you and your children so you know for sure when they are in trouble.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsCybercrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The letters charge the businesses, whose names – ShapeShifter Apparel, GenderBender LLC, TomboyX – indicate the nature of their wares, with neglecting to register these products as “medical devices”. “Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice,” the letters warn. “These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure and injunction.”The FDA has a lot of nerve. After all, its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, is helmed by a man who haspromoted fake “cures”for autism,such as chelation, a treatment for heavy metal poisoning thatkilled a childthis year. To headautism and vaccine “research”, Kennedy has appointed thecharlatan David Geier, who, with his father, has published studies backing the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism. To run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, he has named Mehmet Oz, who haspromoted quack treatmentslike green coffee bean extract andraspberry ketonesfor weight loss.This intensified federal regulation piles on more pain for transgender people, a crusade Trump launched on his first day in office with the executive order “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”. The order requires the federal government to recognize only two immutable sexes – male and female – and to issue identity documents such as passports in accordance with that edict. Congress is collaborating:a bill passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesdaywould make providing transgender care a felonypunishable by up to 10 yearsin prison.As the homeland security agency is doing to immigrants, HHS is attempting to disappear its own designated undesirables. But more than driving people into hiding or sending them to undisclosed detention sites, theTrump administrationbelieves it can legislate and regulate transgender and nonbinary peopleout of existence.The president’s definition of acceptable humanity is limited. If he had his way, it seems, all women would be white and blonde.But like women who seek to end their pregnancies in states and countries where abortion is illegal, transgender people will continue to seek hormones and surgery – only they will be forced to do so through black markets and unlicensed providers, risking illness, impairment and death. Transmasculine people who don’t get top surgery will bind their breasts; transfeminine people will tuck their bits. If they want comfort and style, they’ll pay more for it.Criminalization does not stop people from doing all they can to exercise the most fundamental human right: bodily autonomy. It just makes doing so more perilous.Transgender and nonbinary people have always existed and will continue to exist. They may be driven underground, but they will not disappear. The Trump administration knows it cannot eliminate people whose genders do not match their birth certificates. So instead, it will use any means it finds necessary to do what it does best: make them suffer.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

The fight against Maga Christianity starts locallyDoug Pagitt and Lori WalkeTrump’s movement has used the Christian faith to fuel oppression. Here’s how we are standing against itSun 21 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 17.56 ESTShareDonald Trump wants us to believe that the “war on Christianity” is spreading across the globe. The US president recently sounded the alarm on the “mass slaughter” of Christians in Nigeria while threatening aUS invasionof the African nation. We shouldn’t be surprised. This falls right in line with Trump’s ongoing attempts to project Maga Christianity on to the global stage and crack down on religious freedom.Maga Christianity represents a self-serving, commercialized version of the Christian faith – putting power over service and empathy – and it is everywhere in our federal government. In February, Trump announced a taskforce led by Pam Bondi with thegoal of rooting out “anti-Christian” bias. In September, Trump announced his plans toprotect prayer in schools. Later that month, he issued a memorandumidentifying anti-Christianity as a potential driver of terrorism. These are not just one-off incidents. This is a national effort to push the Maga Christianity agenda on Americans, and we’re already seeing the consequences.Despite the Bible’s clear call to “love thy neighbor”, the Maga movement has used its version of the Christian faith to oppress immigrants, oppose the rights of women and condemn the LGBTQ+ community. At the same time, we’ve seenshootings at places of worshipandarrests of faith leadersat peaceful protests.As faith leaders, our greatest strength during Trump 2.0 and the rise of Christian nationalism is our local congregations. It’s our ability to physically come together in our communities, communicate with one another, support our neighbors in need and elevate our own Christian values that set us apart.Faith leaders have a powerful role to play, especially as the Trump administration continues to use religion to divide us.In Oklahoma City and Minneapolis, we have been working with our congregations to uplift our own visions of the Christian faith and mobilize our communities from within – and we’re making progress.In Oklahoma City, these efforts date back to 2017, when the first Trump administration issued the Muslim ban and Islamophobia soared throughout the country. In response, a small group of faith leaders and community members, led in part by the pastor Lori Walke, began to meet regularly to see how they could join the sanctuary movement. With the understanding that there’s no clear to-do list when joining a resistance, the group dove headfirst into action and started a weekly vigil to support local immigrants.Over the years, the vigil took place through the rain, snow and sleet, and changed locations from outside churches to in front of ICE agencies and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services office so participants could accompany undocumented people to their appointments.This year, with the resurgence of attacks on immigrants, the group has reignited our weekly vigils and started immigrant-justice training sessions to educate community members on everything from what ICE is, what warrants look like and the rights of observers to the rights of people being detained and how community members can support them.These vigils and training sessions aren’t just building hope; they’re making real change. Individuals and families now have relationships with pastors and church members who are accompanying them to immigration hearings, assisting with paperwork and providing moral, spiritual and financial support. Vigils have translated into rapid response trainings in local congregations, equipping communities to offer more effective support of their immigrant neighbors. Earlier in November, they also organized a letter-writing campaign and hand-delivered more than 500 messages to the Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt, and the senator James Lankford urging them to protect immigrant neighbors.In Minneapolis, following the shooting at Annunciation Church that killed two children and injured more than 20 others, the pastor Doug Pagitt’s organization Vote Common Good worked hand-in-hand with Moms Demand Action and a broader faith-led coalition to demand the state ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The group brought these demands directly to the door of the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz,who recently announcedhe’d be holding a series of town halls to speak with his constituents about gun violence and the impact on children and families across the state. In Chicago, despite the presence of the national guard,faith leaders have continued to protestand stand their ground. In Florida, thefaith community has been outside “Alligator Alcatraz”for weeks on end, demanding its closure.Progress is not linear, and securing rights for immigrants and protections against gun violence will not come easily. But local actions will be a driving force that leads to change.Across the country, faith leaders and their communities are showing up in droves to stand up for their beliefs and push back against the hateful and divisive rhetoric that is a core emblem of MagaChristianity. Faith leaders and congregations are taking important steps to fight back and support our neighbors, and we need others to continue to join us to promote our good Christian values and put love before hate.What’s giving us hope nowIn Oklahoma, a state that consistently ranks in the bottom 10% of just about everything in which Americans want to “be best”, glimmers of hope can be seen in Voices Organized in Civic Engagement (Voice) OKC, a broad-based organizing coalition primarily made up of faith communities that range from Roman Catholic to United Church of Christ. Voice OKC is in the middle of its 1,000 Conversation campaign, an effort to strengthen relationships among member institutions, more deeply understand the pressures facing families in our communities and organize those who are willing to act together to build relational power. Voice’s commitment to finding common ground at the parish level through stories of shared experience and shared values is a model for finding our way forward as a nation. It’s not time to grow weary in working for good.Doug Pagitt is executive director of Vote Common Good.

He felt overwhelmed by the cacophony of carols, decorations and well-wishes from strangers. But moreover, he anxiously awaited the inevitable question: what are your plans for Christmas?Amid aloneliness epidemic, it’s no surprise Christmas is a challenging time for many. The heavy focus on family events and relationships can compound feelings of loneliness and isolation, especially for people experiencing complex family dynamics or estrangement, bereavement, “empty-nesting” or separation and divorce.Cost-of-living stress and end-of-year work pressures also contribute to Christmas being a time of malaise rather than merry-making.Andrew is not alone in feeling alone. Australians are finding it harder to make new friendsRead moreHarry’s distress was deepened by a colleague’s month-long commentary about Christmas. Her complaints – a hectic social calendar, kids’ end-of-year school activities, competing Christmas Day lunch invitations, the expense of dozens of gifts –served as a reminder that for Harry that Christmas was typified not by togetherness and cheer but isolation and sadness.His reticence was understandable. Childhood Christmases were tense and miserly, owing to his parents’ marital discord, financial strain and geographical distance from extended family. University friends provided holiday companionship during early adulthood but Christmas become an increasingly solitary affair as friends married and created traditions with families of their own.For Harry, Christmas was an annual spotfire. Riding a rollercoaster of anxiety and low mood, he willed the season to pass quickly while also feeling sad for another Christmas wasted. He found himself in a familiar situation each year – isolated, yet feeling it was too late to make Christmas a different experience.Harry was certainly feeling the pang of Christmas loneliness, but we agreed his distress wasn’t unique to December, nor to this particular year. Similar feelings arose around his birthday and other significant days. For Harry, Christmas magnified other times in his life when he felt forgotten, isolated or lonely.Therapy required a multifaceted approach. First, a plan to alleviate acute distress about Christmas. Second, consideration of Christmas in future years. We focused on three aspects of Christmas: past, present and future.Challenging assumptions about ChristmasFirst, we explored Harry’s thoughts about Christmas. Like many of us, his image of Christmas was more Hallmark than reality. He idealised Christmas as perfect and enjoyable for everyone but himself.We evaluated and challenged further thoughts about Christmas: “There are rules around what should happen at Christmas”, “There’s something wrong with me if I spend Christmas alone”, “Everyone else loves Christmas, and therefore I should, too”, and “People only invite me to their Christmas events out of pity”.At some level, he held hope for a Christmas season similarly busy to that detailed by his colleague. But given Harry’s family history and current personal circumstances, this was unrealistic. Being hooked on this idea triggered feelings of sadness and inadequacy, as he blamed himself for not being able to fulfil the Christmas ideal.Here, we also acknowledged the difficulties of Christmases past, allowing space to grieve the idea that those times could have been different.Strategies for this ChristmasDevising strategies around Christmas was a necessary but not sufficient part of therapy. Harry had spent enough Christmases alone to know available options – accept a Christmas Day invitation from friends, volunteer at the local soup kitchen, attend his neighbourhood pub’s annual “orphan’s Christmas lunch” or spend the day on a solo activity such as a hike. Revisiting these possibilities was important to provide some relief from anxiety about this year’s Christmas but was unlikely to alleviate Harry’s longer-term distress.Working towards new Christmas experiencesTherapeutic work beyond strategies to manage the current Christmas would be required for Harry to have a different Christmas experience in future years. Encouraging Harry to challenge his assumptions of Christmas brought a more balanced view, allowing space to think about creating new narratives and fresh ideas. In doing so, we identified Harry’s values relating to Christmas; not prone to materialism, he sought to prioritise social connection, inclusion and kindness.You don’t need alcohol on Christmas Day. It may be far more enjoyable if you stay sober | The modern mindRead moreSocial connectedness next Christmas would be dependent on establishing and maintaining social relationships during the coming year. This included plans to reinvigorate his social life through meet-up groups, reconnecting with old friends and joining community groups. He accepted an invitation for this year’s Christmas Eve celebrations, challenging his assumption that such invitations were extended only out of pity.Harry was also able to reframe his notion of spending time alone at Christmas as an indication of rejection or defectiveness. He recognised his quieter personality and tendency towards introversion, noting he wanted to balance socialising with others with time to rest and recuperate.Therapy with Harry was by no means a panacea for his Christmas dread. While some gains were made, his deep-seated distress would be difficult to shake. Avoiding comparisons with others and challenging his own assumptions around Christmas was key to making the best of this and future holiday seasons.*Harry is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify similar casesIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636 andLifelineon 13 11 14.

The basic answer probably touches on a few aspects of the 21st-century experience. One is the horror and conflict that seem to define the news almost every day. Another centres around the material pressures that increasingly grip supposedly peaceful countries: the never-ending cost of living crisis, and the impossibility for millions of people of a secure job, a dependable home and some halfway viable idea of the future.Something else demands a mention: the all-pervading mixture of absurdity, nastiness and anger fostered by the internet. Bigotry runs rampant. What we still rather laughably call social media now seem to operate on the basis that the ideal story mixes wildly improbable elements with the kicking-up of moral outrage (witness that ghoulish “online content creator” Bonnie Blue, who,having claimedto have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, ended the year byannouncing her supportfor Nigel Farage). You can check your feed in a mood of mild curiosity, but find yourself instantly pulled into what this results in: great storms of mockery, loathing and polarised shouting.The biggest prizes seem to go to the high-profile figures who cynically manage to turn all this to their advantage – which is the essential story of everyone from latter-day porn stars, through extremist “influencers”, to the current president of the US. And the resulting noise seems only to increase people’s feelings of anomie and disorientation, particularly among the generation that was born into a world remade by the internet, and then came of age amid the aftershocks of the crash of 2008. I get emails three or four times a week that paint this picture, crisply summed up in a press release from September,sent bythe British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy: “Young people are surviving, not thriving, with many feeling disconnected and pessimistic about their future.”Journalism can perhaps only scratch the surface. Really evoking and exploring the whole surreal mess is the job of novels, plays, films, TV dramas and records. And when it comes to music, this year has delivered an absolute peach: Euro-Country,the third albumby the Irish singer-songwriter Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, better known as CMAT.To quoteits 29-year-old creator, “Every song touches on an emotional detail of what it’s like to have come up in this era of capitalism and what it’s done to us all.” It is an album replete with visions of people becoming more and more lonely and alienated, but that also makes a stand for a basic humanity: itaches, basically, and combines its portraits of an increasingly bleak world with an implied insistence that we could all play our part in something better.Now, you do not necessarily need to know any of this to appreciate CMAT’s brilliance. Plenty of her best songs are about matters of the heart. If you are one of the tens of thousands of people who watched her and her band play over the summer (not leastat Glastonbury, where she achieved what music-biz cliche would call a career-defining performance), you will know that she is a flamboyant, funny and self-confident onstage presence, and the pleasure of watching her play live is more about dizzying entertainment than social commentary. But the basic point still stands: the best musicians are always lightning rods for their time, and she is easily 2025’s best example.Some of the album’s most incisive lyrics are focused on her home country. Fittingly, the cover of Euro-Country portrays Thompson emerging from a fountain at a retail destination near her home town of Dunboyne, in County Meath: where she comes from, she has said, is increasingly a place characterised by “shopping centres and cement and roads”, where “There’s been years and years of basically no social services … and everyone’s just been by themselves on Facebook, scrolling and getting radicalised by the far right.” These things, of course, are evident in lots of other countries. But if you really want to understand how raw economics can be an offence to the human spirit,Irelandmight be the perfect prism.View image in fullscreenThe Waterways, an empty and unsold housing development, in Keshcarrigan,County Leitrim, pictured in 2012.Photograph: Cathal McNaughton / Reuters/REUTERSSeven years ago,the Guardian sent me to reporton the housing crisis that was then gripping Dublin, and still does. Amid the European HQs of Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and what was then known as Twitter, I experienced a place where, to quote one stock line I heard all over the city, “Homeless families stay in hotels, and tourists stay in houses.” Everyone I met also talked about the “ghost estates” that peppered the country beyond its capital, built in the midst of the so-called Celtic Tiger boom, that were still vacant and had left no end of human wreckage.This is whatEuro-Country’s title trackis all about. “It was normal,” Thompson sings, “building houses / That stay empty even now.” She also makes reference to what happened to some people who bought into the dream and were left wrecked: “I was 12 when the das [ie dads] started killing themselves all around me.” That is quite a line to write and sing.There are other songs that fuse the personal and political. Iceberg is about how insecurity – both financial and personal – breaks people, and about a friend who “used to wanna pick fights and scream about any ol’ thing”, but is now “drowning”. There is a bracing, unsettling examination of the modern male gaze and its sinister consequences titledTake a Sexy Picture of Me. But Euro-Country’s key moment of triumph isThe Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, which perfectly captures the queasy, accelerated whirl of the 21st century, and how much it can warp how we relate to each other.As the writer and critic Dorian Lynskeyrecently put it, it’s about something quintessentially modern: “the tragicomedy of misdirected anger”. It portrays Thompson pulling in on the motorway for a sandwich, finding an outlet branded with Oliver’s name, and collapsing into a rage that even she doesn’t understand. “I’m wasting my time on seething,” she sings. Her phone is an implied presence: the most barbed lines (“I needed deli but God, I hate him”) might easily have been posted online. And though the lyric is often hilarious, it hints at something incontestably true: the fact that as we rant about other human beings, what really puts us in that mood – which takes us back to housing, jobs and all the rest – grinds on.I first sawCMATplay almost two-and-a-half years ago. She was performing in a big top at a festival in Shropshire, to an audience of a few hundred. As the show went on, more and more people began to realise the level of talent right in front of us, and responded accordingly. But I now appreciate something else: Thompson does what the best singers and songwriters do, perfectly crystallising their time while inspirationally making a stand against it. In a lot of great art, after all, there is always a sense of defiance. Hers is full of it, which is why it is such a brilliant carrier of something that this year sometimes threatened to snuff out: a very human kind of hope.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

It can’t happen soon enoughSun 21 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTShareOne of the great joys of Christmas for me has been being able to share my love of The Nutcracker with my son. Last year, I took him to see a child-friendly version by the Let’s AllDanceballet company. The look of wonderment and recognition on his face when the music started up is a memory that I’ll treasure for ever.I’ll confess that the idea of taking a then two-year-old to a ballet had struck me as faintly ridiculous, one of those painfully middle-class-coded things I find myself doing as a parent (see also Mini Mozart). That kind of thinking, though, is in itself elitist, because who says ballet, or classical music, should be only for rarefied audiences? The popularity of The Nutcracker, not to mention shows such asThe Snowman, which has been running at London’s Peacock theatre for28 years, is testament to how children respond joyfully, and instinctively, to dance.They are also natural dancers themselves. Walking past a school playground recently, I saw a crowd of four- and five-year-olds dancing to Is This Love by Bob Marley and the Wailers with their teacher. The way they jumped and twirled so unselfconciously was beautiful to see.Against a backdrop of cuts to arts funding, though, children are being deprived of the chance to learn more about the dance that comes so naturally to them, whether that’s doing it or watching it. When schools don’t offer dance – and many don’t – this adds a further barrier, especially to pupils from deprived backgrounds who may not have access to the cultural sphere outside school time. A 2023 Ofsted report on physical educationnoted: “Many schools do not match the ambition of the national curriculum. In two-thirds of the schools, dance is not taught to all pupils, or the dance content being taught is not well organised.”That’s why the work of companies such as Let’s All Dance is so important. “Yesterday we held a relaxed performance for some children with special needs in Banbury,” says Orit Sutton, the artistic director. “They were free to come and go as they wished but they didn’t budge for the whole show! They were all totally engrossed and then clapped and cheered at the end … It was incredibly moving and really proves that live, professional ballet should be accessible to everyone, not just an elite, wealthy few.” (To underline this ethos, some of their tickets for The Nutcracker in December 2025 cost as little as £10, and you can alsodonate ticketsto children from low-income families.)It’s easy to feel depressed about access to and funding of the arts, but there is so much hope to be found. London dance space The Place – which isshowing The Magic Flutethis Christmas – has worked with more than 4,000 children from Camden primary schools to let them experience dance as participants, audience and creators, and they do an annual playground tour as well.In a videoabout The Place’s Camden Partner Schools programme, creative learning producer Maria Ryan says: “We have had feedback from teachers who tell us that the children are more focused in class, they can concentrate better, they work better together, they communicate better, and they are more confident in their own abilities – and dance really can encourage all of these developmental processes.”Being in London has huge advantages when it comes to children’s interaction with the cultural sector, but there are similar initiatives elsewhere. Suffolk’sDanceEastalso works with schoolchildren, including those in rural primaries in key stages one and two, through an initiative calledDigital Primariesthat allows them to livestream regular science and PSHE sessions taught through dance. And in the north-west of England,Cheshire Dancedelivers cross-curricular dance projects to schools.It was announced in the summerthat the Department for Education is to continue funding student bursaries for the National Centres for Advanced Training in Dance, a scheme that delivers pre-vocational dance training to 10- to 18-year-olds in 10 dance centres across England on the basis that a career in dance should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background. The outreach portion of their grant funding has been cut, and it was feared that the centres would be forced to close.The big hope is that, after years and years of arts funding cuts and changes to the curriculum, the Labour government will be more committed to creative education in all its forms. The November 2025 curriculum report does show a much better recognition of dance as more than a simple physical activity, but as a “creative discipline”, the teaching of which should involve aspects such as choreography and performance. There are encouraging signs throughout the report that creative subjects are to be made a lot more important.A favourite print I have on my wall is ofa lino cut by the artist Roger Zogolovitch. It shows people blissfully dancing, and the words: “Dance is dreaming with your body. Dance is the hidden language of the soul.” I love it because it captures that very human impulse to express ourselves using movement, regardless of whether it’s in the club, the school playground, or on stage at the ballet.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

How can Britain ignore Beijing’s provocations and human rights abuses?Sun 21 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 21 Dec 2025 13.36 ESTShareThe UK pushed hard to secure the release of Jimmy Lai, the newspaper publisher and British citizen who was a leading light in Hong Kong’s brutally suppressed pro-democracy movement. So, too, did press freedom and human rights campaigners. But the Beijing-appointed high court judges in the former colony convicted him anyway, finding Lai guilty last week on fake charges of trying to“destabilise” the Chinese Communist party(CCP). For Xi Jinping, China’s dictator-emperor, there is no greater crime.Protesting to China’s ambassador, the UK’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper,condemned the trialas “politically motivated”. She’s right, of course – but her angry words will make no difference. Beijing’s contempt for Britain’s views is as painfully obvious as the UK’s weakness and indecision in the face of Chinese hubris. The breaking of its solemn promise to respect Hong Kong’s freedoms after the 1997 handover typifies the arrogance and untrustworthiness of Xi’s CCP.The Lai travesty forms a sombre, unpropitious backdrop to Keir Starmer’s planned trade and business-focused visit to Beijing and Shanghai in January. Any half-decent Chinese fortune-teller would deem it ill-starred and suggest he stay home. Yet speaking at a City banquet this month,Starmer said it was his “duty” to go, to improve relations with a country he called “a defining force in technology, trade and global governance”. While admitting China posed “national security threats”, he downplayed them.This was typical Starmer, pursuing a balancing act amid overwhelming imbalances, seeking firm middle ground in a plashy bog. It’s true Britain’s stagnant economy badly needs foreign investment. It’s true China is a major export market. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, visiting China in January, spoke of a£1bn opportunity for jobs and growth.Yet in terms of Britain’s security and democracy, the global order and national self-respect, the price of doing business with this predatory authoritarian regime, in uncertain hope of future, dependency-creating economic, financial and tech benefits, is too high – and potentially undermines UK sovereignty. Starmer risks walking into a bear trap in Beijing like the one he blundered into this year in Washington set by Donald Trump,another powerful authoritarian bully.China’s hostile regime is Britain’s undeclared enemy. The threat it poses takes many forms. Warnings about espionage,cyber-attacksandintimidation of exiled dissidentsare heard almost daily. Yet another hack was revealed on Friday, this time at theForeign Office, reportedly by China. MI5 says businesses,parliament and MPsare routinely targeted by Chinese intelligence agents. Yet a strange reluctance to act is discernible in Whitehall.It’s still unclear, for example, why the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying for Chinacollapsed this autumn. The Commons intelligence and security committee complained last week the government was“dragging its heels”over designating China a major threat to national security. And in a very political public debut, MI6’s new chief, Blaise Metreweli,deftly skirted the China question.Here’s what Metreweli didn’t say. China’s CCP leadership fundamentally challenges Britain’s values and interests around the world through its gross human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet;persecution of its Christian minority; aggressive trade polices (such ascurbs on rare earth mineral exportsand the“dumping” of subsidised steel); military threats to Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines;partnerships with Russia, North Koreaand Iran; and through itssupport for Moscow’s illegal war in Ukraine.China’srecord-level global export incomeandrapid nuclear and conventional weapons buildupsunderpin its ambition to replace the collaborative international rules-based order with a“great power” systemit seeks to dominate. A world remade in the CCP’s totalitarian image would be the antithesis of the liberal, lawful democratic model ostensibly championed by Britain.Starmer surely knows all this, yet tries to have it both ways – by separating politics and security from business and trade in much the same futile way people try to separate politics from sport. “Protecting our security is non-negotiable – our first duty. But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas,” Starmer argued. That’s why officials disingenuously downplay the threat. They worry untimely criticism could spoil his pitch.It’s a naive approach. The CCP has a hand in everything Beijing does. China’s security state, economy and commerce are intimately intertwined and ultimately inseparable, as a previous UK government recognised whenbanning Huawei from Britain’s 5G telecoms network. That’s how authoritarian regimes work. And centralised party control has tangibly increased under Xi. Any deals Starmer makes will inevitably have national security implications.Beijing is already demanding a down payment. It wants to build abig fortress-embassynear Tower Bridge. If permission is not granted by mid-January, Starmer’s as yetunconfirmed trip may be canned. How crushing a snub that would be. And revealing of how, in China, politics and security intersect.Starmer should have learned his lesson by now. His urgent need for favourable post-Brexit trade deals with another predatory regime – the Trump administration – has become inextricably mixed up with the repulsive politics of Israel-Gaza and UK defence policy – for example, its recent decision tobuy US combat jets. And like Xi, Trumpcannot be trusted: see howhe just renegedon Starmer’s much-trumpeted £31bn US-UK “tech prosperity deal”.All is not lost. A commonsense geopolitical alternative is available. Instead of kowtowing to hostile Xi andtreacherous Trump, Labour could and should be more energetic and braver in rebuilding ties with Europe. In facing shared security threats, tackling economic challenges and upholding democratic values, Europe is Britain’s natural home.In navigating the world, Starmer should follow a simple rule: hug friends close – and know your enemy. In this spirit, he should make his China visit contingent on the priorrelease of Lai.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsChinaOpinionKeir StarmerXi JinpingPress freedomEconomic growth (GDP)International tradeGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

Secular music wasn’t the thing. As a three-year-old, I would stare at Jesus Gave Me Water by Sam Cooke going round and round; I’d be hypnotised by the power, dexterity and raw passion of his delivery.The first single I boughtI Feel for You by Chaka Khan had zoomed to No 1. I lost my mind at the “Chak-Chak-Chak-Chaka Khan” bit. Because I was a good girl, and had done all my chores, I begged Mum and Dad to go uptown and buy it from Our Price in Wolverhampton.The song I do at karaokeI Have Nothing by Whitney Houston, because, frankly, I’m a show off. It’s a song that you aspire to do well, because there’s so much technicality involved in it. You need range and breath control. Because I’ve got that in my arsenal, I do it.The song that changed my lifeI lost my mind and heart when I heard Little Red Corvette by Prince when I was nine.

Sadly, no.The best song to play at a partyGet Ur Freak On by Missy Elliott absolutely bangs.The song I secretly like, but tell everyone I hateI don’t care what anyone says. Who Do You Think You Are by the Spice Girls is an absolute bop.The best song to have sex toThis is appropriate because we just lost him: Untitled (How Does It Feel) by D’Angelo. How does it feel?

But as one who has appreciated its lifelong benefits, do promise us one thing: Keeeeeeeep dancing!”Daly said: “Thank you so much to you all for your lovely words, it has meant the world.“Thank you for the support you’ve shown over the years.”Winkleman added: “It’s been an absolute privilege to spend our weekends with you.”The finalists performed three dances on the live show including a previous routine after a masterclass with the judges, a show dance, and their favourite dance from the series.Carney and Gu performed their Peaky Blinders-inspired Argentine tango to Red Right Hand by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, which received a perfect score of 40 points from the judges.They later performed their show dance to Inner Smile by Texas, receiving 37 points from the judges, before performing a football-themed jive to Blondie’s One Way or Another as their favourite dance.Daly and Winkleman will return for their last appearance as a presenting duo in a pre-recorded Strictly festive special which will air on Christmas Day.Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingClaudia WinklemanBBCEntertainment TVReality TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

So why is it still dismissed by critics?Ella RisbridgerSun 21 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTSharePeople buy lipstick when the world is falling apart. This genuine economic theory, known as the “lipstick index”, was first noted by Leonard Lauder (son of the more famous Estée). When the world seems very bleak – in the weeks and months after the twin towers fell, for instance, or after the 2008 financial crash – and spending generally goes down, lipstick sales trend strongly upwards.The psychological truth at the heart of this equation is real: when people have less than they need, they spend more on small, beautiful things. It’s easy, maybe, to dismiss this in the way most feminine-coded things are dismissed: frivolous, wasteful, foolish. But that would be a mistake. A single treasure, bright and gorgeous, is like a talisman; a candle in the night. It is possible, with your small candle, to make your way in the darkness. One delight, against all this. The world crumbles, and lipstick sales go up.And so, too, do sales of romantic fiction. Just as with lipstick, there were clear spikes in the numbers of romance novels sold after 9/11 and the 2008 crash. Perhaps unsurprisingly, in our current climate, sales of romantic fiction are at an all-time high.Print sales of romance fiction in the US have doubled in the last five years. Meanwhile, in the UK the romance and sagas category, which had for two decades made around £20m annually, leapt to a staggering £53.2m in 2022 during the pandemic, growing to £69m in 2024.Romantic fiction, however you define it, is about the things that matter mostThis has been an extraordinary year for romantic writing. Established American romance writers such as Emily Henry – her latest hit,Great Big Beautiful Life, tells the story of two authors vying to write the biography of a reclusive heiress who themselves fall in love along the way – have continued to sell thousands of copies, of course. But 2025 has also seen books such as Jessica Stanley’s widely acclaimedConsider Yourself Kissedsweep bookshops across the UK. Stanley’s book, in which an ambitious political commentator and aspiring novelist try to build a life together, was never conceived of as a romance novel, but it hits every beat of a traditional romcom. Similarly, Alison Espach’sThe Wedding People– in which an accidental wedding “guest” falls, sort of, for the groom – continues to stack up sales on both sides of the Atlantic. And literary fiction is growing more romantic in response; what is the perennially popular Normal People by Sally Rooney but a romcom at heart?Love is everywhere, and while that says nothing good about the state of our world, it says only good things about our desire for connection. Romantic fiction, however you define it, is about the things that matter most. It is about how we create community, and where that starts. It is about love and everything that happens because of it. These are the books that are selling; these are the stories people want to hear. Though you wouldn’t necessarily know it.So-called “romantasy” books such asA Court of Thorns and Rosesby Sarah J Maas and Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros climb to the No 1 spot and remain there for weeks, even months. They are widely read, loved, sometimes hated but always discussed – while being widely ignored by the critics. The genre is seen as too frivolous, or too domestic, to be taken seriously.And yet romantic fiction handles big themes: chronic illness, global warming, divorce, death, betrayal and despair. Depression, anxiety and PTSD often appear – trauma, almost always. Pain, too. There’s the housing market, issues around antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, fatphobia, sexism, classism, all kinds of interdepartmental hatred and fear. All kinds of horror, love and loss.These don’t just exist in booksdesignedto discuss these kinds of issues; these are the books that sell across the board, for pleasure. They are the books that people are really reading, and there is no subject too big or too bleak for there to exist romantic fiction about and around and because of it.View image in fullscreenFrom left: authors Alison Espach, Talia Hibbert, Sarah J Maas and Emily Henry.Photograph: prJasmine Guillory, for instance, writes (delightful) romantic fiction of the fluffiest kind: there are sweet treats and beautiful landscapes and fast cars and lacy lingerie. They are also sharp analyses of what it means to be fat and Black and a woman in the US today: the vulnerabilities, the dangers, the pleasures. UK novelist Talia Hibbert writes about nannies and single dads; artists and grumpy building caretakers; brooding security guards and sexy librarians. She is also writing about chronic pain, racism and complex family trauma. Queer romance (Casey McQuiston, Alexis Hall, Kate Young, so many more) is entering mainstream sales charts for the first time: Mills & Boon didn’t publish an explicitly queer title until – this is unbelievable – 2020.And yet the trick is to hold all this very, very lightly. When romantic fiction tackles the problems of the world it must do so with such grace that you barely notice. It must do so in a way that makes the reader feelbetterabout those things. Not for the romcom the unresolved ending, the unreliable narrator. The romcom must bring everything together, always, to a happy ending.It is the happy ending that throws people. That, critics of the genre like to suggest, is the part that marks these books as simple escapism – even fantasy. But life is full of moments that might function as a happy ending, if anything ever ended. The problem with real life is that it goes on; the joy of a book is that it can stop at the perfect point.The trick, I suppose, is to learn to identify those moments. As Kurt Vonnegut wrote: “notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point: ‘If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.’”The best romantic novels are books, at base, about noticing things: about noticing someone across a crowded room, certainly, but also noticing your friends, your family, the guy at the corner shop who always asks you how you are, a good coffee, a soft new jumper, cushions, crisps, oysters, the sky, the sea, the sunset. A good romantic novel is full of things that feel tangible and tactile.A good romantic novel is full of people and moments and things: not just the central couple, but everyone else, too. A good romantic novel teaches you to notice these things for yourself. I read hundreds of romantic novels last year – I was writing a book about romantic fiction – and by the end of it, I was different. I was softer. I was, I suppose, happier, though very little had materially changed. I had read books about love, and I saw more love in the world than ever before.The lipstick index tells us people want beauty. The romance index, if we can call it that, tells us that people want connection. People want each other, which is all we ever truly have to give.In Love With Love: The Persistence and Joy of Romantic Fiction by Ella Risbridger is published by Sceptre.

In the 16th century, Copernicus and his peers overturned that view with the heliocentric model. Since then, telescopes and spacecraft have revealed just how insignificant we are. There are hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way, each star a sun like ours, many with planets orbiting them. In 1995, the Hubble space telescope captured its first deep-field image: this showed us that there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in our known universe, huge wheeling collections of stars dispersed through space.Let’s take the International Astronomical Union’s definition of space as everything in the universe apart from our planet and atmosphere. Asking the question “who owns space?” seems laughable. Hubris at a whole new level. The idea that we could lay claim to the rest of the universe is beyond conceit. It’s like a group of atoms in my little toe becoming sentient and declaring that they now own my whole body.A few years ago, I postulated that space exploration could be divided into three distinct eras. The first was confrontation. It was the second world war that fuelled our first forays into the abyss, as this proved to be an effective way of lobbing munitions further. The space race was born from military competition – in a bid to establish superiority. The second era brought collaboration. The formation of the EuropeanSpaceAgency in 1975 and that symbolic docking between Soviet and American space vehicles symbolised what humanity could achieve collectively. But now we’re on the verge of a third era: commercialisation. Space exploration is no longer just the domain of nations, but of billionaires, private companies and start-ups promising holidays in orbit.Space should be regarded as a shared domain, similar to the high seas or AntarcticaOf course, the space industry has been commercial for decades – many communications satellites, Earth-observation systems and some launch vehicles are privately funded and operated. But what’s changing is that humans themselves are now part of the business plan, as we move from exploration to possible exploitation. Private space stations, space tourism, lunar and asteroid mining – this is the new frontier. So the question of ownership suddenly has legal, ethical and economic urgency.Legally speaking, the groundwork for managing space was laid long ago. In the late 1950s and early 60s, as rockets first breached Earth’s atmosphere, the United Nations drafted agreements to govern activities beyond our planet. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 set out some remarkably idealistic principles: “The exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind.”I would reword it to humankind, but I do like the sentiment.It’s a beautiful vision, but potentially an increasingly fragile one. As technology advances, these noble principles will come face to face with economic reality. When a commercial company finds a valuable mineral deposit on the moon or an asteroid, who gets to profit?I would argue that commercialisation is necessary – space needs to pay for itself, because without profit, humanity will stay “terra-bound” for centuries. Exploration is expensive, and governments alone can’t afford to foot the bill. If mining helium-3 or capturing asteroids helps fund missions that expand our knowledge, capabilities and improve our husbandry of our planet, that could be a good thing. But commercialisation must come with equity and transparency. Otherwise, we risk repeating the mistakes of our past, but on a truly cosmic scale.The comparison I often like to make is with the East India Company: a private British enterprise that became so powerful it could shape the politics of nations and at times had an army twice the size of Britain’s. It began as trade; it ended in domination. Could a similar dynamic unfold locally in our solar system, where a handful of today’s tech giants and billionaires control access to orbit, communications, and eventually, extraterrestrial resources? A monopoly in space would be dangerous for humanity. The challenge is to encourage innovation and investment without ceding ownership of the cosmos to a few individuals or organisations.The moon is a fascinating case study. For scientists, it serves as a natural laboratory – a place to study planetary history and test new technologies. But it’s also an appealing commercial target. There’s water ice at its poles, which can be split into hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. Its gravity is only one-sixth of Earth’s, making it a sound launch base for deeper space exploration. And some have suggested mining the lunar surface for helium-3, a potential fuel for future fusion reactors. The possibilities are tantalising. But who decides how the moon’s resources should be used, and by whom?The Outer Space Treaty forbids national appropriation, but it doesn’t explicitly prohibit private companies from extracting resources. That ambiguity has prompted countries such as the United States and Luxembourg to pass their own space-mining laws, granting rights to their domestic firms. Yet if each nation makes its own rules, could the result be chaos like the early wild west – or even conflict? Space, by its nature, demands global regulation.That’s why I believe we need to revive the spirit of the early treaties, not just in words but through action. Space should be regarded as a shared domain, similar to the high seas or, perhaps more fittingly, Antarctica. No one owns Antarctica. It is protected for peaceful research under an international agreement. That hasn’t stopped some countries from eyeing its minerals, but the principle remains: collective stewardship. Space warrants the same approach. The way we behave in the third era of space will define not just the future of exploration, but the kind of species we are. Do we carry our old rivalries and greed into the stars, or do we finally learn to act as one planet, united by curiosity and care?As always, I’m hopeful. I trust the new generation to do a better job, and space has a way of putting things into perspective. When astronauts look down at Earth from orbit, they describe a sense of awe, known as the “overview effect”. They see our planet as it really is, fragile and shared. Perhaps if we can hold on to that view, even as we venture further out, we might be able to reach for the stars in a way that benefits everyone.Dame Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock will deliver the 2025 Christmas Lectures from the Royal Institution.Further readingOrbitalby Samantha Harvey (Jonathan Cape, £9.99)Who Owns the Moon?by AC Grayling (Oneworld, £10.99)A City on Marsby Dr Kelly Weinersmith and Zach Weinersmith (Penguin, £11.69)Explore more on these topicsScienceThe big ideaSpaceAstronomyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He washeld for three months,missing the birthof his first child, by an administration that smeared his opposition to Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza as cheerleading for terrorism, while abusing immigration policy to silence him.At the movies this year, I was repeatedly reminded of Khalil, and others who have seen their altruistic activism reframed as violent threats that need to be snuffed out, in characters whose plights followed similar tracts. InWicked: For Good, Elphaba’s attempts to expose the lies told in Oz are twisted into death threats. InSuperman, Kal-El is investigated for being a foreign agent when he defends a community suffering under violent US-backed occupation. Even inZootopia 2, a bunny cop is framed for attempted murder because she is exposing an attempt to eradicate a marginalized population from their lands and erase their history.‘I think of those I left behind in prison’: Iran’s Jafar Panahi on life as a banned film-makerRead moreUnlike those examples (and there are more), the most compelling – and in my mind, best – movies this year dropped the buffer that science-fiction and fantasy have to offer. They gave us stories of fraught idealism and resistance to oppressive states that more immediately and urgently engage with what people across the globe are witnessing in this moment.Jafar Panahi’sIt Was Just An Accidentis about former political prisoners who think they found the man who tortured them on behalf of the Iranian regime. Kleber Mendonça Filho’sThe Secret Agentfollows a professor in hiding during the 70s military dictatorship in Brazil. And Paul Thomas Anderson’sOne Battle After Anotherstars Leonardo DiCaprio as a stoner former revolutionary on the run from fascist forces in the US, his paranoia not just a byproduct of the substances he abuses.View image in fullscreenWagner Moura in The Secret Agent.Photograph: APThese films form a triptych that have been scoring several critics’ best picture, director and international film prizes in unison, much like the one we celebrated a couple years ago, whenKillers of the Flower Moon,The Zone of InterestandOppenheimerexplored in their own ways how people compartmentalize their humanity to commit or accommodate genocide (incidentally those movies premiered just months before the siege on Gaza). This year’s movies also speak to and reinforce each other, telling stories not of individual heroes but of communities, tied together by systemic oppression, building solidarity. And they all cut through the tension with morbid and absurdist humor: the security guards in It Was Just An Accident busting out portable credit card terminals to take bribes; the dismembered leg in The Secret Agent hopping around, kicking down the gay occupants in a park, standing in for a brutal police force abusing marginalized communities; and almost everything about the white supremacists who call themselves the Christmas Adventurers Club in One Battle After Another. These gags invite us to laugh at how pathetic sinister forces abusing their powers can be, without tempering how scary it is to live in their world.The most righteously infuriating but incredibly empathetic among this batch is It Was Just An Accident, which doesn’t just portray the everyday people who oppose their government but is, in its own existence, an act of resistance, made in typical clandestine fashion (for Panahi) to avoid Iranian censorship. The Palme d’Or-winning film was borne out of Panahi’srecent imprisonment(for making films deemed “propaganda” against the regime), when he absorbed stories from fellow political prisoners that would inspire his characters in It Was Just An Accident.‘Everything is political’: how film can guide us through difficult timesRead moreThe film’s title is uttered in its opening sequence. A man named Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi) is driving his wife and daughter at night along a dark road when he accidentally strikes a dog with his car. The horrified young daughter blames her father for killing the dog. The parents try to reason with her. The dog died because of the poorly lit road and perhaps even the will of Allah. The daughter remains unconvinced by their attempts at shifting the blaming to the infrastructure and belief systems that shape their daily lives, instead of taking individual responsibility.That tension lingers over the rest of the movie, when Eghbal is knocked unconscious, hog-tied and held in the back of a van by an anxious alliance of former political prisoners. They are convinced that he was their torturer but are unsure how to positively identify him or what to do if their suspicions prove true.That’s the desperate set up in a tragicomic road movie that surveys the social landscape in Tehran (notably the progress borne from the Women, Life, Freedom movement as young women roam the streets treating headscarves as optional), while also asking questions for the country’s future. After the regime falls, how do the people carry the trauma? And what to do with those who collaborated with the state? Do they blame the system or follow that young daughter’s instinct, holding individuals accountable for their actions? In moving ways, the film’s moral compass is guided by children, especially after a surprise birth introduces a warm sense of hope for the next generation.That forward looking sentiment is there in The Secret Agent too, a paranoid political thriller that moves like Three Days of the Condor by way of No Country for Old Men to a samba drumbeat. It’s 1977. Carnival is raging. And Wagner Moura’s Armando, a professor, makes plans to escape the country. He is being smeared in local media by bad agents because he dared to criticize a corrupt bureaucrat lining his own pockets with public funds. He is also stalked by an assassin in league with a local police chief.View image in fullscreenJafar Panahi after winning the Palme d’Or at Cannes.Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/Invision/APAll these characters are either fathers or father figures to young men following in their footsteps, a generational thread that hits home when The Secret Agent jumps ahead to the present tense. Young archivists listen to Armando’s recorded testimonies as part of Brazil’s recent reconciliation efforts. Wagner re-emerges, now playing Armando’s son, in a bittersweet coda reflecting on cultural memory (or is it amnesia?), and how threats from the past can just as easily re-emerge for a new generation. Filho and Moura said as much ininterviews, explaining that their collaboration on the film began when the far-right government overseen by former president Jair Bolsonaro (who is currently serving a27-year sentencefor plotting a coup) echoed the 1970s military dictatorship.Re-emerging fascist forces are also the threat inOne Battle After Another, in which DiCaprio’s Bob, a former revolutionary, scrambles to protect his daughter Willa while both are hunted by a wacked-out US colonel from their past (Sean Penn’s celebrated performance needs no further ink here).The revolution will be in VistaVision: what are the politics of One Battle After Another?Read moreAnderson’s exhilarating and monumental girl-dad thriller, packing high-adrenaline action sequences and thorny observations onraceand fetishized radicalism, is remarkable both for its forward moving momentum but also the sense of being stuck (or unfixed) in time. The movie, which borrows liberally from the past (the radical action ofthe Weathermen, the repeated verses of Gil Scott-Heron), opens with a prologue that appears to be set today, as DiCaprio andTeyana Taylor’s revolutionaries break out migrants from an ICE-like detention center. When the movie jumps ahead 16 years, it still seems like it is set today. “Nothing’s changed,” says Taylor’s Perfidia Beverly Hills in voiceover, introducing a second act in which migrants are once again violently rounded up by militant forces whose counterinsurgency tactics (including a soldier manufacturing consent to brutalize civilians by tossing a Molotov cocktail at his own unit) should be a wakeup call for what has been happening on the streets.No wonder Bob is confused and agitated whenever he’s prompted by an operator on a secret revolutionary hotline to answer the question “What time is it?” It’s all a blur, really. The only way to mark the passage of time in One Battle After Another is through Bob’s 16-year-old daughter. Ironically, the wonderful actor playing Willa is namedChase Infiniti.She emerges as the movie’s comforting hope for the future, a sentiment shared not just with It Was Just An Accident and The Secret Agent but also among those of us inspired by the next generation. They resist, onscreen and on college campuses.Explore more on these topicsFilm2025 in cultureOne Battle After AnotherJafar PanahiUS politicsPaul Thomas AndersonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now we have the stage adaptation, which puts to music the tale of young Nikolas.Aged 11, he is marooned in grief and loneliness after his mother is killed by a bear and his father takes off on an expedition to the North Pole to find the fabled villages of the elves. Nikolas (Devon Sandell, performing on press night and full of energy) follows his father northwards with his pet mouse Miika (Olivia Dickens), to meet a reindeer called Blitzen (Alexander Solly), the Truth Pixie (Daisy Chapman), the elves, and a bevy of other fantastical creatures.This is the second musical in recent times that this theatre has adapted from a hit film that was itself based on a bestselling book. The first wasThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, a charming adaptation that transfers to the West End next month. Lighting does not strike twice with Philip Wilson’s adaptation, which is not nearly as captivating.View image in fullscreenThe vivid puppets are designed by Charlie Tymms.Photograph: Ellie KurttzIt is performed by the Chichester Festival YouthTheatre, and more than 70 young people do a heroic job. Visually it is delightful, both in its lovely costumes designed by Ryan Dawson Laight and vivid puppets designed by Charlie Tymms. Directed by Dale Rooks and set against Simon Higlett’s mobile stage design of icy wastes and fluttering snowflakes, it is a shame that some grownup professionals do not hold up their part of the bargain.The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry review – life-affirming musical reckons with deathRead moreThe script by Wilson is staid while the songs (music by Tom Brady with lyrics by Brady and Wilson) are strangely humdrum and samey, from the opening number, How Do You Do It, onwards. The choreography stays minimal and almost static, even at times when the story demands movement, such as during a chase involving a sleigh, and there are certainly no show-stopping song and dance numbers.As a result there is little emotional catch or wonder, when the story should be infused with both elements. Nor is there jeopardy, even when the fearsome bear (George Stanbridge) and troll (Jack Walter-Nelson) make growling appearances.In order to make magic, you have toreallybelieve in it, we are told. This fantasy needs more, to make you believe in its Christmas magic.AtChichester Festival theatreuntil 31 DecemberExplore more on these topicsChristmas showsTheatreChichester Festival theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

JB Priestley’s cosy comedy is easy entertainment on a chilly evening, and Tim Sheader’s chucklesome production conjures the comforting feeling of sinking into an armchair by a fire and rewatching a quaint old classic.Written in 1934 and set in 1908, this shenanigan-filled drama sees three middle-class Yorkshire couples smugly toasting their silver wedding anniversaries. Monied, mannered, and blindingly dressed by costume designer Anna Fleischle (all fine tweed and extravagant puffs of lace cuffs), their unravelling begins with the discovery that a mistake occurred 25 years ago. None of them are married after all.The revelation, beautifully frozen between acts in a tableau set to Beyoncé’s Single Ladies, upends who they are to each other and themselves. Suddenly, the men’s positions of power are smashed alongside the fancy crockery, and the women discover they’re no longer burdened with duty and piles of their husband’s darning. The skill of both Priestley’s prose and this cast’s performances is in the succinct presentation of the characters’ cores. Particularly the belligerent Albert (Marc Wootton), timid Annie (Sophie Thompson) and hen-pecked Herbert (a stand-out Jim Howick), the last of whom gets as much gastric trouble from speaking back to his wife as he does from overdoing it on dinner.View image in fullscreenIncreasingly inebriated … Ron Cook and Tori Allen-Martin.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe port keeps pouring and word of the ruckus gets around town. Noses upturn and lips purse as a host of new, lower-class characters hurl themselves on to the sofa for a slice of the scandal: the chipper charwoman (Janice Connolly), increasingly inebriated photographer (Ron Cook, with delightful physical comedy) and Blackpool gal Lottie (Tori Allen-Martin) who seems a little too familiar with one of the now unmarried men.Priestley’s crisp, playful dialogue bounces every line off the same joke, but does so with charm. All is safe and pleasantly silly in this well-made production, if not uproariously so. The stakes are never too high, the tantrums never too long. As the night draws to a close, the couples are a little shaken, and all the better for it. Priestley’s play reminds us to do better by each other, to make the best of what we have – and, should any wedding days be drawing near, to double-check the paperwork so as to avoid a nasty surprise 25 years down the line.AtDonmar Warehouse, London, until 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreJB PriestleyDonmar WarehousereviewsShareReuse this content"

Scottish composerJames MacMillanis not among them. His vast catalogue includes multiple symphonies, concertos and two passions –St LukeandSt John– as well as hisChristmas Oratorio, which was premiered in 2021. JS Bach’s 1734 version has become a festive classic, but MacMillan’s piece is no homage: although this 21st-century Christmas Oratorio speaks many musical languages, Bach’s is emphatically not among them.Instead, it flits from delicately scored passages of chamber music to full-throttle climaxes for choir and orchestra, from percussive modernist spikiness to smooth, Brittenish almost-tonality, from pastiche renaissance polyphony to surging Hollywood film score. “I’m getting a lot of Harry Potter,” reported a bemused friend during the interval.While portions of this take on the Christmas story sound disconcertingly innocuous, MacMillan’s choral writing is demanding. In this performance conducted by the composer, theBBC Symphony Choruswere initially tentative. They were at their atmospheric best in the unaccompanied and quieter sections showcasing their excellent diction and silky blend. The upper voices’ slow unfolding of “O magnum mysterium” was especially magical, floating over barely audible passagework in the woodwind and lower strings and the periodic throb of muted brass.View image in fullscreenThe BBC Symphony Chorus conducted by Sir James MacMillan.Photograph: BBC/Mark AllanThe two vocal soloists were ideally matched, withRoderick Williams’ warm, malleable baritone balanced by Rhian Lois’s harder, narrower soprano. The latter provided a luminous gilding in the large-scale ensembles, while Williams’ peerless capacity for storytelling made his second aria a highlight, his declamation a kind of stentorian recitative, compelling amid flutter-tongued flute, dabs of muted trumpet and a sprinkle of vibraphone.There were numerous other moments of fleeting beauty and irresistible forwards momentum from the BBC Symphony Orchestra: a chiming harp; icy string tremolo; orchestral chords balanced to sound uncannily like an organ; a flash of what sounded like Shostakovich performed at double speed, driven along by an off-beat high-hat. Despite such pleasures, MacMillan’s Christmas Oratorio remains a strange shape, its ending peculiarly abrupt. But this was a ferociously committed performance that left the large audience roaring with approval.Explore more on these topicsBBC Symphony OrchestraClassical musicChoral musicBarbicanJames MacMillanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Twenty-plus years on, the wintry cosiness of a UKChristmashas taken hold. Now, my essentials include perfectly crisp roast potatoes with plenty of gravy, and sprouts (non-negotiable). Even my young niece and nephew love them, which is a small victory I’m quietly proud of.Blue cheese and honey gougèresView image in fullscreenLet there be light: Chantelle Nicholson’s blue cheese and honey gougères.Warm gougerès fresh from the oven are a pretty tricky thing to beat. However, adding blue cheese and honey steps them up another level. The best thing about these gougeres, though, is you can make and freeze them in advance, meaning they’re never more than 25 minutes away.Prep10 minCook40 min, plus freezingMakes2465g unsalted butter, diced3g fine salt1 tbsp honey85g strong flour60g blue cheese, crumbled2 eggs, beaten1 egg yolk, beaten1 tsp honey, to finishPut the 165g water, the butter, salt and honey in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil on a high heat, making sure the butter has fully melted. Tip in the flour all at once, then stir hard until the mixture forms a smooth dough that pulls away from the sides of the pan. Take off the heat and stir in 40g of the crumbled blue cheese until evenly combined.Transfer the dough to a bowl and leave it for a minute or two to cool slightly. Add half the beaten eggs, mix until well incorporated, then add the rest of the eggs and beat until the dough is smooth and glossy. Spoon the dough into a piping bag fitted with a large, plain nozzle, then pipe out 2cm mounds on to a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or greaseproof paper (alternatively, pipe it directly into small financier moulds for neat, even shapes). Freeze until solid (about two hours), then transfer the gougeres to an airtight container and keep in the freezer until needed.To bake, arrange the frozen gougeres 2cm apart on a lined baking tray, then brush the tops lightly with the beaten egg yolk. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, then bake the gougeres for eight minutes. Turn down the temperature to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and bake for 10 minutes more, until puffed and golden.Take out of the oven, brush the tops with the honey and scatter over the remaining 20g blue cheese. Return to the oven for five minutes, until the cheese melts and the tops turn shiny.Roast squash velouté, pickled walnut, Baron BigodView image in fullscreenSmooth operator: Chantelle Nicholson’s roast squash velouté with pickled walnuts and Baron Bigod.A rich squash soup is like a hug in a bowl, and this version suitably dazzles with two of my favourite winter ingredients: pickled walnuts andBaron Bigod. It’s a dish that also uses the whole squash (seeds and skin included), so there’s minimal waste and maximum taste.Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minServes41 onion squash, or red kuri squash2 sprigs fresh rosemary1 bay leaf50g unsalted butter, dicedSalt1 tbsp vegetable oil100g pickled walnuts, chopped100gBaron BigodScrub the squash well, then peel it; keep the peelings. Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Put the seeds in a medium saucepan with the rosemary and bay leaf, cover with two litres of water and bring to a boil. Cook for 30 minutes, then strain into a clean pan and discard the solids.Heat the oven to 220C (200 fan)/425F/gas 7. Cut the squash flesh into large chunks, spread them out on a baking tray, add the butter and a generous pinch of salt, and roast for 20 minutes. Transfer the roast squash to the pot of strained stock, add a little more salt and simmer for five minutes. Blend until completely smooth, then taste and adjust the seasoning.Turn down the oven to 190C (170 fan)/375F/gas 5. Toss the squash peelings with the tablespoon of oil and a little salt, spread out on a baking tray and bake for 12–20 minutes, moving them around from time to time so they cook evenly, until crisp.To serve, divide the chopped pickled walnuts between four warmed bowls. Using a hot knife, slice the cheese into 12 neat pieces and place three in each bowl. Top with the crisp squash skin. Serve the hot velouté in a jug or jugs at the table, so guests can pour it around the garnish.Mushroom and celeriac pithivierView image in fullscreenThe stuff of dreams: Chantelle Nicholson’s mushroom and celeriac pithivier.A showstopper is required for Christmas day, and what better way to do that than with a delicious pie (of sorts)? While there’s a bit of preparation involved, trust me, this is well worth the effort.Prep15 minCook2 hr 30 minChill1 hrServes4with enough for leftovers500g block puff pastryFlour, for dusting1 large celeriac20g miso(red or white)20g bunch thyme10 tbsp vegetable oilSalt and black pepper1kg chestnut mushrooms, quartered4 garlic cloves, peeled and bashed50g unsalted butter250ml vegetable stock, or mushroom stock150ml double cream2 tbsp cream sherry20g bunch parsley, leaves picked and finely chopped1 egg, separatedBegin by rolling the pastry so it has time to rest. Divide the pastry block into two pieces, one weighing about 200g and the other about 300g. Shape each piece into a disc, then roll out into two circles, the smaller piece to about 25cm in diameter and the larger one to about 40cm. Dust both lightly with flour, cover with a tea towel and refrigerate for 25 minutes.Heat the oven to 200C (180 fan)/390F/gas 6. Scrub the celeriac well, then peel it, reserving the peelings. Put the peelings on a baking tray and roast for 15 minutes, until golden. Tip the peelings into a medium saucepan, cover with a litre of water, add the miso and half the thyme, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 20 minutes.Slice the peeled celeriac into 5mm rounds. Brush both sides with oil, season well and roast on a tray for 10 minutes. Turn over the slices and roast for another 10 minutes.To cook the mushrooms, heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large saucepan. Once hot, add a quarter of the mushrooms, along with the remaining thyme and all the garlic, season with salt and cook until golden. Add a quarter of the butter and continue cooking until all the liquid in the pan has evaporated. Leaving the thyme and garlic in the pan, transfer the mushrooms to a tray. Repeat this process three more times with the remaining mushrooms, reusing the thyme and garlic each time. After the third batch, chill the cooked mushrooms. With the final batch, once the mushrooms are golden, pour in the stock and simmer for 10 minutes. Lift out and discard the thyme, add 50ml cream and blend to a chunky puree. Cover and chill.Strain the celeriac peel stock and discard the solids. Pour the liquid into a clean pan, bring to a simmer and add the sherry. Reduce gently for five minutes, then add the remaining cream. Boil rapidly for 10 minutes, to thicken slightly, then taste and adjust the seasoning.To assemble thepithivier, lay the smaller pastry circle on a piece of baking paper. Using a small knife, lightly score a 15mm border all around the edge. Arrange half the roast celeriac slices inside the border, then top with half the mushroom puree. Stir the chopped parsley into the chilled mushrooms, then spoon half the mushrooms on top. Repeat the layers with the remaining celeriac, mushroom puree and chilled mushrooms.Lightly beat the egg white and brush it all around the scored border. Drape the larger pastry circle over the top of the filling, then, using the sides of your hands, press firmly around the edges to seal, keeping the dome as tall as possible. Chill for 15 minutes, then trim neatly into a perfect circle (use a tart ring or cake tin as a guide). The pithivier can now rest overnight in the fridge or be baked straight away.When you’re ready to bake, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Brush the top and sides with the beaten egg yolk, chill for 10 minutes, then repeat the glazing and chill again. Mark a tiny dot in the centre of the pastry with the tip of a knife. Starting from the base of the dome, lightly score curved lines sweeping up towards the centre dot, working all the way around to create a sunburst pattern. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and bake for 10 minutes more, until deep golden. Serve with the warm celeriac sauce.Roast miso brussels sproutsView image in fullscreenSprouts, but not as you know them: Chantelle Nicholson’s roast miso brussels sprouts.I’m firmly team sprout – and team miso – so this combines the best of both worlds. Just ensure you get enough heat on the wee morsels to induce that nutty flavour.Prep5 minCook25 minServes4as a side50g vegetable oilSalt300g brussels sprouts20g miso paste(red or white)Pour the oil into a deep roasting dish, add a good pinch of salt, put the dish in the oven and turn it on to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.Halve the sprouts or, if they’re larger than a 50p piece, quarter them. Once the oven is up to temperature, carefully tip the sprouts into the hot oil – they will spit, so be cautious – then roast for 12 minutes.Meanwhile, mix the miso with four tablespoons of water until smooth. Take the tray out of the oven and carefully stir the miso mixture through the sprouts. Turn down the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then roast the sprouts for six minutes more. Serve hot.Caramelised pear and rosemary puddingView image in fullscreenAlchemy: Chantelle Nicholson’s caramelised pear and rosemary pudding.There’s an alchemy with pears, caramel and rosemary, and this pudding just affirms it. The floral notes in the pear and rosemary match so perfectly, resulting in a wonderful way to wrap up your festive feast.Prep10 minCook1 hr 15 minServes4–63 pears– comice or conference275g unsalted butter, softened150g soft dark brown sugar2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped105g caster sugar3 eggs, lightly beatenA pinch of salt200g self-raising flour, sieved2 tsp vegetable oilCustard, cream and/or ice-cream,to serveHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Peel, quarter and core the pears, keeping the peelings. Press 75g of the butter in an even layer over the base of a 22cm-25cm ovenproof cast-iron pan or deep pudding dish. Sprinkle over 75g of the soft brown sugar, then lay the 12 pear quarters cut side down in a spiral on top (you may need to trim the tops to make them sit neatly). Scatter over the chopped rosemary, then bake for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, cream the remaining butter with the remaining soft brown sugar and 100g of the caster sugar until thick and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, then add the salt and gently fold in the sieved self-raising flour.Spread out the pear peelings on a baking tray. Add one and a half teaspoons of the oil and the remaining 5g caster sugar, and toss with your hands to coat.Remove the pudding dish from the oven and turn down the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Bake the sugared peelings for 20-30 minutes, moving them around occasionally, until crisp.Brush the sides of the pudding dish with a little of the remaining vegetable oil. Spoon the cake batter on top of the caramelised pears and smooth the surface. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.To serve, while the pudding is still warm, gently shake the dish to loosen it from the sides. Invert a large plate on top, then flip the whole thing over and lift off the pudding dish so the pears are now on top. Spoon any caramel left in the dish all over the pudding, scatter with the crisp pear skins, then serve with lashings of custard, cream and/or ice-cream.Chantelle Nicholson is chef/patron ofApricity, London W1Explore more on these topicsFoodChristmasChristmas food and drinkCheeseBakingPastrySnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"
