Countries across the world are scrambling to adjust. Canadahas announceda trade realignment towards China – andtalk growsof counter-sanctions in Europe. If the UK wants to avoid being caught in the crossfire, there really is only one alternative: to finally take the brakes off rebuilding our common future in Europe.In the past few weeks, Nato has suffered life-changing injuries. This should not be surprising, given the repeated signals from Washington, from the anti-European screed in Trump’sNational Security Strategyto theharassment of President Zelenskyyat the White House. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time and act accordingly.There is no easy solution – but, as ever, there are always ways to make a bad situation worse. Green party leader Zack Polanski, for example, demands we get ready to evict US bases from British soil, and says the UK should “ditch Trident – and fast.” He claims this could be done without undermining Ukraine or Nato, while still standing up to “Putin’s imperial ambitions”. But in reality, an emotional response to the US will do little to stop Trump dealing with Russia over the Ukrainians’ heads. Scrapping Trident is the precise opposite of what our European allies want or need. It abandons a key part of our commitment to their security as well as our own, and leaves Putin with only the French nuclear arsenal to contend with, should his ambitions spread further across Europe. What may sound bold in the echo chamber of the Greens’ social media would not survive the stark reality of the horrified response to unilateral British disarmament from our German or Polish counterparts.Yet progressives’ biggest mistake would be to think that the pressure on Europe comes from Trump alone. Back in 2011, dismayed by Europe’s inability to sustain fighting in Libya, Barack Obama’s defence secretary Robert Gates warned thatAmericans would lose patienceif Europeans didn’t spend more on defence. It is the size and shape of the Chinese military and the prospect of a war in Asia – not Russia, and defending Europe – that drives thinking in Washington, among Democrats as well as Republicans. Even if a future administration was less erratic or more collegial, this fundamental realignment will not change.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Donald Trump at the Sharm El Sheikh peace summit, Egypt, 13 October 2025.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/PAOn its own, the UK has limited resources and political bandwidth to withstand bullying from any direction, let alone from its allies. The very core of its defence strategy, on nuclear weapons and intelligence, is primarily intertwined with the US. The UK has already reportedly promised a contingent ofup to 7,500 troopsto monitor a hypothetical peace in Ukraine – but even deploying that number would be stretching the British army to its limits.The conclusion is inescapable: now is the time for the UK to reinforce, not wreck Europe’s security relationships, both through the European pillar of Nato and through cooperation with the EU. That means developing its own military capabilities as the US pulls back, as well as exploring a UK role in potential decision-making bodies such as a European security council. Labour should lead the charge for these new alliances and roles, not wait to be dragged into making them. Not only does Britain face tariffs, the US is also demandingit bends to their trade standards, and so diverge further from Europe. Capitulating to this would be a form of self-harm at a time when Trump is proving how little worth his past promises of a trade deal carry.For years, Brexiters have behaved as though defence and trade were two separate issues. Trump has proved that wrong by using economic sanctions to pursue his own national security ambitions – so the UK should join the dots between its security and post-Brexit trading arrangements.This is not a moment to be half-hearted about our national interest – not least because the UK’s allies in Europe know how to play hardball too. It was mind-boggling to see the European Commission, egged on by some of our closest allies, askingfor a huge sumfor the UK to join the Security Action for Europe scheme (Safe) to fund joint EU defence projects, a stancethat led to the UK backing away. But the status quo won’t do. We must break the cycle of posturing, and urgently resume the Safe talks for the benefit of all concerned.And the UK should go further. A customs union is not a serious offer, in these circumstances, for addressing how trade can be weaponised against us. Labour should be open to renegotiating all barriers to cooperation – including integration with the single market in a Swiss-style deal.It’s tempting to be cautious and hope things will blow over, but true progressive politics compels a bolder approach. While others see electoral opportunity in deriding Nato or fixating on Trump, the security of our constituents compels us to get real and bold on the EU reset. The UK cannot play at being an economic rival to the EU while the machinations of Trump, Putin and Xi require us to be the closest of strategic allies. The UK’s future withEuropeis its future national security. That’s the reality we must now embrace.Stella Creasy is chair of the Labour Movement for Europe and the Labour and Cooperative MP for WalthamstowExplore more on these topicsForeign policyOpinionTrump administrationKeir StarmerDonald TrumpNatoEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

In terms of straight plot, it’s the story of a man who is drawn into a conspiracy after a chair breaks when he sits on it. But beyond that, it’s honestly anyone’s guess.View image in fullscreenAnyone’s guess … Tim Robinson in The Chair Company.Photograph: HBO/WarnerSo much of it defies logical explanation. Why does that one guy only listen to recordings of men screaming at each other? Why was there a vampire in it, and why did it lure people in by inventing a brand new shape? Why did the show’s big antagonist end up having a baby’s head? None of these questions will ever be answered properly, because The Chair Company would clearly prefer to splash around in its Lynchian weirdness. This is by far the most baffling television show I have ever loved, and I say that as someone who has watched Lost all the way through four times.Stuart HeritageIndustryView image in fullscreenWhat I’m really here for … Marisa Abela as Yasmin dressed as Marie Antoinette in Industry.Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf Productions/HBO/Simon RidgwayThe finance jargon of Industry is impenetrable to the likes of poor me. I could not tell you a single financial transaction that took place on the trading floors. When I naively recapped the first season for another outlet, I apologised more than once for having “no idea what Harper does”. Even when they’re not talking shop, I need the subtitles on for this verbose lot.Does it make me feel like an idiot? Yes. But maybe that’s the point: this is an exclusive world in which only the wicked and wealthy whose first language is money get to play. Even co-creator Konrad Kay, who worked in the City,admittedthat a term like “DV01” is “financial gibberish” that he doesn’t fully know the meaning of. His partner Mickey Downcalled it“technobabble” and said they have tried to dumb it down. Ha! Tell that to the guy who in the new season says: “There’s no need to be so sesquipedalian”.View image in fullscreen‘There’s no need to be so sesquipedalian’ … Toheeb Jimoh as Kwabena in Industry.Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf Productions/HBO/Simon RidgwayAnd yet I am addicted to this show. I have learned to gauge the “vibe” of a business scene – trouble ahoy, big win celebration, burn-this-place-down disaster, etc – while waiting for the frequent payoffs from what I’m really here for: sex, drugs and fights. I’m a bit like a kid saying I’ve finished a book with a grin on my face, after flicking straight to the picture pages.Still, when I get to an episode where, say, all hell breaks loose at the Muck manor Marie Antoinette party, for a devilish moment it all makes sense.Hollie RichardsonTwin PeaksView image in fullscreenWonderful, impossible … Kyle MacLachlan as special agent Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty ImagesI’m not sure anyone, even David Lynch himself, could coherently explain what was going on Twin Peaks, a show where characters gettingtrapped for eternity in doorknobsandDavid Bowie’s reincarnationas a giant kettle apparently seemed par for the course. While I managed to just about cling on to the coattails of the plot of its more conventional (though still pretty damned unconventional) early 90s seasons, my grip had entirely loosened by the time of the far loopier mid 2010s revival.View image in fullscreenBefuddling … Catherine E Coulson as the Log Lady in Twin Peaks.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty ImagesNot that that was a turn-off. The befuddlement you felt was much of the fun in watching Lynch and Mark Frost’s misshapen murder mystery, as a succession of wonderful, impossible images and ideas flew at you from out of the screen. And even if I wasn’t exactly able to summarise its plot, at a purer and more primal level I definitely understood and was moved by the show. After all, at its centre is a simple and affecting story: a dogged detective embarks on a decades-long quest to get justice for a murdered teenager. It just so happened that on this conventional hero’s journey, there was the occasionalpulsating brain treeorbackwards-talking little personthrown in to keep viewers on their toes.Gwilym MumfordHouse of the DragonView image in fullscreenThe mad king? … Paddy Considine in House of the Dragon.Photograph: Album/AlamyI’ll admit it: I found the first season of Game of Thrones hard going. Largely because trying to decipher the various family connections between the 7,000 characters felt like a GCSE history lesson with added bum-flashing. But at least they got one thing right: they didn’t give everyone nigh-on identical names, and create entire families whose offspring are indistinguishable from one another.Not soHouse of the Dragon, where the future of the seven kingdoms seems to rest on whether the next ruler comes from the brunette family or the one whose hairdresser has a job lot of ice-blond dye they’re trying to shift. Maybe some of them are related to the mad king? Or was Paddy Considine the mad king? Or has the mad king not happened yet? Oh God, the amount of questions each scene throws up: why does every family come up with one preposterous name, then slightly change the letters for the rest of their gigantic haul of sprogs? Are we really expected to also remember an entire lineup of dragons with no distinguishing characteristics apart from “likes fire”?Thank God, then, for young Jace Velaryon, the only one with a vaguely normal name – presumably named for his mum Rhaenyra’s love of Jason Donovan’s verse on that 1988 classic, Especially for You. Although why they shorten “Jason” when they’re perfectly capable of pronouncing words like “Rhaenyra” is beyond me. Oh wait, just Googled: he’s called Jacaerys. This bloody show.Alexi DugginsLostView image in fullscreenTV had never felt so thrilling … Matthew Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Josh Holloway and Dominic Monaghan in Lost.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyI was fully invested in Lost. I once watched so many hours of season one back-to-back that I left my friend’s house square-eyed and paranoid that the Others were out to get me. When that episode ended with the reveal of the Hatch – well, TV had never felt so thrilling had it? And, of course, I will never forget the code 4 8 15 16 23 42, which had to be pressed every 108 minutes to save the world.So many of us lapped up Lost from the start right through to the divisive purgatory ending, in which it was revealed that they were absolutely not all dead the whole time. (“You’re real. Everything that’s happened to you is real.”) Yet from the get-go, the plane crash saga was a baffling and ludicrous ride you just had to embrace.The black smoke monster. The Dharma Initiative. The polar bears, for pity’s sake. The fact that the island cured people of their ailments. The temples and assorted other key buildings that they didn’t find for years! The humongous Egyptian foot statue. The giant frozen wheel at the centre of the island that meant it time travelled, and at one point disappeared? None of it hung together, but I loved letting it all wash over me anyway. Even the polar bears.Kate AbbottThe Morning ShowView image in fullscreenFabulous rot … Reese Witherspoon in The Morning Show.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Apple TV+Why is Reese Witherspoon in space? Why is Julianna Margulies so evil? Why does a TV executive live in a palace fit for a billionaire despot? Why are so many company employees being outed and having photos leaked? Who is acquiring what now?These are just some of the many questions that go through my head when watching The Morning Show, which started as a sharp post-#MeToo drama about the systemic cover-up of sexual misconduct by powerful men, and swiftly devolved into rot of the glossiest and most fabulous kind. At this point, it’s all surface – smouldering surface in which Jennifer Aniston’s character gets off with Jon Hamm’s definitely very wicked Elon Musk type – and I’m not complaining.You could say that in itself is a trenchant comment on how hard news fails to compete with sexier content these days. But it’s best not to overthink it and just let the comically overreaching storylines about AI and Iran’s nuclear programme wash over you like luxury bath oils.Laura SnapesThe RehearsalView image in fullscreenThrows you for such a loop … Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.Nathan Fielder’s show Nathan for You saw the Canadian deploy absurdist business advice – poo-flavoured froyo, a fake Starbucks justified via parody law – as cringe comedy meets late-capitalism critique. When his follow-up The Rehearsal was announced for HBO, with a blank cheque to deliver something truly bananas, I was ecstatic. Its premise sounds almost reasonable: many people avoid difficult conversations or scenarios. What if you could “rehearse” them on elaborate sets with trained actors?But the actors don’t know what they’re signing up to before surrendering to the “Fielder Method” – essentially stalking a real person before adopting their persona on television without their knowledge. In the heartbreaking season one finale, a six-year-old actor “playing” Fielder’s son begins to believe Fielder is actually his father.Fielder is disarmingly honest about making it up as he goes along and his show’s potential to literally ruin people’s lives. While a voiceover helps orient viewers, the subterfuge, metanarrative and straight hijinks remain baffling. Where does Fielder get these ideas and what is he really hoping to achieve?Season two uses a more structured approach: Fielder sincerely attempts to reduce plane crashes by staging pre-flight mediations between pilots, until the finale throws you for such a significant loop that you’ll find yourself thinking: “What did I just watch?” and “How can I enjoy a ‘normal’ show now?”Sasha MistlinScandi noirsView image in fullscreenWhat’s going on here? … Sofie Gråbøl as Sarah Lund in The Killing.Photograph: Nbc/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe Killing. Borgen. The Bridge. It really was a small screen mini golden age and most of us couldn’t get enough. A big part of the appeal of these moody Scandi-epics was their exoticism. The language was a tantalising riddle: subtitles were obviously essential but it was fun to land upon the occasional familiarity of a recurring phrase and luxuriate in the singular tone and texture of the dialogue. Then there was the aesthetic mood – all snow crunching under sturdy boots, delightful knitwear and urgent conversations animated by billowing clouds of ice crystals.There was a lot to think about beyond the plotting nuances which, in my case, often came a distant second (or even third or fourth) to enjoying the general vibe. What’s actually going on here? Hmmm. Good question.

At time of writing,the storyabout his Instagram broadside against his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, accusing them of treating him as a commercial prop all his life was by far, far and away the best read on the Guardian site, as well as the most deeply read. Again, I’m glad this blow-up wasn’t used as geopolitical cover, because if there was a time for Trump to invade Greenland largely unnoticed, maybe this was it.Whoever wrote Brooklyn’s intercontinental ballistic Instagram – and it wasn’tthe childlike authorial voicebehind regular “I always choose you baby … me and you forever baby” posts to his wife – the sentiments will be his. Here’s a sample: “My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family ‘love’ is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp …”Wow: elephants.Brooklyn Beckham can’t photograph thembut he sure can address them when they’re in the room. If you watched Victoria Beckham’s lavishly produced Netflix documentary last October, you might have wondered why it didn’t even glance on the biggest elephant in Brand Beckham’s room:the clear and agonising no-contact riftwith their eldest son that has been festering since last year and beyond. But most big documentaries these days aren’t documentaries any more in the way previous practitioners of the craft might have understood the word. As her husband’s was before it, Victoria’s doc was a self-commissioned advertorial on which the subject also served as executive producer. This is the haute version of the curated, public-facing existence that defines our dysfunctional age, but it trickles all the way down via fourth-tier influencers and that friend of yours who can’t stop posting about her perfect life. The Beckhams, at the vanguard of celebrity culture ever since both it and they exploded in the late 90s, are a part of how we all got here.Before I go on, I should say I find this family rift desperately sad. I can’t imagine the agony of being cut off by a child, and hope I never have to. All parents make mistakes, and all children do too. I believe the Beckhams truly and deeply love their children – but, to adaptLogan Roy, they have made it hard for them to be serious people.12:46Beckham feud: why has Brooklyn gone nuclear? | The LatestBrooklyn Beckham has been commodified since he was a foetus. The story of Victoria’s pregnancy was sold by his parents. When he was born, David and Victoria sold the first pictures of him. They sold intimate looks around their home and his nursery. They sold their wedding, staying up till 3am on the night of that big day, deciding which pictures would be featured in OK! magazine. They sold everything – mostly, back then, to OK!. Its proprietor,Richard Desmond, wrote in his autobiographyabout spending what felt like every Friday at Victoria’s parents’ house with the young couple, where they would all “plot and plan the next features we’d do”. A huge cheque was always involved, and the Beckhams wanted the limelight – all of it – so much.But as time went on, David and Victoria acquired more sophisticated advisers who understood the rapidly morphing potential of controlling image and brand, and built a vast and diversified empire for them off the back of it. When social media came along, the Beckhams channelled their business through its pipes.As I’ve written here before, they were past masters at not simply turning to their children and telling them they loved them, but photographing them, tagging them and sending the message of love via social media. Alchemically lucrative – but an accident waiting to happen?I honestly think the Beckhams are now so lost to this commercialised version of family life that they probably long ago lost the ability to comprehend how weird and potentially corrosive it is. I keep thinking of the line in Goodfellas where the mafia wife Karen says: “And after a while it got to be all normal.” And maybe there is something rather “family” with a capital F about the Beckham mob. The trouble is, with families not being meritocracies, every now and then the gene pool is going to throw up a Fredo Corleone or a Christopher Moltisanti who just isn’t suited to the weird life, and can only play out as a liability. Again, as covered here before, it has happened a couple of times with that other deeply strange family business, the Windsors.The Windsors, of course, don’t have a choice. The Beckhams’ wealth is estimated at abouthalf a billion. That is more money than even they could ever spend, and the only truly credible explanation for why they continue to live their life so remorselessly out loud is because they still crave the attention. And, realistically, because they have forgotten how else to live.They are the unicorns of this lifestyle, but not exactly alone. Some of us have always been Instagram and Facebook refuseniks, and never publicly posted pictures of our lives or families or any of it. But it’s not the norm, and billions of people have entirely forgivably got sucked into a world where they are the product, where they work for free for the tech lords, who successfully devalued the idea of privacy at the altar of their big lie: that “being connected” via their networks is far more important than privacy; that it is a win for humanity; that it is social. But it isn’t. Societies are in a mess. Literacy’s in a mess. Young people’s mental health is in a mess. The world’s in far more of a mess than it was when the techlords found it.I see Keir Starmer’s thinking aboutbanning social mediafor under-16s, so maybe someone could stick an amendment on any bill, banning parents from plastering their kids all over it from the moment they’re born. Maybe they can’t meaningfully consent to working in Mark Zuckerberg’s content mines any more than celebrity kids can meaningfully consent to being monetised by their parents. Or maybe all those ships have sailed.As for what David and Victoria Beckham will do, David waspictured at Davosthis morning. Encouraging times. But clearly they will also be locked in crisis talks, and my bet is that they’ll issue a statement saying how much they love Brooklyn and always will, and something like how there will always be a place waiting for him at their family table. And I truly believe all that. As someone behind the scenes will say as the team approves it, it’sauthentic. But even that word has been corrupted, hasn’t it? It has come to suggest a monetisable easy charm, an ability to make staged commercial situations seem appealing, an instinctive capability of embodying a brand or a lifestyle. We live in an age of dangerous slippage, from private to public, from living to trading, from the idea of ourselves as agents of free will to unpaid and unwitting products. Not to interrupt his brief main character moment – but Brooklyn Beckham’s the least of it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She talks about untimely deaths – and being left speechless by Judi DenchTue 20 Jan 2026 09.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 12.15 ESTShareWhitney White is practically swooning. “I have more respect and love for William Shakespeare than I can honestly communicate,” she says on a video call from Stratford-upon-Avon. When she went toHoly Trinity Churchto visit his grave, she says: “I just wept, because the language is so beautiful to me.”White’s first encounter with Shakespeare’s work was in Chicago at high school, where A Midsummer Night’s Dream unleashed her inner “theatre nerd”, she says. “I remember thinking, ‘Shouldn’t all theatre have music and dance and text and fights and be as full as possible?’ Then you grow up and start doing theatre – and we segment the business into musicals and plays.”For so long, we were told that only some people could do these stories. I think that’s not trueExcept that White didn’t. A Tony-nominated director (forJaja’s African Hair Braiding), performer and songwriter, her first exposure to theatre was at her grandfather’s church, which had a 50-strong choir. So it follows that the musicality in Shakespeare is key for her, the metre every bit as valid as the meaning. She realised that when she took a theatre programme at Brown University in Rhode Island. “I was assigned what you call an epic speech. I will never forget the feeling when I finished it. It was like the sky clearing.”Singing was “the first thing I ever did”, she says. “And I was like, ‘Wow, Shakespeare makes me feel the same way. It feels like a song.’” Although she recognises so much of her world in his, she says that: “For so long, we were told that only some people could do these stories. I think that’s not true. I think whoever Shakespeare was, he made them for all of us to be doing them.”View image in fullscreen‘The show is a look at fatal female arcs’ …. another moment from rehearsals.Photograph: Nicola YoungBut as a performer, she found she would only be cast in supporting roles such as the nurse inRomeo and Julietor Maria in Twelfth Night. That was the extent of the diversity of casting 10 years ago. “To be a leading lady still felt reserved for some people – and I think that’s really what kicked all of this off.”She is referring to her boundary-breaking gig-theatre, All Is But Fantasy. About to be staged by theRoyal Shakespeare Companyin two parts, it mixes characters from various Shakespeare plays: Lady Macbeth and Othello’s Emilia in one, Juliet and Richard III in the other.When she began the project, music was paramount. “I readMacbethand I heard rock’n’roll. To me, Lady Macbeth sounded like Tina Turner. She was saying, ‘I want more but the world won’t give me more.’” After a while, White realised: “Wait, I don’t just love Lady Macbeth. My favourite characters are also Juliet, Emilia, Cleopatra. But uh-oh, why do all those women die by act five?”My favourite characters are Lady Macbeth, Juliet, Emilia and Cleopatra. But why do all those women die by act five?For all her adoration of Shakespeare, there is a reframing of these characters and an interrogation of female ambition, power and mortality in the productions. “In the midst of all this, I lost two women in my family and I’m still not OK with how I lost them,” she says. “The show is a look at fatal heterosexual female arcs … I feel like we’re all a little too comfortable with women meeting an untimely end.”The last element she added to the show were the witches from Macbeth, who are front and centre. “As a Black woman, I don’t want to tell this story alone. It’s not just my story. I needed allies on stage to process the trauma and weirdness.” The witches are bossy, funny, humane, and sing in a mix of what sounds like gospel and hymn.“A spell is a prayer, and a witch is a holy woman, right? That didn’t feel like a big leap to me. I also wanted to set the shows in a space in which communal witnessing could happen and that’s the church. If you go to the church I grew up in, the whole community is there, watching. That’s how I was raised, and I don’t understand the world without a community of women watching me, telling me what’s good and what’s bad. My whole life has been my mother and her two sisters guiding me. The three witches are those people – my aunts and my mother are on stage with me every night.”View image in fullscreen‘A spell is a prayer and a witch is a holy woman, right?’Photograph: Nicola YoungHas her relationship to Shakespeare changed after this examination of his women? “It’s complex. If anything, my relationship to ‘us’ has changed becauseOthellois what it is, but why Othello is still relevant is our fault. I think Shakespeare captured something 400 years ago but why haven’twechanged? It’s about us. We’re the problem, not Shakespeare.”At the beginning of her version of Macbeth, she states that “irreverence is everything”. With that in mind, she says: “I have so much reverence for the text that I think it allows me to play with it, because I’ve read and studied and sat with the language and tried to meditate on how the narratives are alive in the newsfeed. That was another big way that I wrote these plays.”So, for example, All Is But Fantasy traces a line between the speech on abused women by Iago’s wife, Emilia, and the rise in domestic abuse during the pandemic and subsequent years. She is trying to take the audience on the ride that her mind went on when she read the plays. “I have an opinion about them that comes from my lived experience and I think I have the right to marry those two things and ask a lot of questions.”To be at the RSC brings a nervousness nonetheless. “I’ve never been more scared in my life, but I’ve also never felt more alive. I met Ian McKellen and Judi Dench and I couldn’t even speak. They have the armoury here where you can pick weapons for the show: think about how many hands have touched those weapons! Being in the church of Shakespeare, I definitely bow down at the altar – but I’d like to add a new song to the mass.”All Is But Fantasy is atthe Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 21 January to 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreWilliam ShakespeareRoyal Shakespeare CompanyMacbethOthelloRomeo and JulietRichard IIIinterviewsShareReuse this content"

No, you don’t need to do a ‘parasite cleanse’Pricey deworming remedies are being touted as cure-alls. Supermodel Heidi Klum gave it a go – experts roll their eyesMadeleine AggelerTue 20 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 07.02 ESTShareLast August, supermodel Heidi Klum revealed that she and her husband, Tom Kaulitz, were planning a worm and parasite cleanse.“Everything on my Instagram feed at the moment is about worms and parasites,” she told theWall Street Journal, ominously adding: “I don’t know what the heck is going to come out.”Maybeyoursocial media feeds aren’t full of posts about worms and parasites, in which case, congratulations. But type “parasite cleanse” into TikTok or Instagram and you’ll be inundated with so-called experts peddling expensive herbal supplements that promise to detox the body and rid it of harmful worms and parasites.One TikTok user, whose credentials are “holistic mama”, suggests people should do deworming cleanses if they experience “sleep issues, gut issues, weight loss issues, mood swings, skin issues”.It would be nearly impossible to find a single human not dealing with at least one of these issues. Does that mean everyone should be on a parasite cleanse?“NO,” Caroline Susie, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics wrote in all caps over email. She emphasized that there was no solid clinical evidence behind them.Ideally, all-caps discouragement from a medical professional would be enough reason to steer clear of something. But if you’re still unconvinced, here’s what to know about parasite cleanses, and why you probably don’t need to do one.What are parasites?Parasites are organisms that live in, on or with another organism and get their food “from or at the expense of its host”, per theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. For example: tapeworms, fleas or me when I lived at my parents’ house after college.Humans contract parasites in several ways, says Beth Czerwony, outpatient dietitian for Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. These include ingestion of contaminated food or water and direct contact with infected feces, she explains. Some parasites, like hookworm, can also penetrate the skin when a person walks barefoot on contaminated soil, and others can be transmitted person to person in unhygienic environments.In the US and UK, the most common intestinal parasites are giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, says Dr William A Petri, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Virginia. Both are transmitted through the ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water.Parasitic infections are extremely common. According to a 2023 World Health Organization (WHO)report, almost 25% of the global population has an infection related to parasitic worms like roundworms, whipworms and hookworms. These infections tend to be concentrated in “the poorest and most deprived communities” where people lack access to clean water and sanitation, per the WHO.“Having intestinal parasites is less common in places with good sanitation,” says Czerwony.What are the symptoms of a parasitic infection?Symptoms vary based on the type of parasite and the health of the host, says Czerwony. Often, symptoms include conditions like diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite or increase in hunger, unexplained weight loss, skin irritation, visible worms or eggs in one’s stool, and itching around the anus or genitals.What is a ‘parasite cleanse’?Klum said of her own cleanse that it had “all these herbs”. Most of those so-called remedies peddled on social mediainvolvetaking herbal supplements (like anise, clove, grapeseed, wormwood and goldenseal), dietary changes (like eliminating processed foods or cutting out gluten) or some combination of the two.Does it work?No.“There is no evidence that these parasite cleanses are either effective or needed,” says Petri. And if someone feels better after one of these cleanses, it’s probably not the result of parasites, says Susie – it might simply be that they’re eating more nutrient-dense food.At-home cleanses are also not without risks.Supplements are not regulated, Susie notes. Additionally, she says, some herbs can interact with other medications and be toxic at high doses. Restrictive diets can also lead to nutrient deficiencies.How do you treat a parasitic infection?“If you think you may have a parasite, it is important to contact a medical professional and not treat it yourself,” says Czerwony.Infections can be diagnosed with stool samples or blood tests and, in some cases, with imaging tests like endoscopies or colonoscopies, she explains.If a patient does have a parasitic infection, treatment depends on the type of parasite and the severity of the infection. Often, doctors will prescribe antiparasitic or antibiotic medications, and/or rehydration and nutrition support if severe weight loss has occurred, Czerwony says.Did the parasite cleanse work for Heidi Klum?View image in fullscreenHeidi Klum’s worm costume.Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Rex/ShutterstockUnclear, but probably not.

When friends shake hands, it must mean something.”Europeans, she added, “consider the people of the US not just our allies, but our friends”. She warned against plunging relations into “a downward spiral”, but said the EU’s response, if necessary, would be “unflinching, united and proportional”.1:48Von der Leyen urges European independence in response to 'seismic change'  – videoBelgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, said Europe was “at a crossroads” and “so many red lines are being crossed” by Trump that the continent had to stand up for itself or “lose its dignity … The most precious thing you can have in a democracy.”De Wever said he would “like to confirm that [the US] is an ally, but they have to behave like an ally”. Eighty years of Atlanticism could be coming to an end, he said. “A Nato country is threatening another Nato country with military invasion.”Gavin Newsom attacks Europe’s ‘complicity’ over Trump Greenland demandsRead moreTrump posted on social media on Tuesday that during a call with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, he had “expressed … very plainly,Greenlandis imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back.”He posted an AI image of himself, the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, planting a US flag next to a sign reading: “Greenland, US territory est. 2026.” Another image showed a map with Canada and Greenland as part of the US.Separately, the US president posted a message to him from Macron, who said he did “not understand what you are doing on Greenland”. The US president had earlier threatened to hit French wine and champagne with a 200% tariff if Macron did not accept an invite to join his “Board of Peace”.The spiralling row has plunged trade relations between the EU and the US into fresh chaos, forcing the bloc to consider retaliatory measures, and also risks unravelling the Nato transatlantic alliance that has guaranteed western security for decades.The Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, fresh from a trip to Beijing to forge a new Canada-China partnership, toldDavosthe world’s “middle powers” need to work together to build a better world order.“It seems that every day we are reminded that we live in an era of great power rivalry. That the rules-based order is fading,” Carney said in a speech that ended with a standing ovation.Carney said the world faces “the end of a pleasant fiction and the dawn of a harsh reality of geopolitics” in which the great powers are unconstrained. “We know the old order is not coming back. We shouldn’t mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy”, he said.UK prime minister Keir Starmer’s response to Trump’s Greenland threats has been more muted than those of his French and Canadian counterparts, but it has shifted slightly from his usually deeply cautious approach towards the US president.He told his cabinet on Tuesday that US tariffs were “the wrong thing to do”, while his government is pressing ahead with plans - criticised by the US president as an “act of great stupidity” - to cede the Chagos islands to Mauritius.While Starmer’s strategy to deal with Trump - maintaining a steady approach in the face of the chaos the US president has unfurled - is being called into question at home, sources said he for now has his cabinet’s backing. “I don’t think we’d gain very much from attacks just to get some headlines for a day or two, only to cause irreparable damage to a partnership that’s so important to us,” one said. In what appeared to be an attempt to smooth over US-UK relations, the US House speaker Mike Johnson told parliament that he had spoken “at length” to Trump yesterday on Monday - and that his mission in London was to “help calm the waters”.Trump is due to be at the WEF gathering with EU leaders who are mulling retaliatory measures that could include a package of tariffs on €93bn (£80bn) of US imports that has been suspended for six months.Another option is the bloc’s “anti-coercion instrument” (ACI), which has never been used but would limit US access to public tenders, investments or banking activities and restrict trade in services, including digital services.View image in fullscreenBart De Wever, the Belgian prime minister, said 80 years of Atlanticism could be coming to an end.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersSenior MEPs on the European parliament’s international trade committee are expected to announce on Wednesday the formal suspension of ratification of the EU-US trade deal sealed in July, after a deal between the largest political groups, a European parliament source said.However, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said that US relations with Europe were strong and urged partners to “take a deep breath” and let tensions over Greenland “play out”.Bessent said a solution would be found and European “hysteria” was unjustified. “It’s been 48 hours. Sit back, relax,” he said. “I am confident the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all.”Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in the capital, Nuuk, that it was “unlikely” military force would be used, but it could be. “Greenland is part of Nato, and if there is an escalation, it will have consequences for the outside world,” he said.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, speaking in the Danish parliament, said that “the worst may still be ahead of us”. Frederiksen added that her country had “never sought conflict. We have consistently sought cooperation.”Trump has repeatedly said the US needs to take control of Greenland for “national security”, despite the US already having a military base on the island and a bilateral agreement with Denmark allowing it to massively expand its presence there.Von der Leyen said in her speech that the EU was working on a package for Arctic security based on Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty, a big investment surge in Greenland, and cooperation with the US in the region.The Danish public broadcaster TV2 reported that 58 Danish troops had landed in Greenland on Tuesday to join about 60 others who were dispatched earlier for a multinational military exercise,Operation Arctic Endurance.European leaders are considering establishing a more permanent military presence in the high north to help guarantee security in the Arctic region, a key US demand, the Swedish defence minister, Pål Jonson, said.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he had no plans to travel to Davos but could change his plans if his delegation and US officials make a breakthrough in peace efforts aimed at ending the war in his country.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionGreenlandDavosUrsula von der LeyenDonald TrumpTrump tariffsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

We are seeing record demand for solar, record demand for heat pumps. We want this opportunity to be extended to everyone in our society.”Don’t cut £13.2bn warm homes pledge over winter fuel payments, Labour toldRead moreHe forecast that 1 million people would be lifted out of fuel poverty, with grants for insulation and clean energy for people on low incomes, and millions more would gain access to loans and subsidies to install heat pumps.“This is three times more public investment than the last government,” he said. “This is what great reforming governments do – they build homes, and they upgrade homes. This is what Labour governments have done. Look at who this government stands up for – ordinary working people.”The long-awaited £15bn plan will include five schemes in England:£5bn for upgrades, including insulation, solar panels, batteries and heat pumps, for people on low incomes.£2bn towards low-cost loans for people who can afford them.£2.7bn for the boiler upgrade scheme, by which people can swap their existing gas boilers for £7,500 on a new heat pump.£1.1bn for heat networks, which distribute heat from a central source, which could be a large heat pump or geothermal or other low-carbon source.£2.7bn towards innovative finance through the warm homes fund, which could include schemes such as green mortgages offering a lower interest rate to homes that have been insulated and equipped with solar panels and heat pumps.There is also £1.5bn in other funding for warm homes plan programmes and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Simon Francis, the coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the government’s plan “has the potential to be the spark that finally powers millions of households out of fuel poverty”.A typical household investing in home upgrades under the plan could save as much as £1,000 on its annual energy bill, according to figures from the research and innovation charity Nesta. The charity found that households that get a heat pump, solar panels and a battery could reduce their yearly bill from April from about £1,670 to about £670 under the changes brought in by the plan.View image in fullscreenEd Miliband said everyone had the right to a warm, safe, affordable home.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianLandlords will be forced to ensure that their rental properties are energy efficient under the plan. “The last government backed off doing this,” said Miliband. “But we think people have a right to warm, safe, affordable homes.”Official figures suggest that the number of households living in fuel poverty was on track to rise to 2.78m homes in England by 2025, despite the government’s legally binding targets to reduce fuel poverty.Even more households –as many as 9.6m across the UK– are estimated to be living in cold, poorly insulated homes, according toa 2024 analysisof the English housing survey by the Institute of Health Equity and Friends of the Earth.By June last year, the amount of energy debt shouldered by households had climbed to a new high of £4.43bn, an increase of 20% from the same time in 2024 and 71% since 2023, even as energy bills decreased in line with market prices.“The lifeblood of the warm homes plan amounts to a rescue mission for the coldest, dampest homes in Britain – and this must be the priority,” Francis said. “Combined with long-overdue improvements to conditions in the private rented sector, it could save lives, cut NHS costs and permanently slash energy bills for those in fuel poverty.”The plans are also expected to support Britain’s burgeoning industry for green home installations, which in the past have struggled owing toa lack of political clarity. The UK has recordedthe slowest introduction of heat pumps in Europein part because oflow consumer confidenceand high upfront costs even with the help of the government’s £7,500 boiler replacement grant.Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy, said the warm homes plan would provide cheaper home heating. “Solar panels can slash energy costs – and paired with a battery we get the electricity when we need it.Heat pumpscan be cheaper to run, and with solar they’re often dramatically cheaper. With the right finance, simpler rules and a big push from manufacturers, heat pumps will increasingly be the best solution for many homes – as they are in other countries like Sweden, Norway and Finland,” he said.Jambu Palaniappan, the chief executive of Checkatrade, an online platform for finding tradespeople, said the plan would also represents “a significant moment for the nation’s skilled trades” to help households “take advantage of the proposals and tradespeople to seize the growth opportunity”.But the government has not introduced a proposed ban on new gas boilers being fitted after 2035, after opposition parties attacked the idea. And instead of aiming to install 600,000 heat pumps a year, in line with expert advice, the government is targeting about 450,000 a year by 2030.Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: “The key question is whether a ‘carrots not sticks’ approach will work. The incentives are currently too weak – we need larger grants for low-income households and investment in reducing the price of electricity. Opting for the slower route of bringing people along with them, rather than setting a legal deadline, means the government will have to squeeze emissions reductions from elsewhere, such as not allowing airport expansion.”Ed Matthew, of the E3G thinktank, said the government needed to make heat pumps more affordable before it could bring in a boiler ban. “They need to nail the 0% loans, they need to eliminate taxes on electricity bills, and deliver high efficiency standards for all heat pump installations,” he said. “When they have done all that then households will flock to heat pumps because it’s the financially rational choice. A boiler ban would then be feasible.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyEnergy billsConsumer affairsFuel povertyHousehold billsHeat pumpsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Amendment 94a is the clearest and most straightforward proposal that meets the scale of the problem and the urgency parents are demanding.”It goes on: “On behalf of the millions of parents we represent through our polling and campaigning, we ask you to encourage your peers in theHouse of Lordsto support amendment 94a. This is a moment for leadership. Parents are asking for help and parliament now has a chance to provide it to protect childhood. Together we could make a real difference.”Members of the House of Lords will have an opportunity to have their say on an outright ban when they vote on the amendment brought by Lord Nash.The amendment has the support of some Labour peers, and if it passes in the Lords it would then be debated in the Commons, where61 Labour MPsrecently wrote to the prime minister urging him to bring in a ban.Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, reassured MPs on Tuesday that the government’sconsultationannounced the previous day would take only a few months and the government would have a firm position by the summer.Proposals for overnight curfews and breaks to prevent “doomscrolling” will form part of the consultation.Kendall also confirmed that “evidence-based” guidance for parents on appropriate screen time for children aged five to 16 would be produced. Guidance for parents of under-fives is expected to be published in April.Nash, a former schools minister, said he would press ahead with his attempt to legislate immediately for a ban. He said: “The time for delay and procrastination is over. Without swift action to raise the age limit for social media to 16, we are at risk of a societal catastrophe.“That is why I am urging all fellow peers to vote for my amendment, which has the backing of peers from every major party, to end the disastrous harm being done to our young people by social media and to give them their childhood back.”One of those planning to vote for Nash’s amendment is the film director and technology campaigner Beeban Kidron.She condemned the government’s announcement of a consultation, saying in a statement: “This announcement is an insult to parliament which legislated to make the online world safe, to parents and teachers, and most of all, to children themselves, who repeatedly say that they want to live in an online world where they are free to explore and learn from one another without being exploited by the tech sector,.“This hastily pulled together announcement is meant to appease the government’s backbenchers, and rescue it from losing votes in the Lords. Keir Starmer pledged to put country before party, but this is the very epitome of party before country. It is not leading; it is not governing.”Badenoch has already said the Conservative party would introduce a ban for under-16s if it was in power.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaChildrenInternet safetyHouse of LordsHugh GrantnewsShareReuse this content"

The climate crisis was exacerbating the problem by melting glaciers, which store water, and causingwhiplashes between extremely dry and wet weather.Prof Kaveh Madani, who led the report, said while not every basin and country was water bankrupt, the world was interconnected by trade and migration, and enough critical systems had crossed this threshold to fundamentally alter global water risk.The result was a world in which 75% of people lived in countries classified as water-insecure or critically water-insecure and 2 billion people lived on ground that is sinking as groundwater aquifers collapse.Conflicts over water had risen sharply since 2010, the report said, while major rivers, such as the Colorado, in the US, and the Murray-Darling system, in Australia, were failing to reach the sea, and “day zero” emergencies – when cities run out of water, such as in Chennai, India – were escalating. Half of the world’s large lakes had shrunk since the early 1990s, the report noted. Even damp nations, such as the UK, were at risk because of reliance on imports of water-dependent food and other products.“This report tells an uncomfortable truth: many critical water systems are already bankrupt,” said Madani, of the UN University’s Institute forWater, Environment and Health. “It’s extremely urgent [because] no one knows exactly when the whole system would collapse.”About 70% of fresh water taken by human withdrawals was used for agriculture, but Madani said: “Millions of farmers are trying to grow more food from shrinking, polluted or disappearing water sources. Water bankruptcy in India or Pakistan, for example, also means an impact on rice exports to a lot of places around the world.” More than half of global food was grown in areas where water storage was declining or unstable, the report said.Chart showing increasing number of conflicts over waterMadani said action to deal with water bankruptcy offered a chance to bring countries together in an increasingly fragmented world. “Water is a strategic, untapped opportunity to the world to create unity within and between nations. It is one of the very rare topics that left and right and north and south all agree on its importance.”TheUN report, which is based on a forthcoming paper in the peer-reviewed journal Water Resources Management, sets out how population growth, urbanisation and economic growth have increased water demand for agriculture, industry, energy and cities. “These pressures have produced a global pattern that is now unmistakable,” it said.Satellite view of the lake shrinking over timeLake Corpus Christi, in Texas, US, where there was a systemic retreat of surface water between October 2021 (left) and October 2025 (right) due to overuse.In some of the world’s most densely populated river basins, including the Indus, Yellow, and Tigris-Euphrates, the rivers were periodically drying up before reaching the ocean. “In many basins, the ‘normal’ to which crisis managers once hoped to return has effectively vanished,” the report said. Lakes were also shrinking, from Lake Urmia, in Iran, to the Salton Sea, in the US, and Lake Chad. Wildlife suffered as well as people, as humans “steal” water from nature, Madani said.The over-exploitation of groundwater was causing cities to subside around the world, with Rafsanjan, in Iran, sinking by 30cm a year; Tulare, in the US, by about 28cm a year, and Mexico City by about 21cm a year. Jakarta, Manila, Lagos and Kabul were other major cities affected. Among the most visible signs of this water bankruptcy, the report said, were the 700 sinkholes peppering the heavily farmed Konya plain in Turkey.Graph showing causes of subsidenceCities, such as Tehran, Cape Town, São Paulo and Chennai, had all faced day zero water crises, the report noted, while the number of water-related conflicts around the world had risen from 20 in 2010 to more than 400 in 2024.Humanity was also slashing the amount of water available by destroying natural stores, such as wetlands, and polluting waterways. Wetlands equal in size to the entire European Union had been erased in the past five decades, the report said.The report calls for a fundamental reset of how water is protected and used around the world. This would include cutting the rights and claims to withdraw water to match today’s degraded supply, and transforming water-intensive sectors, such as agriculture and industry, via changes in crops, more efficient irrigation and less wasteful urban systems. The report emphasises support for communities whose livelihoods must change.“Water bankruptcy management requires honesty, courage and political will,” said Madani. “We cannot rebuild vanished glaciers or reinflate acutely compacted aquifers. But we can prevent further losses, and redesign institutions to live within new hydrological limits.”Tshilidzi Marwala, UN undersecretary general, said: “Water bankruptcy is becoming a driver of fragility, displacement and conflict. Managing it fairly is now central to maintaining peace, stability and social cohesion.”The challenge of sustainable water management around the world was very real, said Prof Albert Van Dijk, at the Australian National University who was not part of the UN report, although, he added, he preferred the description of collapse, or systemic failure, over bankruptcy.Arecent water reportled by Van Dijk highlighted the increasingly erratic climate. “Increased variability is as much a problem as scarcity,” he said. “Sometimes there’s more water available overall, but it increasingly arrives in bursts, at the wrong place and at the wrong time. ‎This makes management genuinely harder. For example, dam reservoir levels need to be kept low to mitigate floods but high to ensure supply during droughts.”Dr Jonathan Paul, at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: “The report lays bare humankind’s mistreatment of water [which] threatens the viability of ‘the water cycle’ as a concept.“The elephant in the room, which is mentioned explicitly only once, is the role of massive and unequal population growth in driving so many of the manifestations of water bankruptcy,” he said. “Addressing this growth would be more useful than tinkering with outdated, non-inclusive, and top-down water resource management frameworks.”Explore more on these topicsWaterAccess to waterClimate crisisPollutionAgricultureRiversFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

The discussions leading up to the vote on 18 November, and the text of the resolution, were all about the conflict.Handing control of Gaza to a Trump-run “board” for two years cut across longstanding UN principles of self-determination and national sovereignty and against colonialism. It was alsovaguer than any other UN peacekeeping resolution in modern times.Nonetheless, the Arab world and Europe decided to vote for the resolution once wording had been added to at least give lip-service to a future sovereign Palestinian state. It was the best way, their diplomats argued at the time, to keep Trump engaged inGaza, with the hope of achieving a durable peace.Two months on, there is not a single mention of Gaza in the “board of peace” charter sent out to national capitals. That document instead portrays the board as a permanent fixture to promote peace and good governance around the world. It will be “pragmatic” and “results-oriented”, it will be “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body”, and will have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”.The document does not name the “failed institutions” that the board will apparently be more nimble and effective than, but there is little doubt that these derogatory references are aimed at the UN.The use of the word “charter” itself is an echo ofthe UN Charter. That 1945 document, however, was anchored in a set of principles which were hard-earned lessons of the second world war: the primacy of non-aggression, self-determination, fundamental human rights, and the “equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”.The Trump board charter uses no such language. Most of the text is devoted to the club rules, which make the chairman (Trump himself – the only person mentioned by name) all-powerful. All other members are selected by him and can be terminated by him. The chairman (mentioned 35 times in the document) can choose when the board meets and what it discusses. He can issue resolutions off his own bat.Kremlin says Putin has been invited to join Trump’s Gaza ‘board of peace’Read moreAll other members come and go under the rules, unless they buy a life-membership for $1bn “in cash funds”, and even that does not appear to offer a guarantee against being ejected by Trump.The inequity represented by the five permanent members of the UN security council, the victors from the second world war, has long rankled the rest of the world. The use and abuse of the permanent members’ veto privilege, particularly by Russia and the US, has long paralysed the council as a body for global governance.The board of peace swaps this inequity for another that is even more unjust – a permanence of a sort that can only be afforded by rich countries with a billion dollars to spare. And in this new forum, Trump alone would have an absolute veto.While the charter has nothing to say about Gaza, the board will oversee a general executive board, and a Gaza executive board, and beneath that a “national committee for the administration of Gaza”, the highest level in which Palestinians themselves are permitted to participate. There is also to be an international stabilisation force (ISF), overseen by a US major-general.Israel objects to White House’s pick of leaders for ‘board of peace’Read moreThe board will therefore have mechanisms to further the ceasefire in Gaza, and in theory to bring peace, governance and reconstruction to the territory. But all the signs are that these mechanisms are also aimed at displacing UN agencies that have historically gone into post-conflict zones to stabilise and help rebuild stricken societies, and replacing them with profit-driven business ventures.Nickolay Mladenov, the board’s would-be “high representative” in Gaza, is a well-respected, veteran UN diplomat, but he alone will find it a hard fight to keep the UN at the heart of the process. He will be hemmed in on all sides by the money people –Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and the other billionairesbrought in from the region.It is anyway unlikely that the Gaza arm of the board – the executive, the national committee and the ISF – will have much to do in the foreseeable future. The Israeli government is resolutely opposed to moving forward with any element of the second phase of the Trump ceasefire that would bring Palestinian governance back to Gaza or give any other nation a stake or a role in the territory. For example, it has sought to rule out Turkish or Qatari participation in the ISF.Might is right: US ‘foreign policy’ held hostage to mad king Trump’s whimsRead moreThe limbo between the first and second phase of the ceasefire suits Israel. It has its hostages back, the UN agencies are being squeezed out, and it can strike any time and anywhere but without the unsustainable costs of full-scale war.For more than two million Palestinians it is an unbearable purgatory. They are still exposed to Israeli bombardment and to the elements,marooned in tents and flimsy shelterswith little prospect of going home or rebuilding.A board of peace withVladimir Putin as a candidate memberis also very unlikely to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine. Its most likely fate is to remain a vanity project, while the rest of the world is stuck with the invitation from hell. Refusal to join, as France has tried, is punished by vengeful tariffs from a petty president.Joining the board, on the other hand, involves undermining the UN, submission to Trump’s will and acquiescence in his vision of future of world governance –an imperial courtwhere vassal states pay cash and vie for the ear of the orange emperor.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyGazaUnited NationsPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Although it’s starting to feel like a different show altogetherHannah J DaviesTue 20 Jan 2026 17.30 ESTShareThe first series of Things You Should Have Done aired on BBC Three in early 2024, a dry and quirky comedy about a recently bereaved “stay at home daughter” from middle England. It was the brainchild of Lucia Keskin, better known online as Chi with a C, and the show marked the then 23-year-old’s transfer from internet comic (her repertoire ranged from parodies of American Horror Story to impressions of Gemma Collins) to TV star. It also came with the co-sign of Roughcut, the production company behind People Just Do Nothing andStath Lets Flats, helmed by The Office producerAsh Atalla.The premise was almost unbearably sad (inept young girl loses her parents in a horrifying car crash and has to navigate life without them, as per a list they left for her), but the end product was zany rather than gloomy. An episode on getting a job saw Chi (Keskin) decamp to a care home, embracing an early retirement in a bid to avoid employment at all, while the chapter devoted to learning to cook ended with two family members being admitted to hospital. The tension between Chi and her bitter aunt Karen (Selin Hizli) was a constant, complete with insults about Chi’s “fat ham hock legs”. Not one but two characters spat into a bowl of pancake mix and no one so much as flinched. And there was a truly unforgettable rendition of Pure and Simple by Popstars winners Hear’Say. The characters tended towards their own nonsensical idiolect and failed to understand the most basic of concepts (see: Chi thinking a breast screening was some kind of peep show), giving the programme more than a dash of Stath-like incompetence. Frequent ghostly appearances by Chi’s dead parents added a sadcom touch, although – wisely – it was never enough to feel truly devastating.Series two opens – major spoiler incoming – with another untimely death in the family, this time of aunt Karen. Presumably Hizli was unavailable (she also stars in the excellentAm I Being Unreasonable?with Daisy May Cooper), otherwise I cannot think of any good reason to have given her the chop. Unfortunately, her absence is glaring – so many of the show’s best scenes involved Karen scheming about how to get the family home back from Chi, or merely making her meek husband Dave’s (Daniel Fearn) life a living nightmare. Her funeral does, at least, tee up some good gags, such as Chi accidentally downloading the template for a best man’s speech instead of a eulogy (“Dave is a very lucky guy today …”). Karen tripped over a vacuum cord at work and fell down 86 steps, leading Chi to believe that her aunt has been reincarnated as a vacuum cleaner. Yet killing off one of the cattiest characters and someone who detested Chi doesn’t make for a particularly emotional storyline – although Keskin does get to say excellent, unhinged lines such as: “My dead auntie is inside this Drift-max cordless IZ900!”View image in fullscreenStarting fights in the food bank … Bridget Christie as Ruth in Things You Should Have Done.Photograph: BBC/Roughcut TV/Jack BarnesThank goodness for Bridget Christie, as a therapist capitalising on Chi’s grief, overstepping all kinds of professional boundaries, and doxing her clients in the process. Ruth isn’t Karen 2.0, but she fills the need for another jittery side character – not least when she gets into a fight while working at a food bank. More good news: Sarah Kendall is back as Sarah Gilbeaux, the down-on-her-luck comic last seen working as a lifeguard, barmaid and compere at a holiday campsite. Juliet Cowan is also very watchable as Dave’s rich and seemingly unstable sister Claudia, who sometimes speaks like Dr Seuss (“Of course I’ve got a horse!”) and is conned by Chi and step-cousin Lucas (Jamie Bisping), who return her cat for a reward before stealing her again. Meanwhile, Keskin remains perfectly gormless as Chi, occasionally aided by miniature versions of her heroes (“Help me, Lily Allen,” she pleads as she tries to figure out what food to donate to charity. “You’re working class, aren’t you?!”)In series one, the fact that the list was a very loose narrative conceit didn’t matter too much, but in series two, it is so loose as to be almost nonexistent, with Ruth now providing the suggestions for Chi based on their therapy sessions. Coupled with no more Karen, Things You Should Have Done now feels like a different show altogether, despite the flashes of brilliance (Keskin did win a Bafta for emerging talent last year, after all). I am still hoping and praying that Karen has faked her own death à laCan You Keep a Secret?, and that she’ll be back someday. But until then, if you want to see a horse – and a cleaner – being liberated to the sound of Spanish one-hit wonders Las Ketchup, boy have I got the show for you.Things You Should Have Done aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTV comedyTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The star talks about leaving Britain for LA – and the £30 bus trip that changed her lifeTue 20 Jan 2026 11.35 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 12.14 ESTShare‘Ido love a Greggs,” says Wunmi Mosaku, as she settles into a sofa in a hotel in London’s Holborn. She’s extolling the virtues of the high-street baker after I jokingly suggested that’s what she could have for lunch, now she’s back in the UK from her base in Los Angeles. Despite being Stateside for the best part of a decade, she has lost none of her Manchester twang or sense of humour.“You know what I love about Greggs?” she asks, leaning in. “In each city, they have something specific to that place. So in London, they’ve got the Tottenham cake. Manchester’s got the Eccles cake. In Liverpool, they’ve got the scouse pie. In Newcastle, they’ve got … a ton of breads. You can’t get them anywhere else!”You don’t appreciate the cost people pay to assimilate into a country, the tax on their spiritMosaku learned all about Greggs’regional delicacieswhile touring her first play, straight out of Rada back in 2007. She played “the World” in The Great Theatre of the World,a 17th-century mystery play, and it took her all over the country. As well as acquainting her with the magic of a stotty cake, it was the first step in a career that has reached incredible heights in the last 18 months.The 39-year-old Mancunian is in the middle of a relentless awards season push, on board the bandwagon forSinners, Ryan Coogler’s juke joint vampire thriller set in the American deep south of the 1930s. She’s an outside bet for a best supporting female Oscar, meaning she is currently manically zig-zagging the Atlantic. Mosaku’s performance as Annie, a Hoodoo priestess whogives the film its emotional centre, has catapulted her into a new strata of stardom. She may be able to list regional Greggs menus but she alsodazzled at the Golden Globes, pregnant in a radiant yellow dress, and has become a regular magazine cover star. After we’re done, she’s off tochat with Graham Norton.View image in fullscreen‘This is where I’m from. This is who I am’ … Mosaku in Sinners.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe fame has brought levels of attention that aren’t always welcome. Mosaku announced she was pregnant with her second child in Vogue, to coincide with the Golden Globes – in part to put to bed growing speculation. “In my Nigerian culture,” she wrote, “we don’t really announce this kind of news. It’s meant to be protected. Everything in me resists sharing it publicly – not because I’m not grateful or joyful, but because this feels like one of the few things that truly belongs to me.”Mosaku managed to hide her first pregnancy while playing the lead in ITV’ssupernatural police procedural Passengers(think Happy Valley meets The X-Files). But this time, with the heightened attention brought by Sinners, she was under pressure to announce. “I was really against it,” says Mosaku. “But then I thought, If I’m gonna do it, I want to do it with the caveat that I say, ‘I don’t want to do this, but I feel like Ihave tobecause you all comment on our bodies.’” She’d watched her Sinners co-star Hailee Steinfeld endure months of speculation before telling her Instagram followers she was expecting a baby with her husband, NFL star Josh Allen.This is new territory for Mosaku, who broke through after winning a Bafta for her performance asDamilola Taylor’s mother Gloriain a 2017 BBC drama, before moving to the US, where she has oscillated between Marvel epicLokiand grittier fare, such as David Simon’s 2022 police corruption seriesWe Run This City.It could all have been so different. Mosaku’s parents, both academics, moved their family to Manchester from Zaria, Nigeria, when Mosaku was one. Later in life, she considered following their path by becoming a maths professor. She had a university place but decided to try acting, and auditioned for Rada instead. Her father wasn’t too enthusiastic but her mother backed the decision. “If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be here,” says Mosaku matter of factly. Her mother gave her £30, which was enough for her to get to London and back on the Megabus and buy some food.But the pair made a pact: if Mosaku didn’t get a place at Rada, she’d be off to uni in Durham to study maths and economics. “No one thought I’d get in,” she says, but she impressed the panel by playing Helena from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Queen Margaret from Richard III, and various parts from Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.Moving to London wasn’t easy. Chorlton-cum-Hardy, the south Manchester suburb Mosaku grew up in, might be characterised as a leafy middle-class enclave today, full of BBC execs pushing up house prices, but that wasn’t her family’s experience. Although Mosaku’s parents were academics in Nigeria, in the UK life was very different. Neither could find work in their desired fields of architecture and chemistry – so made do with what they could. Money was in short supply. “We were on the council estate,” says Mosaku. “My mum worked really, really hard. We were definitely one of those families that, if someone rang the doorbell, the kids all hid, because you couldn’t say mum was out at work.”View image in fullscreenSuperpowered … Mosaku with fellow Rada alumnus Tom Hiddleston in Loki.Photograph: Chuck Zlotnick/©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights ReservedAll this made the move to Rada fraught. Mosaku was the only black girl in her class, something that wasn’t easy at an institution which, in 2020, admitted it wasinstitutionally racistafterpressure from former students. Mosaku was one of many talented young actors: her future Loki co-stars Tom Hiddleston and Gugu Mbatha-Raw were there at the same time. But she remembers an environment where some teachers struggled to see her as anything more than a bit player. “I never got a lead role,” she says, recalling the time she was cast as a 50-year-old ship captain. “Never got to play an ingénue.”She asks: “Why restrict how I imagined my career? I think teachers are the most important people in a person’s life. They make you either bloom or shrivel away. I was really lucky that I had teachers likeBill Gaskell, who made me believe I could bloom, but I had so many people along the way that made me feel like, ‘Oh, this isn’t for you.’”In Ryan Coogler, she found a kindred spirit. After seeing Mosaku in We Own This City, he thought she’d be perfect as Annie and the pair set up a 30-minute Zoom call that ballooned into an hour-and-a-half heart-to-heart, during which they discussed their motivations and the people who inspired them. “We bonded on our first Zoom about those teachers, the ones who really put you on the path and the ones who nearly got you off it.” (Coogler brought his college professor Rosemary Graham, who told him he should write scripts in Hollywood, toa recent awards show.)Actors often peddle the same few well-polished anecdotes on the awards-season merry-go-round, heaping praise on colleagues. But when Mosaku is asked about Annie, she speaks about it as a transformational experience, like a religious convert testifying to the unanointed.View image in fullscreenDazzling … Mosaku on the red carpet at the Golden Globes earlier this month.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesTo prepare for her role as Annie, who loses a child with one of Michael B Jordan’s twin characters, Mosaku studied Hoodoo, which has its roots in the traditional Yoruba religion brought to America by enslaved Africans. This led to a deep connection with her Yoruba roots – and the language she began learning five years ago finally started to click for her. She likens the experience to an archeologist slowly unearthing a long lost civilisation during an excavation. “Oh,” she said to herself. “This is where I’m from. This is who I am. This is part of my survival.” The other thing that dawned on her was just how detached she had become from her own culture.Mosaku puts this down to her upbringing in Manchester. She should already be fluent in Yoruba, but her parents were discouraged from teaching their children the language because it would give them “funny accents”. For Mosaku, who has playedimmigrants throughout her career, that is the steep price new arrivals pay: people are asked to cut off parts of their own culture to “fit in”.How Sinners became the most culturally important film of 2025Read more“That’s the stuff that’s really important,” she says, becoming noticeably moved. “You don’t appreciate the cost to people, the tax on a person’s spirit in order to assimilate into your country – and for what? It’s superiority. It’s ego. It’s brutal. It’s a cultural genocide.”Does she see herself ever coming back to the UK? “A lot of people make me excited about working in the UK,” she says, listing director Akinola Davies Jr, Joan Iyiola’s Apatan Productions and Bolu Babalola. “I never take my eye off the UK for work,” she adds. “Artistically, I do feel like the work in America has been more satiating. I just want to make sure that in the UK I’m not always playing a police officer, you know?”Ahead are roles in Apple’s This Is How It Goes, alongside Idris Elba, and a part in Aaron Sorkin’s The Social Reckoning, his follow-up toThe Social Network. The jury is still out on whether the UK can keep up, but if she does decide to come back, Greggs will be waiting.Sinners is available to buy or rent nowExplore more on these topicsSinnersMarvelOscarsPeriod and historical filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsAwards and prizesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But four shark bites inNew South Walesin 48 hours – three of which were in Sydney – have rattled even some of the city’s most seasoned ocean users.On Sunday afternoon, a 12-year-old boy was left fighting for his life after being bitten on aharbour beach in Vauclusein Sydney’s east. On Monday morning, an 11-year-old’s surfboard wasbitten multiple times at Dee Whyin the city’s north, while that afternoon, a 27-year-old man was bittenwhile surfing in Manly, less than 5km away.After four shark attacks in 48 hours, NSW authorities urge beachgoers ‘just go to a pool’Read more“Sydneysiders are ingrained with surfing and beach activities as part of their life and it does feel like a piece of you gets stripped away when something like this happens,” says Matt Chojnacki, a lifelongSydneysurfer.After three attacks in quick succession, the big wave surfer and coach decided to leave the city to find what he hoped would be less risky waves to the north. On the road on Tuesday morning, he heard news of the fourth attack on a beach less than 15km from his destination – a 39-year-old man wasbitten at Point Plomeron the state’s mid-north coast, about five hours north of Sydney.“It’s so alarming. It seems like a once-in-a-decade anomaly,” Chojnacki says. “At the moment, I’m less scared of surfing the biggest waves in the world than I am of shark attacks on my local beaches.“No one’s surfing today. I’ve cancelled everything. There’s a sudden shock because surfing, as much as it’s a sport, is actually part escapism. It’s the feeling of being immersed in a changing environment that makes surfing so serene – and having the fear of dying in such a violent and graphic way is a polar opposite to that. It’s what’s been keeping me up at night.”View image in fullscreenMatt Chojnacki in the barrel of a wave.It’s not a new fear to the tight-knit surf community. Chojnacki lives across the road from Long Reef surf spot in Sydney’s north, where his friendMercury Psillakis, a 57-year-old father, was fatally mauledin September.In the weeks after, Surf Life Saving NSW provided extra aerial and on-water surveillance at nearby surf competitions for surfers who felt “vulnerable and apprehensive about returning to the water”, Tim Quinn, co-president of Queenscliff Boardriders, said at the time.That vulnerability is again leaving beaches and waves empty along the east coast. At least 28 beaches remain closed in Sydney, while beaches from Town beach to Crescent Head on the mid-north coast of NSW have also been shut.Shark attacks in NSWRob Harcourt, emeritus professor of marine ecology at Macquarie University, usually surfs at Bondi or North Steyne in Manly – the site of Monday afternoon’s incident – every day.On Tuesday morning, the shark expert’s usual surf with friends and colleagues at North Steyne was cancelled.“I haven’t got in the water today. It’s only human – it would just be foolish to rush back into the water when you can just leave it for a few days,” he says.Harcourt plans to avoid the water for the remainder of the week or until it is clear. Murky water, brought about by heavy rainfall, has long been associated with an increased risk of shark activity.“Go for a run instead. If you can’t see what’s happening in the water, that’s a good sign not to go in,” he says.View image in fullscreenWarnings are in place at Nielsen Park beach in Sydney while many beaches are closed across NSW.Photograph: Sitthixay Ditthavong/EPAThat message was echoed by SLSNSW’s chief executive, Steven Pearce, who urged beachgoers to avoid unsafe beaches and“just go to a local pool”.The incidents come in the middle of Sydney’s ocean and harbour swimming season – competitive open water events that draw thousands of swimmers.Big Swim at Whale beach in the northern beaches on 25 January was cancelled by organisers on Tuesday. “This is only the second occasion in 52 years that we have had to cancel the event,” a spokesperson said.Man in critical condition with ‘probably life-changing injuries’ after third Sydney shark attack in two daysRead moreThe Sydney Harbour Splash, due to be held in Rose Bay, close to Vaucluse, on 26 January, was cancelled “out of deep respect for the young boy who was tragically attacked” on Sunday, organisers wrote on Facebook on Monday.Sydney’s largest ocean swim, the Cole Classic in Manly, remains scheduled to go ahead on 1 February.“For this year’s event, we have further strengthened our resources, including the addition of two extra Surf Life Saving NSW drones.

After quite literally years of tabloid speculation and swipes between siblings on social media, the long-rumoured rift between Lord and Lady Becks and their eldest son, Brooklyn, has finally come to a head, with Brooklyn “breaking his silence”in a wordy, six-slide statementto Instagram late on Monday.I do not want to reconcile with my family, says Brooklyn Peltz BeckhamRead moreIf your response to his opus was“I ain’t reading all that”,here’s the lowdown on 26-year-old Brooklyn’s beef, and David and Victoria’s alleged transgressions, so that you can at least pretend you did.1. The body language experts were right! Kind ofView image in fullscreenBrooklyn Beckham and his wife, Nicola Peltz, in Paris, 2024.Photograph: Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP/Getty ImagesAt 800 words, Brooklyn’s statement is the Instagram equivalent of War and Peace, but the topline is this: he has confirmed he is estranged from his parents, and does not wish to reconcile. As widely speculated, the rift is over Brooklyn’s relationship with Nicola Peltz, a 31-year-old actor best known as Brooklyn’s bride but also a presence in the Psycho spin-off series Bates Motel and the fourth Transformers film. The pair began dating in late 2019, confirmed their relationship in January 2022 and married in April 2022. The tabloids and their expert panel of body-language experts have predictably sought to paint Peltz as a fame-hungry American interloper, intent on sowing discontent within Britain’s first family. (Sound familiar?) Now Brooklyn has called that narrative “completely backwards”, saying that if anyone’s been trying to control him, it’s his parents. In painstaking detail, he describes the Beckhams’ disapproval of Peltz and persistent efforts to “ruin” their relationship. “My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we’ve tried to come together as one.” The night before his wedding, Brooklyn writes, “members of my family told me that Nicola was ‘not blood’ and ‘not family’” (begging the question: who did they want him to marry?). Though imprecise about the exact legalities, Brooklyn also claims that he was pressured by his parents to sign “away the rights” to the Beckham name, seemingly to prevent Peltz from staking a claim as his bride-to-be.2. The Battle of the Beckhams will be won block by blockView image in fullscreenThat’s my boy … David with Brooklyn after the  Manchester United v Derby County match at Old Trafford, 2001.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesThough it has evidently long been brewing, Brooklyn’s decision to spontaneously serve the tea was seemingly prompted by a recent claim by his brother Cruz. Days before Christmas, 20-year-old Cruz posted his own Instagram storyaddressing the feud, and rebutting reports that David and Victoria had unfollowed Brooklyn on Instagram. “NOT TRUE. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son … They woke up blocked … As did I.” Brooklyn says now that his brothers Cruz and Romeo, 23, were earlier “sent to attack” him on social media, and blocked him “out of nowhere” last summer. He frames this as part of his family’s long-standing pattern of behind-the-scenes brand management, forcing him to speak out. “I have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press … I’m not being controlled, I’m standing up for myself for the first time in my life.” David and Victoria have not yet responded, though you can safely assume crisis talks are in play. Becks was pictured on Tuesday morning at the World Economic Forum in Davos, “struggling to put a brave face on”,surmised the Daily Mail. This year’s theme, ironically, is “A spirit of dialogue”.3. Family gatherings have been understandably fraughtView image in fullscreenBrooklyn and his parents in 2019.Photograph: Darren Gerrish/WireImageBrooklyn’s non-attendance at David’s 50th birthday bash last year was a flashpoint in this saga, widely interpreted as evidence of Peltz’s influence. Now Brooklyn says he and Peltz made the trip to London to spend “quality time” with David, but were “rejected” by the patriarch himself. Becks was allegedly only willing to meet with his son at his party, “with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner”, or in private “under the condition that Nicola wasn’t invited”. “It was a slap in the face,” Brooklyn writes. When his family later travelled to Los Angeles, where Brooklyn and Peltz are based, “they refused to see me at all”.4. The Beckham-Peltz wedding was one for the agesThe other occasion that Brooklyn has sought to clear up is his wedding in April 2022. Nicola Peltz was reportedly due to wear a dress byVictoria Beckham, but was eventually pictured in Valentino, widely perceived as a snub to her mother-in-law. Now Beckham says Peltz was forced to find an alternative after Victoria withdrew the offer at “the eleventh hour”. The drama continued into the big day itself, with Brooklyn claiming that Victoria “hijacked” his first dance with Peltz, embarrassing them in front of their 500 guests. Per Brooklyn’s account, when the singer Marc Anthony called him to the stage for what was meant to be his “romantic” debut with his new bride, “my mum was waiting to dance with me instead”. “She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I’ve never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.” When Brooklyn and Peltz renewed their vows last year, a few months after his father’s birthday party, he said it was to “create new memories”.5. Brooklynbrought the grandmothers into itIt is not just Marc Anthony who has been roped into this sorry saga. Another apparent bone of contention over the Beckham-Peltz wedding was their decision to seat their grandmothers at their table and not their parents. Brooklyn says this was because “Nanny Sandra”, David’s mother, and “Nicola’s Naunni” were both without husbands, while Posh and Becks sat at another table “equally adjacent” – but it seems that Posh was at best displeased. “My mum went so far as to call me ‘evil’,” Brooklyn says.6. Victoria’s been rifling through the ex files?View image in fullscreenBrooklyn with David and Victoria at Paris fashion week, 2020.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesAnother recent escalation in the drama has been brother Romeo’s relationship with the model/DJ Kim Turnbull. Romeo and Turnbull began dating in late 2024, and attended David’s 50th birthday together last summer. Turnbull has also frequently been pictured spending time with Posh. When she and Romeo briefly split up last year, a source told the Daily Mail it was “a huge shame” as “David and Victoria really adored her”. The relationship was initially controversial as Turnbull had historically been linked to Brooklyn. Cruz hasdenied thatthe two ever dated. But Brooklyn appears to allude to this fraternal fracas in his statement, accusing his mother of engineering encounters between Brooklyn and Peltz and his former flames, “clearly … to make us both uncomfortable”.7. … not to mention ‘displaced dogs’Through all this unpleasantness, the Peltz-Beckhams have sought comfort from their four dogs, known collectively on Instagram as the “@peltzbeckhambabies”. (Announced by Peltzto much fanfarelast July, the account was only active for a week, and still has barely over 500 followers.) Peltz in particular is an outspoken animal lover, and has previously partnered with rescues and called for stronger laws to protect “our fur babies”. In 2024she launched legal actionagainst a dog groomer over the alleged “malicious abuse” and sudden death of her chihuahua (and her other dog). The dog groomer denied the allegations. Early last year Peltz and Brooklyn werereportedly“set to launch” the non-profit Peltz Beckham Foundation, dedicated to helping homeless dogs in Los Angeles, but that did not come to pass – perhaps because of the contentions Brooklyn describes now over using the Beckham name. His statement memorably cites his family’s lack of support for his wife’s animal welfare initiatives as yet more evidence of their disrespect: “The one time my wife asked for my mum’s support to save displaced dogs during the LA fires, my mum refused.”8. Nobody bends it like the Beckhams?View image in fullscreenAll the Beckhams together for the Netflix UK premiere of Beckham, 2023. From left: Mia Regan, Romeo, Cruz, Harper, David, Victoria, Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageBy-the-by as some of Brooklyn’s allegations may seem, his account of his parents’ apparently ruthless back-channel machinations to protect “Brand Beckham” explosively calls into question some of their recent cosy press. Both Posh and Becks have been the subject of Netflix docuseries, cementing their legacy as King and Queen of Cool Britannia. Brooklyn attended the 2023 premiere of Beckham, posing alongsideboth his brothers, but was absent from Netflix’s party for Victoria Beckhamlast October. Now Brooklyn writes that he “grew up with overwhelming anxiety”. “For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.” Between his highly public, personal attack on a British institution and his American bride, many have compared Brooklyn to Prince Harry, and suggested hemight be anglingfor a Netflix documentary of his own. He and Peltz at least have the support of Rebecca Loos – David Beckham’s former PA, who was vilified for claiming to have had an affair with him back in 2004. Beckham has always denied the alleged infidelity, including in his 2023 docuseries. Responding to a commenter on Instagram,Loos wrote: “So happy he is standing up for himself and speaking publicly finally!!!! I have felt so bad for his poor wife, knowing too well what they can be like!” Quoting Brooklyn, she added: “The truth always comes out.”9. It’s not just the ‘brand’: the family may never recoverView image in fullscreenBrooklyn making tomato pasta with sea water, on his TikTok channel.Photograph: TikTok @brooklynbeckhamMeanwhile, the internet hasn’t been so energised since Lily Allen’s tell-all album West End Girl – as acknowledged by the singer herself,who posted a pictureof the cover with Brooklyn’s face in place of hers. While the tabloids rush to stand up and flesh out Brooklyn’s many varied claims, his post has sparked broader discussion of the issue of family estrangement, with growing numbers of young people reportedly cutting off their parents. “The whole thing is very Oedipus Becks,”commentedthe broadcaster David Baddiel on X. Brooklyn has sought to frame “stepping away from” his family as a happy development, saying he is now free from anxiety for the first time in his life, and has found “peace and relief” with Peltz. But it also seems fair to say he’s not yet found his calling in life, as evinced by his short-lived forays into modelling, photography andprofessional cheffing. Nor has he successfully escaped from his family’s spotlight. Far from having the last word (or 800 words) on the story, Brooklyn might have only brought it extra time.Explore more on these topicsBrooklyn BeckhamCelebrity crib sheetCelebrityDavid BeckhamVictoria BeckhamFamilyInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some also have smart functionality, so you can ask Alexa to turn up the heat, and other advanced features such as air purification and adaptive heating. But which are best?I cosied up to some of the most popular models from makers including Beldray, Russell Hobbs, Everhot, Dreo and Mill. Here’s my roundup of the best electric heaters, including models that are cheap to run, high-powered and capable of warming a large room, alongside smart electric devices with app-assisted functionality.At a glanceBestelectric heater overall:Beldray 2,000W smart ceramic core radiator£206.75 at ArgosBest budget electric heater:Russell Hobbs oscillating ceramic 2kW heater£49.68 at AmazonBest fan electric heater:Dreo PTC fan heater Solaris 718£118.98 at AmazonBest stove-style electric heater:Everhot electric heater£1,199 at Cooks & CompanyBest efficient electric heater:Mill wifi max portable heater 1,500W£169 at AmazonWhy you should trust meProduct reviews should be fair, useful and unflinchingly geeky – something I keep in mind when getting to grips with each new batch of items I test.I’ve reviewed hundreds of products, ranging from fridges and fans to combi drills and pressure washers, since 2017. My favoured approach to reviews is in-depth exploration that prioritises hands-on testing and attention to detail.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘Sauna-like conditions’: each heater was tested at its maximum temperature.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianStaying warm matters, so I dug deep to test the models featured in this guide.I set up each model in my living room and blasted them at the maximum temperature. I measured the room’s air temperature using a digital thermometer at regular intervals to see how powerfully each heater was warming the space. Bravely risking sauna-like conditions, I took each measurement from the centre of the room and kept the windows and door shut during each heater’s test.Of course, temperature gain isn’t the only measure of an electric heater’s quality. I also assessed each model’s noise levels from the same position at regular intervals, and used an infrared thermometer after each test to judge whether the heater would be safe to touch. To gauge energy efficiency, I plugged the heaters into a power usage meter during testing.I was keen to try each heater’s special features, so I tested extras such as timed heating and smartphone operability. I ended up testing 12 heaters, and I believe that the nine models listed below are worthy of your consideration.Some brands did not want the heaters I tested back, so those will be donated for fundraising toCat Action Trust 1977, a small national charity dedicated to the welfare of feral cats.The best electric heaters in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Packed with smart features’: the Beldray 2,000W smart ceramic core radiator.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianBest electric heater overall:Beldray 2,000W smart ceramic core radiatorBeldray2,000W smart ceramic core radiator£206.75£206.75 at ArgosWhat we loveExcellent selection of modes and powerful performanceWhat we don’t loveThe digital display is a little clutteredPhotograph: Pete Wise/The Guardian£206.75 at ArgosThe Beldray smart radiator is packed with smart features, including multiple modes – Economic, Frost Prevention, Timer and Comfort (read:gratuitously warm). There’s also a sensor mode that detects movement and raises the temperature when someone’s nearby.There are two ways to incorporate this heater into the home: as a portable, freestanding unit on casters, or permanently wall-mounted. Suitable fixings are included for both options.Why we love itIt takes a little while to warm up, but within about 10 minutes, I really started to feel this heater’s benefit. After half an hour, the room was wonderfully snug throughout, and pretty much infernal right above the heater. In most spaces, you’d be able to use this model at a setting well below the 30C maximum. It’s practically silent during operation, save for the occasional soft clank as the metal warms up.The touch control on the radiator itself is pretty intuitive, but the display could make it clearer when heating has started. I found myself presented with lots of symbols vying for that rarest resource: my attention. Personally, I preferred controlling the heater using its wifi-enabled app, which will be handy for winter-wary users who’d like to fire up their radiator before getting out of bed.It’s a shame that …the front panels of the radiator stay very hot for a while after use. If you’re concerned about a child or pet, set an appropriate maximum heat level using the temperature limitation feature.Temperature increase during testing:5.2CAverage noise level:28dBEnclosure temperature after an hour:87.2CRunning costan hour on maximum:55pSize:57 x 79.3 x 8cm (HWD)Weight:19.3kgBeldray2,000W smart ceramic core radiator£206.75£206.75 at ArgosWhat we loveExcellent selection of modes and powerful performanceWhat we don’t loveThe digital display is a little clutteredBest budget electric heater:Russell Hobbs oscillating ceramic 2kW heaterRussell HobbsOscillating ceramic 2kW heater£49.68£49.68 at AmazonWhat we loveQuality and performance are great for the priceWhat we don’t loveIts on-unit controls are a trifle clunkyPhotograph: Pete Wise/The Guardian£49.68 at AmazonAlthough it’s compact and affordably priced, the Russell Hobbs oscillating ceramic 2kW heater promises the kind of powerful, efficient heating you might expect from a more expensive model. It has some higher-end features, too, including oscillation (the heater rotates) and an Eco mode that adapts heating to the room temperature.Why we love itWithout a doubt, this is one of the best budget-friendly heaters I’ve tested. It spreads warm air throughout the room, even when used in its static mode. Activating oscillation with a press of a button on the remote control (or the on-unit control panel) only makes the effect more pronounced. The air directly in front of the heater felt very hot when I used a high temperature setting.This heater has quite a low-pitched operating noise, and while it’s a little loud, I find this more agreeable than the high-pitched whine you get with some fan heaters. I also appreciated its small footprint, bleep-free option (perfect for timer-based heating at night) and safety features, which include automatic shut-off if the heater were to topple over.It’s a shame that …the on-unit control buttons are a little tricky to press. But I’m splitting hairs here – this is a brilliant heater for the price.Temperature increase during testing:6.3CAverage noise level:51dBEnclosure temperature after an hour:59.1CRunning cost anhour on maximum:51pSize:33.5 x 15.5 x 14.8cm (HWD)Weight:1.9kgRussell HobbsOscillating ceramic 2kW heater£49.68£49.68 at AmazonWhat we loveQuality and performance are great for the priceWhat we don’t loveIts on-unit controls are a trifle clunkyBest fan electric heater:Dreo PTC fan heater Solaris 718DreoPTC fan heater Solaris 718£118.98£118.98 at AmazonWhat we loveQuieter operation than most fan models, despite its powerWhat we don’t loveRelatively high energy usage£118.98 at AmazonI was instantly impressed with this obelisk-shaped fan heater from Dreo. Within a few seconds of activation, it had begun to make a chilly room feel cosy. And after five minutes of heating at the highest of the five available settings, my jumper was well and truly off.Why we love itFor a powerful fan model (drawing up to 2,000W), this is an impressively quiet heater, producing a deep, rushing sound as opposed to a harsh roar. I measured the noise at 46dB while using the highest setting – far quieter than any other fan heater I’ve tested. Operation is simple, with either the remote control or the on-unit buttons tapping into timed heating, lateral oscillation and a child lock. You can also use this as a towerfan for cooling, with three settings to choose from.The Solaris 718 has some heat-sensitive features to guide or control your usage. The Eco mode automatically chooses a heat setting to keep the room at a specified temperature, and there’s an LED indicator ring on the top that glows different colours to tell you whether the room is cold or hot (how Dreo defines these states, we know not).It’s a shame that …it’s quite energy-intensive on a high heat setting, and the elaborate grilles on the front and back of the heater are not the easiest to clean.Temperature increase during testing:5.9CAverage noise level:46dBEnclosure temperature after an hour:40.2CRunning cost an hour on maximum:55pSize:75.4 x 20.1 x 20.1 cm (HWD)Weight:3.6kgDreoPTC fan heater Solaris 718£118.98£118.98 at AmazonWhat we loveQuieter operation than most fan models, despite its powerWhat we don’t loveRelatively high energy usageBest stove-style electric heater:Everhot electric heaterEverhotElectric heater£1,199£1,199 at Cooks & CompanyWhat we loveBeautiful looks and top-notch cast iron constructionWhat we don’t loveYou’ll need plenty of floor space to accommodate itPhotograph: Pete Wise/The Guardian£1,199 at Cooks & CompanyThis cast-iron model is surely the nicest-looking electric heater of them all. It would make a fabulous addition to most interior schemes – especially if you have an empty fireplace or alcove that needs filling.Why we love itFar from just a talking point, Everhot’s heater serenely produces 1.5kW of heating power via its stove-top vent. It warmed the space effectively and near-silently during my testing, resulting in a gradual increase in room temperature.The controls are simple, with just a power switch and heat-setting dial to master. Both components have a lovely finish, in keeping with the generally outstanding quality of the appliance.While the door on this model is non-functioning, you can geta similar model with an integrated ovenand a working door, which understandably comes at a higher price.One note of caution: the top of this stove gets extremely hot during and after use, so this heater may be unsuitable in households with pets or children.It’s a shame that …the price of this heater is too high for most buyers, especially if you’ll use it only occasionally. With that said, if you’re looking for an electric stove to use regularly, this one’s for you.Temperature increase during testing:3.8CAverage noise level:34dBEnclosure temperature after an hour:105.2CRunning cost anhour on maximum:43pSize:50.8 x 48.7 x 41cm (HWD)Weight:~40kg (each model is handmade, so some variation is inevitable)EverhotElectric heater£1,199£1,199 at Cooks & CompanyWhat we loveBeautiful looks and top-notch cast iron constructionWhat we don’t loveYou’ll need plenty of floor space to accommodate itBest efficient electric heater:Mill wifi max portable heater 1,500WMillWifi max portable heater 1,500Wfrom£169£169.99 at B&Q£169 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s effective and energy efficientWhat we don’t loveTakes up more floor space than expected£169.99 at B&Q£169 at AmazonNorwegian brand Mill promotes this heater’s wifi operability first and foremost – but I believe its real strength is its near-silent, highly efficient heating. Barely detectable by sound meter, it subtly heated my cold living room to a comfortable temperature in less than 10 minutes while using less electricity than any comparable model.Why we love itThere are two ways to operate the heater: via theMill Norwaysmartphone app, or using a dial and LED display on the side of the unit. The app brings some fancier functionalities such as remote operation and weekly heating programmes, but the control that will really matter to most users is the on-unit dial, which effortlessly adjusts the thermostat to temperatures up to 35C.Unusually for a heater, this model is bathroom suitable with IPX4 moisture resistance. That means it can withstand the occasional spray of water, although it definitely shouldn’t be used too close to the bath or shower. The oval-shaped base – which requires assembly using your own screwdriver – feels stable and is gentler on flooring than feet or casters.It’s a shame that …the heater takes up quite a lot of floor space, and setting up wifi operation via the app proved fiddly.Temperature increase during testing:7CAverage noise level:26dBEnclosure temperature after an hour:65.8CRunning cost an hour on maximum:41pSize:38.5 x 62 x 24.5cm (HWD)Weight:5.5kgMillWifi max portable heater 1,500Wfrom£169£169.99 at B&Q£169 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s effective and energy efficientWhat we don’t loveTakes up more floor space than expectedThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘I had it set up and appreciably warming my living room within about 30 seconds’: the Swan 700W plug-in mini fan heater.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianSwan 700W plug-in mini fan heaterSwan700W plug-in mini fan heaterfrom£10.90£14.99 at Swan£10.90 at AmazonWhat we loveA useful option for warming up at close quartersWhat we don’t loveNoisy operation and relatively limited heating powerPhotograph: Pete Wise/The Guardian£14.99 at Swan£10.90 at AmazonBest for:small rooms too short on space for a conventional heaterThis tiny power socket heater from Swan is designed to plug straight into an outlet and deliver warmth in your direction of choice. I had it set up and appreciably warming my living room within about 30 seconds.In terms of extra features, Swan has kept this heater straightforward and practical. Using the controls on the top, you can adjust the output temperature and set a timed heating duration between one and 12 hours. Selected settings are shown clearly on the digital display.You can also use the plug rotation button (on the right-hand side) to switch the heater’s position, which partly makes up for the restriction of using it only in a place where it can be plugged in.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s noisy. This heater would be best suited to people who spend a lot of time wearing headphones, or for heating a room before you enter it.Temperature increase during testing:2.4C;average noise level:56dB;enclosure temperature after an hour:60.4C;running cost anhour on maximum:18p;size:14 x 11 x 12cm (HWD);weight:0.63kgSwan700W plug-in mini fan heaterfrom£10.90£14.99 at Swan£10.90 at AmazonWhat we loveA useful option for warming up at close quartersWhat we don’t loveNoisy operation and relatively limited heating powerDuux Threesixty 2 ceramic heaterDuuxThreesixty 2 ceramic heaterfrom£89£89 at Currys£89.99 at DuuxWhat we loveEfficient, temperature-sensitive heatingWhat we don’t loveFlawed connectivity proves an obstacle to smart featuresPhotograph: Pete Wise/The Guardian£89 at Currys£89.99 at DuuxBest for:powerful heating with a small footprintLooking like the defiantly well-adjusted love child of a smart speaker and an air purifier, the Duux Threesixty 2 is clearly the techiest heater on our list. Its minimalist design and pleasing packaging positively beg you to feature it in a social media unboxing video. On a more practical note, the Threesixty 2 delivers heated air in all directions, and has a PTC element that delivers temperature-appropriate heating thanks to its electronic properties (the element’s electrical resistance is such that it heats up intensively when the air is cold; and warms gently in milder conditions).I felt the warming effect of this compact fan heater pretty much straight after turning it on. There are three on-unit temperature settings, giving you some control over the heat level – but less than you’d get with most heaters. As a simple, manual fan heater, the Threesixty 2 works great, thoroughly warming the space while making less noise than your standard fan model.It didn’t make the final cut because …controlling this smart heater via smartphone or smart assistant is difficult. I found the Duux app too buggy to use.Temperature increase during testing:7.6C;average noise level:54dB;enclosure temperature after an hour:58.3C (lid);running cost anhour on maximum:50p;size:30 x 22 x 22cm (HWD);weight:2.4kgDuuxThreesixty 2 ceramic heaterfrom£89£89 at Currys£89.99 at DuuxWhat we loveEfficient, temperature-sensitive heatingWhat we don’t loveFlawed connectivity proves an obstacle to smart featuresDevola wifi-enabled smart glass panel electric heaterDevolaWifi-enabled smart glass panel electric heaterfrom£89.90£89.90 at Devola£96.90 at B&QWhat we loveIts sleek, contemporary designWhat we don’t loveElevated risk of breakage during assemblyPhotograph: Pete Wise/The Guardian£89.90 at Devola£96.90 at B&QBest for:extensive smart functionality at an affordable priceThis smart-assistant-compatible, glass panel heater from Devola is as sleek as they come, with a well-integrated digital on-unit display and controls. Plus, connect it to your wifi and smartphone, and you’ll have access to advanced features, including voice control and timed heating. During my testing, it operated quietly and heated the space steadily.A little assembly is required before use, with the exact steps depending on whether you wish to use the heater as a freestanding or wall-mounted unit. I chose the freestanding configuration and had the plastic feet attached to the bottom within a few minutes (taking great care during handling, as dropping this glass-panelled heater could be disastrous).It didn’t make the final cut because …operating the heater with the remote control isn’t exactly intuitive. You need to go into its settings menu and set a temperature for each of the three operating modes, rather than raising or lowering the heat manually. Smartphone app operation proves easier.Temperature increase during testing:6.4C;average noise level:34dB;enclosure temperature after an hour:44.6C;running cost anhour on maximum:51p;size:‎47 x 65 x 8cm (HWD);weight:7.68kgDevolaWifi-enabled smart glass panel electric heaterfrom£89.90£89.90 at Devola£96.90 at B&QWhat we loveIts sleek, contemporary designWhat we don’t loveElevated risk of breakage during assemblyVonHaus small oil-filled radiator 1,500WVonHausSmall oil-filled radiator 1,500Wfrom£44.99£44.99 at VonHaus£44.99 at Robert DyasWhat we loveIt costs little and works quietlyWhat we don’t loveModest heat output£44.99 at VonHaus£44.99 at Robert DyasBest for:those on a strict budgetThis small, portable, inexpensive oil-filled radiator is a practical choice for occasional use. There are just two controls to master: a power selection switch (which toggles between 600W, 900W and 1,500W) and a thermostat dial.I found this radiator produced enough heat to make a chilly room comfortable, and it used relatively little electricity to do so. You can use the thermostat dial to set the desired temperature at which the heater will maintain the room – saving you from overheating and overspending on energy.The heater is quiet, except for the occasional quiet gurgling of oil, which is quite a pleasant sound in my opinion.It didn’t make the final cut because …it heats only moderately. While this model does a good enough job in a small space, it’s not suitable for heating a medium-sized or large room.Temperature increase during testing:2.7C;average noise level:33dB;enclosure temperature after an hour:70.6C;running costan hour on maximum:24p;size:62 x 33.5 x 24cm (HWD);weight:6.9kgVonHausSmall oil-filled radiator 1,500Wfrom£44.99£44.99 at VonHaus£44.99 at Robert DyasWhat we loveIt costs little and works quietlyWhat we don’t loveModest heat outputWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenAn electric heater costing under £100 should be appropriate for many people’s needs.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianHow much should you spend on an electric heater?Electric heaters vary wildly in price, from less than £50 to £500 and beyond. Swanky ones can cost more than £1,000.How much you spend should depend, above all, on how much you intend to use it. For many users, an electric heater is an occasional-use item to warm us up in out-of-the-ordinary circumstances – such as when we can’t use the central heating due to home improvement work or a malfunction. If this sounds like you, then an electric heater costing under £100 should be appropriate for your needs.However, some buyers want an electric heater to use more regularly. You may use yours to heat just one room in your home, thus avoiding the need to use central heating or install a wood-burning stove. In such cases, spending more could give you a more attractive design and advanced features, such as smart operability.For reference, the total cost of adding a new plumbed-in radiator to an existing heating system tends to run between £200 and £600.Are electric heaters cheap to run?In a word, no. Electricity costs more than gas in the UK, relative to the power delivered to appliances. If an electric heater and a boiler-powered radiator had the same efficiency, it would cost more to produce the same level of heat with the electric unit.That said, using an electric heater in one room could prove more cost-effective than turning on central heating throughout the home. If you’re willing to experiment with your heating habits to reduce your energy costs, an electric heater could be part of the cost-saving combination.Some electric heaters cost less to run than others. In particular, models with a lower wattage, simple functionality and efficient design tend to have lower running costs.Which is the most efficient electric heater?Based on our testing, the cheapest electric heater to run is the Swan 700W plug-in mini fan heater.However, assessing an electric heater’s efficiency also requires us to consider its capability to heat a room adequately. This is tricky to define, as the heating performance needed depends on factors including the size of the space and your preferred ambient temperature.Out of the models featured in this guide, I would consider the Mill wifi max portable heater 1,500W to be the most efficient electric heater for medium to large rooms, while the VonHaus small oil-filled radiator 1,500W is the most efficient electric heater for small rooms (provided you’re happy with moderate heating).Ceramic heaters vs fan heaters: which type is better?If you’re choosing a new electric heater, there’s a good chance that you’ll settle on either a ceramic heater or a fan heater. These two popular types have contrasting pros and cons.Ceramic heatershave heating elements made from – you guessed it – a ceramic material. They often operate very quietly (or practically silently, in my experience), and they keep radiating heat for a while after the power has been turned off. Some examples take a while to heat up.Fan heaterstake in air, heat it up rapidly and push it out into the room. They can heat a space almost instantly, and then quickly cool down after deactivation. Most fan heaters are relatively noisy, but on the plus side, they often have nice-to-have features such as oscillation and cooling modes for warmer weather.Ultimately, both ceramic heaters and fan heaters can do a fine job of keeping you warm. The former are quieter, while the latter are quicker.What to do with your old electric heaterElectric heaters have a shelf life, with warranty periods often in the range of two to five years. Many models stay in good condition for longer, but when faults occur with components, such as the heating element or thermostat, it may prove more economical to replace your heater than it is to repair it.We would urge you to explore having a broken electric heater repaired, especially if it’s under warranty. However, when buying a new model is unavoidable, there are some disposal options that will minimise the environmental impact.The best solution in most cases is to take the electric heater to your local recycling centre (the Recycle Now website will help you find one), where it can be processed as Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Alternatively, you could try listing the heater for free on local marketplace websites as a “spares or repairs” item.For more:The best electric blankets and heated throwsThe best hot-water bottles for comfort and cosinessThe best heated clothes airers to save time and money when drying your laundryPete Wise is ajournalist based in Leeds, withmore than a decade’s experience coveringeverything from global development and social causes to technology and music.

But after the fall of Assad, Syrians have returned to their old homes determined to rebuildByGhaith Abdul-AhadTue 20 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 09.07 ESTShareThe kebab stall stood in the shadow of a building whose three upper floors had been sheared in half, leaving behind concrete slabs that seemed to hang in mid-air. Under a tarpaulin, its edges weighted with cinder blocks, stood a thin man with a thick white beard. Smiling, he stoked the fire in a narrow grill. Walking back and forth to a table set atop a wheelbarrow, he tenderly inspected a dish laid out with tomatoes, greens and a few skewers of meat. A torn mat covered the floor, while a plastic ice box and a few more cinder blocks provided seating for the customers who were yet to appear.The streets were largely deserted here in Amiriya, a dilapidated suburb ofAleppothat once formed the frontline between the rebel-held enclave and government-controlled areas. But there were a few signs of life: children hopping on and off a rusty motorcycle, a woman selling cigarettes and water from a shack, a young man digging through the rubble with his hands, pulling out pieces of limestone and stacking them in a neat pile to use later in rebuilding his own house. “They are much better than the new ones,” he told me.Across Syria, there are thousands of streets just like this one. A year afterBashar al-Assadfled the country and his regime collapsed, nearly 3 million Syrians have returned from abroad and from the refugee camps in the north. Many drifted back into ghost neighbourhoods, places without water or electricity, where darkness swallowed entire blocks. With housing scarce, inflation soaring and rents massively increasing, many have no choice but to seek shelter in the wreckage of their former homes. The scale of destruction is so vast that rebuilding a single neighbourhood would be a daunting task even in the best of circumstances. But people are trying.In Amiriya, a man with dirty black jeans and a red T-shirt that said Burn Your Past on the back, beckoned me to come closer. “Don’t talk to him,” he said, nodding towards the kebab stall. “He stole a bag of cement from me.”The man introduced himself as Abu Arab, and pointed to a roofless corner building. It was his family home, he said, and he had just moved back into it after 13 years. It stood with its columns and flooring slabs exposed, scarred by years of fighting. But there were also signs of recent works: a new cinder-block wall on one side, and freshly fitted metal shutters.He pushed through the door and led me into a dark corridor where a few bags of cement were lined up. “They keep stealing them, so now I have to sleep here to guard them,” he said, his oily black hair falling on his forehead. We picked our way up the stairs. Some sections had collapsed, and others he had recently recast. I held on to the edges for balance. “Be careful,” he said. “Don’t lean on the wall, it’s buckling.”He made his way up nimbly, despite a pronounced limp. I followed him into a small corner room on the third floor. The roof was gone and it opened to a pale autumn sky. “This was my room,” he said. “My desk was here on the left, a single bed on the right, and a narrow cupboard in between.” He gestured as if he could still see the furniture, still remember its colours and smells. “It was the smallest room in the house, but I wasn’t married then,” he added with a faint smile. His wife and children were staying in a rented apartment in the hills outside Amiriya, waiting for him to finish work on the house before they could join him, he said.The walls were black with soot and punctured with holes, though these were larger than the usual bullet marks. He led me to one and told me to look through it. “This was a sniper’s position,” he said proudly. “It overlooks the whole area. My cousin was stationed here for a while.”A local politician in Aleppo, who did not want to be named, told me that nearly two-thirds of the city is in ruins. The destruction is so vast that it will take years just to clear the rubble, let alone start rebuilding. He said it would take decades for Aleppo to return to the city it was before the war. All the reconstruction efforts so far are local, with individuals – like Abu Arab – trying to rebuild their own homes and places of business. This unorganised restoration is dangerous, he believes, because most of these buildings are structurally unsound. “But what can people do?” he asked. “They can’t afford rents and don’t want to live in tents any more.”Amiriya, straddling a line of hills on the southern outskirts of Aleppo, emerged in the second half of the 20th century, when the city – like many across the region – began expanding: absorbing neighbouring towns and villages, consuming orchards and fields, and turning them into vast working-class districts of identical concrete blocks.Abu Arab told me that his father, a medic, had built this house himself in the early 80s. It was a multi-storey building with a basement, ground-floor storerooms, and three floors above for his wife and children. “He used the best-quality concrete to cast the columns and floors,” Abu Arab said, patting the wall gently.View image in fullscreenRuined buildings in the Amiriya district of Aleppo.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianAfter the family moved into their new house, the ground-floor garage and store room were converted into a clinic where Abu Arab’s father and elder brother worked, administering local remedies and injections, and dispensing medicine. The basement, like countless others in the neighbourhood, had been packed with the family’s winter provisions: dried bulgur, olive oil and rows of preserves and pickles in jars.On the roof, his mother had once tended to her little garden of tin cans filled with basil, mint and tarragon, and even a small lemon and olive tree. On warm summer nights, Abu Arab and his brother would sit for hours on the metal swing, smoking and breathing in the mingled scents of herbs and dust. From that rooftop vantage point, the brothers would gaze at the lights of Aleppo, the highway snaking south toward Damascus, the distant outline of the hills, but most of all, they watched the city itself: a sea of blinking lights shimmering into the night.For 5,000 years, Aleppo has been a great metropolis at the heart of a region that stretches from the shores of the Mediterranean, across the fertile lands of what is now southern Turkey, and all the way to Mosul in modern-day Iraq. Throughout the centuries, Aleppo prospered as a trade hub and manufacturing centre. It endured its share of invasions, plagues, civil strife and natural disasters, yet somehow managed to preserve a distinctive character evident in its architecture, cuisine and the social fabric of its multilingual, multi-ethnic communities, all of which could be observed in the old souks of al-Madina, the historic city centre.In 2011, when demonstrators, and later rebel fighters, filled Syria’s streets, Aleppo’s lack of revolutionary zeal, and the near absence of protests in the city, became at first a source of ridicule and later of anger at the population’s perceived indifference. Finally, in the summer of 2012, more than 15 months after the start of the Syrian uprising, a coalition of rebel groups advanced on Aleppo from their staging grounds in the surrounding countryside. “We had to force the people into the revolution,” one rebel commander, a native of Aleppo, told me at the time.View image in fullscreenAbu Arab’s bedroom.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianWhen the fighting reached Aleppo, Abu Arab’s family abandoned their home. Like many residents in their neighbourhood, at first they believed it would only be a matter of time before they could return. Soon, however, they joined the exodus of Syrians fleeing the war. Abu Arab still remembers, and grieves, the belongings the family left behind, especially the ton and a half of tomato paste his mother had spread out on the roof to dry for the winter. “You know how we Halabis [Aleppians] care for these things,” he said, smiling and patting his large belly.The urban warfare that followed, some of the most brutal in recent memory, was shaped by the very architecture built by men like Abu Arab’s father. The design of these districts, with their narrow streets, close balconies and cuboid buildings, offering a clear line of sight, made them ideal terrain for snipers. A single gunman perched on a rooftop, or concealed in a corner room, could dominate an entire cluster of streets. The long, confined roads became death traps. In response, the rebels burrowed tunnels underground, first as supply routes and escape passages, then packed them with explosives and set them ablaze, collapsing entire buildings into the earth.During the lulls in the fighting, Abu Arab – who was squatting with his family in an unfinished concrete structure on the other side of hills facing Amiriya – would return to the house. Like other civilians, he had to brave the journey across the frontlines, passing first through government, then rebel checkpoints. Then came the dash across sniper-dominated alleyways.Each time he reached the house, he found it more derelict than before. “First the neighbours broke in,” he said. “They took things like the gas canisters. That was fine. People needed them.” But piece by piece, the house was stripped bare. Even his beloved metal swing from the roof disappeared. “When I saw them sifting through my mother’s and sister’s clothes, our family pictures and papers, even my father’s certificates …” He paused, unable to finish the sentence.In those years, people’s lives and homes became intimately entangled with those of the fighters. At night, the fighters slept in commandeered apartments where the belongings of the original owners still lay scattered about. Empty Styrofoam meal packets, spilled rice and plastic bottles lay beside piles of women’s clothing.Fighters smashed large holes in tower block walls to create makeshift corridors through abandoned apartments. Once, during the years I reported on the fighting in Aleppo, I followed a group of insurgents as they navigated one of these corridors. They tumbled through a hole in one apartment’s kitchen, stepping on to the marble sink. The fridge door hung open and was full of rotten vegetables. The old occupants had left behind jars of pickled olives and chillies sitting intact on the cupboard shelf.View image in fullscreenViews of the Amiriya district from Abu Arab’s house.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianFrom the kitchen, the fighters walked down the apartment corridor, which was covered with thick layers of white dust and the boot marks of dozens of men. We then walked into the children’s room, where toys were neatly stacked in a blue plastic box, and through another hole in the wall into the neighbour’s bedroom, where we stepped over piles of clothes and women’s shoes scattered across the floor. The journey reminded me of the cross-section drawings I had studied in architecture school.After the anti-Assad fighters retreated in 2017, Amiriya became one of the many ghost suburbs encircling Aleppo: rows of hollowed-out buildings, their facades peeled back, concrete slabs jutting out like broken ribs, entire streets lined with skeletal frames rising from mounds of greyish-brown concrete like tombstones. In many areas, the Assad regime barred residents from returning to former rebel-held districts, especially those with military significance. The military commanders in charge of these districts “sold” entire blocks to contractors, who sent in workers to strip everything of value: cables, pipes, switches, rebar, leaving nothing behind but the large portraits of the dictator, in sunglasses, looking down and marvelling at the tidy job his men had carried out.For decades prior to the civil war, Aleppo remained apart from many of the ideological battles that shook Syria. One notable act of resistance came when the Old City was threatened by a urban-modernisation plan that would have destroyed entire historic quarters. Despite the Ba’athist regime’s oppressive rule, Aleppians successfully resisted the project, securing Unesco world heritage status for the Old City in the 1980s.More than any other city in the Middle East, Aleppo managed to preserve its historical identity into modern times, not only by safeguarding old buildings and artefacts, but in maintaining the Old City as a living economic and social organism, where traditional crafts were still practised in the old workshops. The Old City and its famous al-Madina souk – the largest covered market in the world – remained at the heart of the city’s entrepreneurial life, clustered around its ancient khans. A two- or three-storey complex of rooms built around a central courtyard where merchants, pilgrims and travellers could rest, stable their animals, store their goods and conduct trade, khans ranged from humble roadside inns to exquisitely ornate complexes endowed by the wealthy families and rulers of the city.Late last year, in the souk’s maze of covered alleyways, I found a man named Annas sitting in the courtyard of his old khan, with one of his sons and two merchants beside him. The khan itself was in ruins. In 2023, an earthquake shook the region, causing severe damage to an old city already weakened by years of fighting. As we spoke, Annas’s emotions swung between pain, as he recounted his own losses and those of his city, and the exhilaration of being back in the old souks.View image in fullscreenKhan al-Tutun, where Annas’s shop and factory where located. Some of the damage is from the 2023 earthquake that hit the region.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianBefore the war, Annas had been a moderately wealthy businessman who owned garment factories in the old city and several properties across town. Back then, he liked to be the first to arrive at the khan, before the covered market filled with noise and crowds. He would look around the courtyard, admiring the graceful arched and tall windows. If he craned his neck just a little, he could glimpse the slender 16th-century minaret of a nearby mosque.Once the fighting in Aleppo began, it was only a matter of time before the historic districts burned. The first fires tore through parts of the al-Madina Souk in 2012. Sections of the Great Mosque were consumed by flame, and the library in its eastern wing, home to invaluable manuscripts, was incinerated. Soon after, the minaret collapsed. One by one, khans, hammams and buildings of incomparable historic and religious significance vanished. As the rebels dug tunnels beneath the ancient quarter, enormous underground charges detonated beneath Ottoman-era barracks, sucking entire structures into the cavities created by the blasts.By his own account, when the uprising began in 2011, Annas had little interest in politics. It wasn’t until a year later that he was radicalised, after a humiliating incident at the hands of Assad’s police, who hit him and arrested him, forcing him to kneel on the ground in his beloved souk in sight of other merchants. After an $800 bribe, he was released. But, he told me, this one moment of public shame set him on a trajectory he could not escape. “On that day, I decided I would sacrifice my life, my wealth, even my children’s lives, to topple that regime,” he said. He went on to form a small rebel group composed mainly of local people from the old city: some of his factory workers and even a few of their sons. They based themselves in the alleyways of the souks, around the Antakya Gate.Eventually, in 2017, after the rebels retreated from Aleppo, Annas smuggled himself into Turkey and decided to start over, doing what he knew best: making garments. The business thrived and, after a few years, he managed to make enough money to settle his children into their own apartments and expand his operation.Yet the pain of exile never left him. Every night he sat with his family, repeating the same stories of his father’s and grandfather’s journey into Aleppo and its old souks, and of how everything they had built there was now gone. “Even my wife and sons were bored with me repeating the same old stories about Aleppo,” he told me. “I had no one left to tell these stories to except my youngest grandchild.” Every Sunday, he would take the boy to a park in Istanbul and repeat the same tales: “We had lands and factories in the greatest city in the world.”“The poor boy would listen quietly. Sometimes, he would say,Jido[grandad], I know all of that, but he still listened without complaining.”The al-Madina Souk is made up of a network of smaller souks, each devoted to a trade: spices, ropes, olives, fabrics and so on. Nine of 54 souks have been renovated, and when I visited, they were full again with people: shoppers jostling, merchants shouting, porters clearing paths for their pushcarts, customers testing underwear and bras by pinching the fabric between index finger and thumb.Many of the souks remain in ruins. Grass grows on the roofs of caved-in stalls, and domes have collapsed, casting sharp shadows. Shop shutters are still twisted and riddled with bullet holes. In one ancient khan that served as a barracks during the war, iron bars that once formed part of elegant facades, now prop up half-destroyed walls. Inside, on the day I visited, there were still stacks of sandbags, rusted cans of army rations and filthy mattresses. Fires had turned a vaulted ceiling black, and bits of plaster were then punctured by bullets, giving the impression of stars sparkling in a dark sky. In the middle of what was once a busy thoroughfare, an old guard’s sofa sat abandoned.At one point, as I wandered along a dark alleyway, the sound of a drum rose from a hammam. A small crowd gathered as young men danced a groom out towards his wedding party. Some people hurried past the ruins towards the parts of the souks that have been renovated, while others lingered to take selfies.View image in fullscreenRuins of the historic souks in the Old City.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianIn one of the oldest and most magnificent khans, a dozen or so young men crouched on the floor, in semi-darkness, shaving soap bars into perfect cubes, as if war had never come to this city, but outside, the ruins and rubble stretch for hundreds of metres on each side. Some ceilings remain charred. Others have been repaired. A number of renovations are delicate, respectful of the old fabric; others look like the corridors of a shopping mall. Even in those souks where everything is still burned, where entire market lanes sit dark and abandoned, men have returned to sit on plastic chairs outside their ruined shops, waiting, watching, refusing to leave the place that once made them who they were.Annas told me that his newest challenge came from far away: China. Since the fall of the regime, customs duties had been removed and tariffs slashed, flooding the old markets with cheap imported merchandise and crippling Aleppo’s remaining industries. “If they don’t stop the imports, I won’t be able to reopen my workshops,” Annas told me. “Do you know how many people work to make a single bra? There’s the one who sews, the one who glues the sponge, the one who attaches the elastic, and then …” He stopped, counting on his fingers. “Thirty-five people. Thirty-five people work in the process of making a single bra.”He looked around the ruined courtyard, the broken arches and fallen stones. “I don’t need the UN or the Americans,” he said. “Just close the border to Chinese goods, and we’ll find work for thousands of workers.”In recent weeks, two Kurdish enclaves in Aleppo have come under fire, and reports say thatmore than 300 Kurds have been detained. These areas were considered relatively safe during the war, and are packed with people – Arabs, Kurds and Christians – who fled their homes when their houses were destroyed. The local politician I spoke to has been involved in negotiating safe passage for civilians trying to escape this new outbreak of fighting. “I can see the columns of smoke rising from Sheikh Maqsoud [one of the two areas], and the scenes of the people fleeing are breaking my heart. It’s like the early days of the war,” he said.The recent violence, he says, stems from the two sides being unable to reach a solution. “The government can’t accept the presence of armed formations inside the city [the Kurds], and the Kurds don’t want to give up their weapons because they don’t trust the government.”View image in fullscreenA man collecting stones from the rubble to use again, Amiriya district, Aleppo.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianWalking through the ruins of Aleppo, it often feels as if the conflict is not over, as if snipers might still be peering from their hideouts. Cities such as Beirut, Sarajevo and Mosul feel as if they continuously live in the shadow of their former wars. And maybe the only way to defeat that fear is not by erasing the ruins and building anew, but by following Abu Arab’s way of confronting the destruction little by little, fixing a frame, fitting a door, patching a wall, conquering the ruins brick by brick.I asked Abu Arab if he had tried to come back and live in the house after the fighting in Aleppo ended in 2017. He said yes. A few months after the rebels left, he had tried to return to the house again. This time, he found it occupied by a company of government soldiers. The walls were blackened with soot, and whatever had not already been looted was now gone. The soldiers did not believe his story that he was visiting his family home. They detained him immediately, hoisted him by his arms from the ceiling, and began interrogating and torturing him: wasn’t this house occupied by terrorists? Who were they? Did he permit them to establish their sniper post upstairs?His detention and torture were brief. The soldiers found nothing on him, except that he had never completed his reserve military service. He was promptly conscripted and sent to serve in the army for two years. During one of the battles, he was wounded in the leg, an injury that never healed. (This was the cause of his limp.) After that, he had waited for the regime to fall before he dared return.Hunting for books in the ruins: how Syria’s rebel librarians found hopeRead moreBefore leaving, he led me into what must once have been the living room. It was filled with old soldiers’ mattresses and trash. From behind a paint canister, he pulled out the flag of the former regime: red, black and white with green stars.“Why do you still keep it?” I asked him.“I don’t know,” he said. “You never know what might happen in this country.”“Do you really think Assad might come back?” I asked, incredulous.“I don’t know,” he said quietly. “We have seen a lot … and been burned many times.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readSyriaAleppoBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

That went well, then. A day after Keir Starmer gently pointed out that the US would be wrong to seize Greenland and that a period of calm diplomacy was needed, Donald Trump goes mad. Again. Having already rubbished the Norwegian prime minister for not awarding him the Nobel peace prize, the US president took aim at the UK prime minister. No good deed goes unpunished and all that.The Chagos Islands deal was anact of gross stupidity, The Donald posted on his Truth Social platform. No matter that nine months previously he hadwarmly endorsed it. No one knows if he could even find Diego Garcia on a map. Sure, he can. Next to Greenland. That’s loyalty and consistency for you. And teach Starmer not to take anything he does or says for granted. Let’s face it, not even Trump is entirely sure what Trump will do next. Depends on how he is reacting to his meds on any given day. The world is one step closer to chaos.Still. Try to look on the plus side. At least Keir didn’t have his personal messages to the president made public. Emmanuel Macron’s refusal to join Trump’s board of peace – not everyone reckons Vladimir Putin is an ideal working partner – had France threatened with 200% tariffs on wine and champagne. It’s hard to keep up with this level of insanity. Maybe Trump is banking on Nato countries giving him Greenland just to make him shut up and go away. Who knows? It could even work.All of which gave more of an edge to Mike Johnson’s speech to both houses of parliament, which had previously been billed as soporific filler to mark the 250th year of American independence. Though still not enough to guarantee a full room. There were plenty of spare seats. The last time I had been in committee room 14 it had been for a Tory leadership announcement. Then it had been packed.Maybe the reputation of the US speaker of the House of Representatives precedes him. Barely even the monkey to Trump’s organ grinder. There was a time when Johnson was one of The Donald’s useful idiots. A previously relatively sane Louisiana Republican who had drunk the Maga Kool-Aid. Had fought to overturn the 2020 presidential election.Now you get the feeling Johnson is no longer even useful to Trump. He certainly won’t be if Congress turns Democratic at the November midterms. So Mike has to make do with just being an idiot. To give him his due, he doesn’t seem that bothered. The Contented Halfwit. It’s a job and someone’s got to do it.The mood in the room was one of enforced jollity. One where everyone was trying not to mention the one thing that was on everyone’s mind. Like a wedding where all the guests are trying to ignore that the bride’s father has passed out and was last seen face down in his lunch. DON’T MENTION THE WAR. DON’T MENTION THE WAR. Keep it light. We’re all friends really. Even if right now it feels as the best man is now kicking the groom in the head.Johnson began with a quick dig at the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. He had noted that the UK speaker had a tendency to go on a bit. He wasn’t wrong. Hoyle loves his own voice above all others. Then the obligatory note of thanks. It was a huge honour for him to be allowed to give an address to a three-quarters-full committee room at 9.30 in the morning. It was hard to know if he was being sarcastic or not. But maybe he has hidden depths. Let’s give him the benefit of the doubt. Hoyle could find himself talking in a broom cupboard in the Capitol if he manages to wangle a return invite.Then a nod to the serious stuff. He had met Starmer the day before and had praised him for his press conference. His address had been well judged. A tribute to the special relationship. “We work through our differences calmly,” he said. Really? I’d hate to think how things would look if we were ever to fall out with Trump. Or maybe Mike is just happiest when he is not seeing anything very much. Only the day before he was claiming not to have seen the president’s social media posts about the Nobel peace prize. That was above his pay grade. He had come to the UK for an extended lig. Not to defend his boss.Mike did at least have the grace to sound a bit embarrassed. As if deep down he recognised his own absurdity. Nothing to do but to plough on. “I spoke to President Trump yesterday,” he said. “And I told him my mission is to calm the waters.” It was unclear what The Donald had said by way of a reply. Or whether Johnson had just been talking to the president’s answerphone. Because there is no sign of Trump letting up. He is getting madder by the day. Or “disinhibited”, as the BBC likes to put it. It’s too late now for the anti-psychotic meds. They can take days to kick in. Only an overdose of Xanax will do.The rest of the speech passed in something of a rose-tinted blur. Sentences like fluffy clouds rolling into one another. He is very easy on the ear. The perfect narrator for self-help books on dealing with anxiety. The only trouble was that it sounded as if it had been written by AI. “ChatGPT, write me a feelgood speech that will go down well with the Brits and drops plenty of names.”Only it turned out AI may also have a finely tuned sense of irony. For, time and again, Mike talked of the need to confront tyrants, apparently unaware there was one already in the White House. “All men are created equal and free,” he said. Except they really aren’t. Least of all in the US. He worried about the loss of human rights around the world. Though didn’t register a flicker about the use of ICE squads in Minneapolis. It was almost as if Johnson was being wilfully stupid. Somehow assuming that no one in the room would be able to join the dots for themselves.“The Declaration of Independence was not a repudiation of Britain,” he said. By now those that were not asleep or looking at their phones were looking decidedly confused. What was the Declaration of Independence if not a severance of constitutional links? Mike pressed on. God had created every one of us. And clearly had it in for some of us. The world was too woke. We were only ever one generation away from totalitarianism. Yes. And he was a spokesman for that generation.Finally, Not So Magic Mike drew to a close. It was time for everyone to re-engage with reality. Not a moment too soon.Explore more on these topicsHouse of CommonsThe politics sketchHouse of LordsMike JohnsoncommentShareReuse this content"

Greenland is a moment of great ruptureChristopher S ChivvisTrump’s demand for Greenland is a throwback to the 1884 Berlin conference: a transaction of land and people driven by a might makes right worldviewTue 20 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 17.23 ESTShareThe announcement on 17 January that Washington will imposepunitive tariffsof 10% to 25% on eight European allies – unless they facilitate the “complete and total purchase” of Greenland – is likely to be the death knell of the post-1945 transatlantic order. By linking the territorial sovereignty of a Nato ally to trade access, the US has transitioned from Europe’s security guarantor to a 19th-century imperial rent-seeker.This is a moment of profound rupture. For decades, the western world believed that raw imperialism had been relegated to the past among advanced industrial powers. Even China, for all its assertiveness, largely couches its ambitions in the language of revanchism – the “reclaiming” of lost territory. Washington’s current demand for Greenland, by contrast, is a throwback to the age of the 1884 Berlin conference: a transaction of land and people driven by a might makes right worldview.To be sure, this act of raw aggression faces pushback within the US. Senator Thom Tillis has rightly criticized the coercive effort andpublic pollingshows that while a segment of the Republican party favor a purchase, only 8% of Americans support the use of force to acquire the territory. But Europe must realize it is dealing with a president drunk on executive power, undeterred by congressional dissent or a skeptical public that he views as malleable and more concerned with the cost of living and culture wars than Arctic sovereignty.The strain is already intense for Europe. Trump’s pressure is designed to expose EU fault lines and sow internal division by forcing member states to prioritize different existential threats and divergent interests. Denmark has a near-existential interest in preventing this annexation. France and Germany have an interest in demonstrating EU cohesion, yet risk seeing their vital access to US export markets severed.The most tragic tension, however, is on the eastern flank. Poland and the Baltic states view Russian aggression as an immediate, physical threat that only American boots and missiles can deter. To maintain that shield, they will want to stay silent on Greenland. Yet Trump’s policy presents them with an impossible paradox: the very coercion being used to force a deal on Greenland undermines the logic of the security guarantee itself. What responsible sovereign power in Warsaw or Tallinn can put stock in the word of an ally that uses the threat of abandonment to compel the sale of a neighbor’s territory?Brussels isalready reachingfor its most powerful defensive tool: the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI). This “trade bazooka”, designed to bypass national vetos through qualified majority voting, allows a range of EU retaliation. But firing it against Washington would be a major escalation – and probably irreversible. For the eastern flank, activating the instrument risks acting on a suicide pact; for Paris and Berlin, failing to activate it could be the end of European sovereignty.In the face of this trauma, the traditional European habit will be to try to weather the storm. There is a deep-seated institutional hope in Brussels and Berlin that this is a temporary aberration – that if Europe simply absorbs the tariffs and waits until 2028, transatlantic relations will return to “normal”.This reflex must be actively resisted. The wait and see approach is no longer a strategy. It is a recipe for perpetual vassalage. The Greenland crisis is not just bad weather. It is a structural shift. European leaders must use this crisis as the necessary political catalyst to further the continent’s own sovereign defenses.To survive, Europe must overcome the bureaucratic and nationalistic resistance that has long stalled defense integration. It must seize on this crisis to force recalcitrant national defense industries into irreversible cooperation. To fund this, leaders need to break long-standing taboos to re-energize the continent’s economy through a radical mix of immigration, economic liberalism and wise industrial policy that boosts Europe into the first tier of technological powers.Doing so will generate turmoil by challenging entrenched interests on both the left and the right. The urgency of the mid-21st century will not permit a gradual approach. Producing the financial resources for an independent defense will take years; every month spent debating is a month lost. The choice is no longer between the status quo and integration. It is between a painful European rebirth or a slow descent into a world where the EU collapses internally, its security is in tatters and it becomes a target for expansion in Moscow.Christopher S Chivvis is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former US national intelligence officer for EuropeExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

One is the story told by the ruling classes in Denmark, the other is the narrative that unites progressives and nationalists in Greenland.The moral of the first tale is that Greenland, as a part of the Danish kingdom, has managed the extremely challenging transition to a modern society without sacrificing its culture or identity. This is a rare and impressive achievement. Greenlanders are among the only indigenous people in the world with their own parliament, political institutions and education system and who have maintained their own language. And they have access to the same welfare services as other citizens ofDenmark.This has been achieved under difficult conditions by only around 55,000 inhabitants on a vast island in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, isolated from the rest of the world. True, the people of Greenland were not asked to consent when they were integrated into the Danish kingdom in 1953, after more than 200 years as a Danish colony. But in referendums in 1979 and 2008 a majority of them voted in favour of a revised arrangement that allowed them to expand political control over their own territory and resources. Greenland’s constitution calls the period from 1953 to 1979 a phase of “hidden colonisation”, but also recognises that the next decades constitute an era of “decolonisation”.View image in fullscreenResidents of Nuuk, Greenland, on 18 January 2026.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesIn this narrative, the Danish kingdom has served as a formidable vehicle for Greenlanders to achieve self-determination. Freedom for Greenland from this perspective is not about formal independence or liberation from old masters, it’s about gradually building institutions and the capacity for self-determination – under the Danish crown.Colonialism continuedThe other narrative sees Greenland’s recent history as merely a continuation of colonisation. It claims that the Danes have never respected Greenlanders as equals, and that the Danes have always been illegitimate rulers. Here in fact is the “hidden colonisation” in question: a term that reflects the unequal pay between Danes and Greenlanders, the negative attitudes of Danish employers in Greenland and the way in which the Danish media talk about Greenland in general.Those who tell this story point to scandals such as the practice in the 1960s and 70s of Danish doctorsimplanting contraceptive IUDsin the wombs of thousands of Greenlandic women and girls without their consent or knowledge, as part of a campaign to limit Greenland’s birthrate. The Danish government hasofficially apologised, but approximately half the fertile women in Greenland wereforcibly fitted with contraceptionat the time. Then there’s the 22children who were taken from their familiesin Greenland and transported to Denmark, where they were supposed to be educated as the next generation of the colony’s capable rulers. The Danish prime ministerhas acknowledgedthese moral failures. But such dark episodes reveal, according to this narrative, that the Danes saw themselves as the white masters on a mission to bring civilisation to savages.Where the story held by the ruling classes often refers to institutional progress and welfare reform, the story of those who demand Greenland’s independence speaks of persistent and institutional racism in Denmark against people from Greenland.This iswidely documentedand I think anyone who has lived here in Denmark has encounteredexamples of racismagainst Greenlanders. The fact that there is a demeaning phrase for heavy intoxication that refers to being “as drunk as someone from Greenland”, so commonly used that it’s in the officialDanish dictionary, speaks of ongoing humiliation and a denial of human dignity to Greenlanders.You could say Greenland’s people have been institutionally decolonised but still seek the dignity and pride of being their own masters.Battles of modernisationSo you have the ruling classes insisting that Greenland’s consent is the first and decisive premise for the present arrangement. There is a very broad public consensus that Denmark cannot rule Greenland against the will of its citizens.At the same time, many people in Denmark say that Greenland still lacks the capacity to deal with its own social problems or its economy. They point to the €600m that Greenland receives every year from Denmark as proof that their freedom is paid for by their so-called colonisers, and argue that blaming everything on Danish colonialism is a way of escaping responsibility for their own failures.These two narratives can be a feature of any society that has gone through a process of rapid modernisation.But in the case of Greenland and Denmark, the tensions have been intensified by cultural and geographical distance. It is morally and politically difficult to defend an arrangement in which a huge island is governed by a small country with an entirely different social and cultural history, thousands of miles away, unless the people of Greenland choose it as their collective path to greater self-determination.I’m not saying you have to choose between these two stories. Most people accept that both perspectives are part of the same complex history. And the political divide in Greenland is not between those who want independence and those who want to remain in the kingdom of Denmark. Rather it is between those who want formal autonomy in the near future and those who consider it a long-term goal. The broad but fragile government stresses that it wants to remain in the kingdom, but only “for now”; it is a temporary arrangement.View image in fullscreenA demonstration in Copenhagen, Denmark, against US interference in Greenland, 17 January 2026.Photograph: Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg/ShutterstockEven after thedirect threat of annexationby the Trump administration, most public figuresin Greenland refused to explicitly recognise the kingdom of Denmark as their political home. The distance between the Danish and Greenlandic governments has been revealed in numerous public statements in recent months. Danish leaders have insisted on a united “we”, whereas Greenlandic voices have repeated that they are neither Danish nor American. This changed on Tuesday last week, when Greenlandic government leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen said during a joint press conference with the Danish prime minister thatGreenland would pick Denmark over the USif asked to choose, “here and now”.For the first time, the two parties almost managed to speak with one voice. This past weekend marked another moment of historic solidarity, when peoplein both territoriescame together to demonstrate against Trump’s threats. Protesters in a number of Danish cities waved Greenland flags.Exploiting divisionsThe great irony of this story is that theTrump administration, which leads a culture war against “woke” post-colonial ideology in American universities, has understood thepolarising potential of the division between the former coloniser and the colonised. This is why Trump makes appeals to anti-colonial forces in Greenland.Much of what the Americans say about Greenland displays both their ignorance and their own imperial arrogance. It’s not true that they need ownership of Greenland for national security. Thanks to a 1951 treaty, the US military has had unlimited access to all parts of the island and maintains its own Greenland base.The US already possesses the military monopoly on legitimate violence in Greenland. JD Vance often emphasises that the Danes havenot lived up to their security obligationsin Greenland, which is true. But neither has the US, which has also done very little for security there.The claim that it needs Greenland for rare-earth minerals and resources is also unconvincing. Greenland has long been open for business and invited investors to the country. But the Americans have not taken up these opportunities. The decisive challenge here is not access to resources, but building the infrastructure required to exploit them. It’s a high-risk investment, and the US currently lacks the capacity to cultivate rare-earth minerals.View image in fullscreenJD Vance visiting the US military’s Pituffik space base in Greenland, 20 March 2025.Photograph: Jim Watson/ReutersDespite so many false claims and so much misinformation, the Trump administration’s approach to Greenland is clever. It says that if Greenland does become independent, it will be so strategically attractive and at the same time so politically weak, that it will besnapped up by China or Russia. The US cannot allow that to happen, it says.Consequently, if the call for independence in Greenland and the resistance to Denmark is strong, it delivers a kind of legitimacy for a US conquest. If, on the other hand, Denmark and Greenland speak with one voice against the US and for self-determination within the kingdom, it will make it a lot harder for Trump to take it.But the Trump administration has actually managed to expose the divisions between the two stories that Greenland and Denmark tell themselves. Even though there’s a clear legal and political answer to thequestion posed by Trump’s aide Stephen Millerquerying Denmark’s right to rule over Greenland, it does challenge the moral legitimacy of the arrangement.The dilemma for GreenlandThis places Greenland in a dilemma. Its best leverage against the old colonial master, Denmark, is that it is now attractive to the US administration. But its best defence against a new imperial master is the recognition of the legitimacy of the old one. Either it uses Trump to pressure Denmark or it uses the Danish kingdom to protect itself from him.After years of being ignored, Greenlandic voices and preferences are being listened to and transmitted to a global audience. They can use Trump’s interest to pressure a Danish government that has suddenly shown a great deal of interest in the wellbeing of Greenlanders. The government has even proposed a strategyto combat anti-Greenlandic racism in Denmark, which is remarkable for a leadership that has challenged international law to make life hereless attractive for immigrants.This recognition of Greenlanders’ consent and agency does give them some dignity. But for a very small population in a geo-strategically vital position to insist on their independence and dignity is dangerous.As the true nature of Trump’s offensive emerges, this danger is becoming increasingly clear. He makes appeals to anti-colonial impulses in Greenland even as he openly reveals his true imperial ambitions. Yet he is no longer polarising Danes and Greenlanders, but uniting us.From a Danish perspective, it’s hard to refute the challenge from Miller. The status quo is the result of an arbitrary deal that made Denmark the ruling power in Greenland.As Danes, we don’t “deserve Greenland”; Greenlanders deserve freedom under the conditions they choose.But for the people in Greenland this is existential. Their basic conditions of life will be radically changed if they become part of Trump’s US empire. They will lose rights and protections. Maybe they will be paid generously on the first day and get access to other opportunities. But their lives will be less secure, more vulnerable and less dignified. They will be offered a deal by a man who neither respects any political commitment nor cares about people. He does not even celebratehuman rightsand political freedom in principle. He’s not transactional, he’s extractive.We know by now that what he wants in Greenland isabsolutely unacceptable, but also not impossible. He wants ownership, this is “psychologically needed”, he says. It’s not about security or minerals, it’s about the ambition that the French called “la gloire” (the glory). He has a yearning to become a historic president, to expand US territory.This is the tragedy of the people of Greenland: when they finally get the leverage to assert their dignity and demand recognition from their old master, they are confronted with a new, much stronger and more ruthless colonial master. And all of this is happening in a new geopolitical era, where an old phrase from Thucydides seems to describe the worldview of today’s rulers: “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”Rune Lykkeberg is editor-in-chief of the Danish newspaper InformationExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDenmarkColonialismDonald TrumpEuropeUS foreign policyTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

It is not because ministers have decided it’s embarrassing that eight years have passed sincethe collapse of Carillion, the massive corporate failure that reminded everybody that auditing is boring until it matters greatly that outsiders can trust the published numbers. Rather, it is because the government has given up on a reform bill. It would rather give another airing of its “pro-growth” refrain.“While the planned reforms would be beneficial, some would increase costs on business, and it would not be right to prioritise these over more deregulatory measures,” the minister for small business, Blair McDougall, formally told the business select committee. He had other explanations – not enough parliamentary time and “the need for major reform is less pressing than it was” – but all can be regarded as a case of short memory syndrome.Back in 2018, the chaotic collapse ofCarillion, one of the country’s biggest construction and contracting firms, prompted near-universal agreement that the quality of audit in the UK, and audit regulation, was overdue for a major upgrade.Almost 3,000 employees lost their jobs and, since the company was up to its neck in contracts to service schools and hospitals, the government had to spend £150m to maintain basic services. The shocking detail was that it took just six months from Carillion’s first profits warning to full calamity. At the end, liabilities were about £7bn and cash just £29m.KMPG, as auditor, copped a record fine from the audit watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), and the fallout continues, with two ex-Carillion directors beingfined by the Financial Conduct Authorityas recently as this month. But, back in 2018 the whole saga was viewed as so serious that a new regulator was needed, armed with stiffer powers and a broader remit, as recommended by the City grandee Sir John Kingman in a review for government. A white paper was issued in 2021 but a bill never made it on to the legislative agenda of the Brexit-consumed last Tory government. Now it won’t appear under Labour either.The best that can be said in the government’s defence is that it is correct that the FRC, after a clear-out of old management, upped its game in subsequent years. The club looks less cosy now that the big four have separated their audit and advisory arms.But the biggest flaw was always the FRC’s lack of statutory status to guarantee its annual funding and its powers to summon witnesses. If the FRC is being retained, rather than replaced, will it at least be put on statutory footing as a matter of absolute urgency? “As soon as parliamentary time allows,” is the government’s weak promise.But there seems to be no intention even to try to resuscitate other elements that were previously viewed as vital. One was the proposal to bring the largest private companies into a tighter regulatory auditing system (the BHS failure happened at roughly the same time as Carillion’s). A second was the plan to give the regulator powers to hold to account directors who are not members of accounting bodies. If the government regards those proposals as inessential pieces of regulatory flummery, it should rethink. Private companies are getting bigger all the time and the FRC, not just the FCA, should be able to go after all directors in cases like Carillion.A generation ago, in 2001, the US had its “Enron moment”, the bankruptcy of a major energy company amid an accounting scandal. Within a year, it had passed theSarbanes-Oxley Act, which rearmed regulators and created criminal penalties for corporate misreporting. In the UK, the “Carillion moment” of 2018 has been met with eight years of ineffectual fiddling by successive governments that will result, maybe, in the bare-minimum requirement of statutory powers for the regulator being tacked on to some other financial bill. This does not feel like dynamism in action.Explore more on these topicsCarillionNils Pratley on financeAccountancyOutsourcingFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsCorporate governanceFinancial sectorcommentShareReuse this content"

We must fight and win itRayner urges Starmer to keep promise on leasehold reformTue 20 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 13.29 ESTShareAt cabinet last Tuesday the prime minister reportedly made a powerful case for a government that serves the interests of those struggling to get by. He is right. The cost of living emergency is the issue of our time.It is a crisis not months, but years in the making. For more than two decades, living standards have been crushed and there is an increasing sense of a country where people cannot get on, of a system stacked against them.In the face of this deep-set disillusionment,Labourin government has been at its best when challenging the status quo. By standing firm in the face of established interests who have had it their own way for decades – that’s exactly what the landmark Employment Rights Act and Renters’ Rights Act have done, delivering new protections for millions.And now, this government has a fresh opportunity to show whose side it is on – by ending the scandal of unregulated and unaffordable ground rents faced by leaseholders, as we pledged in our manifesto.Millions of people suffering from this scandal expect action in the imminent draftleasehold and commonhold reform bill. Many of them are young families who have tried to do everything right. They entered the jobs market in the teeth of a great recession; they endured the worst collapse in living standards in generations; and they scrimped and saved and managed to get their foot on the housing ladder.Yet despite owning their home, they hand out hundreds, and in some cases thousands of pounds a year in ground rents to unaccountable investors, often from overseas, for the right to occupy the land on which the home they live in was built. Unlike service charges, leaseholders get nothing in return for these payments. And for many this is made worse because the rates at which they pay can escalate with total impunity, in some cases doubling every five to 10 years.In the past, ground rents were of a low or a symbolic peppercorn value. Over recent decades, though, ordinary homeowners have been charged high and escalating amounts of ground rent, leaving them in financial distress and often unable to sell or remortgage their homes.The Competition and Markets Authority has found that nearly 1m leases have one of these escalating or onerous ground-rent clauses. Where they are replaced, it’s often made even worse, with a formula pegged to inflation, leading to huge and unpredictable increases for hard-pressed homeowners.All this misery for ordinary homeowners to do nothing more than sustain the unearned income stream of unaccountable investors – it’s not right.Labour made a promise to leaseholders that we would fix this injustice, but ministers are currently subjected to furious lobbying from wealthy investors trying to water down this manifesto commitment.There are those who argue we cannot act on our promise as it could risk a backlash from investors, including pension funds. It’s hardly surprising – the system works just fine for them. They get an annual return for doing absolutely nothing, they can raise ground rents and pile up service charges without transparency, with total impunity, regardless of the devastation it causes to families.But only a very small amount of UK pension fund assets are actually dependent on ground rents. The government’s own figuressuggest this could even be below 1%and easily absorbable. They are also niche investments with little risk to wider investor confidence. In any case, this unproductive investment does nothing to grow our economy. Incentivising investors to move towards productive investments – such as infrastructure, technology and capital to help businesses scale up – is exactly what we should be doing to promote growth.As things stand, this Labour government has a record on leasehold reform we can be proud of. We have already switched on a range of new protections and rights for leaseholders. Our draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill can move us on from the feudal leasehold system – but not without meaningful action to tackle ground rents; at the very least, an annual cash cap.If Labour cannot fix such an obvious injustice and show families whose living standards have been crushed that we will fight for them, then we shouldn’t be surprised if they lose faith that anything can change.This battle is a symbol of so much more. It is about whose side we are on, and who we are in government to fight for. Last week the prime minister powerfully made that case at cabinet. Now it is on all of us in government and parliament to deliver on it – so let’s get the job done.Angela Rayner is the Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and a former deputy prime ministerExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionLeaseholdPropertyLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

This is a historic moment – and a time to actTue 20 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 07.45 ESTShareAEuropean-wide chorus of resistance, ledthis morningby Keir Starmer, has greeted Donald Trump’s plan totake over Greenland, by force if necessary, and to start a tariff war if any country stands in his way. Have no doubt, this is a moment: if pursued as a non-negotiable demand, Trump’s plan ends any lingering hope that the liberal rules-based order can stumble on through his remaining time in office. The real question now is whether the 2020s will be defined by the complete collapse of the order’s already crumbling pillars and the atrocities accompanying it, or whether an international coalition of the willing can come together to build a new global framework in its place.For, in quick succession, the US has abandoned its longstanding championing of the rule of law, human rights, democracy and the territorial integrity of nation states. Gone is its erstwhile support for humanitarian aid and environmental stewardship. Gone, too, is the founding principle of the postwar settlement: that countries choose diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over aggression and unilateral action. We cannot doubt any longer that the president meant it when he said he doesn’t “need international law”, and that the only constraint on his exercise of power would be “my own morality, my own mind”.Indeed, in the past few weeks, every single promise of the US-ledAtlantic charter, authored by Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, which foreshadowed theUnited Nations charterand which includes “freedom of the high seas”, free trade and freedom from colonial aggrandisement, has seemingly been cast aside. For Trump, as his political adviser Stephen Miller tells us, the world is to be “governed by strength … by force ... [and] by power”.But if Greenland marks the end of the world looking to the US for leadership, it has also become the moment for Europe and the democracies of the global south to lift their heads out of the sand. They, and other democracies, should now set out a new statement of values and rules that show how we will champion peace, stability and justice, and deliver meaningful progress in areas where international cooperation is essential. AsKeir Starmer hasargued,reaffirmedby the attorney general at the80th anniversary celebrationof the United Nations in Londonon Saturday, this now means reinvigorating, for a new age and new challenges, the enduring shared values on which the post‑1945 institutions were founded.So how to proceed? The democracies of the world should draft a short values statement, echoing the UN charter’s starting point – “We the peoples …” – and this time showing we mean it. Its first section would assert our full support for self-determination and the mutual recognition of nation states; for the outlawing of war and coercion; and for the primacy of law, civil rights and democratic accountability as the essential means by which human dignity is advanced. A second section would outline the rules that govern the cooperation essential to guarantee food, water and security, economic opportunity and social justice, and climate resilience and health for all, including pandemic prevention.View image in fullscreenUN secretary general António Guterres with Keir Starmer at 10 Downing Street, London, 16 January 2026.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/ReutersSuch a charter should make it clear that no one need apply for the vacant leadership of the global order for, in our new multipolar world, power has to be shared among countries, each with vastly different traditions, ethnicities and ideologies. But neither can the new world acquiesce in what the US, Russia and China now threaten: a return to the19th-century arenaof spheres of influence and great-power domination.Instead, we have to ask how we can advance multilateral cooperation in a multipolar world, and so a charter has to take fully into account what has fundamentally changed long before the Trump presidency, and what was never considered seriously in the constitutions of 1945: the existential nature of the climate crisis; the rightful demands for gender equality; the modern threat of terrorism and the role of other non-state actors, including those with vast concentrations of accumulated wealth and technological power. Also the previously neglected but now rising aspirations of the global south; and perhaps most of all, the need to reach across borders to reflect our increased and inescapable interdependence.For one thing seems clear: the truth is that an “America first”, us-versus-them, nationalist politics that despises international cooperation does not have the support of the global public. In fact, they are ahead of leaders in understanding that the sheer extent of our dependence on each other gives us no other option but to work together. And whether it be the stranglehold China has through its monopoly of rare earths, or the maritime choke points that canclose downthe Strait of Hormuz and other trade corridors, we know that to prevent interdependence being weaponised in hostile ways, the rest of us must act together.We have arrived at a moment of truth for Europe. For too long, its voice has been silent as the Trump administration hasviolatedinternationally agreed trade rules; savagelyslashedinternational development aid; and threatenedCanadian,PanamanianandMexicanneighbours. This month, Trump’s US iswalking out of66 international organisations, most of which the US itself had created, while at the same time making the momentous decision to constitute an alternative, a “board of peace”, with a remit for interventions far beyond Gaza, and with membership offered to about 60 favoured states, including Russia.But no global initiative can hope to command wide support or be seen as legitimate if it is merely elites agreeing how to balance their power. And any new charter has to make the connection between meeting local needs and aspirations and the global cooperation that can bring this about. We need to reaffirm for a new generation the need for equality of opportunity and fairness of outcomes, and for what Roosevelt called thefour freedoms– of speech and worship, from want and from fear.Years from now the history books will tell us that Trump could have declared a quick victory in negotiations over Greenland – accepting theDanish offerof virtually unlimited military bases and access to Greenland’s25 critical minerals. But,to quotethe Danish foreign minister after his Washington talks: “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland.” With that Trump has truly signalled the end of the era when people in every continent saw the US as “a shining city on the hill”.That does not mean the US cannot lead again. In his 1961 inaugural address, President John F Kennedysaidwe must build “a new world of law where the strong are just and the weak are secure and the peace preserved”. That is a path the US, and the world, must walk again.Gordon Brown is the UN’s special envoy for global education and was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsOpinionGreenlandKeir StarmerDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

But legal troubles have not damaged the fortunes of her partyTue 20 Jan 2026 13.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 15.18 ESTShareIn a Paris courtroom, the first act of the 2027 French presidential election is already under way.On TuesdayMarine Le Pen began to answer judges’ questions in her appeal against a conviction relating to the embezzlement of European parliament funds. If she wins, the far-right leader will be free to run for the presidency for a fourth time. If the sentence is upheld, her 30-year-old protege, Jordan Bardella, is almost certain to take her place in the race.Having presented the original verdict as an assault on democracy by judges bent on thwarting her political ambitions, Ms Le Pen hassoftenedher stance. If the appeals court is swayed by arguments that offences committed by her National Rally party were inadvertent, a five-year ban on running for public office may be reduced or overturned. Even if she loses, however, her political opponents may not be inclined to celebrate too enthusiastically.Mr Bardella is seen by many voters as the likelier candidate to pull off a historic far-right triumph in 2027. Since Ms Le Pen’s conviction last March, he has performed a tricky balancing act, protesting her innocence while demonstrating his own credentials for taking her place. As party president, he has used the time to try tobroadenits appeal beyond a mainly blue-collar base, wooing the traditional right and business interests.More broadly, and ominously, the French far right may be dismantling the “republican barrier” which has hitherto blocked its route to the Élysée. Pollingpublishedthis month in Le Monde suggests that Ms Le Pen’s legal troubles have had little or no impact on her party’s fortunes. Instead, its ideas are steadily penetrating the mainstream while retaining an insurgent, anti-establishment appeal.More than 40% of respondents to the poll believed that the National Rally would improve the situation in France when it came to security, reindustrialisation, the quality of public services and the cost of living. Around one-third said that it was “the only party that can do things differently”. Growing numbers of voters are sympathetic to the policy of “national preference”, which would license discrimination against foreign residents in relation to housing, welfare and jobs.Virulent ethnonationalism has, of course, always been at the heart of Ms Le Pen’s politics, and the same goes for Mr Bardella. But the failure of mainstream governments to protect living standards and boost growth is allowing the far right to posture as a “patriotic” solution to a wider socioeconomic malaise.Mr Bardella’s assiduous courting of elites with promises of corporate tax cuts and deregulation represents a shift of emphasis, compared with Ms Le Pen’s focus on working-class concerns and the cost of living. But a strategy of being all things to all people is easier to pursue when there is no track record in power to critique.As the United States actively seeks tounderminethe European Union, and promote far-right nationalist parties as a kind of enemy within, the stakes in 2027 will be vertiginously high. Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former adviser and outrider, hasidentifieda far-right victory in France as a key stage in “killing” the EU.Whether their eventual opponent is Ms Le Pen or Mr Bardella, France’s mainstream parties have less than 500 days to find a way to see off a threat that has never been more real.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The UK clings to neoliberal ideas while households pay the priceTue 20 Jan 2026 13.29 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 15.19 ESTShareFood policyacross much of the world is changing. But not in Britain. That may be a costly mistake as the prices of essentials rise because of the climate emergency, geopolitical tensions and the fragility of just-in-time supply chains. Many capitals are now reviving their strategic food reserves. European nations such as Sweden, Finland, Norway and Germany are rebuilding stocks dismantled after the cold war. Climate shocks have led to Egypt and Bangladesh boosting similar programmes. Countries such as Brazil and Indonesia – sensitive to the food needs of their vast populations – are also expanding their reserves.The UK, by contrast, has no substantial public food reserves. Its strategy rests almost entirely on global markets and private intentions – an approach shaped by decades of liberalised trade. Even in the event of war, the official advice focuses on householdsstockpilingessentials. In Britain’s view, food security is about prices, not scarcity of supply.Basic foodstuffs don’t respond to market mechanisms in the way expected. Demand doesn’t drop suddenly when prices rise, as people still need to buy them to live. The planting, growing and harvesting of crops don’t adjust rapidly to price changes. Global grain markets are dominated by a few exporting regions such as the Black Sea, disruption to which has a huge effect on prices.Big playershold sway over many agricultural products, and speculative activity amplifies swings in prices.The economist Isabella Weber’sworkargues that public buffer stocks can act as shock absorbers – smoothing prices and ensuring physical supply. Critics of such a strategy argue that this is not needed as global food prices have dropped to their lowest level sinceJanuary 2025. But this is not the same thing as food becoming “cheap” or “stable”. In fact, prices are roughlya quarter abovepre-pandemic levels. In the UK, food prices are risingfasterthan the headline inflation rate – in part driven by key inputs such as cereals undergoing pricespikeslinked to Russia’s war on Ukraine.Countries withoutbufferscan quickly become price takers – opening the door to inflationary pressures. Food reserves make sense in this context. Stocks can be accumulated when prices are low – and released when inflation spikes or supply is restricted, to ensure that bills don’t zoom upwards. Losses incurred by buffers in periods of calm should be understood as the price of resilience, much like flood defences.China’s grain policy from2008 to 2016is often cited as a warning against food reserves. But China used stocks as open-ended price support, allowing corn inventories to balloon and deteriorate until much became unfit for food use. India faced the same shocks, but largely avoided this trap by setting limits on stockpiles and routinely moving grain through the system. Delhisucceededwhere Beijing stumbled because it designed buffers to work like insurance, not a price support mechanism.Britain is a post-industrial economy. But it would be wrong to think that it is insulated from volatile commodities in a way that bigger developing countries are not. London’s thinking needs to move on from the Washington consensus, asevidencemounts of the need for change. The UK must realise that resilience is not a rejection of markets but an acceptance of their limits. Other European nations have done so. Strategic food reserves are returning because we are in a world that no longer behaves as economic textbooks once assumed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Bullying is not strength, 18 January). However, Keir Starmer’s response remains weak. By saying Greenland is only a matter for Denmark and Greenland, he tries to rewind the clock to a status quo that is plainly no longer adequate.Greater vision has a clear historical precedent: for nearly 70 years, Antarctica has been kept out of military competition and resource grabs by theAntarctic treaty. With this 1959 treaty, countries with competing interests accepted that some places are too important to be owned, and must instead be protected for science, peace and the common good.That precedent applies even more strongly toGreenland. Its ice sheet plays a central role in regulating the global climate, and what happens there affects everyone. Creating a new strong international protectorate, explicitly safeguarding Greenlanders’ right to have a veto over its terms, could address defence and climate risks for the international community too. If the UK and the EU truly believe in strong diplomacy, this is the moment to show imagination, and to walk as well as talk, on the road back to international cooperation. Future stability could be built around a process of creating a Greenlandic international protectorate.Dr Rupert ReadCo-director, Climate Majority ProjectDr Andrew BoswellClimate policy consultantDr Nick BrooksDirector, Garama 3CBridget McKenzieFounder, Climate Museum UKI found the piece about Donald Trump’s billionaire “friend” Ronald Laudersickening (How a billionaire with interests in Greenland encouraged Trump to acquire the territory, 15 January). Lauder’s huge business empire deals in beauty, but his motives are beyond ugly. His cosy relationship with the president and his deals in Greenland are yet more evidence of the greedy gang of men getting rich with Trump – from his sons Donald Jr and Eric to his real‑estate pal Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.I have always loved one perfume made by Estée Lauder, called Pleasures. But I’ve now thrown it away. That sweet fragrance is poison for all of us who despise the exploitation of resources and peoples that this man and his evil gang stand for: they stink.Dee CookWhitchurch, ShropshireGreenland was part of the European Union until 1985, when it left following a referendum. As a then member of the European parliament’s Socialist group, I sat alongside Finn Lynge, representing the country for the Siumut party.Maybe in light of the fact that Donald Trump is intent on “conquering Greenland” and the country’s dramatically changed circumstances, and its preference for Denmark and the EU over the US, Ursula von der Leyen could offer fast-track re-entry. You never know, it might set a precedent.Glyn FordLabour MEP 1984-2009Surely it would send the US government a message if all European countries – not just those threatened by additional tariffs for supporting Greenland – stated that they would pull out of both the Fifa World Cup this year and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics if Trump persists in his plans to take over Greenland.Caroline DuchetChepstow, MonmouthshireIt’s a bit rich of Trump to ask of the Danes about Greenland: “Why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago” (Donald Trump links Greenland threats to Nobel snub as EU trade war looms, 19 January). Surely that’s the same premise that led to the existence of the United States of America?Rupert FeatherstoneDickleburgh, NorfolkWait, so are you telling me that appeasement doesn’t work (EU considers retaliatory measures over Trump Greenland tariff ‘blackmail’, 19 January)?

As combined authorities start to form, it is these hyperlocal councils that will be taking the lead in shaping solutions that are genuinely rooted in place and driven by the people who live there.At Lewes town council, the conversations we are having focus on how these changes could be an opportunity for the town. Sussex is one of the six counties on the government’s priority programme for establishing a combined authority. As the possibility of a more unified county structure edges closer, we are having to think imaginatively about the future. That means exploring how residents can lead discussions on creating truly community‑led and place‑based solutions to the most local issues.With the future of local elections still uncertain, this is a chance to engage with your most local decision-makers. If communities want town and parish councils that truly reflect their needs and ambitions, now is the time to help shape them.Veronique PoutrelTown clerk, Lewes town council, East SussexDepriving people of their right to elect their local councillors for several years, pending the establishment of new unitary authorities, is definitely undemocratic, but might possibly be justifiable if the existing councils were all doing a competent job. But allowing councils that are notorious for being inefficient, unresponsive and unaccountable to their constituents to continue to run their counties for years after their term of office has ended, unelected and without a mandate, is not justifiable.InEast Sussex, the May 2025 local elections were cancelled, the mayoral elections have been postponed until 2028, and the county council, at the invitation of the government, has opted to postpone its own election due in May. The unelected county councillors will now have the lead responsibility in shaping its replacement, if any.

We have the ­feeling that everything is going wrong in many details and we have to try to change.”City have yet to record a league win in this calendar year and this ­painful reverse leaves them on 13 points in theChampions Leaguebefore ­Galatasaray’s visit next week to close out the league phase. For them, ­entering the last 16 directly is left in the ­balance. Bodø/Glimt’s most famous scalp gives them six points, keeping alive their dream of making the playoffs.View image in fullscreenFans go wild as Jens Petter Hauge celebrates scoring Bodø/Glimt’s third goal.Photograph: Michael Regan/Uefa/Getty ImagesIn 2017 Bodø played in Norway’s second tier, but by last year – having never previously won the championship – they were the four-in-a-row Eliteserien victors under Kjetil Knutsen. The former teacher said: “It’s big for us to beat one of the best in the world. All the fans are happy, a day they will remember for the rest of their lives – a great day for a small club likeBodø/Glimt.“We all had to pull up our sleeves – that was our motto. City weren’t very physical. Tottenham was more ­physical [in the Europa League last season]. But no celebrations – we are in pre-season. That is off the table.”His men went close to a dream start. Bodø broke and Høgh, then Ole Didrik Blomberg, shot. City replied almost immediately. This time a Rayan Cherki snapshot was saved low by Nikita Haikin; Phil Foden dropped the resulting corner towards Max Alleyne’s head yet with a gaping goal he failed to connect. Erling Haaland – brought up in Byrne, about 1,800km south of here – was next put in along a right-hand channel but the No 9’s chip was gathered by Haikin.Quick GuideSalford beat Swindon to set up Manchester City tieShowSalford secured an FA Cup fourth-round visit to the Etihad Stadium with a 3-2 home win against Swindon. The hosts took a 2-0 lead with goals in the 11th and 52nd minute from Ryan Graydon on debut. Ollie Palmer pulled one back for the visitors in the 55th minute before James Ball equalised with half an hour left. Luke Garbutt, the Salford captain, curled in the 68th-minute winner from a free-kick 25 yards out. Swindon’s Ryan Tafazolli thought he had made it 3-3 late on but his strike was disallowed for a foul.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bodø showed how to finish – twice – through carbon‑copy moves. Each time City’s defence was exposed down its left, where Max Alleyne and Nico O’Reilly allowed Blomberg to scoop over crosses. Høgh’s first finish was a header, from a tight angle, to the left of goal. The second was more central, a little further out, and as composed, with his right boot.Cue bedlam from all inside the 8,000-capacity Aspmyra Stadion, minus the 404 travelling faithful who were as stunned as Guardiola was anguished. He had offered a no‑excuses line regarding the surface and the plunging temperatures; for this fishing village 80km north of the Arctic Circle the -1C at kick-off was actually temperate.When Sven Jablonski blew for ­half-time, Rodri’s moan to the ­German referee was emblematic of the state City were in – Bodø’s 31% possession telling the tale of their smash-and-grab act.Guardiola made zero ­adjustments, then watched Rodri aim a ­diagonal straight to a yellow shirt that caused him more despair. After Tijjani Reijnders’ effort went weakly into ­Haikin’s gloves, Bodø swarmed ­forward. Only Gianluigi ­Donnarumma’s leg thwarted Håkon Evjen, then the offside flag – correctly – denied Høgh his hat-trick.City were flat, bereft of spark, and when Hauge ghosted past a flailing Rodri, the ­finish beyond ­Donnarumma rocketed into the top-right corner, Bodø entered fantasy land.View image in fullscreenRodri is sent off for picking up two yellow cards inside two minutes.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockAt last City responded, Cherki’s low drive beating Haikin to his right. It came on 60 minutes, 120 seconds after Hauge’s strike. In the next 120, Rodri drew two bookings, both for similar cynical fouls to halt Bodø breaks, and off the captain went.This was all breathless. Hauge hit the bar, then Høgh had another goal wiped out for offside before Foden, again a non-factor, was replaced by Omar Marmoush. At the final whistle the delirious home support partied and City ­wandered off, schooled. The result and its buccaneering style is precisely why the sport can transfix.“Bodø played some incredible football and in the end it’s deserved,” Haaland told TNT Sports afterwards. “I don’t have the answers. I take full responsibility of not being able to score the goals I should do. I just apologise to every singleManchester Citysupporter, everyone that travelled today, because in the end it’s embarrassing.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBodø/GlimtManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A seventh win out of seven ensured Mikel Arteta’s side will head straight into the last 16 of this competition as one of the two top seeds after Gabriel Jesus scored twice – including their 19th goal of the season from a corner – to see off last year’s beaten finalists.It means that as well as getting one back over an Inter team that theylost to 14 months ago, Arsenal have surpassed their longest winning streak at this level. WhileManchester City’s surprise defeat in Norwayin the earlier kick-off had removed any jeopardy about them progressing, this was more evidence of the ruthless streak Arsenal have developed under Arteta. The only blot on the copybook in a fourth successive away game in four different competitions was Petar Sucic’s equaliser in the first half after Jesus had given Arsenal an early lead, although this was all about the Brazil striker even after the substitute Viktor Gyökeres sealed the points late on with a classy finish.Solanke eases Spurs past 10-man Borussia Dortmund to offer relief for FrankRead moreHaving just returned from 11 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, Jesus said on Tuesday that he wanted to fulfil his ambition of winning trophies with Arsenal. With his team seven points clear at the top of the Premier League and still in both domestic cup competitions, he will never get a better opportunity.“It’s a dream night,” said an emotional Jesus. “When I was a kid. I watched a lot of Serie A, so to be here in this stadium and score here – I had tears in my eyes because I always dreamed of being here.”Arteta was also full of praise for the 28-year-old and hopes the competition between him, Gyökeres and the returning Kai Havertz to start up front can inspire them to end the season with silverware.“We’ve been missing Gabi a lot,” he added. “I think he’s going to raise confidence levels in the teams because we now have different profiles in that position, like we have with the wingers in other positions. And the fact that those players are playing at that level gives the team a great impact as well in the game. It will only make us better.”Arsenal’s defeat by Inter in the group stages last year was still on Arteta’s mind in the buildup to this match, with a controversial penalty awarded against Mikel Merino proving decisive on that occasion. Despite the temptation to go strong in a bid to gain some revenge, he made seven changes to the side that drew with Nottingham Forest but still saw his players produce one of their most impressive performances of the season.Manuel Akanji had questioned whether Arsenal could be considered the best team in Europe beforehand, with the former City defender suggesting Bayern Munich are the team to beat this year. He may feel differently after the Serie A leaders were given a torrid time by Jesus and the outstanding Bukayo Saka.View image in fullscreenGabriel Jesus gives Arsenal an early lead with an acrobatic finish.Photograph: Ciancaphoto Studio/Getty ImagesThis grand old stadium is due to be demolished after Inter and their neighbours, Milan, purchased it from the city council in November and there was a cauldron of noise to greet the teams before kick-off. But it was Arsenal who seized the initiative immediately. Jesus was inches away from connecting with Jurriën Timber’s cross in the second minute and it was the same combination that found the breakthrough. Eberechi Eze’s pass into the penalty area was deflected into Timber’s path and his scuffed shot was diverted in by the alert Jesus, who was being played onside by Luis Henrique.Inter were level within eight minutes after William Saliba blocked a goal‑bound shot and it fell perfectly into the path of Sucic, whose strike took a tiny deflection off Martín Zubimendi’s heel to give David Raya no chance. Incredibly it was only the second time they have conceded in this year’s competition. Yet parity did not last for long. Arsenal went back in front when Leandro Trossard headed Saka’s corner against the crossbar and Jesus was on hand to snaffle the rebound.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres gets in on the act with a fine finish in a reminder of the depth of Arsenal’s striking resources.Photograph: Fabrizio Carabelli/PAThe home supporters felt they should have been awarded a penalty in the second half when Lautaro Martínez went down in the box under pressure from Saliba but the Portuguese referee was not interested. Compared with previous seasons, Saka has been rested far more in this campaign due to concerns over his workload and the benefits have been clear to see in recent weeks. A brilliant cross from the England forward picked out Trossard, only for his volley back across goal to miss the target.Saka was guilty of dallying when put clean through by Jesus and a last-ditch tackle from Alessandro Bastoni saved Inter. The substitute Pio Esposito almost made them pay when he found space inside the Arsenal area as Inter tried to step up the pressure. However it was Gyökeres who made sure of the victory when he latched on to a long ball from Gabriel Martinelli and beat Yann Sommer from outside the area to send an ominous warning to the rest of Europe.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueInternazionaleArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Nobody had given Tottenham any hope afterthe Premier League disasterhere against West Ham on Saturday, one which came coated in vitriol for Thomas Frank. The fans had demanded his immediate removal as the manager, only for him to stagger on.The execution was stayed. But here wereBorussia Dortmund, the Bundesliga’s second-placed team, who had lost only three games all season, to apply the final cut.Gabriel Jesus stakes claim at Inter as Arsenal celebrate qualification in styleRead moreFrank could see the bones of his squad – 13 players unavailable, only 11 established outfielders from which to select. Yet Spurs rebelled. Frank rebelled. And when it was over, he could reflect on having taken a huge step towards direct qualification into the Champions League’s last 16.It was a fourth home win out of four for Spurs in the competition – and a fourth clean sheet into the bargain. Wasn’t this stadium supposed to be a problem?Xavi Simons was the star turn, shrugging off the pain of the swollen ankle he sustained against West Ham, and he had support around him. Starting with the excellent Wilson Odobert.The game was shaped in part by Daniel Svensson’s harsh red card for Dortmund in the 24th minute but Spurs were ahead by then courtesy of Cristian Romero. When Dominic Solanke – on his comeback to the starting XI after an injury-ravaged season – looked as though he had fluffed a straightforward finish only for the ball to rebound home off his trailing foot, Spurs felt it would be their night.Frank has a distance to goto convince a sceptical fanbaseof his worth and it was noticeable that there was not much applause for him as he departed the pitch. He will probably settle for no boos. The road ahead continues to look precarious – on to Burnley on Saturday. It feels that Tottenham cannot dispense with him before that.View image in fullscreenReferee Glenn Nyberg shows a red card to Borussia Dortmund’s Daniel Svensson during the first half.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I’m very happy,” Frank said. “Two big glasses of red will be necessary. But I am very aware we need to keep this consistency. The big thing is to build on this with a performance and win against Burnley.”Frank changed his system again, lining up with three central defenders, mirroring how Dortmund set up. It was Destiny Udogie, who was back from injury, on the left of the trio, Djed Spence at left wing-back. They would emerge with honours.It looked like an inspired move at the outset. Spurs tore out of the blocks, with Spence throwing down the gauntlet to the Dortmund right wing-back, Yan Couto. Spence had the size, strength and skill to trouble him while Simons and Odobert were determined to make their moves; to be direct. Simons’s first-time passes were especially easy on the eye.The breakthrough goal swelled an unexpected feelgood factor. Spence won a corner after another surge around Couto and when Serhou Guirassy could only half clear, Odobert swung at the dropping ball and missed. He was quick to react, quicker than Julian Brandt and blasted over a low ball. It was made to measure for Romero, who swept home.It was a golden first half for Frank and Spurs, everything going their way. From the red card to Solanke’s lucky finish. Svensson knew what was coming when the referee, Glenn Nyberg, a fellow Swede, was advised to go to the pitchside monitor. Svensson had taken a heavy touch and he stretched out a leg in a bid to recover the ball. He swiped and missed, going into the side of Odobert’s knee instead. It was one that looked worse on the replays.Bodø/Glimt give Manchester City one hell of a Champions League beatingRead moreThe Spurs fans rubbed their eyes in disbelief. Guglielmo Vicario took a poor touch on 21 minutes and had to clear for safety but Spurs were winning so no harm done. There were cheers upon the half-time whistle, the knowledge that Frank’s team could have been further ahead. Simons had two decent sightings before the interval.Solanke could smile broadly after his first goal of the season. Odobert had danced away from his man to cross low and Solanke had a tap-in. Except he got himself into a tangle, the attempted flick going into his front foot, bouncing back off his trailing one and ricocheting in.Niko Kovac made changes for the second half, introducing Julian Ryerson at left wing-back and Emre Can into central midfield. The 10 men stabilised. It was possible to feel a few nerves among the home support and Frank did not need to lose Lucas Bergvall to injury. On came the 17-year-old Jun’ai Byfield for his debut at right wing-back. Pedro Porro moved into midfield. Byfield was safe and solid.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank needs to translate Tottenham’s Champions League form into wins in the Premier League.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSpurs dug in because the fatigue levels rose, Simons leading by example. He launched into one tackle on Couto and whipped up the crowd. When he later bought a yard inside the area to work Gregor Kobel, there was a smile on his face.Randal Kolo Muani, on as a substitute, was denied one‑on‑one by Kobel but it was about whether Dortmund could do anything at the other end.Apart from a stoppage-time header from Nico Schlotterbeck which Vicario tipped over, they created nothing. Porro could not finish when he ran clear at the very last.

Talks about the Greenland crisis were held informally on the sidelines of an event organised to celebrate the Hungarian football federation’s 125th anniversary, in the knowledge that a unified European response may be required should Trump seek to escalate the situation.Growing sense of embarrassment at Fifa over Donald Trump peace prizeRead moreFootball’s authorities have been reluctant to offer public responses to a fast-moving situation that threatens the territory of Denmark, aUefamember. But the demand for a reaction will intensify if Trump does not back down, particularly as the US will host 78 of the 104 games during the World Cup in June and July.Some senior figures believe military aggression to takeGreenland, which Trump has refused to rule out, would be the tipping point for a Uefa-led boycott or other major steps in protest at the US administration.Fifa’s leadership, who have forged close ties with Trump’s government, are thought to deem such a development unlikely at this point. Calls for a boycott have reared up in recent days, the German politician Jürgen Hardt suggesting recently that it would be a last-resort option and a petition in the Netherlands nearing 90,000 signatories by Tuesday evening.View image in fullscreenLocals play football in Ilulissat, Greenland. The territory has unsuccessfully applied to join both Uefa and Concacaf.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesThose present in Budapest are understood to have been united by deep concern about Trump’s actions, to an extent not previously seen during his presidency. There is a recognition that this is a critical moment for Europe’s security and broader future. The majority of football federations are likely to be guided by their governments’ responses to events around Greenland, although some sources have pondered how a more proactive approach would work. There is a sense that, should one of the continent’s bigger FAs make a stand, others would follow.Discussions are likely to continue, although no definitive steps emerged from the talks, with the situation fast-moving. Uefa’s executive committee will next meet formally in Brussels on 11 February, the day before the governing body’s annual congress.One item unlikely to be on the agenda next month is a dramatic acceptance to Uefa of Greenland, which is not a member of any confederation.The territory’s longstanding ambition to join was thwarted by a statute change in 2013 that forbade the acceptance of non-independent regions, but a fresh alteration has not been considered at this point. Greenland remains isolated in football terms after Concacaf, the confederation for North, Central America and the Caribbean, rejected an application to join last year.The Guardian reported on Sunday thatFifa insiders feel a growing sense of embarrassmentover the “peace prize” presented by Gianni Infantino to Trump in December. Fifa said in response that it stood by the award and noted “the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado]has given her medal to President Trump”.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026UefaFifaDonald TrumpGreenlandWorld CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Once upon a time aSix Nationssquad announcement would have topped the agenda across the country; on Tuesday it felt like a semicolon in a much bigger narrative. Even Wales have never selected seven players whose club is in imminent danger of being axed by their own union.The bare facts of the situation are increasingly stark for all involved. The existing owners ofOspreys, Wales’s most successful region of the past two decades, have just been nominated controversially as the preferred bidders for Cardiff, potentially clearing the way to reduce the number of Welsh professional sides from four to three. The internecine politics have become so increasingly toxic that Steve Tandy, the national head coach, had to plead for rugby‑related questions at his lunchtime squad announcement.The Breakdown | England prepare to reveal Six Nations hand with Borthwick aware of ticking clockRead moreGood luck with that. Barely had Tandy, a distinguished former Ospreys player and coach himself, completed his media duties in a soggy Vale of Glamorgan than a statement was being issued by the Ospreys squad on social media, accusing their owners and the Welsh Rugby Union of leaving them in the dark.“We struggle to believe the most successful Welsh team to exist with the biggest history is on the brink of nonexistence,” read the statement, making clear the players had yet to receive any notification of any kind. “We will continue to play for the fans and for the people who have stood by the Ospreys over the years.”The local Swansea West MP, Torsten Bell, also weighed in on X, accusing the WRU of behaving “disgracefully from start to finish” and suggesting legal action could follow, with Swansea council keen to keep the Ospreys in the city.This is a saga showing few signs of an amicable resolution: support is being canvassed for a potential extraordinary general meeting of the union while the WRU’s leading officials are also due to appear in front of a parliamentary select committee on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenSteve Tandy must focus on lifting his Wales players’ mood amid the domestic crisis.Photograph: Kian Abdullah/Huw Evans/ShutterstockAccording to Bell they will need “to justify their chaotic decision-making” which is fast escalating into a full-blown civil war with thefuture of Welsh rugbyat stake.The Welsh fly‑half legend Jonathan Davies believes it would be “a disaster for Welsh rugby” if an Ospreys‑Cardiff merger goes ahead, wondering how it would enhance the game in the Ospreys’ catchment area, which includes Aberavon, Bridgend and Maesteg, as well as other tribal heartlands such as Neath and Swansea.Trapped in the middle, likeWarren Gatland before him, is the unfortunate Tandy, a decent rugby man who would love to be attacking the Six Nations without any off-field distractions. Instead he is being left to try to fire a cannon from a desperately wobbly canoe, with the seven Ospreys in his squad in limbo regarding their club’s future.They include his squad captain, Dewi Lake, who has already signed for Gloucester, and the fly-half Dan Edwards, who recently turned down an offer from Leicester to re-sign with the Ospreys. The other five are Gareth Thomas, Harri Deaves, Kieran Hardy, Owen Watkin and Reuben Morgan‑Williams, with Tandy promising to do everything in his power to help players worried about their situation: “There is lots of history with every club. Whoever you represent, it’s going to hurt and there will be frustration and anger. One thing we can’t do is run away from it or pretend it’s not happening. If the players have got something to share, if they’re seeking more clarity or anything they want to talk about, then we have to be open.”Tandy’s task would also be easier if Wales were in a more buoyant place on the pitch. They have won just two Six Nations matches in their past four championship seasons and will be battling to avoid a third wooden spoon in a row. Their opening game this year is against England at Twickenham and the bookmakers have them at a distant 100-1 for the title. As Tandy wryly observed: “The bookies don’t often get it too far wrong, do they?”Quick GuideTownsend turns to France-based forward duoShowThe Scotland head coach, Gregor Townsend, has opted for experience and reliability by recalling forwards Jonny Gray and Dave Cherry for the Six Nations.In a 40-man squad of few surprises, the France-based pair were among the most notable inclusions given that they had not featured for the national team since last year's championship.Cherry, 35, was Scotland's first-choice hooker in the 2025 Six Nations but appeared to have drifted out of contention after joining French second-tier side Vannes in the summer and then being omitted for the autumn series. The Bordeaux lock Gray started four of the Scots' five championship matches last year but was not selected for either the summer or autumn campaigns.\"Experience with Dave,\" Townsend said, explaining the return of the forwards. \"He was a bit of a glue player for us around his set-piece and in attack and defence. He missed the summer tour with injury and we decided to look at different options in November. On form, Dave probably should have been in the November squad.\"Jonny hasn't had that many opportunities [at Bordeaux], but he's actually in really good form. He's looking fit and sharp, his work-rate is outstanding. Again, someone who played really well last year's Six Nations. He's someone that has played well for us and we can rely on him if required during this championship.\"Townsend and his experienced team have been the subject of scrutiny after back-to-back fourth-placed finishes in the Six Nations and a poor autumn campaign.\"I don't really think in those terms,\" he said when asked if he felt under extra pressure.\"I think I'm so privileged to be going into another Six Nations.

It was something of a statement too, and not just in the goals scored but the reaction to them. Nine days afterXabi Alonso’s sacking, six after their captain said they had hit rock bottom withCopa del Rey eliminationand three after the protest of a generation, white hankies and whistles greeting the players and even the president, there were songs and support at last as Real Madrid defeated Monaco 6-1.Kylian Mbappé, Franco Mastantuono and Jude Bellingham all scored, while there was an own goal from Monaco’s Thilo Kehrer. More significantly still, the man who had been at the centre of the storm made three of the six goals and smashed in a superb strike of his own. And ifVinícius Júnior, who had stood accused before the game and stood with the MVP trophy at the end of it, wasn’t entirely ready to share his moment with fans yet, his first goal here since October saw teammates come to his side. He then hugged his new coach, Álvaro Arbeloa, who claimed that was the embrace of the whole of Madrid.Solanke leads Tottenham past 10-man Dortmund to offer relief for FrankRead moreCelebrations from his teammates were more demonstrative, speaking to what they had been through. Mbappé had marked the first of his two by asking for forgiveness, while Bellingham stepped round the keeper to add the sixth and celebrated with a drinking gesture following rumours of his supposed off-field habits and his part in Alonso’s fall. He had already called those “a load of shit” and, smiling now, his on-pitch response was even more pointed, and done from a position of power, at the end of an impressive performance.“A lot of people say a lot of things,” he told TNT after the game. “There are two ways you can take it: you can cry about it and moan or send a lawyer or you can just roll with it and enjoy it. I know the truth. I know what really goes on in my personal life, what I give. It’s nice to have a bit of a joke.”There was a smile too as Bellingham looked back on Saturday, when he and his Madrid teammates had been whistled for 90 long minutes. “It was a little bit different, yeah,” he said. “It’s not always very helpful and it’s not the nicest thing in the world. But the fans are entitled to their opinion, and the way we have to react is the way we have the last two games.”For Vinícius in particular, Saturday had been an ordeal and although the pain remained he reacted with a superb display here. The moment he had stormed off the pitch and down the tunnel during theclasicoin October had been seen as the beginning of the end for Alonso andagainst Levante he heard– shockingly loud and clear – what supporters thought. That he carried the blame, becoming an easy scapegoat, had hurt. “We have to support Vini,” Mbappé had said on Monday and now they did when the Brazilian had dribbled through the Monaco defence and hit a sensational shot into the top corner on 63 minutes.That was the fifth of what had been a fun night – there have been too few of those – and the Bernabéu erupted. Vinícius didn’t go towards the supporters; instead he went back to the centre circle head down, where teammates gathered. “The last few days were very complicated; I don’t want to be in the spotlight for what I do off the pitch,” he said afterwards.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham (right) plays to the crowd after scoring Real Madrid’s sixth goal.Photograph: Rubén Albarrán/Shutterstock“It hasn’t been the easiest week.” Mbappé had said. This on the other hand was, a first public apology coming early. They hadn’t been playing five minutes when Mastantuono and Fede Valverde teed up Mbappé to sweep in his tenthChampions Leaguegoal of the season. As he celebrated, he raised his hands in prayer position.Monaco put up little resistance, even if Folarin Balogun shot wide and Ansu Fati skied a shot over the bar from six yards. At the moment when it seemed Madrid were losing control they scored the second, soon reasserting themselves again. It was superbly constructed, too. A pirouette from Eduardo Camavinga found Arda Guler, who turned the ball into the run of Vinícius. With the outside of his boot, he played it across for Mbappé to score and make a point of signalling the passer.Something had shifted, seen too in moments when things went wrong. The shackles fell, as Bellingham put it: Vinícius, he said, needs to feel the love. And although some whistles met Vinícius losing the ball with a turn, they were immediately drowned out by applause and support. Fans had concluded that they too could help the healing and the third and fourth followed early in the second half, Vinícius creating both. First he found Mastantuono to steer in, then Kehrer turned his cross into the net.Vinícius maintained an unusual and conspicuous low profile in the celebrations, but from behind the goal came chants of his name which got even louder when he got the fifth, the Brazilian heading into the comforting embrace of his teammates. And although Madrid did concede through Jordan Teze, a sixth came too, Bellingham raising a smile and a glass.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridMonacoKylian MbappéVinícius Júniormatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Ipswich leapfrogged Middlesbrough by a point, before Boro play on Wednesday.The hosts struck after eight minutes, with Clarke’s low effort into the bottom corner of the goal his ninth score of the season. Jens Cajuste spun in the City half and fed the winger who darted inside and finished across City’s Czech goalkeeper Radek Vitek from inside the penalty area. Ipswich stretched their lead in the 55th minute when Iván Azón picked up a headed clearance from Dara O’Shea and squared the ball to Clarke who fired past Vitek.Jannik Vestergaard’s 90th-minute equaliser deniedWrexhama win that would have put them within a whisker of the playoff places asLeicesterheld them to a 1-1 draw. Lewis O’Brien had fired Wrexham in front in the 63rd minute, no less than they deserved for a dominant second-half display in which Leicester rarely managed to break out of their own half. However, Vestergaard scored at the end with only Leicester’s second shot after the break. The result leaves Wrexham ninth, two points from the top six, while Leicester – without a clean sheet in their past 22Championshipgames – drop to 14th.View image in fullscreenMilutin Osmajic is shown a red card during Preston’s defeat against Hull.Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty ImagesLiam Millar scored against his former side before Oli McBurnie rounded offHull’s thumping 3-0 win againstPrestonin style.

And Osaka added another in MelbourneMorwenna FerrierTue 20 Jan 2026 12.32 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 13.22 ESTShareNaomi Osaka’s renowned 125mph serve is positively slow compared with a jellyfish’s sting, which can cover 10 to 20 micrometresin less than one-millionth of a second. But it wasn’t just the invertebrate’s speed that the tennis player was calling on when she wore a jellyfish-inspired outfit to face Antonia Ruzic of Croatia in their first-round match at the Australian Open.Entering Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena, the 28-year-old tennis player’s look consisted of a pleated miniskirt over wide-legged trousers, a wide-brimmed hat with a white veil and a parasol. Jellyfish-esque elements were also incorporated into her on-court outfit, which featured a watery turquoise and green palette and soft frills on the warm-up jacket and dress, alluding to tentacles.View image in fullscreenNaomi Osaka enters the court.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPAAs Osakatold Voguebefore the match, which she went on to win 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, the inspiration came when she was reading a storybook to her two-year-old daughter, Shai: “Reading to my daughter, discovering beauty in unexpected places like the underwater world, working with artists who care about meaning – those moments have all shaped the way I see this expression now.”‘Really weird and really beautiful’: why the jellyfish is 2024’s unexpected style iconRead moreIt is the outcome of a collaboration between Nike, Osaka, her longtime creative collaborator Marty Harper and the London-based couturier Robert Wun, who has previously dressed stars such as Beyoncé, Cardi B and Ariana Grande.Wun, who is reportedly a big tennis fan, had been inspired by Osaka for one of his previous collections. “One of the looks from myfall 2024 collectionwas inspired by her moment at court, whena butterfly landed on her face mid-match,” he told Vogue, referencing the moment during the 2021 Australian Open, a tournament she went on to win, when a butterfly landed on her face during her third-round match against TunisianOns Jabeur. Wun described it as “a simple, beautiful scene that went viral as she gently placed it aside. I wanted to revisit that story and weave it into this design and collaboration.” The design features butterflies on top of the hat and parasol.Over the years, tennis has had its share of noteworthy fashion moments. From Serena Williams in a Virgil Abloh x Nike tutu dress at the 2018 US Open to Suzanne Lenglen and her hemlines toAnne White, who wore a white catsuitto play at Wimbledon in 1985, andwas told not to wear it again. In recent years, heralded by Jannik Sinner wearing a duffel bagcovered in Gucci’s GG monogramfor his changing room to court walk at Wimbledon, the idea of tennis having its own version of a catwalk has been cemented. The NBA has its“tunnel fashion”, with players dressing to the designer nines to walk into the arena before a game, the Premier League has its bus-to-dressing-rooms runway, and all tennis tournaments have the changing-room-to-courtside saunter.View image in fullscreenSerena Williams in action at the 2018 US Open.Photograph: Juergen Hasenkopf/BPI/ShutterstockOsaka is aware of tennis’s sartorial chops.Speaking to Vogue, she said: “When I look back at the players who came before me, I think about how those moments – those looks – have become memories that live forever. So much of the time, other people get to write our stories for us.” Of her jellyfish-inspired ensemble, she added: “This felt like a moment where I could write a little bit of my own.”But this feels like it broke new ground. As Vogue noted: “Haute couture has never been worn in this way in a live sports setting.”Despite having toyed with style in the past – perhaps most playfully via bedazzledLabubudoll keychains worn to her matches – this feels like Osaka’s most dramatic style moment yet. Speaking to Vogue of a newfound confidence with clothes,Osaka said: “Fashion, for me, really opened up when I stopped thinking about how it would be received and started thinking about how it made me feel. The biggest shift really has been realising that style doesn’t have to be loud to be powerful. It can be quiet, emotional, layered. That realisation changed everything for me.”View image in fullscreenNaomi Osaka in acton against Antonia Ruzic.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPABut, Osaka to one side, the jellyfish is also a (supporting) star of the show, and it’s not the first time the otherworldly ocean creatures have had a moment of heightened popularity on land.In 2024, jellyfish inspired everything from haircuts to lamps to makeup and couture dresses.Their silhouettes are a gift to spectacle. As scientist-turned-science writer Juli Berwald, author ofSpineless: the Science of Jellyfish and the Art of Growing a Backbone, told the Guardian in 2024, around the time of the “jellyfish trend”: “Anyone with a sense of aesthetic would have to pause and say: ‘Wow, what is that?’” Plus, their grace of movement feels like something a tennis player might want to replicate – not to mention that signalling you have a sting – which can’t be bad from a sports psychology point of view, either.Explore more on these topicsNaomi OsakaAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

This deal secures the operations of the joint US-UK base for generations. It has robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out. It has been publicly welcomed by the US.“As the world grows more dangerous, so too does the importance of the base for our national security. It’s one of the most significant contributions to the UK and US intelligence and security relationship, and almost every operation from the base is in partnership with the US.”Trump, who is travelling to Davos in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, made the claim as he ramped up his rhetoric on Greenland, firing off a flurry of posts on his Truth Social platform about taking over the Arctic territory, which is part of Denmark.He wrote: “Shockingly, our ‘brilliant’ Nato Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital US Military Base, toMauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.“There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness. These are International Powers who only recognise STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before.“The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.”Trump’s comments will add fuel to Conservative and Reform criticism of the move. Both parties have cited US concerns as a reason to drop the deal with Mauritius, but they have been met with surprise by Labour as they had previously criticised Trump’s threats over Greenland.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said: “Paying to surrender the Chagos islands is not just an act of stupidity but of complete self sabotage. I’ve been clear, and unfortunately on this issue President Trump is right. Keir Starmer’s plan to give away theChagos Islandsis a terrible policy that weakens UK security and hands away our sovereign territory. And, to top it off, makes us and our Nato allies weaker in face of our enemies.”The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, said: “Thank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos Islands.”However, the chief secretary to the prime minister, Darren Jones, suggested Trump’s intervention would not have an effect on the UK’s deal with Mauritius and that it was no longer possible to “reverse the clock” on the decision.“We’ve done a deal with the Mauritian government, we’ve legislated for the process, we’ve agreed the terms of the treaty, which has been signed,” he told Sky News. “This is the way in which to secure that military base for the next 100 years.”The welfare secretary, Pat McFadden, who is close to Starmer, told broadcasters: “I think what we saw last night was a series of posts criticising a number of world leaders. That may tell us that the president is frustrated right now.What are the Chagos Islands – and why is the UK returning them to Mauritius?Read more“I don’t really believe this is about Chagos, I think it’s about Greenland, and the best way to resolve that is through dialogue with the Danish government, and that’s what we’ve said all along.”The UK has signed a £3.4bn agreement to cede sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius but it is facing significant opposition in the House of Lords.Under the plan, Britain will cede control over the islands to Mauritius but lease the largest, Diego Garcia, for 99 years to continue operating a joint US-UK military base there.Downing Street has said in the past that the deal is a “legal necessity” and is backed by the “five eyes” intelligence-sharing partnership with the UK. A UN courtgave an advisory opinionin 2021 that the UK did not have rightful sovereignty over the archipelago.At the time of the agreement in May 2025, Rubio welcomed it as “historic”. “This is a critical asset for regional and global security,” he said. “President Trump expressed his support for this monumental achievement during his meeting with prime minister Starmer at the White House. This milestone reflects the enduring strength of the US-UK relationship.”Critics of the handover have said the deal gives China an opening in the region because of its close relations with Mauritius. Trump has regularly cited fears of Chinese influence as a reason he intends the US to take over Greenland.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsForeign policyDefence policyMauritiusTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They also stressed the importance of annual eye checks for people in middle age, and called for awareness campaigns to be rolled out to address late diagnosis.Glaucoma damages the optic nerve, which connects the eye and brain, and is most common in people over 50. It does not usually exhibit symptoms and develops slowly over many years.Researchers from University College London and Moorfields eye hospital said it was previously thought about 700,000 people in the UK were living with glaucoma.However, using the most recent census data, the team estimated that more than 1 million people in the UK currently have the condition, the equivalent of 3% of the population over the age of 40. This is estimated to rise to 4% among people of African descent, and 11% in people over 85.The study’s lead author, Prof Paul Foster, a UCL Institute of Ophthalmology researcher and consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Moorfields, said: “Glaucoma is a common cause of blindness, but it isn’t symptomatic until its later stages, so regular tests are important for early diagnosis.“Previous studies have estimated that half of glaucoma cases are undiagnosed, and this is even higher among some ethnic minority groups who are more likely to experience delays in diagnosis.“Late diagnosis comes with a higher risk of sight loss and higher costs of care; over 40% of glaucoma patients in the UK experience vision loss that could have been prevented with earlier diagnosis and treatment such as eye drops or surgery.”The research suggestsglaucoma cases in the UK will rise to 1.6m by 2060, based on population predictions from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This finding underscores the need to expand ophthalmology services to meet the expected rise in demand, as well as ensuring people have access to specialist eye care, researchers said.“Our findings show that there will be a large increase in glaucoma cases in the UK, so there’s a growing need to expand eye health services to meet this demand, including specialist care and diagnostic capacity,” Foster said.“Awareness campaigns encouraging people to get their eyes checked are also needed as part of targeted early detection strategies, particularly to address late diagnosis in underserved, hard to reach populations.“For people in midlife onwards, it’s important to get your eyes checked annually by your optician, to detect changes that haven’t yet caused any symptoms.”Joanne Creighton, the chief executive of Glaucoma UK, which commissioned the research, said many of the 1 million adults estimated to have glaucoma would not know they had the condition, and potentially lose sight that they would never be able to recover.“This landmark study also predicts a 60% increase in glaucoma cases by 2060, rising from just over 1m to 1.61m. This is a demographic timebomb, and we need serious planning and action now to prepare to diagnose, treat, and support these future patients.“These findings highlight why routine eye tests are more important than ever before.”Explore more on these topicsBlindness and visual impairmentHealthMedical researchAgeingNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

Nor had the owners of the cables raised any concerns either, he added.In a joint letter, made public as part of the process, two spy chiefs, Ken McCallum, the head ofMI5, and Anne Keast-Butler, the head of GCHQ, conceded: “It is not realistic to expect to be able wholly to eliminate each and every potential risk.”But they went on to add that the intelligence agencies had been able “to formulate a package of national security mitigations”, by working with officials across government, that was “expert, professional and proportionate”.That conclusion was endorsed by the cross-party intelligence and security committee, but its chair, Lord Beamish, complained that the process by which spy agencies informed the decision “was not effectively coordinated”.The Labour peer said “key reports lacked the detail necessary, were dealt with piecemeal, and appeared not to have been kept up to date”.Mitigations include allowing the intelligence agencies to monitor the perimeter of the site to prevent tampering with underground cables. Access will also be retained for the emergency services in the publicly accessible forecourt.Critics of the site say its size – the embassy site would be the largest in Europe, hosting more than 200 staff – means it would become a hub for Chinese espionage and intimidation of dissidents, including from Hong Kong–and a target for large, hard-to-police protests.View image in fullscreenPeople gather outside the Royal Mint Court site on Saturday to protest against the planned embassy.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockChina has been accused of trying torecruit informants in parliament,harass Hong Kong pro-democracy activistsin the UK, suppress criticismby an academic at a British universityandengage in cyber hacking, although none of the activities are known to have been directed from its existing embassy.Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, accused Starmer of a “shameful super-embassy surrender”. The Conservative MP said the prime minister was giving China’s president,Xi Jinping, “what he wants – a colossal spy hub in the heart of our capital”.Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative party leader who is a co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: “This is a terrible decision that ignores the appalling brutality of the Chinese Communist party as it practises forced labour at home and spies on the UK and uses cyber-attacks to damage our internal security.”Downing Street countered that opponents of the new Chinese embassy were “either naive or recklessly isolationist”. Embassies were “a normal part of international diplomatic relations,” Starmer’s official spokesperson said.Reed said China had agreed to consolidate seven existing diplomatic sites into one once the new embassy was built – which MI5 has indicated would make monitoring of the site easier.Any spying on the UK, harassment of dissidents or surveillance conducted by China from the embassy site could be dealt with by “other legal processes and by various agencies” and could not be controlled “through the planning system”, Reed concluded.Dan Jarvis, the security minister, told MPs the government had seen unredacted plans for the embassy, directly contradicting a report in the Daily Telegraph earlier this month that claimed rooms were concealed in the plans Beijing had submitted.Downing St said it was “content that any risks are being appropriately managed” and that ministers were confident they knew what all the embassy’s rooms would be used for.People living next to the site said theyhoped to seek a judicial reviewif they could raise £145,000 to fund legal representation. Mark Nygate, the treasurer of Royal Mint Court residents’ association, said: “The residents are determined to keep fighting today’s decision.”Officials acknowledge the timing is helpful given Starmer’s expected trip to China next week. Beijing has made the embassy a priority in the UK-China relationship. Xi raised the matter directly with the prime minister in their first phone call in August 2024.Government insiders also hope it will give them some leverage over a reciprocal decision for the UK’s embassy in Beijing. The UK’s plans to redevelop its own outpost in China’s capital have been blocked because of the London embassy row.Explore more on these topicsLondonChinaEspionageMI5MI6Planning policyKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

These will intensify, resulting in “geopolitical instability, economic insecurity, conflict, migration and increased inter-state competition for resources”.The hard-hitting report, which originally would have beenpublished last autumnbut for an intervention by Downing Street, is attributed only to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but the Guardian understands that the joint intelligence committee, which oversees spy agencies MI5 and MI6, was responsible.National security experts havestepped up their warningsthat the climate crisis will bring existential dangers for which we are still unprepared. Tuesday’s report focuses on an even less considered threat, that of the collapse of biological systems, such as rainforests turning to savannah-like conditions under the impact of deforestation, climate breakdown and other stresses.Lt Gen Richard Nugee, a former senior military commander, said: “This assessment, a welcome and important acknowledgment of the very critical nature of the diversity of threats facing the UK, treats ecosystem collapse with the seriousness it deserves, as a threat to our national security. When risks are systemic, unavoidable and already unfolding, there is a duty to build national resilience and preparedness, which depend on understanding and honesty.”The report is unusual in applying military intelligence techniques to examine the biodiversity crisis unfolding across the world. “Critical ecosystems that support major food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security,” the report says.“Severe degradation or collapse of these would highly likely result in water insecurity, severely reduced crop yields, a global reduction in arable land, fisheries collapse, changes to global weather patterns, release of trapped carbon exacerbating climate change, novel zoonotic disease and loss of pharmaceutical resources.”The authors identify key hotspots that are under increasing threat as “particularly significant” for the UK, including the Amazon and Congo rainforests,boreal forests, the Himalayas and south-east Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves.Some of these, includingcoral reefsand boreal forests, are likely to start to collapse from 2030, while the others could take up to 2050, the report found. Some scientists have warned that the Amazon isalready showing signsof shifting faster than expected.Ruth Chambers, a senior fellow at Green Alliance, a thinktank that pressed the government to release the report, said: “This should be essential reading for government. It should focus minds on meeting targets to reverse the decline of UK nature, where progress is lagging in most areas. But it should also make us think again about backing away from international efforts to preserve biodiversity, like our failure to contribute to a fund for the world’s rainforests at the last global climate summit.”Ministers are debating how much the UK should spend assisting poor countries to cope with the climate crisis and stem the decline of nature, when the current pledge of £11.6bn to be spent from 2021 to 2026 runs out. Insiders have suggested to the Guardian that the amount is likely to be cut substantially and that the ringfencing of some spending for nature projects could end.Zac Goldsmith, who was a climate and nature minister under Boris Johnson, warned against such moves. “The assessment shows that we cannot expect to be able to destroy key ecosystems like the great forest basins, peatlands, mangroves or coral reefs without serious implications for our safety and prosperity. But that is what we are doing,” he said. “The government has shifted its priority away from nature towards a very narrow focus on carbon and we must hope this report forces a reversal.”The report also says the UK must focus on its own food systems, which are highly reliant on imports, because without strong action “it is unlikely the UK would be able to maintain food security if ecosystem collapse drives geopolitical competition for food”.David Exwood, a deputy president of the National Farmers’ Union, said the government must provide financial support to help farmers invest in environmental improvements and food production. “With an increasingly volatile geopolitical and climactic situation, we cannot rely on imports to sustain us. Investing in our national food security has to be a priority, and that starts with investing in the land,” he said.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on. The findings of this report will inform the action we take to prepare for the future.”Explore more on these topicsBiodiversityClimate crisisFood securityMI5MI6newsShareReuse this content"

The tide is slowly rising over the expanse of sandy beach, but the man does not seem to notice. His eyes are not fixed on the sea, but on the small screen clutched between his hands.About 600 metres offshore, past the shadowy fringe of coral reef, his drone hovers over the murky sea, focused on a whirling grey shape: Miracle, the local dugong, is back.Theerasak Saksritawee, known by his nickname Pop, has been visiting Tang Khen Bay nearly every day for the past 15 months to monitor the dugongs, including Miracle, who have come to live in this pocket of the Andaman Sea.After dropping his daughter off at school, Pop, 42, makes the short drive from his home in Phuket city down to a roti bread shack crouched on the bay’s shore. Sometimes he will travel farther – to the beaches of Koh Phra Thong or down to Trang province.Here, he stakes out the bay for up to eight hours, guiding his drone over the water in search of dugongs.15:04The influencer racing to save Thailand’s most endangered sea mammal“I see Miracle almost every day, although there have been times when I didn’t spot him for as long as a month,” says Pop,a hobbyist photographerwho began filming the dugongs after seeing them on social media.“I feel a deep connection to these incredible creatures,” he says. “Dugongs are a vital part of my home.”I felt heartbroken because she was one of my favourite dugongs. The lady who makes the roti here cried‘Pop’ SaksritaweeAt one point, there were as many as 13 dugongs living in Tang Khen Bay, nibbling the stubbly seagrass that sprouts along the ocean floor.But today, Miracle is the only one left. The aggressive dugong chased the others away, Pop says, nipping at their paddle-shaped flippers to keep the precious seagrass to himself.It is not known where the others have gone. The only companion that Miracle seemed to tolerate – a small female dugong named Jingjok – died last year.“I felt disappointed and heartbroken because she was one of my favourite dugongs,” Pop recalls. “The lady who makes the roti here cried.”View image in fullscreenTang Khen Bay, where the last remaining patches of seagrass can be seen close to the shoreView image in fullscreenTheerasak ‘Pop’ Saksritawee, an amateur conservationist, uses a drone to monitor the dugongs in the bayAcross the shallow coastal and island waters of the Indo-Pacific Ocean, dugongs (Dugong dugon) – medium-sized marine mammals similar to their sea cow relatives, manatees – are in trouble.AnAugust 2025 assessmentby the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals found that the dugong,already considered vulnerableto extinction, is also critically endangered in many parts of the world, threatened byhabitat loss, climate breakdown, noise, boat strikes, and water and plastic pollution. The latter gained significant media attention in 2019 after a beloved baby dugong named Marium wasfound dead in Thailand with plastic in her stomach.The dugongs living along Thailand’s Andaman Coast are now thought to be critical to the survival of the species. The region is one of only six locations in the world, outside Australia, with a population of more than 100 dugongs. In 2022, at least 273 dugongs lived in Thai waters, according to government estimates.But a couple of years ago, dead or emaciated dugongs began washing up en masse along Thailand’s shores. From 2019 to 2022, an average of 20 dugong strandings a year were reported along the Andaman Coast. Then, from 2023 to 2024, that number more than doubled, to 42 a year. Jingjok’s death became just another statistic.“We have probably easily lost half the population,” says Petch Manopawitr, an ecologist and adviser on dugongs to Thailand’s marine and coastal resources department.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: biologists examine a dead dugong at the Phuket Marine Biological Center. A major cause of dugong deaths is starvation. Below right: Pop takes a sample of contaminated seawater at Tang Khen Bay. It was found to be diesel spilled from a local boat. Left: the tail fluke of a dead dugong is measuredMuch of the devastation occurred in nearby Trang province, south-east of Phuket. Once a stronghold for the dugongs thanks to its abundant seagrass meadows, locals say the animals are no longer seen in Trang.Many have instead migrated about 60 miles (100km) to the waters off Phuket, a global tourism hotspot with expansive resorts that usher in millions of visitors every year. This, scientists say, poses additional challenges as the area is not used to the presence of dugongs and boat traffic needs to be intensively managed to protect the animals.Everywhere we went, local people would tell us about a different cause. But whatever was happening had moved along the coastProf Helene MarshIn January 2025, an international team of 13 scientists assembled for a fact-finding mission along the Andaman Coast to determine what was killing the country’s dugongs.Helene Marsh, a global dugong authority and emeritus professor at Australia’s James Cook University, travelled along the coast for five days, inspecting the state of seagrass meadows and interviewing government scientists, conservation organisations and local people about what they were witnessing.Marsh and her colleagues concluded that the dugongs were responding to a massive seagrass die-off. “Dugongs are seagrass community specialists,” she says. “An adult animal eats maybe 40 to 60kg a day.”The most serious seagrass losses were in coastal waters near Trang, the group found, while seagrass in Krabi, Phuket and Phang Nga provinces remained in decent shape. Trang’s seagrass dieback therefore culminated in more dead dugongs washing ashore, starving animals becoming stranded, fewer young being born, and animals migrating to find greener pastures.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: scientists from Kyoto University prepare to monitor dugongs acoustically to see if playing sounds underwater can prevent dugongs being hit by boats; above right: government marine biologists test seawater contaminated with diesel; left, a fisheries biologist, Attawut Kantavong, checks climate-resilient seagrass at a lab in Sri RachaBut what is killing the seagrass is still unclear. The mission concludedin their reportthat the root causes were unknown, but said the die-off may have been caused by an accumulation of factors: less light reaching the seagrass due to silt in the water, more pollution and dissolved nutrients in the water, the effect of dredging, warmer seas and shifting tidal cycles leaving seagrass more exposed to the sun.If you have a system that is already a little bit sick, this kind of thing can knock things off quite easilyPetch Manopawitr“The Thai situation is quite puzzling in that it doesn’t seem to have been associated with an extreme weather event, and it could be a chronic condition,” says Marsh. “Everywhere we went, the local people would tell us about a different local cause. But it was pretty clear that, whatever was happening had moved along the coast.”Some experts say it may simply be that higher water temperatures from human-caused climate change are pushing an already compromised ecosystem to a breaking point. “If you have a good, intact and healthy ecosystem, it can probably cope with such an extreme situation,” Manopawitr says. “But if you have a system that is already a little bit sick, this kind of thing can knock things off quite easily.”At Tang Khen Bay, Pop stares across the bay at a new hotel going up. There have been heavy rains in recent weeks, spurring deadly floods in southern Thailand.View image in fullscreenTheerasak Saksritawee attaches a 360-degree ‘fisheye lens’ camera to a drone to monitor dugongs in the bay“The rain washes down materials from the construction site into the bay,” he says. Such wastewater and sediments deprive seagrass of essential nutrients, while algae blooms proliferate over the seagrass, blocking out sunlight. During one period of heavy rain, Pop recalls, Miracle left the bay for a week.Manee Sanae, who runs the roti stall, says she used to see many dugongs popping up for air near the buoys. “There was also much more seagrass before, even near the boats that you see parked in front of my shop. But not any more.”View image in fullscreenMarium, an orphaned baby rescued off a beach in Krabi in 2019.

Photograph: Sirachai Arunrugstichai/AFP-GettyWhile there have been some efforts by the government to plant new seagrass and provide additional food for the hungry dugongs, such interventions cannot reach the scale required to sustain dugongs in the long-run, Manopawitr says.“This critical ecosystem is much more fragile than we have believed before,” he says. “We never really imagined we were going to lose such a vast area of seagrass – the last stronghold of seagrass in Thailand – in a very short period of time.”‘We rarely see them now’: just how vulnerable are Vanuatu’s dugongs?Read moreMoving forward, he advocates for locally managed marine areas and adaptive measures in protected areas that can help to create an ocean corridor as the dugongs migrate in search of food. One glimmer of hope, he adds, is that the dugongs that moved into Krabi have begun to have calves.Meanwhile, locals such as Pop and Sanae do what they can to help the species, with an online group now dedicated to protecting the bay’s dugongs.If Sanae sees fishing boats enter Tang Khen when Miracle is present, she says she immediately informs the group chat so they can help to keep the fishermen away.The people who visit her stall do not know much about dugongs, she adds. “But sometimes I tell them about Miracle.”Theerasak Saksritawee and Thailand’s critically endangered dugongs form the subject of a 15-minuteGuardian documentary: PayuunThis story was supported by the Pulitzer CenterExplore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansConservationMammalsCoastlinesOceansThailandPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In effect this price signal screens citizens from the environmental and social costs of their consumption.The new study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research calculated some of those hidden costs and examined how two possible policy reforms – full VAT levies or a carbon price on food – could affect prices, consumption levels, environmental impacts and costs.Published in the journal NatureFoodon Tuesday, the paper found that the global environmental footprint of meat was substantially higher than plant-based foods in terms of climate impact, biodiversity loss, land use and pollution. The only exception was water use.The difference in these environmental costs is not adequately reflected in the price of goods on the shelves because such calculations are complex. To overcome this obstacle, the authors of the study said the simplest first step would be to remove tax breaks on the most damaging food – meat.Those tax breaks vary from country to country. The biggest break for meat consumption is in Ireland, where meat has zero tax compared with a general VAT rate of 23%. Raw meat in the UK is zero-rated compared with the 20% standard for cooked meat in restaurants or processed products. The gap is 20 percentage points in Croatia. In France, it is 15 points, Germany and Italy 12 points, and Spain 11 points. Within the EU, only Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania tax meat at the general VAT rate.If EU governments ended meat’s VAT privileges, the paper calculates the environmental damage caused by food consumption would be reduced by 3.48% to 5.7%, depending on the type of impact. In the case of the climate, for example, it would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 29.9 megatons of CO2equivalent per year, which is about 5% of the total.The burden on consumers would depend on what is done with the extra tax revenues. Average annual food expenditure per EU household would have to rise by €109 (£95) as a result of the additional VAT. But if the revenues were redistributed through payments to citizens, the overall cost would fall to €26 per year.An even cheaper system for consumers would be the levying of a carbon price of €52 (£45) on food products, which would bring down net household costs to about €12 a year and have greater environmental benefits. But the authors recognise this will require more complex economic and political calculations, which makes the VAT change a more feasible option in the short term.In both cases, society would be significantly better off once the costs of reducing environmental destruction are factored in, the researchers said. “Our numbers show the policies we investigated can be effective, but they also reveal that we do not yet fully price in the environmental impacts of meat,” said Charlotte Plinke, an author of the study: “It’s important to have exact information of what the impacts actually are, and then to be transparent about the goals of the policy and the use of revenues.”Explore more on these topicsMeat industryFoodTax and spendingEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We need to reduce the impact of our food systems urgently and the US is an important piece of the puzzle in doing that.”While many Americans will simply ignore the guidelines, the new framework will probably influence institutions such as schools and federal workplaces. The average Americanalready eatsabout 144kg (317lb) of meat and seafood a year, second globally only to Portugal, and ingests more protein than previous federal government guidelines recommended.Any further increase will be felt in places such as theAmazon rainforest, which is already beingfelledat a rapid rate for cattle ranches and to grow livestock feed.Red meat, in particular, has anoutsized impactupon the planet – beefrequires20 times more land and emits 20 times more greenhouse gas emissions per gram of protein than common plant proteins, such as beans. The raising of cows, pigs, lamb and other animals for slaughter is also associated withsignificantlocalizedair and water pollution.“To the extent that people follow these guidelines and eat more animal protein foods, particularly beef and dairy, they will negatively impact our environment, since the production of these foods emits way more greenhouse gases than vegetable protein foods, or even other animal foods,” said Diego Rose, a director of nutrition at Tulane University.Choosing beef over beans and lentils is “a big choice we make that has real consequences”, said Waite. “If people want more protein there are ways to do that via eating plant-based foods without the environmental impacts. We can have our protein and our forests, too.”Animal agriculture is responsible for about a fifth of global emissions, with little progress made in recent years to reduce its impact as more of the world starts to demand meat products. Worldwide consumption of pork, beef, poultry and meat is projected to reach over 500m tonnes by 2050 –doublewhat it was in 2000.In the US, much of this meat-eating is concentrated in a relatively small group of avid carnivores – just 12% of Americans consume nearly half of the country’s beef, a 2024 studyfound. But plant-based options, including “fake meat” burgers, have suffered aslump in salesin recent years amid a resurgenttrend in meat-eating, fueled by online “meatfluencers” and a broader desire to consume more protein.The environmental problems associated with the meat industry were previously highlighted by Kennedy himself, when he was a campaigner on green issues. At one point, Kennedyeven saidthe pork industry was an even bigger threat to the US than Osama bin Laden, the terrorist mastermind.“The factory meat industry has polluted thousands of miles of America’s rivers, killed billions of fish, pushed tens of thousands of family farmers off their land, sickened and killed thousands of US citizens, and treated millions of farm animals with unspeakable and unnecessary cruelty,” Kennedywrotein 2004.US mixed messaging on flu shots alarms experts: ‘Children should not be dying’Read moreHowever, since becoming Trump’s health secretary, Kennedy has sought toelevatemeat-eating, dismissing an independent scientific committee’sadviceto emphasizeplant-based proteinsto instead favor meat.“TheTrump administrationwill no longer weaponize federal food policy to destroy the livelihoods of hard-working American ranchers and protein producers under the radical dogma of the Green New Scam,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in response to questions about the knock-on environmental impacts of the new guidelines.“Americans already eat a lot of meat, so this promotion of more meat and things like beef tallow is puzzling to me,” said Benjamin Goldstein, a researcher at the University of Michigan who has studied the huge emissions associated with meat-eating by city-dwellers in the US.“We needed to be addressing climate change two decades ago and we are still not doing enough now. If we are adding more greenhouse gases to impose unnecessary ideas of protein intake, that’s going to destabilize the climate further. It’s going to have a big impact.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOur unequal earthGreenhouse gas emissionsTrump administrationRobert F Kennedy JrUS healthcareHealthFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

They argue their areas are deprived because of low incomes, rather than high housing costs, which are more of a problem in London.Jim McMahon, the MP for Oldham West and a former local government minister, told the Local Government Chronicleearlier this week: “Everybody accepts that the government has done a significant amount to stabilise local government and reflect that deprivation is a driver of cost and need.“Where MPs see there is a gap is when they go back to their local authorities who are taking budgets to council that will see more cuts, as rocketing demand for children services, adult social care and temporary accommodation are still eating into budgets.”McMahon called for an additional £400m each year to be put into the “recovery grant” for councils with the highest level of need.Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley council, said: “The inclusion of housing costs in the deprivation index has moved money that should have been going to the north back to the south.”According to calculations by the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities, which represents 49 urban authorities, dozens of councils face real-terms cuts in their funding from central government over the next three years.A separate calculation by the Local Government Association shows about 15 top-tier councils and 115 district councils in England – many in London and the south-east – will receive real-term reductions in total funding over that period.The analysis suggests increasing numbers of councils will try to avoid effective bankruptcy by applying for hundreds of millions of pounds of special “bailout” loans to prop up day-to-day services, local authority leaders have warned.Last year a record30 councils in financial distress relied on so-called exceptional financial support(EFS) amounting to £1.5bn. More are expected to apply this year amid rising demand and soaring costs in areas such as social care and homelessness.EFS is granted to councils to enable them to meet their legal requirements to balance the books, through loans, asset sell-offs or cap-busting council tax rises. Recent recipients include insolvent councils such as Birmingham, Thurrock and Croydon.Louise Gittins, the chair of the LGA, said: “Government should urgently provide additional new funding to protect councils from real-terms cuts and work with councils on deeper, long-term reform so local services remain financially sustainable and communities get the support they need.”An spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Local Government and Communities said: “We’ve made almost £78bn available to England’s councils this year and radically overhauled the broken funding system we inherited, so the most deprived communities benefit.“By the end of the multiyear period, we will have provided a 15.1% cash-terms increase for local authorities in England to help them deliver high-quality public services.”Explore more on these topicsNorth of EnglandLocal governmentLabourLiverpoolPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

The two alleged offences took place in 2009.Brandpreviously deniedtwo counts of rape, one count of indecent assault, and two counts of sexual assault in relation to alleged offences between 1999 and 2005, involving four women.During a brief hearing in relation to the fresh charges on Tuesday afternoon, Brand appeared at Westminster magistrates court via video link from Florida.Wearing a partly unbuttoned blue denim shirt, Brand spoke only to confirm to his name and date of birth.The chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, said: “Mr Brand, one of the charges you face is what we call indictable only which means it can only be tried at crown court.”Brand was granted bail to appear at Southwark crown court in London on 17 February for a pre-trial preparation hearing. A trial is scheduled to begin later this year in relation to the five original charges.Brand was charged after an investigation by Channel 4 and the Sunday Times in which several women made allegations against him. The night before publication, Brand denied the claims in a video posted online, stating that all of his relationships had been consensual, and accused the media of a “coordinated attack”.The comedian presented a BBC Radio 2 show between 2006 and 2008 and the Big Brother spin-off shows Big Brother’s Big Mouth and Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack in the 00s.He was married to the US pop singer Katy Perry from 2010 to 2012. He is now married to Laura Gallacher, the sister of TV presenter Kirsty, and the pair have two children, Mabel and Peggy.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now a new chapter is to be written in the history of a building considered the most at-risk structure inNewcastle, with the announcement of £4.6m lottery money to convert it into affordable housing.It is an ambitious project being watched closely by others across the UK, grappling with the problem of what to do with important but derelict and difficult listed buildings.The project is being managed by theTyne & Wear Building Preservation Trustin partnership with Newcastle city council, which is matching the money coming from theNational Lottery Heritage Fund(NLHF).Keelmen’s hospital is Grade II* listed, just one step down from the Grade I listing held by buildings such as York Minster and Buckingham Palace.The building, overlooking the Tyne and the Quayside, dates back to 1701, built for retired, sick and often destitute keelmen and their families. Until nearly 20 years ago, people had always lived there, whether it was the keelmen, people living in tenement housing or, until 2009, students.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Martin Hulse, Katie Liddane, councillor Alex Hay and Helen Featherstone outside the Keelmen’s hospital, which will be turned into 20 housing units.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianKeelmen worked on flat-bottomed boats called keels, carrying coal from the banks of the river Tyne to ships too big to sail up the river. This was punishing, under-appreciated work, as depicted by JMW Turner in his great paintingKeelmen Heaving in Coals by Moonlight, currently on loan from the National Gallery of Art in Washington to Tate Britain for itsTurner and Constable exhibition.Martin Hulse, the trust’s chief executive, said they did an audit of heritage buildings in Newcastle about five years ago and Keelmen’s hospital jumped out as being in most need of saving.“We are here to rescue heritage at risk, that’s how we get our joy,” he said. “This is a really well-known building but it has been forgotten. You talk to people and they remember it but don’t really know it has been empty for nearly 20 years.”The plan is to begin work in March and have the first people living in the planned 20 units by Christmas 2027. The feeling is that if it can be done in Newcastle, then why why not elsewhere? Similarly minded authorities and organisations around the UK were watching the progress of the project closely, said Hulse.View image in fullscreenThe project is being watched closely by others grappling with the problem of what to do with important but derelict and difficult listed buildings.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianThe building was paid for by the keelmen themselves, initially giving one penny a tide from the wages of a crew.The keelmen used the building for about 200 years, with 19th-century residents warned that they were not allowed to have chickens or dogs roaming free. There were a number of rules in place with a one-shilling fine for “being disguised with drink at a funeral”; and a sixpenny fine for any “great rudeness of their wives” or “speaking disrespectfully of his Majesty, or any of the royal family”.View image in fullscreenSome students were convinced the building was haunted, describing an ‘ice presence’ – but that may have been the poor heating.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianThe lease expired in 1899 and the building became tenement housing, with families packed into tiny flats. There was gas but no electricity – even in the 1960s, when a German charity, hearing of the desperate English conditions, offered to pay for a TV room. A lounge was created but there was nowhere to plug in a television.In 1989 the building was successfully converted into accommodation for students at what was then Newcastle polytechnic, now Northumbria University.Katie Liddane, who works for the trust, has talked to students who lived there, with many of them remembering the alternating smells of soap and animal bone char from nearby factories.It was definitely cold, students recall, but they also had fun – including a rave in the courtyard – and many made friendships for life, Liddane said.Some were convinced the place was haunted, she said. “Students have described certain areas of the building being colder than others and feeling an icy presence walking through you and stuff. But I think you get a lot of that with old buildings, generally. What’s a spectral presence and what is poor heating?”Students also got a rent reduction if they decorated rooms themselves – the reason one room still has walls painted banana yellow, lime green and postbox red.View image in fullscreenThe building was paid for by the keelmen themselves, initially giving one penny a tide from the wages of a crew.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianHulse said people often asked why they were not converting the building, from which you can see the Tyne Bridge and theshimmering Glasshouse music centre over the river, for commercial or cultural use. “It just always felt to me that it should be residential,” he said. “When you come here, you can just feel it.”He was echoed by Helen Featherstone, the director for England, north at the heritage fund, who called it a “hugely significant” project.“There’s something really important about renovating derelict historic buildings for social housing, it is so much more environmentally friendly than building new properties,” she said. “It’s really important that we can do this and bring disused buildings back to life.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastleHousingTyne and WearHeritageNorth of EnglandArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

However, it said the evidence did not meet the test required to bring fresh charges.The CPS is understood to stand by the charges that resulted in Letby’s convictions.Cheshire constabulary, which has been investigating Letby since 2017, expressed surprise and disappointment at the decision.The force insisted the announcement did not “affect or undermine” her existing convictions and that its investigation into hospital bosses continued.It added: “There will be some who will feel that this is news worth celebrating. We do not share this view and would ask that people respect the privacy and feelings of the families involved.”Letby’s convictions, which followed two trials at Manchester crown court, are some of the most contentious in recent British legal history.The former neonatal nurse, from Hereford, has always insisted she is innocent and that babies died or became seriously unwell as a result of poor care and under-qualified staff at the Countess of Chester hospital.She has twice unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the convictions at the court of appeal in London.Her legal team referred the case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, in February last year.The CPS said on Tuesday it had considered 11 new offences: two of murder and two of attempted murder in relation to two babies who died, and seven of attempted murder in relation to seven babies who survived.Prosecutors received a file of evidence in relation to the potential charges in July last year.Frank Ferguson, the head of the CPS’s special crime division, said it had written to the families of the babies and would offer to meet them to explain their decision, adding: “Our thoughts remain with them.”Letby’s barrister, Mark McDonald, said the nurse had always maintained her innocence and that she had “never hurt a child and never would”.He said there was “overwhelming evidence that no babies were murdered” and that her case should be urgently referred back to the court of appeal. “The reality is that a young innocent woman is in prison for crimes she has not committed.”Investigators at the CCRC are considering a dossier of 31 reports, compiled by 26 experts, which Letby’s legal team say significantly undermine her convictions.A panel of experts instructed by Letby’s lawyerssaid last yearthey had found no evidence she had murdered or harmed any of the babies she was convicted of attacking.They concluded that the 17 newborns had instead suffered a catalogue of “bad medical care” or deteriorated as a result of natural causes.David Davis, the senior Conservative MP who has described Letby as the victim of “one of the major injustices of modern times”, welcomed the CPS decision.He said: “In my view, the ‘evidence’ in the original cases failed to prove guilt, and this is the reason that Letby’s lawyers have taken the matter back to the Criminal Case Review Commission.“The CCRC must conclude its review quickly and refer the case to the court of appeal. It has long been my view that any retrial in Lucy Letby’s case should happen as quickly as possible.”Cheshire constabulary said the decision was “not the outcome that we had anticipated” and that it had been confident the evidence was sufficiently strong.The force stands by its original investigation into Letby and said its ongoing inquiry into hospital bosses over alleged corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter was ongoing.Three former senior leaders at the Countess of Chester hospital were arrested in June 2025 on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. All three remained on bail pending further inquiries, the force said on Tuesday. It added: “Our thoughts remain with the families affected by this.”Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyCrown Prosecution ServiceUK criminal justiceCrimeHospitalsCheshireNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

The groups Canadian Lawyers for International Human Rights and the Legal Centre for Palestine also joined the complaint.Hochman’s performance went on as scheduled following his release. On Tuesday, the Hind Rajab Foundation alsofiled a complainturging US authorities to investigate and prosecute Hochman, who is scheduled to perform in New York City on Tuesday evening.The group argued that the scheduled performance “poses an imminent risk of further criminal conduct” and noted that in addition to international law, Hochman’s conduct might violate US federal criminal statutes, including the War Crimes Act and genocide statute.The group’s dossier, which includes several photos and videos Hochman himself posted on social media, details evidence of his presence and participation in September 2024 in the destruction of the Raed al-Attar Mosque in Rafah – which the group notes was a religious structure protected under international law. It also accuses Hochman of “clear, repeated, and public incitement to genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza, in statements made both during his time working along with the Israeli military and during performances and online broadcasts.According to the group, Hochman called for the “mass killing and extermination” of Palestinians, advocated for the use of nuclear weapons againstGaza, celebrated civilian deaths, and called for the starvation, displacement and collective punishment of Palestinians, among other statements. He also called for the destruction of religious sites, including stating that “not a single mosque will remain in Gaza”.Hochman did not immediately respond to a request for comment but he confirmed the detention in a social media post. “They tried to stop me from entering Canada, but after 6 hours of delay, I got in,” hewrote. “They tried to prevent me from performing in front of the Israeli community, I performed.“And while they kept shouting ‘free Palestine’ to themselves in minus 10 degrees, we warmed up with laughter–400 Israelis inside. That’s what victory feels like.”Dyab Abou Jahjah, the Hind Rajab Foundation’s general director, said that the group “does not chase comedians”.“What we are dealing with here is not comedy. It is genocidal propaganda and incitement to violence,” he added. “Moreover, Guy Hochman is not only an inciter; he is also a perpetrator of war crimes who filmed himself while committing them.”A former combat soldier, Hochman began producing and disseminating videos with soldiers following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks and was later recruited and deployed to Gaza as an “entertainer” linked to the IDF spokesperson unit, according to the Hind Rajab Foundation’s dossier. The Israeli military did not answer questions about the allegations in the dossier orits relationship with Hochman but said “this is not an IDF matter”.“Every country in the world has an affirmative legal duty to seek out and punish all war criminals and genocidaires within their borders, and the United States is no exception,” Jake Romm, HRF’s representative in the United States, said of the Tuesday filing against Hochman in New York. “The US now has a choice: apply its own laws in compliance with its international legal obligations, or further erode the rule of law and allow its soil to be used for the gravest of crimes.”A spokesperson for Canada’s Border Services Agency declined to respond to questions about Hochman’s case, citing privacy laws, but said in a statement that foreign nationals entering the country can be subjected to a “secondary inspection” and that “in some instances, the inspection may take longer due to information being gathered through questioning.”The US justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Israeli soldiers have postedscores of photos and videosof themselves in Gaza, a practice the military has attempted to rein in ascriminal effortsagainst them have mounted overseas.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsUS immigrationCanadaGazaPalestineIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Usha Vance, 40, has already made history as the country’s first south Asian and Hindu second lady but does so again, as the first vice-presidential spouse to be pregnant while her husband served in office.“During this exciting and hectic time, we are particularly grateful for the military doctors who take excellent care of our family and for the staff members who do so much to ensure that we can serve the country while enjoying a wonderful life with our children,” the Vances said.Throughout his political career, the vice-president has repeatedlyraised concernsaboutdeclining birth ratesin the US, and in a speech at the anti-abortion March for Life rally last year,declared: “ I want more babies in the United States of America.”In aninterview last yearwith conservative commentator Meghan McCain, Usha Vance had said her husband “thinks he might like to have a fourth”. She laughed then, and added: “We’ll see where that leads.”While this pregnancy marks the first second lady to have a baby while in office, two first ladies have given birth during their husbands’ White House term. Frances Cleveland, wife of former president Grover Cleveland and the youngest first lady in history at 21 years of age, gave birth to daughter Esther in 1893. Esther was the Cleveland’s second child and was born in a bedroom on the second floor of the White House.Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of John F Kennedy, gave birth to their third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, in 1963. He was born on Cape Cod prematurely and died at just two days old.The White House congratulated the couple on social media. “The most pro-family administration in history!” the official account said.The Vances’ pregnancy announcement follows the news last month that Karoline Leavitt, the 28-year-old White House press secretary, was expecting her second child, a baby girl in May. Katie Miller, the rightwing podcaster and wife of Stephen Miller, alsoannouncedthat she was pregnant with the couple’s fourth child.The Vance children have traveled with their parents on major trips, memorably on a weeklong visit to Italy and India, where JD Vance was photographed carrying his daughter and trying to get them to pose for a family photo in front of the Taj Mahal.“I think that there’s always a limelight on the kids, and that’s both good and bad,” Vance said in an interview with NBC News last month. “Our eight-year-old really doesn’t like it. He wants to have as private of a life as possible. When we come to an event in the White House and he sees the cameras, he doesn’t love it, and so we try to keep him out of that limelight as much as possible.” By contrast, he said his five-year-old, “who’s a bit more like me” probably enjoys the attention “too much”.He also said in the interview that his marriage was “as strong as it’s ever been”, dismissing online rumors speculating otherwise.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJD VanceUS politicsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Next season will be cut from 18 productions to 17, with the Met postponing a planned staging of Mussorgsky’s Khovanshchina,a 19th-century Russian opera.A spokesperson for the MetOperaconfirmed the cuts to the Guardian, saying: “These staff reductions, combined with some temporary salary reductions and other cost-cutting measures, will reduce the Met’s expenses by $15m for the remaining six months of the Met’s fiscal year, and by another $25m in the Met’s following fiscal year.”The measures follow atentative agreementstruck last September between the Met Opera and Saudi Arabia. Valued at about $200m, the deal would see the company – which has an annual operating budget of$330m– perform each winter for five years at the Royal Diriyah Opera House near Riyadh,in returnfor Saudi subsidies.Speaking to the New York Times, Gelb said the cuts were prompted in part by delays and uncertainty surrounding the Saudi agreement.“I’ve been assured that it’s going to go forward. But we have been waiting for some time,” he said.The Met Opera spokesperson said: “The cuts are necessary while the Met awaits its pending agreement with Saudi Arabia and the implementation of other revenue-generating initiatives. The Met is committed to maintaining the highest artistic standards while ensuring its present and future financial sustainability.”Other measures floated by Gelb include the possible sale of its theater’s naming rights, as well as a potential sale of its two Marc Chagall murals, valued at a combined $55m, though any sale would require the works to remain in place at the organization’s city venue.Gelb also said the opera company may look towards renting out its auditorium to pop artists on nights when it is not running its own programs.Explore more on these topicsOperaNew YorkClassical musicnewsShareReuse this content"

The S&P 500 closed down 2.1% while the Dow Jones finished down 1.8%.The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 2.4%, with Amazon down 2.9% and Tesla and Nvidia both off more than 3%, wiping billions of dollars off their market values.Graph showing falling stock marketsThe UK’s FTSE 100 index dropped 0.7% on Tuesday, aftera smaller fall on Monday.InEurope, France’s CAC was down 0.6%, Germany’s DAX fell 1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB was off 1.1%.The dollar was down 0.9% against a basket of currencies.Trump’s threat to increase tariffs on US imports of goods from Germany, France, Denmark, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland have renewed economic uncertainty.View image in fullscreenHoward Lutnick said Trump uses tariffs as a way to initiate diplomacy.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, played down the likelihood of a fresh trade war. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he gave a bullish defence of US tariff policies but suggested the outcome of what he called the “kerfuffle” over Greenland was be likely to be diplomacy.“We are here to make a very clear point: globalisation has failed the west and the United States of America. It’s a failed policy. It is what the west has stood for, which is export, offshore, find the cheapest labour in the world, and the world is a better place for it. The fact is, it has left America behind. It has left American workers behind,” he said.Lutnick argued that Trump uses tariffs as “a way for him to say: ‘Hey, you know, you need to talk to us.’ Do I think the trade deals that we’ve set with Europe, with the UK, are they durable? I absolutely do … What I see happening is diplomacy and talking and at the table, rather than action, which is something I think the president cares about.”Sitting alongside Lutnick, the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the UK was also interested in its economic security – but said the US should remember who its allies are.“For all of your strengths, we do also need to preserve some of the things that the US has benefited from, in the Nato alliance, and the western alliance, not because it is the benevolent, because I believe it is in your country’s national interest.”Reeves also urged people to keep cool heads as fears mount over Trump’s push for Greenland. “We absolutely want to de-escalate,” she told Bloomberg. “The future of Greenland is for the people of Greenland.”Trump is scheduled to give a speech at Davos on Wednesday.What are Trump’s latest tariff threats and could EU hit back with ‘big bazooka’?Read moreEarlier on Tuesday, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also speaking at Davos, urged European countries not to retaliate against the US’s trade tariffs announced over theGreenlandcrisis.Referring to Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, announced in April, Bessent said: “I would say this is the same kind of hysteria that we heard on 2 April. There was a panic.“What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out. The worst thing countries can do is escalate against the United States.”But Kathleen Brooks, a research director at the broker XTB, said Bessent had failed to calm investor nerves.“Overall, this is a man-made crisis, and the continued sell-off on Tuesday suggests that US threats to Greenland and their effects on financial markets could have further to go if the situation does not de-escalate soon,” she said.Gold and silver hit record highs as investors sought shelter from the market falls.Goldrose past $4,700 (£3,500) an ounce for the first time on Tuesday, and silver hit a fresh high of $95.52 an ounce.Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that eight European countries including the UK, France and Germany,will face tariffs“until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland”. The tariffs are due to start at 10% on 1 February, rising to 25% on 1 June.Trump also added further uncertainty to global trade overnight by threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and champagne after France’s Emmanuel Macron was reported to be unwilling to join his Gaza “board of peace”.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsFTSEGoldDollarGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

We must make that clear todayKiran StaceyPolicy editorTue 20 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 18.26 ESTShareAngela Rayner has urged Keir Starmer to stick to his campaign pledge to cap ground rents for leaseholders in England and Wales, as cabinet divisions over the government’s plans to rip up the leasehold system come to a head.The former deputy prime minister has intervened in a tense standoff betweenSteve Reed, the housing secretary, and Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, over whether to stand by Labour’s promise to limit annual charges for existing leaseholders.Is this Labour party for rich investors or hard-working leaseholders?  We must make that clear todayRead moreThe measure was part of a draft leasehold bill due to be published last year, which was delayed after Reeves became concerned that capping ground rents could deter property investors.Government insiders say Starmer is due to decide between his warring ministers on Tuesday, as pressure mounts fromLabourMPs to publish the draft bill as soon as possible.In anarticle for the Guardian, Rayner writes: “Over recent decades … ordinary homeowners have increasingly been charged high and escalating amounts of ground rent, leaving them in financial distress and often unable to sell or re-mortgage their homes.”She adds: “Labour made a promise to leaseholders that we would fix this injustice, but ministers are currently subjected to furious lobbying from wealthy investors trying to water this manifesto commitment down.“There are those who argue we cannot act on our promise as it could risk a backlash from investors, including pension funds. It’s hardly surprising – the system works just fine for them.“They get an annual return for doing absolutely nothing, they can raise ground rents and pile up service charges without transparency and with total impunity, regardless of the devastation it causes to families.”Labour promised in its manifesto to “finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end”, including banning the sale of new leasehold flats. The manifesto added: “We will tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent charges.”Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister, has been working on the draft bill since Labour entered government, including a measure to cap ground rents at £250 a year for current leaseholders. New leasehold properties must be sold with peppercorn, or nominal, ground rents, under legislation passed by the last Conservative government.He was supported for much of that time by Rayner, who was also the housing and local government secretary beforeshe left governmentlast year after admitting to underpaying property taxes on her new property in Hove, East Sussex.Pennycook was due to publish the draft bill in December, but the plans were postponed at the last minute after Treasury officials became concerned that the ground rent cap could hit pension funds that own freehold properties.Labour MPs have become increasingly frustrated by the delays, given there are an estimated 5m leasehold homes in England, and have raised the issue repeatedly with the prime minister in the Commons.One of those MPs, Ruth Cadbury, told the Guardian: “I am very keen that momentum isn’t lost. My constituents and those of us who have been working on this issue were disappointed that the bill hadn’t been published, so I hope it is published very soon.”Explore more on these topicsLeaseholdHousingPropertyAngela RaynerSteve ReedKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Emptying 37m cubic metres (1,307m cu ft) of water was not an option, meaning that helmeted divers were limited to 98-minute stints in the high-pressure environment.The risky project required a team on a floating platform with a crane to cut out the broken equipment with thermal lances, bolt a plate on to the reservoir wall, and install the new equipment. It took more than a year until last October to complete, according to Glenfield Invicta, the contractor that carried out the work for ThamesWater.Water companies across Britain are gearing up for more of these repairs and upgrades than ever this year, as the industry undertakes the biggest spending spree in its history until 2030. It follows decades of underinvestment by the privatised water system in England and Wales.On Tuesday, Labour announced plansto overhaul regulationof that system to try to make sure companies invest enough to avoid sewage overflows or leaking pipes. It will replace Ofwat, the regulator in England and Wales, and shift to a new regime regulating each company individually, rather than setting industry-wide targets.Yet that will take time. In the meantime, water companies must continue with upgrades. In December 2024 Ofwat granted suppliers permission toincrease bills by an average of 36%between 2025 and 2030 to allow £104bn of spending on pipes and water treatment works, compared with£51bn in the last five years. That steep bill increase came at a political cost, amid outrage around the country over sewage spills into rivers and seas. Now they have won the money, some experts believe the water companies may struggle to spend it.Nobody disputes that much of the spending is necessary. The water system is creaking in very visible ways; South East Water faced heavy criticism this month afterthousands of residents were without waterfor days this month, an incident which followed asimilar outagebefore Christmas. A drumbeat of serious pollution issues resulted in six companies beingbanned from paying executive bonusesin the year to June.View image in fullscreenSouth East Water faced criticism after thousands of residents were left without water for days.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesStuart Colville, the deputy chief executive of Water UK, a lobby group for the industry, said suppliers had demonstrated a “steep increase in ambition”, with plans to increase capacity at 1,700 wastewater treatment works and upgrade 3,000 storm overflows. However, he argued that the bills increase was needed to make up lost time during a period when bills were kept lower.“We’ve got all this legacy of catch-up,” he said. “Why did that underinvestment take place? Bills should have been about 25% higher than they would have been if they’d kept up with inflation. We’ve not seen enough investment since about 2010.”However, the justification for the bills increase is disputed. River Action, which campaigns for cleaner waterways, has gone as far as legal action against Ofwat,arguing that households are paying twicefor investments to stop sewage leaks that should have been funded from their previous bills. Ofwat, which oversaw the underinvestment, is itselfdue to be abolishedas Labour brings in a new regulatory system.“We believe that the water companies have already had more than enough money to sort out the problems,” said James Wallace, the chief executive of River Action. He and others have argued that money was siphoned out by previous investors in the form of excessive dividends to shareholders.Join the queueThe spending has already started, but water companies are not the only ones looking for builders.The Labour government has a very long construction shopping list: 1.5m homes a year, £28bn in upgrades for the gas and electricity grids, the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C nuclear reactors, a new£33bn runway for Heathrow airport– not to mentionenough potholestofill the Albert Hallmany, many times over.With the water spending on top, that would suggest an infrastructure boom to rival the reign of Queen Victoria, when water assets still in use today were built such asJoseph Bazalgette’s Westminster embankmentin London, the Thirlmere aqueduct supplying Manchester, and the Elan Valley aqueduct supplying Birmingham.View image in fullscreenThe Thames Tideway is cited as an example of a large, well managed project.Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty ImagesThe water industry does have some more recent examples it can draw on, according to Dieter Helm, an Oxford University professor of economic policy who has advised previous Labour and Conservative governments on energy and water. He cited the Thames Tideway – an update to Bazalgette’s works in London – as an example of a large, well managed project. But water companies will be battling with other sectors for the equipment, workers and materials to pour concrete and lay pipes across the country.“What is the capacity to build all this?” said Helm. “Very little. There’s a scarcity of contractor supply, a scarcity of materials.”In-demand contractors spy a “massive opportunity”, according to one person at a large engineering firm. Galliford Try, Kier and Morgan Sindall are among the FTSE 250-listed companies expected to benefit.The engineering company Costain is working on projects for at least six English companies, from Northumbrian in the north-east to reservoirs for Anglian in Cambridgeshire. Alex Vaughan, the Costain chief executive, said water companies had tried to bring in contractors earlier than usual to secure the expertise they needed.“For the UK to have a sustainable and resilient water system, a consistent, long-term approach to the delivery of water infrastructure is needed,” he said. He added that longer-term strategies and “extended delivery frameworks” were allowing companies such as his to recruit people more easily because they could offer longer-term stability.View image in fullscreenKier is among the FTSE 250-listed companies expected to benefit from water investment.Photograph: Colin Underhill/AlamyBeyond securing enough builders, several experts are worried about inflation. Helm said infrastructure projects often overran by 30% on time and 30% on costs – wherever they were in the world. “Do we think the cost inflation in the construction sector will get any better?” he said. “Well, why would we think that?”Ofwat hasmechanismsto adjust for inflation, which will protect the companies to a certain extent, by making bill payers pay more if price indices rise rapidly.Financial distractionsSpending billions of pounds is not simply a matter of buying something off the shelf. It requires large, experienced teams keeping a beady eye on progress. That becomes a lot harder if you are distracted.Distractions do not come much bigger than those faced by Thames Water, which has been locked in seemingly endless talks with investors and the regulator torestructure its huge debts and avoid temporary nationalisation. But Ofwat alsojudgedin November that South East and Southern required active monitoring for financial problems, with another six water companies on the “elevated concern” list.Six companies are also appealing to the Competition and Markets Authority formore money from bills, tying up managers who could otherwise be overseeing investments.The increases to bills over a five-year period were front-loaded to this financial year – prompting a bigger political backlash and a surge in complaints from households – in order to get cash to companies quicker. But the current spending period started in April, so a quick start required planning years ago.Martin Young, a former investment bank analyst who now runs the Aquaicity consultancy, said that some of the better-run companies with less debt appeared to have got moving more quickly.View image in fullscreenThames Water has been distracted by talks to restructure its huge debts.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“The listed companies on balance are performing better than the unlisted companies,” he said. “That would have given them potentially a good head start. Those who were more stretched either operationally or financially were always going to find it a little bit tougher.”There is a split between the water companies steeling themselves for a five-year spending marathon, and the analysts who worry it will be too much for them.Water UK’s Colville argued that companies faced “really strong financial penalties if they fail to deliver”.“We are getting on with it,” he said. “We recognise that delivery is absolutely essential for restoring trust and justifying the increases in bills.”The companies face a tall order to prove they can do that. River Action’s Wallace said he expected “disappointment and more criminal pollution by water companies”.“I would be stunned if they get through this capital programme in this period of time,” said Helm. “If they do they will pay top dollar.”Explore more on these topicsWater industryThames WaterConstruction industryWaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.Ryanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”Muskwrote in a replyto a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”All this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.However, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.Musk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.The row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,”he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”He claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”O’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.Ryanair was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskRyanairMichael O'LearyAirline industryIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

After his mother died, his grandmother needed help raising his sister, brother and him, and placed him with a white missionary family from Florida. He was the only member of his family to escape the war. “That is something that weighed heavy on me as I grew,” he says. “Why was it me? Why couldn’t my siblings come, or why wasn’t it one of them?” It would be years until he knew what became of them.Today, his stage name – he was born Janjay Lowe – is a stylised version of the Liberian capital Monrovia; his songwriting addresses his fractured identity, and the spectre of colonialism that surrounded him in Liberia and the US, applying emotional intimacy to global realities. His approach, he theorises, “starts with people trusting that you’re not afraid to be vulnerable in your own way. Then you start talking about the bigger picture.”Of all the coffee shops in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the one Lowe chooses for our interview is in a downtown business district that appears to have cleared out for the holidays. Only a handful of patrons trickle in while we talk over mint tea on a December afternoon, and that suits him. “I don’t really like to be noticed,” he says, casually attired in a dark, plaid flannel shirt. That kind of modesty is his trademark: at his sellout shows, he avoids grand gestures and invites audiences into his clarifying calm. But despite his aversion to attention, Lowe stands out among a new generation of singer-songwriters translating TikTok fame into tangible success.Mon Rovîa: Bloodline – videoOn his debut album, Bloodline, the arresting serenity of his music is in deliberate contrast to his harrowing past. Listeners have compared him to Nick Drake and Labi Siffre, cult heroes of elegant folk sensitivity. He dubbed his music Afro-Appalachian folk, having learned that a predecessor of the banjo also originated in west Africa, and enslaved musicians and their descendants helped create the string band music associated with the region he now calls home. “You just see that these things have been whitewashed over time,” he says.Before he became Mon Rovîa, Lowe grew up in a white, American, middle-class background – radically different environment from the one into which he was born –and relied on his keen perceptiveness to acclimatise. “The real person that I am was never really shown,” he says. “I understood what it was to be the funny guy. I had friends easily.” But when he was alone with his thoughts, “that was a whole other journey of loneliness”. Deep down, he acknowledged: “I’m not OK at all, but I’m in this American space being what I need to be, the token Black guy.”Lowe accepted his adoptive family’s evangelical Christian faith, and life revolved around church. Attending private Christian schools insulated him from much of American popular culture, although when he was in high school, the family moved to the Bahamas for mission work and he gained two foster brothers who introduced him to Fleet Foxes and Bon Iver. Soon he was poring over Mumford & Sons lyrics like a seminal text. “I spent a lot of time with their songs because there was a religious aspect of struggle, and I was intrigued,” he says. When his foster brothers formed a band, he wrote eagerly, but left the lead vocals to them.With no particular career ambitions, Lowe seized the opportunity to play football for his conservative Presbyterian college near Chattanooga. Living alone for the first time, he “was battling a lot of different things, when it comes to adoption and identity and survivor’s guilt”. And he couldn’t help but consider how entangled his experience was with the history of colonisation. Music became a way of processing his experiences. Taking his stage name was a way of symbolising his commitment to “remember my people, remember the journey and the blessing of my life, and my mother, and my siblings that I’ve not thought about in years”.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t think I would ever be able to put my full mind into music’ … Mon Rovîa.Photograph: Carter HoweAt first, he dabbled in melodic rap and digitally programmed bedroom pop. “If you’re a Black American, you gotta kind of lean that way,” he says of the race-based genre parameters by which he initially felt confined. But nothing clicked. Then he posted an acoustic clip of an original for a lark and received enthusiastic feedback from his friend – and future manager – Eric Cromartie. In a separate interview, Cromartie recalls advising him: “‘Go to TikTok, put the beats down and just go with your ukulele.’ And within three weeks, he blew up.”In 2020, Lowe started self-releasing EPs while working everyday jobs, but in 2024 he signed with Nettwerk Music Group, the Canadian indie label that launched Sarah McLachlan’s career, and dropped the side hustles. “I didn’t think I would ever be able to put my full mind into music,” he says, “and now I get to.”Bloodline benefited from that freedom. The call to collectively resist abuses of power in the gently galvanising Heavy Foot emerged in part from a study of leading thinkers in the American civil rights movement, including James Baldwin. Contemplating the south’s romantic distortions of the American civil war gave rise to Somewhere Down in Georgia, whose circling guitar figure, pensive vocals and naturalistic imagery feel haunted by the unreconciled traumatic history of the south. “They refuse to look at it clearly and do the things necessary to make those amends,” he says of the region. “A lot of the south lives in this place of deterioration because of that.” Despite these heavy themes, Lowe’s delivery is a gentle marvel.‘I ate acid for two months straight. It was the best time of my life’: Americana anarcho-punk Sunny War on booze, drugs and the KKKRead moreHe also conjures and recasts his own painful memories. Pray the Devil Back to Hell, informed by a documentary of the same name, conveys his awe at the Liberian women who ended the war. Black Cauldron traces his evolving perspective on his relationship to his mother. Though her life ended tragically early, he points out: “The story doesn’t end. She has a son who miraculously gets rescued and gets to help other people on a journey of healing.”Plenty of pop and hip-hop artists have used voice recordings as tone-setting interludes, but on Bloodline, Lowe shares audio clips of life-altering significance. They’re excerpts of WhatsApp messages from the Liberian sister, now a mother herself, with whom he only recently reconnected. “That’s really where I’ve gleaned a lot of my own history,” he says. In the intro to his searching song Whose Face Am I, she can be heard addressing him in Kolokwa – Liberian English – as Janjay and telling him that the father he never met was Senegalese.Soon after the album’s release, Lowe will embark on his second European tour, and he longs to return to Liberia. Bloggers there started posting about him last year, he has seen videos of Liberian musicians interpreting his songs and the Liberia music awards recently named Mon Rovîa outstanding artist of the year for 2025. “It’s been the biggest joy of my life,” he says, “to be welcomed back to a place I didn’t think I would ever be welcomed to.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockFolk musicLiberiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Director Kurtis David Harder takes a good elevator pitch – hot girl kills influencers and takes over their social media accounts – and turns it into something far smarter and entertaining than you might expect, with a small budget and a lead actor who, mark my words, will be in everything before long.The film opens on Madison (Emily Tennant), an influencer who is in Thailand on a sort of working holiday – taking smiley selfies, posing with skincare products and barely leaving her hotel while espousing the values of travel to her thousands of followers. “I love soaking it all in and really experiencing Asia as it is meant to be experienced – away from my comfort zone,” her voiceover coos, while we watch her eat a burger alone at her hotel and mope over her manager-boyfriend, Ryan (Rory J Saper), who didn’t come with her. After posting a bubbly video on an idyllic beach, she stares blankly out at the beautiful horizon as her phone pings incessantly; this is a lonely, empty life she has chosen, and she seems to know it.But in what seems like a chance meeting at the hotel bar, Madison crosses paths with CW (Cassandra Naud). CW is magnetic, confident and a seasoned solo traveller, and encourages Madison to stop obsessing over Ryan and actually enjoy her trip away from her phone. Madison’s passport mysteriously goes missing from her room and she breaks up with Ryan, but it seems she is finally having a nice time – until CW takes her to a remote island and leaves her there to die.“You sell products to little girls. Do you really think they will come looking for you?” CW asks Madison, before taking off in their boat with Madison’s phone and leaving her drugged on the beach. The opening credits roll – we are 26 minutes in and just getting started.CW has been described as a sort of Tom Ripley for the Instagram generation, stepping into the digital lives of others and enjoying their lifestyles by using AI to alter her face and voice to continue posting as them. It’s not an inaccurate comparison, but it is worth stressing that Naud makes this film as watchable and compelling as it is and, in a just world, this is the start of a great career. (Promisingly, she has been castin Mike Flanagan’s upcoming remake of Carrie.)View image in fullscreenTennant and Naud in Influencer.Photograph: Courtesy of ShudderWhile posting as Madison, CW heads to Bangkok to target a new influencer and finds fresh prey in Jessica (Sara Canning) – but her best laid plans are ruined when Ryan suddenly rocks up, thinking he’s tracked down Madison’s location from her Instagram photos.2 Fast 2 Furious is the franchise’s most derided film. It’s also the bestRead moreThe film’s co-writers, Harder and Tesh Guttikonda, smartly don’t give CW a backstory: she does what she does because she can, and the film is better without the baggage of a convoluted explanation. The entertainment comes from how convincing she is as a villain, and her ability to exploit these social media people with their shallow reading of the world. Naud’s facial birthmark is smartly, subtly incorporated; when Ryan tells CW that she is “unique” and should become an influencer herself, her dead-eyed silence tells you she has heard a version of this loaded compliment a hundred times before.Influencer is an entertainingly cynical and nasty 90 minutes well spent. It was enough of a hit that it earned a sequel – pleasingly titled Influencers, which sees CW unleashed on an “incel” streamer and his conservative influencer girlfriend in Bali. It is the funnier of the two films and also worth watching – though it didn’t manage to make me empathise with incels. It’s a good film, not a miracle.Influencer and Influencers are streaming on Shudder via Prime Video in Australia, the US and UK; Influencer is also on Netflix in the US.

Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is an adaptation of a Japanese folk tale, the story of a princess from the moon discovered inside a bamboo stalk in a poor rural village. A decade ago, Studio Ghibli adapted the tale intoa gorgeously animated moviewith a traditional, lovingly hand-painted feel. This film could not be more different, a trippy, high-energy, techno anime set in the near future, half of it in a virtual reality world – and TikTok-ifed with emojis and stickers exploding all over the screen.It begins when a 17-year-old high school student called Iroha finds a baby girl inside a glowing lamppost (rather than the bamboo stalk of the original). Iroha (voiced by Dawn M Bennett in the English dub) is a sensible kid, a talented musician and grade-A student who has already moved out of the family home and is living alone, working all hours to pay the rent of her tiny studio flat. In any free time she does have, Iroha follows her idol, AI musical megastar Yachiyo, in a crazy, chaotic virtual reality world called Tsukuyomi.Iroha takes the baby home. But overnight, the tiny newborn grows into a crawling toddler. Within days she is a pre-teen, a pale ethereal beauty called Kaguya, who, it transpires, is a runaway from the moon. This girl who fell to Earth is an impulsive ball of energy; she persuades Iroha to collaborate with her on songs to win a competition to perform with superstar Yachiyo, none of them remotely catchy. The plot pings about hyperactively, so dizzying that Cosmic Princess Kaguya! may leave audiences over 15 years old feeling more ancient than the original tale.Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is on Netflix from 22 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeAI (artificial intelligence)Virtual realityJapanMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In one episode before Rob becomes an author, we see him as a sexually pent-up teacher abroad, masturbating over an essay he’s marking. That the scene is an echo of one in Michel Houellebecq’s Atomised (once named by Doyle as the best book from the past 40 years) hardly lessens our discomfort, and it’s hard not to feel that our unease is precisely the point. “Frankly, a lot of my life has been disastrous,” he once told an interviewer – which might not be quite as self-deprecating as it sounds, given that Doyle has also argued that “great literature” is born of “abjection” not “glory”.The autofictional game-playing continues in his new novel, Cameo, but instead of self-abasing display, we get a perky book-world send-up for the culture war era, cartoonishly dramatising the ups and downs of creative life. It takes the form of a vertiginous hall of mirrors centred on gazillion-selling Dublin novelist Ren Duka, renowned for a long novel cycle drawn on his own life, the summaries of which comprise the bulk of the book we’re reading. Duka’s work isn’t autofiction à la Knausgård: hardly deskbound, still less under the yoke of domesticity, he leads a jet-set life of peril, mixing with drug dealers, terrorists, spies, and eventually serving time for tax evasion before he develops a crack habit, a penchant for threesomes in Paris and – perhaps least likely of all – returns to his long-forsaken Catholicism.The matter-of-fact present tense narration, sprightly with hyperbolic intensifiers, generates terrific momentumWriterly pettiness is an ever-present source of comedy: abducted in Iraq (long story), Duka finds himself recording propaganda for Islamic State, during which he has the presence of mind to denounce “his literary rivals, including writers barely known beyond Dublin publishing circles”. Punctuating the action are free-floating monologues from voices recalling their connection to Duka, including an actor bitter about no longer playing him on screen, a punk novelist akin toVirginie Despentes, and – naturally – one Rob Doyle. There are excerpts, too, from the memoir of an unnamed author recalling his boyhood breakthrough of writing a story in the voice of the Predator (“It just hadn’t occurred to me before that I could enter the sensorium of an extraterrestrial psychopath”); plus – on top of all that – snippets from a near-future novel about a cab driver in a time of pan-European war, alien sightings and “cartel leaders in Mexico worshipping a new AI”.Away from our anticipation as to how these strands fit together, Cameo’s energy lies largely in that sort of larky detail, narrated in a winningly deadpan register caught between bewilderment and weariness. The matter-of-fact present-tense narration, sprightly with hyperbolic intensifiers (he’s especially fond of “satanic”), generates terrific momentum and the satire is wicked. At one point, Duka – reinventing himself as an anti-woke comedian – is in demand as a rightwing talking head: “Whenever an interlocutor, invariably in firmer command of facts and statistics, seems poised to get the better of him, Ren accuses them of racism. If he feels he is in a particularly tight corner, he accuses them of paedophilia … Two months after his stand-up tour ends, he writes an article for the New Statesman titled ‘I’m Sorry’.”While I frequently lost track of whether I was reading the life of the fictitious author Ren Duka or the story of what his fictional avatar gets up to in the novels written by him, you might take that as a mark of the immersion generated by Cameo’s conceit. It’s not all laughs, either; there’s a kernel of emotion when, on the brink of drug-induced breakdown in Berlin, “Rob Doyle” rings his sister for help – but she’s still unhappy because of her portrayal in a previous book, and the call ends disastrously when, deep in his own plight, he’s oblivious to hers.Overall, though, such moments are rarer than in Threshold and Doyle’s 2022 memoirAutobibliography, as if he wanted a break from hanging himself out to dry as the bad guy. But that only makes this slippery jeu d’esprit harder to pin down. Is Duka’s improbably storied narrative – the writer as action hero, a fantasy of literary celebrity – a comic riposte to the accusation that autofiction looks no further than its own navel? Whatever the case, I suspect some readers will hate it – but also that Doyle wouldn’t want it any other way.Cameo by Rob Doyle is published by W&N (£20).

These subjects are at the heart of A Giant on the Bridge, the singer-songwriter Jo Mango and the theatre-maker Liam Hurley’s urgent piece of gig-theatre, which premiered in 2024 and heads out on tour acrossScotlandnext month.It was born from a research project, Distant Voices: Coming Home, that revealed dire statistics for the number of people who come out of prison and then go back in again, says Mango. “Research showed that the process is often less about the individuals and more about societal and structural issues – whether they can get a job when they come out, whether they have any family left who are there to support them.” A Giant on the Bridge emerged as “a kind of way of writing an essay about what we learned”, Mango says, but using songs co-written by people who have lived experience of the prison system.For the project’s research associate, Phil Crockett Thomas, that songwriting process revealed something profound. Over about 20 intensive sessions in open and closed prisons and community justice settings, the team worked with roughly 200 people. “Coming home, punishment and disconnection from the world outside are extremely distressing experiences,” she says. “What we found was that collaborative songwriting allowed more space for people to explore those issues in the way that felt right to them.”Often, participants chose not to write directly about prison at all. “They wrote about completely different things,” Crockett Thomas recalls. “Or they wrote daft and wonderful songs.” Music, she realised, functioned as “a resource for the self”, sometimes “a quiet form of resistance” within the prison environment.View image in fullscreenEmotional journey … Louis Abbott in A Giant on the Bridge.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanOne of the most striking moments of the show comes from a song audiences often assume was written by someone incarcerated. “It’s actually written by a prison officer,” Mango explains. The song reflects on a child whose father is absent because of military service, stressing that “although his daddy isn’t here in person, he’s around by phone and in our memories”.Another song, Bars and Multicoloured Chairs, was written by someone nearing the end of their sentence. The lyrics highlight the complicated emotions that can be associated with release: “Don’t count the days, make the days count / Learn to cope, nose like a sniffer dog, I can smell home / We are human when we walk in / We turn to numbers, and we are forgotten.”One audience favourite, Fuck It Button, emerged from a songwriting session that brought community members into prison spaces. Written by a participant in recovery, its blunt refrain – “I know you want to press the fuck it button, to oblivion and beyond” – resonates far beyond its context. “That moment where you decide whether you’re going to go ‘fuck it’ or not – that exists across loads of spectrums,” Mango says. “It’s an example of the way songs brought different people together and integrated different types of experience.”Hurley, whose co-writing credits includeMixter Maxterfor National Theatre of Scotland and Rowan Rheingans’ Fringe First-winningDispatches on the Red Dress, led on the collaborative writing of the script that went alongside the songs. He brought to the project a recognition of theatre’s ability to hold emotional and ethical complexity. “It’s not a topic that I was engaged with before getting involved,” he says, “but I saw the opportunity to have an intelligent, emotional and human conversation through theatre, building on the songs that had already been created, around an issue that doesn’t really get spoken about with much compassion or nuance.”View image in fullscreenPlurality of voices … the rapper Dave Hook.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanCentral to the show’s power is the plurality of voices, and on stage, these songs are performed by a remarkable ensemble of Scottish musicians whose individual identities help shape the storytelling. Alongside Mango herself, the cast comprises Louis Abbott from the group Admiral Fallow, Kim Grant (aka Raveloe), Jill O’Sullivan and the rapper Dave Hook.Hurley describes them as “a Scottish indie folk supergroup” and says the piece’s theatrical magic lies in the act of collective imagination. “It’s that moment where a live performer is telling a story as themselves, and then they become the character,” he says. “You don’t need lights or sound or high production values for that to happen. It’s that spark of intimacy and connection. And we couldn’t be prouder of the cast, because none of them had considered themselves storytellers, and certainly not actors.”Over many iterations, the show has grown more confident in its own shape. “At the start, everyone was trying so hard to do justice to the complexity and all the stories and all the people we’ve met,” Crockett Thomas reflects. “What’s been so good to see is that the show has become something of its own out of that. It’s got this confidence and this independence, and it’s still absolutely sensitively relating back to those earlier steps.” Hurley adds: “The audience experiences one story. Despite the disparate stories we start off with, it’s one satisfying emotional journey.”For Crockett Thomas, theatre’s value lies in its capacity to hold contradictions. “Art can allow us to vicariously live through experiences we’ve not had ourselves,” she says. “And theatre can do justice to the messy complexity of homecoming.”The team is clear-eyed about the political context in Scotland. “I’d like to see more challenge to the undeserved image of Scotland as progressive on justice issues,” Crockett Thomas says. Despite some reforms, imprisonment rates remain high, and deaths in custody are among the highest in Europe. “Why are we building more and bigger prisons rather than trying to decarcerate?” she asks.Ultimately, A Giant on the Bridge doesn’t give simple answers. What it offers instead is a shared space – to listen, to feel, and to sit with discomfort. Hurley hopes audiences leave “emotionally opened, intellectually stimulated, but also productively discombobulated”. He sums up the spirit of the piece: “We can’t all talk at the same time, but we can all sing at the same time.”A Giant on the Bridgeis at Cottier’s theatre, Glasgow, 25-26 February.

That’s dancer Amy Thake’s toe, her sole thrust forth with implacable strength, that digit stretching away, bristling with intention. If you can get that much out of one foot, just wait till everything else starts moving. Thake’s solo isDeep Song by Martha Graham, from 1937, made in response to the Spanish civil war. It’s only six minutes long, but it is an intense six minutes: the exactitude of Graham’s stripped-to-the-core style, the weight and grace and power. Among other things it is a picture of a kind of exhaustion when one’s soft edges are shorn off by the load borne.As well as reviving 20th-century gems – such as Bella Lewitzky’s Kinaesonata (1970), danced with racing speed and millimetric accuracy –Yorke Dance Projectis trumpeting two premieres in this rich and really excellent programme. Troubadour is the first new work from choreographer Christopher Bruce (now 80) for more than a decade.View image in fullscreenAn intense six minutes … Amy Thake in Deep Song by Martha Graham.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBest known for 1991’sRooster, set to the Rolling Stones, Bruce chooses Leonard Cohen this time. The songs, and Cohen’s deep drawl of a voice, are hugely atmospheric. It’s three-piece suits and wine-red dresses, scenes from a half-remembered midnight in a smoky club. They tango through love, desire and fallibility, but Bruce never settles for the obvious in these couplings, always inventive, as are the endless rhythmic variations of the steps within the frame of a 4/4 beat. The craft is clear; Bruce has still got it.Up-and-coming choreographer Liam Francis also knows the value of a good soundtrack. Composer Jethro Cooke’s creation for Cast|X| uses fragments of film dialogue: “What have you done?” “I had no choice!” There are immediate parallels with choreographer Crystal Pite, bodies moving in response to quickfire text, but Francis’s movement is more amorphous – you can sense guilt, uncertainty, accusation, interconnectedness, without it coming into sharp focus. It’s promising.View image in fullscreenStarkly beautiful … Jonathan Goddard and Eileih Muir in Lacrymosa.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBest of the night isLacrymosa, made for the company in 2015 bythe late Robert Cohan, inspired by the idea of Mary losing her son Jesus to his calling. Having danced with Martha Graham, Cohan learned the art of choreographing no more than was necessary – there’s no small talk here yet it says so much.

Without giving too much away for those who haven’t seen it, Ralph Fiennes dancing semi-naked among piles of human bones to Iron Maiden’s The Number of the Beast is not how you expect one of our greatest thespians to deport himself on screen.View image in fullscreen28 Days Later: The Bone Temple director Nia DaCosta.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images“Alex Garland chose that song,” says the film’s director, Nia DaCosta. “He wrote it into the script. And you can’t get better than that in a film about satanists.”Indeed you can’t. From the track’s spoken intro by actor Barry Clayton – “Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number. Its number is six hundred and sixty six” – to Bruce Dickinson concluding with “I have the fire, I have the force / I have the power to make my evil take its course”, it is a shade under five minutes of nothing but the dark lord.The song was the title track of Maiden’s 1982 album, their third, and first with singer Bruce Dickinson, and it moved them to the peaks of the metal world – their first UK No 1 album and first US top 40 album. Released as a single in 1982, the track reached No 3 in the UK in 2005, and that remains the highest ever UK chart position for a song about Satan (in the US, that honour belongs to the Charlie Daniels Band’s The Devil Went Down to Georgia, also a No 3 single).It’s a far from usual track: Clive Burr’s drum patterns judder awkwardly and, as Maiden are wont to do, they put multiple sections in. “That makes it so fun,” DaCosta says, “and gives you so many options in terms of when and how to cut.” The scene had to contrast the world of the Jimmys – a Satanist gang – with that of the warm, humanist Fiennes character. “We wanted it to feel as erratic and crazy as it was when we shot the Jimmys being violent in their scenes, but also having the romance of Ralph’s character’s world – which is why there is fire and warm tones. And that song gave us a lot to work with.”View image in fullscreenIron Maiden in 1983: from left, Dave Murray, Steve Harris, Bruce Dickinson, Nicko McBrain and Adrian Smith.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesIron Maiden seldom license their music for use in film and TV. “The biggest thing to consider,” says Dave Shack, one of the trio who run the band’s team Phantom Music Management, “is: are we going to be made fun of?” Given popular culture’s propensity for mocking metalheads, that rules out a huge number of proposals off the bat. He still regrets the band allowing one character in Hot Tub Time Machine to wear anIron Maidenshirt throughout. “That was a litmus test of what happens if you grant the licence and take the fee. We’re not bloody Spinal Tap or Steel Panther.”Even with a great script, fantastic cast and crew, and amazing director, it can all go wrong, he says. “What happens on the day can completely kibosh it – we all accept that risk.” This time, though, everything went perfectly to plan. After the BFI Imax screening, DaCosta approached Shack and asked if he was happy. “Am I happy? Are you kidding me? People stood up in the cinema and clapped for it!” The scene itself might be startling, but Maiden don’t come out of it looking at all silly.It’s the second time in weeks that Maiden have been at the centre of a pop-culture moment on screen. Their 1983 track The Trooper featured in the Stranger Things finale, and within seven days its streaming numbers across all platforms rose by 252%.It’s worth noting that both 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple and Stranger Things were big budget, prestige productions, both of which used music as an integral part of plotting and character. Maiden, a band who were refusing to do things “for the exposure” long before the internet made it commonplace, have always maintained a sense of their own worth.“The music budget is usually the ass end of everything,” Shack says. “That’s a big part of the reason why, historically, Maiden have said no. If you make a $10m film, why don’t you put half a million aside for music and licensing? They’ll tell you it’s crucial to the scene, that it’s the only song the director wants. Then pay some money for it.”From Ralph Fiennes to Jeffrey Wright: the most overlooked performances this awards seasonRead moreDaCosta quickly realised this scene would have an impact. It was shot over three nights, and within a couple of days her editor had prepared a cut of it. “It was so amazing, and in that moment I felt: Oh, we did it. I couldn’t have predicted people would be cheering or getting out of their seats and dancing. But I felt the impact from the first cut. If you have a needle drop in a movie it had better be great, because sometimes it’s used to blast over a scene that’s not so good. But when you use it right, it can be amazing.”It’s another semi-naked snake-hipped showstopper for Fiennes after his dance to the Rolling Stones’ Emotional Rescue in Luca Guadagnino’s A Bigger Splash, and it’s all worked out very well for Maiden, too, albeit inadvertently. The band are currently in the midst of their 50th anniversary world tour. Both Stranger Things and 28 Years Later were under way long before that. Shack knows it was chance, but still he says, “Maybe they were vindications. But the big picture is that you’re always looking for validation from a new audience. And Iron Maiden are no different in that.”This article was amended on 20 January 2026. An earlier version incorrectly said Iron Maiden had not released any greatest hits compilations. This reference has been removed. Also, The Number of the Beast reached No 3 in the UK singles chart in 2005, not 1990. Its 1990 release was part of a box set that reached the same position in the albums chart.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMetalIron Maiden28 Days Later28 Years LaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sabrina Sutherland, who worked with Lynch on Twin Peaks and Inland Empire, said the mysteries at the heart of the films were meant to be open to interpretation.“David left it open to the viewer to come up and formulate their own ideas, and whatever it means to you is the meaning of the piece,” she said. “Nobody has the answer.”View image in fullscreenDavid Lynch with Sabrina Sutherland.Photograph: BFILynch, a lifelong smoker, died after beingdiagnosed with emphysema. Sweeney,who wrote The Straight Storyand is a professor at the University of Southern California, said she and their son, Riley, tried many times to encourage him to stop smoking.“Just a couple weeks before he died and we were Zooming with David and he out of the blue said: ‘You know, you tried to make me stop and I wouldn’t listen to you.’ It was heartbreaking.”Lynch’s films are being celebrated ina new season at the British Film Institute, which is called David Lynch: The Dreamer and includes screenings of Lost Highway, Inland Empire and Eraserhead.Earlier this week, Clare Binns, the creative director of Picturehouse Cinemas,encouraged directors to make shorter filmsin order to create better experiences for audiences.Recent critically acclaimed films have gone of the three-hour mark, such as Martin Scorsese’sKillers of the Flower Moon(206 minutes) and Brady Corbet’s The Brutalist (215 minutes).“I talk to producers about this and say: ‘Tell the director you’re making the film for an audience, not the directors,’” she said.Explore more on these topicsDavid LynchSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

He worked withDavid Attenboroughon The Tribal Eye in 1975 and Spirit of Asia in 1980, followed by a remarkable series of films, The Shogun Inheritance (1984) and The New Pacific (1985), both of which were accompanied by books featuring Michael’s striking photographs, taken on location. Many of his films captured cultures that have since disappeared, making them invaluable records of the past.Born in Baildon, West Yorkshire, Michael was the son of Vera Brougham and David Gray. After David’s death, Vera married Maurice Macintyre and Michael was educated at Cheltenham grammar school, followed by Magdalen College, Oxford.I first met him in 1961 at aBBCoffice in London, where I had gone for an interview as a trainee television engineer. Michael was there too, going for the same position, and we discovered that not only had we both travelled from Oxford that morning, but that we had been studying on the same physics course for nearly three years and had never met.That short conversation led to an agreement to meet back in Oxford, and to a lasting friendship. We were both subsequently employed by the BBC, and from that point onwards we followed similar career paths, with Michael always slightly ahead.Soon becoming a videotape editor, by 1963 he was a director in BBC TV’s presentation department, moving on to its music and arts department in 1965 and working on programmes such as Look of the Week, Release and Review.After a year out in 1969, travelling in the far east, he returned to the corporation as a producer/director and subsequently began his work with Attenborough, including on The Tribal Eye.In 1991 Michael left the BBC to become a freelance director/cameraman, video editor and photographer. He made many more films, several for the BBC, before being diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia, which forced him to retire in 2007.In his spare time Michael played the guitar, and he loved classical music and dance, both Indian and western. He was also a keen tennis player and cyclist, and had a collection of fast cars and motorbikes. But his passion above all else was photography.He is survived by his partner, Stephanie Chilman, whom he met at the BBC when she was a production assistant, and their daughter, Natasha.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionOther livesUniversity of OxfordDavid AttenboroughBBCobituariesShareReuse this content"

Her songs and albums have neither been particularly critically acclaimed nor commercially dominant; many people would know her only as Lizzie McGuire, hero of the Disney Channel sitcom from the early 00s. But for the 38-year-old Duff’s first live performance in 18 years, she’s met with a sold-out crowd screaming back every word of her music like they are all universally adored hits. Duff seems overwhelmed by the rapturous reception. Fans have come from Brazil, Saudi Arabia and all over Europe, and they are often so loud you can’t hear the woman on stage.But after the shock wears off, Duff shows no signs of rust and her fierce sincerity combined with girl next door charm infuses the night with euphoria and escapism. When she jumps up and down on the stage’s sofa singing Why Not, you get the sense that this is how everyone in the crowd once sang the song in their adolescence. She’s also not afraid to poke fun at herself and her past: she brings three fans on stage to recreate the low-energy dance choreography of her 2007 single With Love that went viral on TikTok in 2021.The 17-song set expertly sprinkles five new numbers from forthcoming album Luck … Or Something in between fan favourites such as 2015’s criminally underrated Sparks and 2003’s So Yesterday to keep the mood elevated. Time has made Duff’s voice more textured and refined, adding new depth to songs like Fly and Come Clean, though the twee Someone’s Watching Over Me, a ballad about self-acceptance, is cloying.View image in fullscreenRapturous reception … Hilary Duff.Photograph: Christopher Polk/© Polk Imaging 2026The biggest noise of the night comes with the one-two encore of her new single Mature and the Lizzie McGuire classic What Dreams Are Made Of. A wild singalong ensues complete with pink butterfly confetti as a giddy Duff jumps for joy on stage. It’s an emotional conclusion that takes this devoted crowd to new levels of noisy rapture and proves that Duff could easily put music at the centre of her portfolio career.Explore more on these topicsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The modern internet was just a decade old, mobile phones were far from universal and our social lives were mostly physical – and local.In the 25 years since, technology has changed how we live in profound ways. Most people check their phone within minutes of waking and return to it on average186 times a day. Computers and the systems that sit behind them mediate every aspect of modern life, shaping how we move through the world.The time we spend with screens now dwarfs that spent interacting with others. In 2024, the average Australian spent two hours and 13 minutes a day on screen-based activities – nearly half their free time – but just 38 minutes socialising in person. Young Americans now spend70% less time attending or hosting partiesthan they did 20 years ago, and have among the highest screen time of any age cohort. Meanwhile, consistent surveys show a trend towards people, particularly men, having fewer close friends. As our reliance on technology has increased, the time we spend with others has shrunk.With the arrival of AI, our social connections are further endangered, and many people now turn to chatbots for advice or comfort instead of friends. Technology promises more connection, but in practice we’ve become more insular.Increasingly it can feel that instead of enabling our social lives, technology is controlling them – who we see, what we know and how we connect. We use it to “optimise” our time, remove inefficiencies and smooth over social frictions by removing interactions. But in doing so we risk losing a fundamental part of what it is to be human: the messy, unexpected nature of life.However, unlike wars and climate change, the antidote is almost entirely in our hands – shaped by everyday decisions to choose the human over the technological. As we enter the second quarter of this century, here are some ways in which you can “re-humanise” your life.Take out your headphonesWearing headphones in public has become a routine for many people. While headphones offer comfort and distraction, they signal we are closed off to others, reducing opportunities for casual interactions and new connections, however fleeting.The business of silence: is there a hidden cost to noise cancelling?Read moreBut it’s not only others we block out. Dr Jim Taylor, a psychologist and the author ofRaising Generation Tech, says we often use headphones to distract ourselves from our own thoughts too. “You’re caught in a netherworld where you’re both not inside your head and you’re not engaging with the world – and those are the two things that make us human: our ability to think and our ability to feel,” he says.Taking out your headphones, even occasionally, allows space for reflection, observation and connection. It opens the possibility of overhearing a conversation you relate to, listening to the sounds of nature or simply letting your mind wander. “It’s amazing what will happen when you’re open to the world – or open to yourself,” says Taylor. “But it’s difficult to do when you’re listening to a podcast.”Make better introductionsModern social life often begins on screen. Digital profiles invite us to inspect the lives – and social circles – of friends, colleagues and strangers. Before meeting someone new, chances are we may have scanned their Instagram, LinkedIn or dating profile, forming assumptions from a carefully curated snapshot of their life. Somewhere along the way, we’ve forgotten the value of a considered, human introduction as the foundation for genuine connection.Bridget Jones’s Shazza had it right when she said that makingintroductions with thoughtful detailscan go a long way: mentioning an unexpected talent or hobby, highlighting a mutual interest or sharing a funny anecdote.A well-made introduction reminds us that a complex, multidimensional person exists in front of us – and invites further questions. It’s best to avoid theMark Darcy techniqueand stick to positives that you know the other person will appreciate. Essentially, you are selling the prospect of an interesting future conversation, peppering details they can pick up on after you leave.Done well, a proper introduction will not only help others connect, but leave those we have taken the time to introduce feeling valued and seen. As the behavioural neuroscientist Dr Lynda Shaw puts it: “Feeling significant – feeling noticed – is one of the greatest gifts we can give someone. Why do we so often wait until a eulogy to say the good stuff?” If we’re lucky, that person will pay forward when introducing you in future, too.Talk to people outside your generationFor younger generations, social media is now the primary source of news and ideas, with algorithms prioritising novelty and speed. Older people tend to occupy different digital spaces, and the result is age-segregated conversations where meaningful exchange between generations is harder to sustain.This new order poses risks to all: young people lose out on insight and wisdom that can’t be found online, and older people – who already often report feeling invisible – feel disconnected. Prof Hugh Mackay, a social psychologist and researcher, says age is a form of diversity that is all too often forgotten – and intergenerational contact enriches both sides.Taking time to speak to those outside your generation can offer a new perspective and help you break out your digital bubble. It could be as simple as carving out half an hour to have a proper conversation with someone in your family or workplace. If that feels too daunting, you could try a “deeds not words” approach and invite them to an activity that you do regularly. That way there’s some structure to the interaction, but they will understand more about your life, and have the chance to meet other people too.We ignore intergenerational wisdom – and sage advice – at our peril.Say it with handwritingCommunication is easier than ever before; but while we are communicating with more frequency, it is often with less depth. Birthdays are a good example: a text message is easy; a card takes effort. Writing by hand engages more of the brain and creates emotional benefits for both giver and receiver, says Shaw. “Altruism puts the brain in one of the most pleasurable states it can be.”Signature moves: are we losing the ability to write by hand?Read moreUsing AI to write a card may save time, but it also defeats the point. The value lies in the thinking, remembering and choosing of words, says Shaw, not just the final message. Avoiding these rituals, and exercising the neural pathways they use, may make expressing emotions more difficult further down the line, Shaw says. “What we don’t use, we lose.”A birthday needn’t be the only excuse: a heartening handwritten note for someone you live with has much more impact than sending a text, revealing traces of personality in the loops and lines of your handwriting.Read – and share – poetrySure, memes are great, but oral traditions like poetry are the oldest form of social media. William Sieghart, founder of the UK-basedPoetry Pharmacy, prescribes poems to people who come to his “pharmacy” sessions with emotional ailments. He has noticed that more and more people are arriving feeling anxious and overstimulated, which he puts in large part down to phones keeping us in a state of constant alert. “Lots of people tell me that they wake up in the morning and they’re kind of in fight or flight before they open their eyes,” he says.In a world of distraction, reading a poem aloud – or to someone else – can create space for emotional honesty. “People have written about every human experience,” says Sieghart. “[A poem] will make you realise you’re not alone, you’re not mad. Even if the poem was written hundreds of years ago.” Sieghart suggests starting withthis.Avoid technological shortcutsSelf-checkouts, QR codes, video calls and chatbots are designed to save time and reduce friction. But the small exchanges they replace recharge what Mackay calls our “social batteries”.“Human beings thrive on interpersonal interaction and suffer without it,” he says. “Neuroscientists tell us eye contact is like the super highway to the emotions. You can’t get that through a screen.”Choosing to speak to strangers helps us break out our social bubbles and reminds us of the people who exist around us. We all benefit when we understand differences in others, even if they don’t align with our worldview.Many of these technological tools – like self-checkouts – were introduced by companies to save on labour costs. Lining up to use the staffed counter might take longer, but a positive, friendly human exchange will help you remember that social contact is not an inefficiency to be eliminated, it’s part of the joy of being human.Take fewer photosEarly research suggests our information-heavy media diet of videos and photos is affecting our memories. Agen Z podcasthost recently (and somewhat ironically) went viral for a sobering reflection: “I heard that our generation will be the first to die with more memories of other people’s lives than our own lives because of social media.”While cutting down on social media is an obvious choice for reducing information intake, our own photo taking habits are just as important:studies have shownthat those who took a photograph are less likely to remember a moment than those who didn’t.This doesn’t mean never taking photos. But being more intentional allows experiences to lodge more deeply in memory. Sometimes, the best way to remember something is simply to live it.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleHealth & wellbeingFriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was always time for another pint and conversationRobin CraigTue 20 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 13.13 ESTShareThe Woodbourne hotel, Isle of ManI felt eyes on me the second I stepped into the pub. It was as though we were interlopers in a sacred space – everyone turned to look. Self-consciously, I walked to a door labelled “BAR” and pushed it open, and was met by further stares at me and my female companion. Only once we had got our pints and sat down did we notice the “GENTS ONLY” sign on the wall.It was 2011 in the Woodbourne hotel, a red-brick establishment on theIsle of Man, where I was born and raised. I was barely old enough to drink but heard this pub, affectionately known as “the Woody”, had some of the best beers on the island. I didn’t know it was also one of the last holdouts of an Isle of Man where people still spoke with thick Manx accents mixed with Gaelic and knew each other’s families going back generations. It was constantly packed, with older men propping up the bar while younger groups played pool.I visited regularly in the summer before I moved away for university – always bringing a friend or two for support – and saw an Isle of Man that had been largely unknown to me. Except for a few slang words, I had been raised without Manx Gaelic, and had grown up with teachers telling me it was a waste of time to learn because “we all speak English nowadays anyway”.View image in fullscreenThe arch above the main door of the Woodbourne in Douglas.Photograph: BigTom/AlamyBut here, English mixed vividly with the Gaelic language as locals gathered around the TVs and slot machines, drinking pints of Okell’s Manx pale ale (a golden, malty beer brewed just down the road) and greeting each other withfastyr mie. It was a glimpse of somewhere with its own culture distinct from England’s, one I had only previously seen through my grandparents with their thick accents and connections to Manx community life. The Manx sayingtraa dy liooar(literally “time enough”) reigned here: nobody could be rushed; there was always time for another pint and another conversation.Over the course of that summer, we gradually found that the gents-only bar wasn’t enforced and the old signage was kept up for nostalgia’s sake. The regulars softened and stopped looking at us when we walked through the door. For a brief period, my friends and I joined them as part of this crammed, chaotic, noisy piece of Manx culture.When autumn rolled in, I left the island for London, where I would settle, study and build a life for myself. The summer I spent in the Woody stayed with me, though – I’ll always look out for Manx ales and I still doggedly try to keep my Manx accent. And now, whenever I enter somewhere full of suspicious locals, I know that they’ll warm up in time.Explore more on these topicsPubsThe pub that changed meIsle of ManfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It never goes mouldy, so am I wasting my time doing it the “proper” way?Dagna, Berkhamsted, HertsYou can’t get much sweeter than marmalade, and this is most likely the reason for both Dagna and her son’s success, despite their differing strategies. “The chance of mould developing is low because there’s so much sugar to balance the bitterness of the orange peel,” saysCamilla Wynne, preserver and author of All That Crumbs Allow. “Mould needs water to do its thing, and sugar binds to water.” She recalls a former student who, like Dagna’s son, simply ladled her marmalade into jars and closed the lids. All was fine until one day the student’s latest batch of marmalade was covered in mould: “She’d been reducing the sugar in her recipe over the years, so her method no longer worked because there was available water for mould to grow.”But back to the particulars of the family dispute. “He’s more right than she is,” says Pam Corbin, author ofPam the Jam: The Book of Preserves. “Nowadays, we have fantastic food-grade lids, which have a wax seal inside and keep preserves safer than a wax disc and cellophane would.” Some people put a wax disc under the twist-on lid, too, but for Corbin that’s a hard no: “As the marmalade cools, condensation forms on top of the paper, so you’re more likely to get mould.”What’s “most important”, however, is to use only clean new lids, Wynne says: “This will help them seal properly, and if your marmalade is sealed, you won’t be worrying about anything untoward happening.” Depending on how many jars you’re making, this can be an expensive strategy: “If you want to reuse your lids – and I do – make sure there aren’t any dents or odours,” Corbin says. “If they’re damaged or smelly, throw them out. Otherwise, pop them in a pan of water and simmer for five minutes to make sure they’re clean.”On to the jars, which is where opinions divide. “You definitely want to heat them, because that’ll make sure there’s no mould or yeast that could potentially cause problems,” Wynne says. Corbin, meanwhile, doesn’t think this is strictly necessary – so long as the jars are sparkling clean, that is. “I would warm jars only if I was making a reduced sugar preserve, because you won’t have that high temperature,” she says (the sugar is what allows marmalade to reach a high temperature). “I’m also mindful that people have done things the same way for generations, so if it makes them happy, let them do it.”What is unforgivable, though, is overcooking your marmalade, Corbin says: “It’s the biggest crime of marmalade making. When I’ve been a judge, a lot of marmalade tastes like barley sugar, because it has become too caramelised.” So how do you know it’s good to go? “When all the light, white bubbles have disappeared and it begins to look glossy on top. There will also be a slower, more relaxed rhythm to the boiling.” Finally,alwaysfill those jars practically to the brim: “I see people on Instagram filling them only halfway, but any air in the jar can bring contaminators,” Corbin warns.

It feels decadent, so it’s best served with a simple fennel salad, zingy with apple cider vinegar and mustard. It’s excellent eaten while still warm from the oven (be patient!), but even better as leftovers, because I have a soft spot for cold eggy tarts.Caramelised miso leek custard tart with apple cider vinegar fennel slawShop-bought pastry can, of course, be used, but making it from scratch is what makes this dish that much more special.Prep30 minChill1 hr 15 min+Cook45 minServes6-8For the pastry185g plain flour, plus extra for dusting1tsp salt100g cold unsalted butter, cubedFor the leeks2tbsp vegetable oil350g leeks, trimmed, halved lengthways and cut into 3cm segmentsSalt2tbsp red miso2tbsp honeyFor the egg mixture5 eggs150ml whole milk1tbsp dashi granules1tbsp sesame seedsChives, thinly sliced, to garnishChilli oil, for servingFor the slaw300g fennel, trimmed and thinly sliced or cut using a mandoline2 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, tender stems and leaves chopped2tbsp apple cider vinegar1tsp dijon mustardFirst make the pastry: in a food processor, blitz the flour, salt and butter into a breadcrumb-like consistency. With the motor on pulse, slowly add 65ml cold water, until a rough ball of dough forms. (Alternatively, sift the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl and rub in the cubed butter. Add the water slowly and mix gently to make a dough.) Wrap the dough in clingfilm or baking paper and chill for at least an hour.Put the vegetable oil in a pan on a medium heat and cook the leeks with a small pinch of salt for seven to 10 minutes, until fully cooked and starting to brown.In a small bowl, dissolve the miso and honey in two tablespoons of cold water, then pour over the cooked leeks. Reduce for a few minutes on a low heat, until the leeks are jammy and most of the liquid has evaporated, then set aside.On a floured surface, roll the pastry into a disc to fit a 20cm round loose-bottomed tin. Lay in the pastry, pressing it into the tin, then prick the base with a fork. Return to the fridge for 15 minutes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and put a baking sheet inside to heat up. Line the chilled pastry shell with baking paper and weigh it down with baking beans. Blind bake for 15 minutes, then remove the beans and paper, and bake for five minutes more, until lightly brown. Remove and trim any overhanging pastry, and turn down the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and dashi granules. Spoon the cooked leeks into the pastry shell, then pour in the egg mix. Bake for five to seven minutes, until the custard is slightly set. Sprinkle the sesame seeds on top and bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the sesame seeds toasted. Cool to room temperature.Meanwhile, make the slaw by gently massaging the sliced fennel with the remaining ingredients, then season to taste.To serve, slice and garnish the tart with chives. then serve with the slaw and the chilli oil.Ferment: Simple Ferments and Pickles, and How to Eat Them, by Kenji Morimoto, is published by Pan Macmillan at £22.

How a Chinese app exposed single people’s deepest, darkest fearsIn China, marriage and birth rates have hit record lows and many people are living in isolation. Is the Are You Dead? app just a practical response to this – or something more troubling?Amy HawkinsTue 20 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 10.46 ESTShareAfew days before Christmas, after a short battle with illness, a woman in Shanghai called Jiang Ting died. For years, the 46-year-old had lived in a one-bedroom apartment in Hongkou, a residential neighbourhood that sits along the Huangpu River. Neighbours described her as quiet. “She rarely chats with people. We only see her when she goes to and from work, and occasionally when she comes out to pick up takeout,” said a local residentinterviewed by a Chinese reporter. Her parents long deceased, Jiang had no partner or children to inherit her estate. Her lonely death sparked a debate in Chinese media about how society should handle theincreasing number of people dying with no next of kin.For Xiong Sisi, also a professional in her 40s living alone in Shanghai, the news triggered uncomfortable feelings. “I truly worry that, after I die, no one will collect my body. I don’t care how I’m buried, but if I rot there, it’s bad for the house,” she says.So Xiong was intrigued when, a few weeks later, she saw an article about an app that had suddenly gone viral, called Are You Dead? She forwarded the news to a WeChat (similar to WhatsApp) group of five fellow childless friends. “I said: ‘This is actually quite practical.’”The app, which was released by a company called Moonscape Technologies last year, has surged in popularity in recent weeks, at one point becoming the most downloaded paid-for app in China. It took off after it was discovered by users onRedNote, a social media platform that is predominantly used by women. Are You Dead? describes itself as “a lightweight safety tool crafted for solo dwellers”. Its name, which in Chinese isSileme, is a play on the name for China’s ubiquitous takeaway app, called Are You Hungry? orEleme.Ian Lü, one of the co-founders of Moonscape Technologies, says he came up with the idea for Are You Dead? while browsing on Chinese social media. “In recent years, there has been wide and heated discussion about a hypothetical ‘are you dead’ app,” Lü says. “For example, something with features like: if you don’t check in for 48 hours, someone will come and collect your body.” Lü and his partners saw a business opportunity.The concept of Are You Dead? is simple: users must check in once a day by clicking a large green button. If a user misses two consecutive days of check-ins, the app sends an automated alert to a designated emergency contact.Part of the app’s popularity may be down to its tongue-in-cheek name, although Moonscape Technologies is now reconsidering the moniker and has invited users to suggest alternatives. But it has also tapped into an anxiety in modernChinathat a person could be swallowed up by one of the country’s sprawling cities and disappear without a trace.“This app makes people feel alive,” wrote one RedNote user. It is an “interesting phenomenon that reflects and combats the loneliness of young people today”.View image in fullscreen‘A safety tool crafted for solo dwellers’ ... the Are You Dead? app.Photograph: Ng Han Guan/APThe topic of social isolation feels particularly acute in Chinese cities.Falling marriageandbirthratesmean that more people are living alone well into their 20s and 30s. Intense work cultures leave little time for socialising. And many people can’t find a job at all, which itself carries stigma and shame, and can lead to reclusiveness.In 2024, just 6.1 million couples got married in China,a record low. At the same time, 2.6 million couples filed for divorce. The trend is not unique to China but it has sparked nationwide concern, particularly as the country’s birthrate is also in decline, creating demographic challenges as thepopulation shrinkseach year. By 2030, there could be as many as 200 million single-person households,according to Chinese state media.“People lack a sense of security,” says Xiong, who lives more than 500 miles away from her parents in Henan province in central China. “Most young or middle-aged people aren’t necessarily staying in their family homes – unlike previous generations, who never left their ancestral lands.”Xiong, who is 43, started to think about the consequences of living alone after a bout of illness a few years ago that forced her to stay indoors for seven days. “At the time I thought, ‘Oh my God, if I died in this room, no one would even know.’ I used to post something on WeChat Moments every day so my parents would know that I was OK,” Xiong says, referring to the app’s public feed. Now there is an app that performs a similar function.“In modern life, everyone feels lonely,” says Zhao Lu, a clinical mental health therapist based in Xi’an, a city of almost 13 million people in north-central China. “Married people, divorced people, single people.” But as an increasing number of people decide to embrace “new ways of living” and don’t automatically turn to marriage, technology is also becoming a tool to combat feelings of isolation. Zhao thinks Are You Dead? will be helpful, “because if you’re isolated or living alone, that one quick push will help you connect to other people”.It is not just singledom that makes people lonely. For decades, China’s economic growth was fuelled by people travelling far across the country to find their fortunes in the cities. But in recent years there has been a reckoning with the psychological scars this has caused. Inan essay, Xiao Hai, a factory worker turned writer, described his time as a migrant in Shenzhen, China’s southern tech and manufacturing hub: “I was overcome with loneliness – an intense loneliness that submerged through to the concrete floor beneath my feet, splattered over the assembly line, glazed the unfamiliar faces of my co-workers below the fluorescent lights.”View image in fullscreen‘I wish there was a way for the app to say something like, “I’m alive, but I’d like help”’.Photograph: Linghe Zhao/Getty ImagesA feeling of isolation in big, anonymous cities is not unique to China. But the intensity of competition and population density in the world’s second-biggest economy means that it is possible to see the psychological effects of the urban crush “on steroids”, says George Hu, a clinical psychologist and president of the Shanghai International Mental Health Association.“There is not only isolation but anxiety, stress and a sense of helplessness,” Hu says. He points to China’s notorious“996” work culture– meaning workers toil from 9am to 9pm, six days a week – as a major stress factor, especially when coupled with the fact that the rising cost of living means that working those long hours does not necessarily guarantee the ability to buy a house or a car – markers that the older generation saw as important milestones in adulthood.One of China’s hottest buzzwords is “involution”: the feeling that people are working harder than ever, but for diminishing returns. Working long hours leaves little room for socialising or meeting a romantic partner. It’s a feeling that Lü remembers well. Now he is married with a young child and living in Hangzhou, a city in east China famed for being home to many of China’s hottest new tech talents, including AI firmDeepSeek. But a few years ago, the 29-year-old product manager was living in Shenzhen, toiling in an office job that starved him of social connection.“In Shenzhen, everyone often works overtime until very late, including weekends. You might have no plans with friends and live alone in a closed space. You feel a very strong sense of loneliness and insecurity,” says Lü. His female friends told him that sometimes they felt scared walking home alone at night.He pondered how he might come up with a solution to this problem. He says he was inspired by Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, a framework developed by the American psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1943. It proposes that after a person’s physiological needs – such as food and water – are met, the next most important need is a feeling of safety.I feel what is being reflected is not just the situation in China. This new ‘living alone’ group is a global phenomenonBut aside from providing reassurance, analysts believe that Lü and his all-male business team may have inadvertently tapped into another feeling that is specific to young Chinese women: dissatisfaction with the men in their lives.The country’s falling marriage rate is largely driven by women. China is still a highly conservative society, and many educated, professional women reject the idea of entering into a partnership where they are expected to be subservient to a man. Althoughpolitical expressions of feminism are sensitive in China, many women express their independence through their lifestyle choices. It is “feminism with Chinese characteristics,” explains Ivy Yang, a tech analyst and founder of advisory firm Wavelet Strategy, who also dubs the trend “RedNote feminism”.Many women feel liberated by that choice, but choosing not to embrace traditional family structures can also create a gap in human connection that is now being filled by technology. Yang calls this the “loneliness economy”. She points to the rising popularity of AI companions – a global trend, but one in China that is particularly popular amongwomen looking for the perfect “AI boyfriend”.The Japanese television seriesI Want to Die Alone, about a single woman in her 30s grappling with the death of her lonely aunt, wasa hit among female RedNote users in China. But psychologists say that people of all ages and genders can suffer from feelings of disconnection. Hu, the psychologist, says that isolation is a factor in the psychological problems of nearly every person who comes to him for treatment.Hu welcomes the premise of the Are You Dead? app, but he would like it to include a facility for people to call for help earlier. “I wish there was a little bit more complexity to it, a way of adding a couple more layers to say something like, ‘I’m alive, but I’d like some help.’”The bluntness of the app’s original name has caused controversy, with some people describing it as inauspicious or vulgar. Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of the Global Times, wrote on Weibo: “The app is truly a great idea – it could help so many elderly people who live alone. At the same time, I would suggest renaming it to Are You Alive? It would provide more psychological comfort.”Last Tuesday, the company announced it would bechanging its name to Demumu, a portmanteau of “Death” and “Mumu”, a cutesy suffix that connotes another popular Chinese trend –Labubus. Then on Wednesday, there was another U-turn. Ina post on Weibo, the app’s developers wrote that they would be renaming the app again, and invited followers to submit suggestions. At the time of writing, the app’s final name is undetermined, although Lü said he expects it to stick with Demumu for the time being. It has also been removed from China’s Apple App Store, and news articles about the app are being censored for reasons unclear. Lü said it was “not convenient” to discuss the app’s removal, but it may have drawn unwanted scrutiny from China’s internet regulators, who don’t like content that could be viewed as “superstitious”. On Monday, Moonscape Technologiesissued a statementwarning users against counterfeit versions of the app.Still, Lü has big plans for the future. He wants to develop a sister app aimed at elderly people, or find a way to use AI so that the app can alert a person’s emergency contact when the user is in a dangerous situation, such as a speeding car.“I feel what is being reflected is not just this kind of situation in China,” Lü says. “But rather that this new ‘living alone’ group is a global phenomenon. I hope the whole world can pay attention to the safety issues of people living alone.”Additional research by Lillian YangDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In return you’ll get a report (sometimes generated by AI) outlining your food sensitivities, metabolic fitness, and what pathogens or fungi you’re harbouring.These at-home gut microbiome tests or “GI mapping” kits are frequently promoted by influencers as a way to “hack your health” and “take control” through analysing some of the trillions of organisms that live in your digestive tract.But how much can an at-home gut test really tell you, and are they actually worth doing?Even experts struggle to interpret at-home microbiome testsProf Rupert Leong, a gastroenterologist and microbiome researcher based at Macquarie university hospital, is increasingly seeing patients alarmed by gut microbiome reports they don’t understand.Leong said depending on what is being analysed, gut microbiome testing can be “very powerful and accurate” in detecting microbial markers. But interpreting what those markers mean for an individual remains a major challenge, and different labs vary in their methodology, leading to differing results.“We are still in the infancy of understanding how to interpret them,” he said.Crunch time: are freeze-dried fruit and veg actually healthy to eat or just chips in a different form? | AntiviralRead moreIf a gut microbiome test is ordered by a specialist doctor or accredited dietitian with a clear clinical reason, sent to a reputable lab, and interpreted by someone trained to make sense of the results, it can be genuinely helpful.Leong recently saw a patient with inflammatory bowel disease and rectal bleeding who had already undergone standard medical tests. The microbiome results, in that case, helped confirm dietary issues and guide further treatment once simple and important issues had been ruled out.But these cases are the exception, he said.A healthy mix of organisms in one person could be problematic in another; “The same organism has different species and acts differently in different individuals,” Leong said.It means for the vast majority of people who order these tests online, and who may be curious about their gut health or wondering about their symptoms or foods to avoid, “there are no translatable benefits” to ordering a test, he said.Temporary dietary changes, medications or illness could all affect the results, and what those results actually mean for an individual’s health outcomes isn’t well understood.False alarms can cause distressOne of Leong’s patients who took a commercial home test came to him panicking about bowel cancer after the report suggested she had certain inflammatory markers.Leong said a colonoscopy remains the definitive test to investigate bowel polyps and cancers. The free home bowel screening test issued by the Australian government, which looks for hidden blood in stool, is an evidence-based way to detect early warning signs of bowel cancer and may prompt follow-up testing, including a colonoscopy.And while some home gut microbiome tests claim to offer insights into metabolism or inflammation, “very few experts can use these results appropriately at present,” Leong said, including gastroenterologists.This is because clinicians aren’t trained to interpret the complex outputs the tests generate, the science is still developing, and there aren’t clear guidelines on what to do with the information.The illusion of controlAt-home microbiome tests are spruiked by online influencers as a way of empowering people who want more insights into their health. But Dr Erica Zurawski, an assistant professor in environmental studies, said this encourages consumers to internalise health responsibility while giving their personal data to large for-profit companies.More kissing, less kimchi: seven surprising ways to boost your gut healthRead moreHer researchhas examined howdirect‑to‑consumer microbiomeare often pitched “as a wholesale solution to myriad health issues when, in fact, they oversimplify the complexity of the inner workings of the gut, its malleability, and the impact external factors have on it,” she said.It makes people feel they are doing something wrong, “while the underlying issues that cause poor gut health,” including the influence of harmful industries and government policies, are “side-stepped,” she said.“Thiscomplexity gets smoothed over and ignored… testing kits fail to account for things such as stress, pollution, or access to meaningful health care to address adjacent health issues.”Back to basicsSo how can you actually support gut health?Leong says: “A diverse diet, high in fibre” is a sensible place to start.Zurawski adds that governments have a responsibility to address the broader social and environmental conditions that influence gut health, including poverty, housing, pollution, and access to affordable, nutritious food.If you are experiencing gut symptoms or concerns, Leong recommends seeing a qualified dietitian or GP before jumping to expensive, at-home testing.Melissa Davey is Guardian Australia’s medical editorAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The definitive Valentino dress was patchworked of handmade lace, so light it could have been posted in an A3 envelope.Valentino, who has died aged 93, was a specialist in a high level of luxury without undue grandeur, dressing the world’s most photographed women from the Dolce Vita period of Italian cinema in the 1960s toJ-Lo at the Oscarsin the 2000s. He never led, or wanted to lead, fashion in cut, line or mood, and, although he was proud to be the first Italian couturier fully, if reluctantly, accepted by Paris as one of their own by training and aspiration, he kept a direct connection with a more personal Italian tradition of skilled dressmakers: the needs of the wearer always came first.Glamour was his metier – he had been enchanted into the business as a boy by the glittering, shimmering, robes of the showgirls processing down endless stairs in the 1941 Hollywood musical Ziegfeld Girl. Long before red carpets at film premieres and the steps of the New York Metropolitan Museum on gala night became major fashion venues, Valentino designed gowns that would have been show-stoppers on them.He was far ahead ofPariswhen the actual red carpet business took off in the late 80s.Valentino was born in Voghera, Lombardy. From his babyhood onwards, his parents, Mauro and Teresa (she named him after the silent film sensationRudolph Valentino) indulged the boy’s tastes, and later his aunt Rosa and another local dressmaker allowed him into their workrooms. From 1949, his parents funded his education at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and supported him through five years of apprenticeship in the house of the couturier Jean Dessès; then he did two more years with Guy Laroche.View image in fullscreenJennifer Lopez at her 2001 wedding to Cris Judd wearing a dress designed and created by Valentino.Photograph: ReutersValentino’s father and a fellow businessman backed his first couture studio, on the Via Condotti in Rome in 1959, and Valentino, determined to equal Parisian couture, spent without limit on fabrics, furs and French mannequins. It might have ended in bankruptcy, but in a cafe, one hot night in July 1960, he met the 19-year-old architecture student Giancarlo Giammetti. Giammetti, who had a natural aptitude for business, gave up his studies, and joined Valentino to refound the company in a small apartment on the Via Gregoriana. Gradually, they took over the rest of the palazzo.Their business was in the right place at the right time. Italian craftwork was relatively cheap, compared with France, for the making of fashion, and California for the shooting of movies. Valentino made a dress forElizabeth Taylor, visiting the then Rome studios Cinecittà for a premiere, and in 1962 Giammetti persuaded Valentino to show at the Italian collections in the Pitti Palace in Florence, which attracted American department store buyers unwilling to pay ever higher Paris premiums for the rights to reproduce catwalk designs.Valentino began to sell directly in New York in 1964, his most valued customer the widowedJacqueline Kennedy; he later made her delicate lace dress for herweddingto Aristotle Onassis. AsJohn Fairchild of Women’s Wear Dailysaid: “Valentino just wanted to dress very important, beautiful women.”Jackie O was his perfect customer, moneyed yet devoid of vulgarity, as were most of his private clients. Through the 60s and into the 70s, he was court dressmaker to the beautiful people, including the empress of Iran, Farah Pahlavi, and the Vogue editorDiana Vreeland; he dressed them all with featherweight majesty, thoughYves Saint Laurent’sbusiness partner,Pierre Bergé, once sneered at him for dressing ‘‘whores and kept women”.As Paris couture turned theatrical from the mid-70s, Valentino remained the safest salon for wealthy women, and Giammetti ensured that he and Valentino could live at a similar level to their clients through up to 42 lucrative licensing deals. Their style was high – parties, travel with a retinue to five fully-staffed, antiques-stuffed homes around the world, a yacht, a jet and, in Italy’s most turbulent years, a bullet-proof Ferrari in Valentino’s signature shade of red. “You feel cosy around them,” Joan Juliet Buck, former editor of French Vogue, said of the pair, “wondering when they’ll bring out the next quail egg.”View image in fullscreenCate Blanchett wearing a Valentino gown at the Academy Awards, Los Angeles, in 2005.Photograph: Jim Smeal/BEIAll this was more extravagant than the Parisian couturier manner. EvenHubert de Givenchynever assembled an art collection to compare with that of Valentino, who hung his beloved Bronzino portrait of Eleanora of Toledo behind his desk. In 1990, he opened an art gallery, the Accademia Valentino, in Rome, where he was, teased Giammetti, “a state power”.The history of the fashion house is best traced garment by garment, who wore it and when. His dressmaker’s good manners in physically flattering his clients brought movie-star and later pop-star custom, including Taylor, Sophia Loren,Audrey Hepburn, and Cate Blanchett, who had not a measurement or a gesture in common – “you need to know the body,” Valentino warned, “you need to know the mood of the lady, and you need a very good seamstress”.The couture ateliers lost a few million annually out of a billion-dollar turnover, but were an investment in prestige, research and development. InValentino: The Last Emperor, Matt Tyrnauer’s 2008 documentary film, the links between Valentino, his clients and the workhands who clad them are visibly close: many customers and seamstresses were with him all their adult lives, and his few key upper-level personnel stayed for decades too. The film was an unexpected pop phenomenon, and made Valentino’s retirement feel even more like the end of an era.Giammetti had persuaded Valentino to go directly into high-end ready-to-wear, menswear and accessories, and in the 90s terminated all licences except for perfume, jeans and sunglasses. In 1998, when couture houses were being transformed into brand trophies, he and Valentino were paid $300m for the company by the Italian conglomerate HdP.It was sold on in 2002 to the textile firm Marzotto Apparel:a private equity group bought itin 2007, andsold it to a Qatari consortiumin 2012. Valentino showed his final collection in 2008, but in retirement still designed for a few favoured clients, and the ballet. Otherwise, he sustained his perpetual deep tan between the yacht and the gardens of his houses, with his tribe of pug dogs and important guests.The end of his emotional relationship with Giammetti after 12 years never impaired their business partnership and friendship. From 1982, Valentino lived with Bruce Hoeksema, who was vice-president of the company until its sale. His sister, Wanda, who also worked in the business, died in 1997.Of all his Italian, American, British and French awards, he was most pleased at becoming a chevalier of the Légion d’honneur in 2006, and with his 2008 Médaille de la Ville de Paris. He remembered when the French did not believe that there could ever be serious Italian couture.Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani, couturier, born 11 May 1932; died 19 January 2026Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion industryItalyFranceCelebrityParisobituariesShareReuse this content"

In Snowdonia?” I asked incredulously. “That’s right!” came the enthusiastic reply from our newest hostel companion. We were standing in the large kitchen of The Rocks hostel in Capel Curig, a village in the north-east of Eryri national park (Snowdonia), chatting amiably while waiting for our teas to brew.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

You’ll see a sign warning about feeding them,” he said. “But even if they’re hiding and you don’t see one, it’s one of the best walks in the area.”Spotting a penguin in the Welsh mountains seemed unlikely, but that hardly mattered, least of all to my 11-year-old son, who was thrilled by the idea of a day spent hunting for penguins. And with that, our daily adventure plans were settled, inspired not by an internet search or guidebook, but by the easy exchange of recommendations that happen so often in the communal spaces of hostels.Childhood memories of communal dinners filled with laughter made me wonder why privacy was so covetedIt was our fourth and final day at The Rocks and, to my relief, we’d settled into a comfortable rhythm: exploring the mountains by day and spending evenings relaxing at the hostel with fellow residents. Initially, my suggestion to try something different for our family holiday by staying at a hostel had been met with scepticism. My husband, haunted by memories of school trips, imagined bleak dormitories with creaking iron beds and draughty communal spaces, while our sons (one teen and one tween) were unenthusiastic about shared living spaces and polite chit-chat.View image in fullscreenTravel tips are swapped over communal meals.Photograph: James VincentStill, I was eager to give it a go. Lately I’d begun to feel uninspired by holidaying in the UK. Endless scrolling through lists of private rentals – cottages, lodges, cabins – was exhausting and downright unaffordable. Seclusion, it seemed, had become highly prized and came with a hefty price tag. Yet I found myself thinking back to childhood memories of hostel holidays: communal dinners filled with laughter and nights spent tearing around with other kids. It made me wonder why privacy was so coveted.In the golden era of travel, around the late 19th and early 20th centuries, meeting new acquaintances while away was common. Think of Lucy Honeychurch’s transformative trip to Florence in EM Forster’s A Room With a View, shaped largely by her meeting the Emersons in theirpensione. Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile also reminds us how trips were once far more social affairs – even if the passengers did keep bumping each other off. By retreating into isolation, have we lost the very essence of travel: the pleasure of meeting new people; sharing stories; hearing word-of-mouth tips; and stepping outside our familiar routines?Our snug but smart private family room was kitted out with comfy mattresses, soft sheets and Welsh woollen blanketsHostels offer a gateway to those old ways of travel.First established in the UK in the 1930sto provide affordable accommodation, especially for young travellers, while also encouraging outdoor pursuits and socialising, their core purpose has changed little over time. What has evolved are the standards and the demographics. Today, private rooms are commonplace alongside bunk rooms, and guests range from solo travellers and students to families, couples and groups of friends.To my delight, standards at The Rocks were exceptional: bright and stylish interiors ran throughout, with Scandi-style wooden furniture and colourful cushions. The fire in the shared lounge was a beacon of warmth, while the firepits outside allowed us a night of stargazing and marshmallow toasting. Upstairs, our snug but smart private family room was cosy and warm, kitted out with comfy mattresses, soft sheets and Welsh woollen blankets. Even my luxury-loving eldest son was impressed.View image in fullscreenThe Rocks has bright and stylish interiors, with Scandi-style furniture and colourful cushionsBut what about the social element? Would this be an opportunity to meet like-minded folk, or just a series of awkward encounters to be endured before scuttling away to hide in our room? I needn’t have worried. Conversations flowed easily between guests, whether cooking dinner in the well-equipped kitchen, eating together in the airy dining room, surrounded by maps, games and puzzles, or gathering around the fire. There was a comforting pattern of change, with people coming and going, and new friendships forming quickly.As we hiked up Moel Siabod, with the crunch of snow underfoot and the promise of mountain doughnuts in our backpacks, I felt deeply satisfiedAfter our daily adventures, we looked forward to returning to the hostel and sharing our experiences. One evening, over cards and a glass of rum with two lads from the Midlands, we learned the recipe for “mountain doughnuts” (banana, jam and peanut butter spread between slices of bread, wrapped in tinfoil and gradually squished in a backpack during a hike). I picked up tips on thermal gloves from an army nurse who shared my despair over cold fingers, and talked 90s rave music with a couple from Spain. The children made friends instantly, disappearing for snowball fights and board games until bedtime. There was no pressure to socialise – some guests retreated to their rooms or books, others dipped in and out of communal life – and that flexibility was part of the appeal.After a challenging few years through Covid,hostelling is enjoying a quiet revival. According to Sam Dalley, founder of theIndependent Hostelsnetwork, “hostelling is in better health than ever. People want inexpensive stays where mingling is part of the adventure. There are more hostels now than at the height of the youth hostel movement in the 1950s.”View image in fullscreenA tip from another guest led to a hike on Moel Siabod in search of penguins.Photograph: Georgie DuckworthWith places such as The Rocks combining comfort with affordability, privacy with community, the future looks bright for British hostelling, proof that meeting new people and sharing experiences can still be found at the heart of travel.As we hiked up Moel Siabod, with the muffled crunch of snow underfoot and the promise of mountain doughnuts in our backpacks, I felt deeply satisfied. The trip had sparked an appreciation for something I hadn’t realised our holidays were missing; a sense of community. From now on, hostels will be my go-to for adventures like this, rather than the closed doors of private rentals. We never did see those elusive penguins, and we’re still baffled by the mysterious “Do not feed the penguins” sign perched on that remote Welsh mountainside, but who knows what adventures our next hostel stay may lead to?The Rockshas dorm beds from £36pp, private family rooms from£115.60Explore more on these topicsWales holidaysHostelsFamily holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Originally from Worcester and now living in Carpentras, France, the couple had led a nomadic lifestyle, moving house often. But in 2017, along came Julot, a big old ginger cat from next door.The couple befriended the cat after his owner was taken into a nursing home. “He became our little bundle of fun. Well, not ‘fun’ … Like older people, he was set in his ways – fussy and miserable. But he slowly became affectionate, in his way.”Julot was born in 2004. “By 2022, he was pretty much deaf and blind, though he could still navigate through his nose. He liked to drink out of a pool outside, and would use his paw to find the water. I remember when we used to leave the house for an evening or a few days away, he used to sit in the middle of the driveway with a look on his face saying: ‘Where are you going?’ And I would tell him: ‘Julot, you’re in charge.’”After a trip to the UK in April 2024, they returned to find Julot lifeless on their terrace. “It was something sad beyond words, that he died alone. The neighbour explained he had been alive in the morning, although quite weak. We wept for I don’t know how long afterwards. More even than for family deaths.”The couple buried Julot with his favourite blanket in a wooden fruit box at the bottom of their garden. “We laid out stones in the form of a ‘J’. When our children and grandchildren visit from the UK, they all want to pay tribute to him and pause for a few minutes in front of his grave.“We haven’t finished grieving really, although it’s now more reminiscences than tears. We remember his behaviours. He used to reach up and open the back door using the handle. I always used to say to him: ‘It’s cold, can you shut the door behind you, please?’ He never did that, of course.“We still feel sad. We bought an antique real-size cat sculpture for the garden and placed it in Julot’s favourite sitting place. When we leave the house, we still tell him he’s in charge.”‘I ache whenever I walk our sidewalks, remembering our afternoon ritual’View image in fullscreenWalter with Paul’s son.Photograph: Handout/Guardian CommunityPaul Kane and his wife were “in love from the first moment” they saw Walter, a French bulldog. They adopted him in the San Francisco Bay area in 2017, and would go on to have many adventures with him.“We took him on trips, hikes, car rides,” says Paul, 40, who lives in Virginia and is a web software developer. “When you share those experiences and build a bond with someone – even an animal – those aren’t just retained in your memory. They’re embedded in your soul. They’re irreplaceable.”When the couple settled in Virginia with their two young children, Walter became “a part of their early moments”.“He’s in every picture of them playing on the carpet, next to them with pleading eyes at mealtime, waiting at the stairs for them to come down in the morning (or us to come back to play with him),” says Paul. “Walter was one of a kind. He filled our daily life with laughter, love and joy. He was at once a ball of energy and also the laziest animal you’ll meet. Stubborn but loyal, loving yet watchful.”View image in fullscreenPaul and his wife, Adrian, with Walter in Yosemite national park.Photograph: Handout/Guardian CommunityWalter died suddenly aged eight late last summer. A fast-moving cancerous growth had developed around his heart, and abruptly ruptured.“When he suddenly passed, we were completely taken by surprise and devastated,” says Paul. “We had barely realised something was truly wrong with him before he left us. I was driving him to the vet, and he died on the way in the car. I am just relieved my family weren’t with me to see that. That would have been a lot, especially for our young kids.“It was – and still is – overwhelming to relive. We only wish, despite now knowing his time was limited, that we had given him more comfort in his final days, and embraced what were his final moments in totality.”Paul says they continue to mourn the loss of Walter. “To this day we look to his corner of the living room where his bed was, instinctively,’ he says. “I ache whenever I walk our sidewalks, remembering our afternoon ritual. “We think at some point we’ll be ready for another pet, but it will never replace him. There is a space in our hearts to love again, but the one for Walter will always remain.”‘I wish Womble could have lived for ever’View image in fullscreenWomble was rescued from a drain in Tehran.Photograph: Handout/Guardian CommunityGeraldine Blakewas living in Tehran in the late 1970s with her husband when a neighbour came to their door with two tiny kittens.“A litter had been dumped down a drain, and only two had been saved,” says Geraldine, 75, who lives in Worthing, West Sussex. “We took them in; unfortunately, one of them was knocked down and killed, but the other one, whom we named Womble, stayed.“Our apartment was on the outskirts of the city, and we would take long walks through pomegranate orchards, while she raced around exploring and unsuccessfully chasing the wildlife, but a couple of handclaps, a shout of her name, and she would come racing back, ready to go home. I think she thought she was a dog.“After a few years, and the revolution, we were evacuated back to the UK, but couldn’t bring her with us. Fortunately, good friends managed to get her on a plane to Heathrow, where she spent six months in quarantine. We visited her every Sunday until she was finally allowed to join us in Chiswick.“She was an amazing cat. She could recognise our car by the engine noise and be waiting on the doorstep when we got home from work. She loved going for long walks along the Thames with us, even following us into pubs, and sitting under the table until we were ready to go home.“Sadly in 1984, she died, we were devastated. My husband and I weren’t fortunate enough to have children, and I don’t believe that animals are a substitute in any way, but at the same time, I was very, very attached to Womble.“It sounds silly, but we were so close to her. We’d had cats before, and they were OK. There were nice animals, but Womble was so special and so different. It’s been more than 40 years since she died, and whenever I look at her photo on the mantlepiece, I smile and wish she could have lived for ever. I’d give anything just to see her again, walking along the garden wall.”Explore more on these topicsPetsAnimalsPsychologyDeath and dyingCatsDogsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It made me ready for lifeDylan B JonesTue 20 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareThe Glory, east London (closed 2024)In a packed pub, revellers chat, sip lager and look at their phones. Suddenly a side door crashes open, and in walks drag sensation John Sizzle, dressed as a hair-raisingly accurate Diana, Princess of Wales. She saunters demurely to a halo, fashioned from tinsel and coat hangers and stuck to the wall, stands under it, and starts lip-syncing to Beyoncé’s Halo. The crowd erupts.Just a regular Tuesday night at the Glory, the Haggerston pub that had a decade of debauchery from 2014 to 2024. I worked at a nightlife magazine at the time and was there for most of it. I loved the fact that it offered an alternative to the ripple-muscled mainstream of London gay clubbing. Nothingwrongwith rippled muscles of course, but sometimes you just want something a bit more inventive – like the saucy Spanish-inspired night “Gayzpacho” (underwear-wrestling in apassata-filled paddling pool, anyone?).I was there when they randomly decided to paper the pub’s entire exterior in gold foil. I was there for groundbreaking drag contest Lipsync1000, where many of the UK’s most infamous queens began, including Drag Race UK starBimini Bon Boulash. I was there when they served microwaved pasta in that bizarre period during Covid when licensed venues could only open if they served food. They charged £1 per meal and called it “Diana’s Delish Dish”. I wasn’t there for the New Year’s Eve party when Chelsea Clinton showed up – I’ve kicked myself ever since.You didn’t stand out if you wore outlandish clothes or acted strangely at the Glory. You stood out if you didn’t.Straight couples occasionally dropped in by accident, or were dragged along by gay friends, and they too were welcomed with open arms, if perhaps some gentle teasing of sensible jumpers or footwear.As with any pub, it had some nefarious characters. It taught me that just because someone’s wearing a sparkly sarong and a jaunty red beret, they shouldn’t necessarily be trusted. Often, it’s exactly the opposite. The east London queer scene is one of the most competitive and well-connected in the world, and comes with its share of shrewd, cutthroat manipulators. But with lovely shoes.Above all, the Glory made me ready forlife.Its colourful cast of punters and performers always kept me on my toes. Compared with most of the things that went on in its basement after midnight, life’s trials and challenges have paled in comparison. And being unshockable, particularly in our current climate, is indispensable.Explore more on these topicsPubsThe pub that changed meHospitality industryLGBTQ+ rightsDragfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photographs by Kate OchsmanTue 20 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 00.08 ESTShareTsotleho Mohale was addressing a group of people gathered on a mountainside still damp from an intense rainstorm that morning. The peaks on the other side of the steep valley were draped in cloud. Mohale was speaking in siPhuthi, a language spoken by just a few thousand people in parts of southernLesothoand the north of South Africa’s Eastern Cape province, about the plants he used and the ailments he cured as a traditional healer.The questions came from Sheena Shah, a British linguist, and were translated into siPhuthi by Mohale’s grandson Atlehang. Shah’s German colleague Matthias Brenzinger was filming the exchange. The two academics have been travelling regularly to Daliwe, a remote valley in Lesotho about 15 miles from the nearest paved road, since 2016, working with local interpreters and activists to document siPhuthi.View image in fullscreenA view of homes in Daliwe valley in southern LesothoObserving the encounter was a senior healer, Mathabang Hlaela. Initially she had refused to be interviewed, wary of foreigners stealing knowledge that she had been amassing since 1978. But after briefly disappearing into her corrugated iron hut, she re-emerged adorned with beads – a thick belt, headbands and multistringed necklaces – and declared that she too wanted to be interviewed in her native language.While siPhuthi remains under threat from the dominant Sesotho in Lesotho and Xhosa across the border in SouthAfrica, it has undergone a remarkable revival.MapMalillo Mpapa, a shop owner, started working with Shah and Brenzinger as a paid language consultant in 2019. She recalled how receptive ebaPhuthi people were to the project. “When we made recordings, they were so impressed and they were proud and willing to help,” said Mpapa, who lives in the Sebapala valley neighbouring Daliwe.View image in fullscreenThe linguists Sheena Shah and Matthias Brenzinger record the traditional healer Tsotleho Mohale speaking in siPhuthi about his work as villagers watch in Ha Sekhobe in Daliwe valleyView image in fullscreenTsotleho Mohale, a traditional healer, stands outside his home; Mathabang Hlaela, also a healer, watches a recording just made of herMpapa, 34, expressed her own pride in having worked on the project and improved her siPhuthi. “It helped me a lot, because … I was interested in how to write and speak siPhuthi correctly,” she said.About half of the world’s 7,000 languages are spoken byfewer than 10,000 people. While intergenerational transmission is more important than absolute numbers in language survival, about half of languages are at risk of extinction by the end of the century,according to Unesco.Linguists argue that language death is a tragedy. “Languages represent thousands of natural experiments: ways of seeing, understanding and living that should form part of any meaningful account of what it is to be human,”Ross Perlin, a co-director of the non-profit Endangered Language Alliance,wrotein his book Language City.While at the University of Cape Town, Brenzinger and Shah heard about siPhuthi and realised there had been no academic research on it since the 1990s. In January 2016, they set out on a month-long trip to find out where siPhuthi was spoken and whether communities would be open to working together.View image in fullscreenHerders with their donkeys in the village of Ha Sekhobe, in Daliwe valley“We really wanted not to have any agenda before this trip, because we thought it’s also important to gain trust,” said Shah, now a researcher at the University of Hamburg.The pair hiked two days to one village and found just three siPhuthi speakers, two elderly. Many people hadn’t heard of the language or were reluctant to admit that they spoke it.The researchers heard that the “purest” siPhuthi was in the Daliwe valley, home to about 1,000 people, mostly crop and livestock farmers. There, they found children speaking it. They became members of Libadla le baPhuthi, an association campaigning for the official recognition of siPhuthi in Lesotho and political representation for the community.View image in fullscreenA river bend seen from the unpaved road that connects Daliwe valley in southern Lesotho with the rest of the countryView image in fullscreenEbaPhuthi men wait for an audience with Bereng Nkuebe, the chief of Daliwe valley, outside the chief’s home in Ha Sekhobe villageSince then, the researchers have worked with about 20 local people such as Mpapa to record more than 40 hours of siPhuthi video, on everything from marriages and funerals to poems, recipes and life stories.From 2019 to 2022 they hosted workshops with about six ebaPhuthi each time to decide on an orthography – an agreed way of writing siPhuthi. They plan to publish a 3,000-word dictionary next year and are conducting a census of speakers.Outside Daliwe, in the town of Alwyn’s Kop, six of the linguists trained by Shah and Brenzinger are now translating the Bible into siPhuthi, in written and audio form. The project started in 2019 with Bible stories recorded on to solar-powered audio devices and distributed among siPhuthi speakers. The group has finished translating the books of Genesis, Romans and Luke and are partway through Matthew.For the deeply Christian community, having “the word of God” in their own language is important. The translators also noted other benefits. Phuthi Mats’abisa, who grew up in Alwyn’s Kop, said: “Before the Bible, I thought [siPhuthui] was going to perish.” He added: “At first, I felt like a nobody. Now I have pride in my own identity.”View image in fullscreenMats’eliso Tsekoa, a translator, records a portion of an oral siPhuthi Bible translation in the Bible translation group’s mobile sound booth in Alwyn’s KopDespite the growing confidence in siPhuthi, it is still endangered outside of the Daliwe valley by Sesotho and Xhosa, said Brenzinger, a research fellow at the University of the Free State in South Africa. “There is always this notion of English being a killer language,” he said. “In most cases in Africa, it’s not English or French that are threatening other languages, it’s the dominant national languages.”SiPhuthi was given a boost in August when it was made an official language of Lesotho, alongside Xhosa and sign language. It was the culmination of decades of campaigning, said Libadla le baPhuthi’s president, Letzadzo Kometsi.“I feel like my mission is accomplished,” said Kometsi, a law lecturer at the National University of Lesotho. He acknowledged, though, that the government needed to allocate resources and effort to implement siPhuthi’s new legal status, including in schools.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTranslators work to translate the Bible into siPhuthi in their office in Alwyn’s Kop; Bongani Peete, a teacher at Daliwe primary schoolCommunity members said being forced to learn in English and Sesotho, the previous sole official languages, led to children struggling in school and the ebaPhuthi’s subsequent struggles to break out of poverty. Children needed to be taught in siPhuthi in the first years of school, they said, something that is backed up by research showing that mother-tongue educationimproves learning outcomes.Bongani Peete, a teacher at Daliwe primary, said he had to punish children he caught speaking siPhuthi, as mandated by the school’s rules. “I feel so bad,” he said, looking downcast. “I need everyone to be allowed to express his or herself in his or her language.”It was news to him that siPhuthi was now an official language. “It is very good indeed,” he said, adding that he would now no longer punish children for speaking their mother tongue.Explore more on these topicsLesothoLanguageAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Checker previously spent more than a decade with the CIA as a conflict analyst;previousappointeesto the role have generally been career diplomats.Checker’s appointment comes after the Trump administration released a new USnational security strategyinNovember. That strategy outlines the administration’s foreign policy priorities: promoting far-right interests in Europe, and taking a more transactional view towards much of the rest of the world. It says the US should “transition from an aid-focused relationship with Africa to a trade- and investment-focused relationship.”The US should favour partnerships with “capable, reliable partners committed to opening their markets to US goods and services,” it says.Checker’s email elaborates further on what this strategy means, saying that in Africa “the stakes are often limited, indirect and largely negative (risk management)”.“To put it bluntly, Africa is a peripheral – rather than a core – theater for US interests that demands strategic economy,” it says. “Framing Africa as ‘strategic’ has often historically served bureaucratic and moral imperatives, not hard interests.”‘They take the money and go’: why not everyone is mourning the end of USAID – podcastRead moreIt identifies several “opportunities for engagement” for the US, among them “negotiating settlements to ongoing conflicts (eg, DRC-Rwanda, Sudan),” and says that promising areas for investment are critical mineral development and the energy sector.A former senior state foreign service official with two decades of experience in Africa who had seen the email called it “offensive and downright racist”, and said its suggestions were against US national security interests.Checker is “wildly out of touch with reality”, said Kristofer Harrison, a former senior official at the US state department and president of the Dekleptocracy Project, an anti-corruption NGO.“He’s talking about communities where the US withdrew lifesaving drugs that kept people alive. Yet, he’s concerned about messaging to those surviving that America is generous?”A diplomat from west Africa, who has worked in mediating conflicts across Chad, the DRC and beyond, said: “US humanitarian aid in the medical and food sectors has greatly alleviated the suffering of many African populations.“If aid continues, the US can provide information on its volume and usefulness to inform American and international public opinion. However, the fact that aid has been abruptly reduced or stopped is indeed creating unease. It is therefore no longer appropriate to reiterate that the US has demonstrated generosity.”Separately, last week the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which wasgutted last yearby Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”, circulated an invitation for private companies to bid on a contract to close down the agency. That invitation, also obtained by the Guardian, is for “Institutional Support for USAID Closeout”.“USAID is undertaking an agency-wide closeout effort requiring the orderly completion of statutory, regulatory, financial, and personnel obligations,” it says.The invitation offers an unspecified amount to shut down USAID and suggests the contract will extend, at a maximum, until March 2028. It bars potential bidders from hiring anyone who has previous experience working with USAID.The closure of USAID has widely been argued to be against the law, as the agency was created through an act of Congress and dismantled without congressional approval. However, a funding bill thatpassedthe US House last week attempts to codify the final shutdown of the agency.“It’s absolutely illegal,” said the former state department official. “And it’s illegal to target former USAID staff who served this country.”While the bill has yet to pass the Senate, the invitation for bids suggests the state department is nonetheless moving into a final phase of shutting down the agency.Harrison said closing USAID was “a gift to worldwide corruption and authoritarianism” and an unwise move on the part of the administration.The US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyAfricaUSAIDTrump administrationAidUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This gravely threatens the rule of law, which is the foundation of all peaceful civil coexistence.”Somewhat similarly, the statement from Cupich, McElroy and Tobin said: “we renounce war as an instrument for narrow national interests and proclaim that military action must be seen only as a last resort in extreme situations, not a normal instrument of national policy.”The statement alluded to the pre-dawn 3 January attack in Caracas that saw US forces capture the Venezuelan dictator,Nicolás Maduro, on drug-related charges. It also referred to Trump’s decision to reduce foreign aid after the start of his second presidency early in January 2025, his more recent threats to takeGreenlandfor the US forcefully if necessary, and Russia’s ongoing war inUkraine.According to the cardinals’ statement, those events together had ignited “the most profound and searing debate about the moral foundation for America’s actions in the world since the end of the cold war”.In comments attributed to him that accompanied the joint statement, Tobin said eschewing “peaceful relations among nations” risked “escalating threats and armed conflict … destroying international relations and plunging the world into incalculable suffering”.“We cannot stand by while decisions are made that condemn millions to live trapped permanently at the edge of existence,” Cupich remarked separately.McElroy, for his part, added: “In our current national debate about the fundamental contours of American foreign policy, we ignore this reality at the cost of our country’s truest interests and the best traditions of this land that we love.”In a statement on Tuesday, the White House deputy press secretary, Anna Kelly, maintained in part that “President Trump’s foreign policy is unequivocally moral”. Kelly’s statement also asserted that Trump’s actions had “made the world safer and more stable”.Trump has insisted that capturing Maduro was legal and necessary for national security. With regards toGreenland, Trump has maintained that the US needs control of the resource-rich island for its national security as well. The US military does already have a military base on Greenland, a semiautonomous region of Nato ally Denmark.The Trump administration has previously said it gutted theUS Agency for International Developmentbecause its projects were financially wasteful while advancing a liberal agenda that the president opposed. And, according to reporting from Reuters, Trump recentlysaidit was Ukraine holding up a peace deal ending the war within its borders rather than Russia, which invaded it in February 2022.The Associated Press contributedExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationCatholicismUS politicsVenezuelaGreenlandUSAIDUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

However, it added that Mancuso’s time in prison could be reduced to eight years, if he collaborated with truth and reparation activities that benefited victims of his former paramilitary group.Colombia’s decades-long internal conflict has led to several peace negotiations between the government and guerrillas and armed groups, including a 2016 peace deal with the Farc, the largest guerrilla group.Mancuso, 61, wasrepatriated to Colombia in 2024after serving a lengthy prison sentence in the US for drug trafficking. The former paramilitary leader, who also holds Italian citizenship, was denied several requests to be sent to Italy after completing his sentence in the US, where he had been extradited in 2008.In the late 1990s, Mancuso was one of the commanders of the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a rightwing paramilitary faction thatworked with drug traffickers and the country’s business, military and political eliteto sow terror and wipe out leftwing insurgencies.At least 450,000 people were killed in Colombia’s armed conflict between 1985 and 2018, according to a report published by a truth commission in 2022, including civilians, rebel fighters, soldiers and members of paramilitary groups.Mancuso’s group pushed the rebels out of some rural areas, but was accused of killing hundreds of innocent villagers.AUC began to disarm in 2003 after an agreement with the Colombian government that provided reduced sentences to its leaders. But the paramilitary group was succeeded by a second generation of rightwing militias that continue to operate in Colombia, including theGulf Clan, a group with approximately 10,000 fighters.Mancuso was freed from US prison in February 2024 and deported to Colombia, where he remained in custody for several months. He was freed in July after various courts determined there were no prison sentences pending against him.When he was repatriated to Colombia, Mancuso was named a “peace facilitator” by Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, a designation that enables him to act as a mediator in talks with armed groups.Colombia’s government is engaged in peace talks with the Gulf Clan, which the USdesignated as a foreign terrorist organisationin December.With reporting by the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was shot during the ambush and fell into the river. Another community member was injured and survived.Five of the six suspects originally charged will face trial. A sixth suspect was killed in an attempted arrest last year during which he attacked police officers with a machete, Gavancho said.Prosecutors say they have built a strong case, including forensic gunshot-residue tests and witness testimony placing the accused at the scene around the time of the killing. Investigators have also linked the suspects to individuals whom Inuma had repeatedly reported to authorities for illegal logging and drug trafficking.If the court were to hand down life sentences, Gavancho said, it would mark an unprecedented outcome in Peru over the killing of an Indigenous environmental defender. Advocates say a ruling of that kind could send a strong signal that such crimes will no longer go unpunished in Peru and farther afield in Latin America.While high-profile killings of environmental defenders in countries such as Brazil, Honduras and the Philippines have led to arrests and prosecutions, advocates say these cases have seldom resulted in outcomes seen as setting lasting precedents. The 2022 killing in Brazil of theBritish journalist Dom Phillips and the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereiraled to multiple charges but has yet to yield a ruling widely considered as precedent-setting.Legal experts say the Peruvian case could mark a rare break fromwhat is viewed as widespread impunityover attacks on Indigenous environmental defenders.Gavancho said: “This case is significant because it is the opportunity that the Peruvian state has to establish an exemplary sanction.”At least 35 Indigenous defenders have been killed in Peru over the past decade, according to Indigenous organisations and human rights groups, including Global Witness.The case has also drawn attention to the failure of Peru’s system for protecting environmental and Indigenous defenders. Inuma had been granted a security detail under a state protection mechanism created in 2021, but those measures were never implemented.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmazon rainforestIndigenous peoplesAmericasDeforestationConservationTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nor had the owners of the cables raised any concerns either, he added.In a joint letter, made public as part of the process, two spy chiefs, Ken McCallum, the head ofMI5, and Anne Keast-Butler, the head of GCHQ, conceded: “It is not realistic to expect to be able wholly to eliminate each and every potential risk.”But they went on to add that the intelligence agencies had been able “to formulate a package of national security mitigations”, by working with officials across government, that was “expert, professional and proportionate”.That conclusion was endorsed by the cross-party intelligence and security committee, but its chair, Lord Beamish, complained that the process by which spy agencies informed the decision “was not effectively coordinated”.The Labour peer said “key reports lacked the detail necessary, were dealt with piecemeal, and appeared not to have been kept up to date”.Mitigations include allowing the intelligence agencies to monitor the perimeter of the site to prevent tampering with underground cables. Access will also be retained for the emergency services in the publicly accessible forecourt.Critics of the site say its size – the embassy site would be the largest in Europe, hosting more than 200 staff – means it would become a hub for Chinese espionage and intimidation of dissidents, including from Hong Kong–and a target for large, hard-to-police protests.View image in fullscreenPeople gather outside the Royal Mint Court site on Saturday to protest against the planned embassy.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockChina has been accused of trying torecruit informants in parliament,harass Hong Kong pro-democracy activistsin the UK, suppress criticismby an academic at a British universityandengage in cyber hacking, although none of the activities are known to have been directed from its existing embassy.Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, accused Starmer of a “shameful super-embassy surrender”. The Conservative MP said the prime minister was giving China’s president,Xi Jinping, “what he wants – a colossal spy hub in the heart of our capital”.Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative party leader who is a co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: “This is a terrible decision that ignores the appalling brutality of the Chinese Communist party as it practises forced labour at home and spies on the UK and uses cyber-attacks to damage our internal security.”Downing Street countered that opponents of the new Chinese embassy were “either naive or recklessly isolationist”. Embassies were “a normal part of international diplomatic relations,” Starmer’s official spokesperson said.Reed said China had agreed to consolidate seven existing diplomatic sites into one once the new embassy was built – which MI5 has indicated would make monitoring of the site easier.Any spying on the UK, harassment of dissidents or surveillance conducted by China from the embassy site could be dealt with by “other legal processes and by various agencies” and could not be controlled “through the planning system”, Reed concluded.Dan Jarvis, the security minister, told MPs the government had seen unredacted plans for the embassy, directly contradicting a report in the Daily Telegraph earlier this month that claimed rooms were concealed in the plans Beijing had submitted.Downing St said it was “content that any risks are being appropriately managed” and that ministers were confident they knew what all the embassy’s rooms would be used for.People living next to the site said theyhoped to seek a judicial reviewif they could raise £145,000 to fund legal representation. Mark Nygate, the treasurer of Royal Mint Court residents’ association, said: “The residents are determined to keep fighting today’s decision.”Officials acknowledge the timing is helpful given Starmer’s expected trip to China next week. Beijing has made the embassy a priority in the UK-China relationship. Xi raised the matter directly with the prime minister in their first phone call in August 2024.Government insiders also hope it will give them some leverage over a reciprocal decision for the UK’s embassy in Beijing. The UK’s plans to redevelop its own outpost in China’s capital have been blocked because of the London embassy row.Explore more on these topicsLondonChinaEspionageMI5MI6Planning policyKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Kim said he had already criticised Yang over related issues during a party meeting in December and watched him closely, but found that he felt no sense of responsibility at all, KCNA said.“To speak figuratively in simpler words, he was like a goat yoked to pull an ox cart. We should see this as an incidental mistake in our practice of personnel appointment,” Kim said. “Could we expect a goat to pull a cart for an ox?”View image in fullscreenThe factory project’s troubles were more likely to be caused by North Korea’s fundamental structural problems, said one expert.Photograph: KCNA/EPAPublicly scolding and firing officials is Kim’s familiar management style. By doing so, Kim probably aimed to “create extreme tensions among senior officials” and pressure them to produce better results before the party congress, said Kwak Gil-sup, the head of One Korea Center, a website specialising in North Korean affairs.Moon Seong-mook, an expert with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, said the factory project’s troubles were more likely to be caused by North Korea’s fundamental structural problems, such as dedicating scarce resources to weapons programmes, rather than by individual officials such as Yang.“Kim Jong-un has gone all-in on nuclear and missile programmes but he’s mismanaged the economy. He’s just passing the blame for his fault to a subordinate,” Moon said.North Korea’s economy suffered major setbacks during the Covid-19 pandemic. South Korea’s central bank said North Korea’s economy grew 3.7% in 2024, but many observers say the country would find it difficult to achieve major, rapid growth due to its excessive focus on weapons programmes, its inefficient, highly centralised economy and international sanctions.Kwak said much of the benefits of North Korea’s small economic growth had largely gone to its ruling elite and weapons development sector, not to the general public, further deepening inequalities.The party congress is likely to open later in January or February, according to South Korea’s spy service.During the congress, Kim was expected to strengthen a policy of cooperation with Russia, China and other allies to bring out gradual economic developments, Kwak said.Outside experts are also closely looking at whether Kim would take steps to restart long-dormant diplomacy with the US. They say Trump’s planned visit to Beijing in April could increase prospects for a resumption of talks between the US and North Korea.Moon said Kim would probably use the congress to formally declare his stated goal of simultaneously advancing nuclear and conventional weapons programs.Explore more on these topicsKim Jong-unNorth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Chinese tourists to Japan spent a combined $3.7bn in the third quarter of last year.Each Chinese tourist spent on average 22% more than other visitors last year, according to the Japan National Tourism Organisation.The transport minister, Yasushi Kaneko, downplayed the slump in Chinese visitors, referring to the annual figure – which exceeded 40 million for the first time – as a “significant achievement”.“While the number of Chinese tourists in December decreased, we attracted a sufficient number of people from many other countries and regions to offset that,” he said. “We also hope and want to make sure that Chinese visitors will return to us as soon as possible.”The debate over how Japan should respond to a conflict between China and Taiwan has intensified since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and amid doubts over whether, under Donald Trump’s presidency, US forces would defend Taiwan.Japan has stepped up measures to defend its outlying islands in response toChinese military activitynear Taiwan, located just 100km from Japan’s westernmost island,Yonaguni, and around the uninhabitedSenkaku Islandsin the East China Sea. They are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu.Explore more on these topicsChinaJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The S&P 500 closed down 2.1% while the Dow Jones finished down 1.8%.The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 2.4%, with Amazon down 2.9% and Tesla and Nvidia both off more than 3%, wiping billions of dollars off their market values.Graph showing falling stock marketsThe UK’s FTSE 100 index dropped 0.7% on Tuesday, aftera smaller fall on Monday.InEurope, France’s CAC was down 0.6%, Germany’s DAX fell 1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB was off 1.1%.The dollar was down 0.9% against a basket of currencies.Trump’s threat to increase tariffs on US imports of goods from Germany, France, Denmark, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland have renewed economic uncertainty.View image in fullscreenHoward Lutnick said Trump uses tariffs as a way to initiate diplomacy.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, played down the likelihood of a fresh trade war. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he gave a bullish defence of US tariff policies but suggested the outcome of what he called the “kerfuffle” over Greenland was be likely to be diplomacy.“We are here to make a very clear point: globalisation has failed the west and the United States of America. It’s a failed policy. It is what the west has stood for, which is export, offshore, find the cheapest labour in the world, and the world is a better place for it. The fact is, it has left America behind. It has left American workers behind,” he said.Lutnick argued that Trump uses tariffs as “a way for him to say: ‘Hey, you know, you need to talk to us.’ Do I think the trade deals that we’ve set with Europe, with the UK, are they durable? I absolutely do … What I see happening is diplomacy and talking and at the table, rather than action, which is something I think the president cares about.”Sitting alongside Lutnick, the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the UK was also interested in its economic security – but said the US should remember who its allies are.“For all of your strengths, we do also need to preserve some of the things that the US has benefited from, in the Nato alliance, and the western alliance, not because it is the benevolent, because I believe it is in your country’s national interest.”Reeves also urged people to keep cool heads as fears mount over Trump’s push for Greenland. “We absolutely want to de-escalate,” she told Bloomberg. “The future of Greenland is for the people of Greenland.”Trump is scheduled to give a speech at Davos on Wednesday.What are Trump’s latest tariff threats and could EU hit back with ‘big bazooka’?Read moreEarlier on Tuesday, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also speaking at Davos, urged European countries not to retaliate against the US’s trade tariffs announced over theGreenlandcrisis.Referring to Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, announced in April, Bessent said: “I would say this is the same kind of hysteria that we heard on 2 April. There was a panic.“What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out. The worst thing countries can do is escalate against the United States.”But Kathleen Brooks, a research director at the broker XTB, said Bessent had failed to calm investor nerves.“Overall, this is a man-made crisis, and the continued sell-off on Tuesday suggests that US threats to Greenland and their effects on financial markets could have further to go if the situation does not de-escalate soon,” she said.Gold and silver hit record highs as investors sought shelter from the market falls.Goldrose past $4,700 (£3,500) an ounce for the first time on Tuesday, and silver hit a fresh high of $95.52 an ounce.Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that eight European countries including the UK, France and Germany,will face tariffs“until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland”. The tariffs are due to start at 10% on 1 February, rising to 25% on 1 June.Trump also added further uncertainty to global trade overnight by threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and champagne after France’s Emmanuel Macron was reported to be unwilling to join his Gaza “board of peace”.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsFTSEGoldDollarGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

She had emerged from the accident with only a minor head wound.According the Spanish media, the child and her family had been on their way home to Aljaraque, on the Atlantic coast near Huelva, after travelling to the capital to see the Lion King musical and to visit the Bernabéu stadium in Madrid.The outing had been a treat to celebrate the Christian feast of the Epiphany, which is when Spanish children traditionally receive their Christmas presents.José Carlos Hernández Cansino, the mayor of the nearby town of Punta Umbría,told the broadcaster Canal Sur: “We’d been hoping that we wouldn’t have to declare any days of mourning or to lower the flag to half mast. But then we got the call telling us that four members of the same family who were missing had been found dead, confirming our worst fears.” He said the girl’s survival was “a miracle”.View image in fullscreenSpain’s Queen Letizia visits a hospital treating people injured in the collision.Photograph: Casa de SM El Rey/Jose Jimenez/ReutersAdrián Cano, the mayor of Aljaraque, said the town was “broken with grief and almost without words of comfort”.The girl was cared for overnight by a police officer before being reunited with her grandmother in Córdoba, authorities said.As work continued to recover the remaining bodies of those who died in Spain’s worst rail crash in more than a decade, other families shared stories of what had happened to their loved ones.Alberto Garcíatold the Antena 3TV channel that one of his daughters, who is five months pregnant, was in intensive care because of serious injuries she sustained in the crash. He said doctors had placed her under sedation and on a ventilator and were monitoring the baby’s heartbeat.Relatives told El País that firefighters had pulled the woman unconscious from the wreck of the carriage after passengers smashed windows to escape from the train. Her sister, Ana, who was travelling with her and their dog, had lighter injuries. Relatives say the dog, named Boro, is still missing.Ana said she believed her sister may have been injured while trying to protect the animal. “If I can’t do anything for her, at least I hope I can find Boro,” she toldEl Mundo.Spain began three days of national mourning on Monday to honour the dead.

But on Tuesday evening the US said it believed it could work with the Syrian government against IS.Al-Hawl houses an estimated 24,000 people, mostly Syrians and Iraqis but also 10,000 from other countries, and it is unclear what will happen as Syrian government forces move in.A spokesperson for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said: “Our forces were compelled to withdraw from al-Hawl camp and redeploy in the vicinity of cities in northern Syria that are facing increasing risks and threats.” They blamed the withdrawal on a “failure of the international community”.A smaller number of female detainees – about 2,400, including Shamima Begum who wasstripped of her UK citizenship– are being held at al-Roj camp further to the north-east and still under Kurdish control.The Syrian government said it would assume control of al-Hawl camp, accusing the SDF of leaving it without guards, allowing detainees to escape. It also accused the SDF of doing the same at a prison in Raqqa from which 120 prisoners escaped, a claim the SDF denied.The withdrawal came as the Syrian government swept through north-east Syria, making unprecedented gains as the SDF lost vast swathes of its territory in just a few days. The SDF lostRaqqa and Deir el-Zouron Sunday as tribal elements defected from the Kurdish-led force and pushed it to withdraw from the Arab-majority areas.Map of Syrian territorial controlThe rapid advance of Damascus’s forces and partial collapse of the SDF almost overnight was stunning: the Kurdish-led group had controlled nearly a third of the country, with US support, since 2019. It was the biggest shift in frontlines since thefall of the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assadin December 2024.Tom Barrack, the US envoy for Syria, said on Tuesday evening the US no longer supported the SDF in the fight against IS. Though the SDF had “proved the most effective ground partner in defeating Isis’s territorial caliphate by 2019”, he said that was because there was “no functioning central Syrian state”.The US diplomat said the situation had “fundamentally changed” with the overthrow of al-Assad and his replacement by Ahmad al-Sharaa. “Syria now has an acknowledged central government that has joined the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS,” he wrote on X, meaning that “the original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired”.A 14-point ceasefire agreement signed on Sunday by President al-Sharaa and the head of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, collapsed the next day after a disastrous meeting in Damascus.However, on Tuesday night the Syrian presidency announced a four-day ceasefire with the SDF so that the 14-point agreement could be implemented. It said that if an agreement could be reached, the Syrian government would not enter Kurdish-majority cities, such as al-Hasakah and Qamishli, and that security forces would be drawn from local residents.It also said Abdi would nominate a candidate from the SDF to be the deputy defence minister, MPs for the national parliament, and lists of people to be employed in the Syrian public sector.The announcement seemed to stave off immediate further fighting between the two sides and to reassure Kurdish officials that their rights would be respected.Syrian government sources had previously accused Abdi of trying to stall the implementation of the 14-point agreement, which would turn over most of the Kurdish-led authorities’ institutions and governance to Damascus. Ilham Ahmed, a senior leader of the Kurdish-led authority, said Abdi requested a five-day grace period to implement the agreement, which was initially rejected by Damascus.“They wanted a direct handing over of everything to Damascus. However, with or without this meeting they wanted to go to war … and now their plan is to massacre theKurds,” Ahmed said on Tuesday.After the meeting, Kurdish officials, Abdi included, called for a general mobilisation across Kurdish-majority areas and to resist Damascus’s advance towards their territory. SDF media published pictures of people, young and old, holding assault rifles seemingly in preparation for a further assault.Clashes between the two sides continued on Tuesday, with shelling reported in Kobani, a Kurdish-majority area on the Turkish border, and Syrian government forces entering al-Hasakah.The areas lost to Damascus’s forces so far have been Arab-majority areas, where many residents had longstanding resentments against the SDF. The SDF has seemingly dug into areas closer to the borders with Iraq and Turkey, which are populated mainly by Kurds.If the four-day ceasefire fails and Damascus’s forces advance into Kurdish-majority areas, fighting is likely to be deadlier than in previous days. In those areas they have infrastructure, including heavy artillery, drones and underground tunnel networks.The Kurdish population view the fight as existential and have pointed to mass killings when Syrian government forces entered Sweida province and the Syrian coast last year as an example of what could happen to them if Syrian government forces took over the area.The Syrian government said in a statement on Tuesday that it would not enter Kurdish areas and that the army’s goal was “to restore stability and protect government institutions”.The SDF was for years the US’s biggest partner in Syria and together they defeated the IS “caliphate” in 2019. It is the military wing of a Kurdish statelet, an autonomous area that had its own institutions and government. Among other things, it protected Kurdish rights, which for years had been repressed by al-Assad and his father.When al-Assad fell, the SDF and Damascus came to the negotiating table, with the former seeking to retain its autonomy and the latter wanting to consolidate control over the country. Despite the signing of an agreement on 10 March last year to integrate the SDF into Syria’s army, the two sides remained at odds and occasionally clashed.At the weekend, the US urged the Syrian government to halt its advance at the dividing line of the Euphrates River, but government forces pushed on. It has since stayed silent as the government continued its campaign against the SDF.Damascus’s advance over the last week has helped it extend control over most of the country, and crucially, the country’s largest oil and gasfields, as well as key dams.Explore more on these topicsSyriaKurdsIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The discussions leading up to the vote on 18 November, and the text of the resolution, were all about the conflict.Handing control of Gaza to a Trump-run “board” for two years cut across longstanding UN principles of self-determination and national sovereignty and against colonialism. It was alsovaguer than any other UN peacekeeping resolution in modern times.Nonetheless, the Arab world and Europe decided to vote for the resolution once wording had been added to at least give lip-service to a future sovereign Palestinian state. It was the best way, their diplomats argued at the time, to keep Trump engaged inGaza, with the hope of achieving a durable peace.Two months on, there is not a single mention of Gaza in the “board of peace” charter sent out to national capitals. That document instead portrays the board as a permanent fixture to promote peace and good governance around the world. It will be “pragmatic” and “results-oriented”, it will be “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body”, and will have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”.The document does not name the “failed institutions” that the board will apparently be more nimble and effective than, but there is little doubt that these derogatory references are aimed at the UN.The use of the word “charter” itself is an echo ofthe UN Charter. That 1945 document, however, was anchored in a set of principles which were hard-earned lessons of the second world war: the primacy of non-aggression, self-determination, fundamental human rights, and the “equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”.The Trump board charter uses no such language. Most of the text is devoted to the club rules, which make the chairman (Trump himself – the only person mentioned by name) all-powerful. All other members are selected by him and can be terminated by him. The chairman (mentioned 35 times in the document) can choose when the board meets and what it discusses. He can issue resolutions off his own bat.Kremlin says Putin has been invited to join Trump’s Gaza ‘board of peace’Read moreAll other members come and go under the rules, unless they buy a life-membership for $1bn “in cash funds”, and even that does not appear to offer a guarantee against being ejected by Trump.The inequity represented by the five permanent members of the UN security council, the victors from the second world war, has long rankled the rest of the world. The use and abuse of the permanent members’ veto privilege, particularly by Russia and the US, has long paralysed the council as a body for global governance.The board of peace swaps this inequity for another that is even more unjust – a permanence of a sort that can only be afforded by rich countries with a billion dollars to spare. And in this new forum, Trump alone would have an absolute veto.While the charter has nothing to say about Gaza, the board will oversee a general executive board, and a Gaza executive board, and beneath that a “national committee for the administration of Gaza”, the highest level in which Palestinians themselves are permitted to participate. There is also to be an international stabilisation force (ISF), overseen by a US major-general.Israel objects to White House’s pick of leaders for ‘board of peace’Read moreThe board will therefore have mechanisms to further the ceasefire in Gaza, and in theory to bring peace, governance and reconstruction to the territory. But all the signs are that these mechanisms are also aimed at displacing UN agencies that have historically gone into post-conflict zones to stabilise and help rebuild stricken societies, and replacing them with profit-driven business ventures.Nickolay Mladenov, the board’s would-be “high representative” in Gaza, is a well-respected, veteran UN diplomat, but he alone will find it a hard fight to keep the UN at the heart of the process. He will be hemmed in on all sides by the money people –Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and the other billionairesbrought in from the region.It is anyway unlikely that the Gaza arm of the board – the executive, the national committee and the ISF – will have much to do in the foreseeable future. The Israeli government is resolutely opposed to moving forward with any element of the second phase of the Trump ceasefire that would bring Palestinian governance back to Gaza or give any other nation a stake or a role in the territory. For example, it has sought to rule out Turkish or Qatari participation in the ISF.Might is right: US ‘foreign policy’ held hostage to mad king Trump’s whimsRead moreThe limbo between the first and second phase of the ceasefire suits Israel. It has its hostages back, the UN agencies are being squeezed out, and it can strike any time and anywhere but without the unsustainable costs of full-scale war.For more than two million Palestinians it is an unbearable purgatory. They are still exposed to Israeli bombardment and to the elements,marooned in tents and flimsy shelterswith little prospect of going home or rebuilding.A board of peace withVladimir Putin as a candidate memberis also very unlikely to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine. Its most likely fate is to remain a vanity project, while the rest of the world is stuck with the invitation from hell. Refusal to join, as France has tried, is punished by vengeful tariffs from a petty president.Joining the board, on the other hand, involves undermining the UN, submission to Trump’s will and acquiescence in his vision of future of world governance –an imperial courtwhere vassal states pay cash and vie for the ear of the orange emperor.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyGazaUnited NationsPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The demolition marks Israel’s latest step against Unrwa, which provides aid to millions of Palestinian refugees.Roland Friedrich, Unrwa’s director in the West Bank, said the agency had been informed that demolition crews accompanied by police arrived at its East Jerusalem headquarters in the early hours of the morning. The facility had been largely unused for nearly a year because of security threats and incitement, he said, but Israeli forces nonetheless entered the compound, confiscated equipment and expelled the private security guards hired to protect the site.An Israeli flag was seen hoisted above the facility in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood, where some Israeli politicians arrived on the scene to celebrate the organisation’s fate. Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, called it “a historic day”.Israel defended the move to demolish the compound, with the foreign ministry saying: “Unrwa-Hamas had already ceased its operations at this site and no longer had any UN personnel or UN activity there.”View image in fullscreen‘The compound does not enjoy any immunity,’ Israel said.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersIt added: “The compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law.”But Friedrich called it a violation of international law guaranteeing such facilities protection and said: “What we saw today is the culmination of two years of incitement and measures against Unrwa in East Jerusalem.”Founded in 1949, Unrwa’s mandate is to provide aid and services to 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The group has for years maintained infrastructure in refugee camps, run schools and provided healthcare.A few months after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, Israeli settlers and rightwing activists protested byblocking the entrances of theUnrwa office in Jerusalem and calling for the body’s closure, following accusations by the government of collaborating with Hamas in Gaza, and with its staff facing a systematic campaign of obstruction and harassment by the Israeli military and authorities.In 2024,according to the Wall Street Journal, a US intelligence report assessed with “low confidence” that a handful of Unrwa staff had participated in the attack, but indicated that it could not independently confirm the assessment’s veracity.Nevertheless, Unrwa’s operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel – including East Jerusalem.Unrwa has recorded 382 colleagues killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the start of the conflict.View image in fullscreen‘This must be a wake-up call,’ said Philippe Lazzarini, Unwra’s comissioner general, warning this could happen to other international organisations or missions.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersThe acts of sabotage against Unrwa ultimately culminated in the demolition on Tuesday. Videos showed Israeli bulldozers destroying the compound and the facilities inside the agency’s headquarters.“This comes in the wake of other steps taken by Israeli authorities to erase thePalestinerefugee identity,” Philippe Lazzarini, Unrwa’s commissioner general, said in a statement on X. “This must be a wake-up call. What happens today to Unrwa will happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission, whether in the Occupied Palestinian Territory or anywhere around the world.”The latest action comes amid a long-running political and financial campaign against the agency. The US cut funding to Unrwa in 2018 under Donald Trump, restored it in 2021 under Joe Biden, and then paused contributions again in 2024.Israel’s ban on Unrwa has coincided with broader efforts to tighten controls on humanitarian organisations operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. New legislation requires nongovernmental groups to dismiss staff accused of activities deemed to “delegitimise Israel” or support boycotts, and to submit detailed staff lists as a condition for continuing operations.Israeli authorities warned dozens of organisations –including Médecins Sans Frontières and Care– that their licences would expire at the end of 2025. Aid groups have described the measures as arbitrary, warning that further restrictions will fall most heavily on a civilian population already facing an acute humanitarian crisis.Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestineWest BankUnited NationsAidHumanitarian responseRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

It said it had lost control of the building after what it claimed was an attack by government-affiliated fighters that killed or wounded dozens.The Syrian army confirmed the escape late on Monday and imposed a total curfew in Shaddadi, the state news agency Sana reported. It denied attacking the jail and blamed the SDF for the escapes, saying it would comb the city in search of the militants.According to Syria’s interior ministry, about 120 Islamic State detainees escaped. The Kurdish forces put the figure much higher, at 1,500.The interior ministry said security forces had recaptured 81 people after search and sweep operations in the town and surrounding areas, with efforts continuing to arrest the remaining fugitives.The clashes came less than 24 hours after Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, said his government had agreed aceasefire with the SDFand would move to dismantle the group’s decade-long control of the country’s north-east and consolidate his rule.The sudden defeat of the SDF in Syria’s north raises questions about its ability to retain control of prisons and camps housing tens of thousands of male and female supporters of IS.Fighting was also reported outside al-Aqtan prison in formerly SDF-held Raqqa, and two others in the city – Taameer and a juvenile detention centre – were said by Kurdish sources to have been emptied by local people. The Syrian army said it had arrived at al-Aqtan to secure it “despite the presence of SDF forces inside”.Many other IS detainees, originally from 70 countries including the UK, are held farther to the north-east in Kurdish majority areas, where many have been detained since the territorial defeat of the terrorist group in 2019.The bulk of female detainees and their families are being held in al-Hawl, which holds an estimated 26,000 people, and the smaller Roj camp, where Shamima Begum is housed. About 4,500 men are held at the Panorama or Gweiran prison.Map of Syria, showing areas of controlIt remains unclear who freed the prisoners in Shaddadi. The SDF claimed the armed men involved were “Damascus factions” and that several of its fighters had been beheaded.It said in a statement that the US-led anti-IS coalition did not respond despite repeated appeals for assistance to a nearby coalition base. The US military’s central command did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Kurdish-led forces backed by the US rounded up tens of thousands of people linked to IS after the group’s defeat. Washington later left responsibility for the camps to its Kurdish allies, but as US troops scale back, pressure is growing for Syria’s new authorities to take over.According to the text of the deal between the SDF and Damascus, the administration responsible for the IS prisoners and camps, as well as the forces securing them, is to be integrated with the Syrian government, which will assume “full legal and security responsibility” for these facilities.But the plan, also part of efforts to fold the Kurdish-led SDF into a reunified national military, is fraught with mistrust as manyKurdsfear the government, led by Islamist former rebels once linked to al-Qaida, could loosen controls on IS networks.Among the prisoners and detainees are an estimated 55 men, women and children from the UK, including Begum, many of whom have had their citizenship removed because of their IS links.Reprieve, a UK-based human rights campaign group, said the situation was “a reality check” for Britain’s refusal to repatriate people held in Syria. Other countries, including the US, which has repatriated 28 people, have gradually brought back many of their citizens who were otherwise held in indefinite detention.Maya Foa, the chief executive of Reprieve, said the “volatility of the current situation demands an urgent rethink”. Foa added: “The only safe thing to do is bring British nationals home and prosecute the adults where there is a case to answer.”Sharaa’s jihadist career was forged in post-invasion Iraq, where he was drawn into al-Qaida’s orbit through its Iraqi affiliate, a precursor of IS. Detained by the US in 2005, he deepened his militant ties and encountered Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who later dispatched him to Syria to set up Jabhat al-Nusra.The group rose quickly but split from Baghdadi in 2013, prompting Sharaa to first align openly with al-Qaida before severing that link in 2016 to present a more locally rooted insurgency that would ultimately become Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.Sincetoppling Bashar al-Assadin December 2024, Syria’s new leaders have struggled to assert full authority over the country. An agreement was reached in March that was to have merged the SDF with Damascus, but it did not gain traction as both sides accused each other of violating the deal.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – long hostile to the SDF – on Monday hailed the Syrian army for what he called its “careful” offensive to take over Kurdish-held areas of the country’s north-east.“The Syrian army’s careful management of this sensitive operation … is commendable. Despite provocations, the Syrian army has passed a successful test, avoiding actions that would put them in the wrong when they are in the right,” he said.Turkey sees the SDF as an extension of the Kurdish militant PKK and a major threat along the 560-mile (900km) border it shares with Syria.“The principle of one state, one army is indispensable for stability,” said Erdoğan, describing the ceasefire and the integration agreement as “a very important achievement for lasting peace and stability in Syria”.He urged that the deal be implemented as soon as possible, saying there was “no excuse for stalling or playing for time. The era of terror in our region is over. No one should miscalculate.”Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaIslamic StateKurdsnewsShareReuse this content"

Amendment 94a is the clearest and most straightforward proposal that meets the scale of the problem and the urgency parents are demanding.”It goes on: “On behalf of the millions of parents we represent through our polling and campaigning, we ask you to encourage your peers in theHouse of Lordsto support amendment 94a. This is a moment for leadership. Parents are asking for help and parliament now has a chance to provide it to protect childhood. Together we could make a real difference.”Members of the House of Lords will have an opportunity to have their say on an outright ban when they vote on the amendment brought by Lord Nash.The amendment has the support of some Labour peers, and if it passes in the Lords it would then be debated in the Commons, where61 Labour MPsrecently wrote to the prime minister urging him to bring in a ban.Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, reassured MPs on Tuesday that the government’sconsultationannounced the previous day would take only a few months and the government would have a firm position by the summer.Proposals for overnight curfews and breaks to prevent “doomscrolling” will form part of the consultation.Kendall also confirmed that “evidence-based” guidance for parents on appropriate screen time for children aged five to 16 would be produced. Guidance for parents of under-fives is expected to be published in April.Nash, a former schools minister, said he would press ahead with his attempt to legislate immediately for a ban. He said: “The time for delay and procrastination is over. Without swift action to raise the age limit for social media to 16, we are at risk of a societal catastrophe.“That is why I am urging all fellow peers to vote for my amendment, which has the backing of peers from every major party, to end the disastrous harm being done to our young people by social media and to give them their childhood back.”One of those planning to vote for Nash’s amendment is the film director and technology campaigner Beeban Kidron.She condemned the government’s announcement of a consultation, saying in a statement: “This announcement is an insult to parliament which legislated to make the online world safe, to parents and teachers, and most of all, to children themselves, who repeatedly say that they want to live in an online world where they are free to explore and learn from one another without being exploited by the tech sector,.“This hastily pulled together announcement is meant to appease the government’s backbenchers, and rescue it from losing votes in the Lords. Keir Starmer pledged to put country before party, but this is the very epitome of party before country. It is not leading; it is not governing.”Badenoch has already said the Conservative party would introduce a ban for under-16s if it was in power.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaChildrenInternet safetyHouse of LordsHugh GrantnewsShareReuse this content"

Usha Vance, 40, has already made history as the country’s first south Asian and Hindu second lady but does so again, as the first vice-presidential spouse to be pregnant while her husband served in office.“During this exciting and hectic time, we are particularly grateful for the military doctors who take excellent care of our family and for the staff members who do so much to ensure that we can serve the country while enjoying a wonderful life with our children,” the Vances said.Throughout his political career, the vice-president has repeatedlyraised concernsaboutdeclining birth ratesin the US, and in a speech at the anti-abortion March for Life rally last year,declared: “ I want more babies in the United States of America.”In aninterview last yearwith conservative commentator Meghan McCain, Usha Vance had said her husband “thinks he might like to have a fourth”. She laughed then, and added: “We’ll see where that leads.”While this pregnancy marks the first second lady to have a baby while in office, two first ladies have given birth during their husbands’ White House term. Frances Cleveland, wife of former president Grover Cleveland and the youngest first lady in history at 21 years of age, gave birth to daughter Esther in 1893. Esther was the Cleveland’s second child and was born in a bedroom on the second floor of the White House.Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of John F Kennedy, gave birth to their third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, in 1963. He was born on Cape Cod prematurely and died at just two days old.The White House congratulated the couple on social media. “The most pro-family administration in history!” the official account said.The Vances’ pregnancy announcement follows the news last month that Karoline Leavitt, the 28-year-old White House press secretary, was expecting her second child, a baby girl in May. Katie Miller, the rightwing podcaster and wife of Stephen Miller, alsoannouncedthat she was pregnant with the couple’s fourth child.The Vance children have traveled with their parents on major trips, memorably on a weeklong visit to Italy and India, where JD Vance was photographed carrying his daughter and trying to get them to pose for a family photo in front of the Taj Mahal.“I think that there’s always a limelight on the kids, and that’s both good and bad,” Vance said in an interview with NBC News last month. “Our eight-year-old really doesn’t like it. He wants to have as private of a life as possible. When we come to an event in the White House and he sees the cameras, he doesn’t love it, and so we try to keep him out of that limelight as much as possible.” By contrast, he said his five-year-old, “who’s a bit more like me” probably enjoys the attention “too much”.He also said in the interview that his marriage was “as strong as it’s ever been”, dismissing online rumors speculating otherwise.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJD VanceUS politicsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

The S&P 500 closed down 2.1% while the Dow Jones finished down 1.8%.The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 2.4%, with Amazon down 2.9% and Tesla and Nvidia both off more than 3%, wiping billions of dollars off their market values.Graph showing falling stock marketsThe UK’s FTSE 100 index dropped 0.7% on Tuesday, aftera smaller fall on Monday.InEurope, France’s CAC was down 0.6%, Germany’s DAX fell 1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB was off 1.1%.The dollar was down 0.9% against a basket of currencies.Trump’s threat to increase tariffs on US imports of goods from Germany, France, Denmark, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland have renewed economic uncertainty.View image in fullscreenHoward Lutnick said Trump uses tariffs as a way to initiate diplomacy.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, played down the likelihood of a fresh trade war. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he gave a bullish defence of US tariff policies but suggested the outcome of what he called the “kerfuffle” over Greenland was be likely to be diplomacy.“We are here to make a very clear point: globalisation has failed the west and the United States of America. It’s a failed policy. It is what the west has stood for, which is export, offshore, find the cheapest labour in the world, and the world is a better place for it. The fact is, it has left America behind. It has left American workers behind,” he said.Lutnick argued that Trump uses tariffs as “a way for him to say: ‘Hey, you know, you need to talk to us.’ Do I think the trade deals that we’ve set with Europe, with the UK, are they durable? I absolutely do … What I see happening is diplomacy and talking and at the table, rather than action, which is something I think the president cares about.”Sitting alongside Lutnick, the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the UK was also interested in its economic security – but said the US should remember who its allies are.“For all of your strengths, we do also need to preserve some of the things that the US has benefited from, in the Nato alliance, and the western alliance, not because it is the benevolent, because I believe it is in your country’s national interest.”Reeves also urged people to keep cool heads as fears mount over Trump’s push for Greenland. “We absolutely want to de-escalate,” she told Bloomberg. “The future of Greenland is for the people of Greenland.”Trump is scheduled to give a speech at Davos on Wednesday.What are Trump’s latest tariff threats and could EU hit back with ‘big bazooka’?Read moreEarlier on Tuesday, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also speaking at Davos, urged European countries not to retaliate against the US’s trade tariffs announced over theGreenlandcrisis.Referring to Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, announced in April, Bessent said: “I would say this is the same kind of hysteria that we heard on 2 April. There was a panic.“What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out. The worst thing countries can do is escalate against the United States.”But Kathleen Brooks, a research director at the broker XTB, said Bessent had failed to calm investor nerves.“Overall, this is a man-made crisis, and the continued sell-off on Tuesday suggests that US threats to Greenland and their effects on financial markets could have further to go if the situation does not de-escalate soon,” she said.Gold and silver hit record highs as investors sought shelter from the market falls.Goldrose past $4,700 (£3,500) an ounce for the first time on Tuesday, and silver hit a fresh high of $95.52 an ounce.Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that eight European countries including the UK, France and Germany,will face tariffs“until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland”. The tariffs are due to start at 10% on 1 February, rising to 25% on 1 June.Trump also added further uncertainty to global trade overnight by threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and champagne after France’s Emmanuel Macron was reported to be unwilling to join his Gaza “board of peace”.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsFTSEGoldDollarGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

TheTrump administrationhas dispatched about 3,000 federal agents to the state, in what it claims amounts to its largest enforcement operation thus far, amid a broadercrackdown on immigration.More than 2,400 people in Minnesota have been arrested in recent weeks. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officerfatally shot Good, 37, in Minneapolis earlier this month.Justice department ‘not investigating’ Renee Good killing in contrast to 2020 inquiry on George Floyd deathRead more“There is an unprecedented and outrageous attack being waged against the people of Minnesota. I have never seen anything like it in my life,” said Kieran Knutson, the president of Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 7250 inMinneapolis. “This is just an outrageous acceleration and escalation of violence toward working-class people.”The CWA, which represents workers in the state at companies including AT&T, Activision and DirecTV, is one of several local unions organizing and supporting the planned economic blackout.Others include Unite Here Local 17, Saint Paul Federation of Educators and Minneapolis Federation of Educators Local 59.Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said: “Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families. Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.”“I think what generated the idea for this action comes out of the need to figure out what we can meaningfully do to stop it,” said Knutson. “The government in the state ofMinnesotahas not offered any path towards stopping these attacks, this violence.”Knutson expressed hope that “the CEOs of all these corporations that are based in Minnesota take notice”.Large US corporations headquartered in Minnesota include Target, Best Buy, United Healthcare and General Mills. None immediately returned requests for comment.As the administration continues to send ICE agents to the Minnesota region, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has complained in recent days that the city’s police are outmanned and outgunned.Who is on the frontline of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown?Read more“Can our cops arrest them? From a legal perspective, yes,” he said during aninterviewon the Bulwark podcast. “From a practical perspective, to state the reality, it does get kind of hard when they drastically outnumber us, and they have bigger guns than we do. We don’t want to create warfare in the street.”A blackout by workers can send a message, Knutson said. “Those of us in the trade union movement understand the leverage and power that our labor has, and we are going to try and use that, because really there’s nothing else left,” he told the Guardian. “The idea is that we use our collective power to show those that rule this country and those that profit off of our labor that there’s a cost to attacking our communities this way.”Organizers held apress conferencelast Tuesday, outside of the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, to announce that the event, which will also include a march and rally in the city’s downtown at 2pm local time.“On Friday, January 23, we are calling for a day of truth and freedom,” said JaNaé Bates Imari, a minister and co-executive director of the multi-faith non-profit Isaiah. “It is a day where every single Minnesotan who loves this state and this notion of truth and freedom will refuse to work, to shop, and to go to school. What we have experienced and are experiencing in the state of Minnesota is not normal.”The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the planned economic blackout.A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said: “The fact that those groups want to shut down Minnesota’s economy, which provides law-abiding American citizens an honest living, to fight for illegal alien murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, drug dealers, and terrorists says everything you need to know.”Trump inauguration anniversary walkouts: here’s what to knowRead moreThe spokesperson reiterated the administration’sclaimthat Good “weaponized” her car before the shooting. This account of the incident has beendisputedby local and state leaders in Minnesota, as well as by eyewitnesses.Video footageof the shooting appears to show Good’s vehicle turning away from the officer as he opened fire.The DHS spokesperson added that “if these community and faith leaders wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable”, they would stand with federal law enforcement officers, whom the spokesperson claimed have faced a sharp increase in assaults and vehicle attacks. They did not provide evidence for this allegation.“These men and women are moms and dads who risk their lives on a daily basis to protect innocent, law-abiding Americans from the dangerous criminal illegal aliens in their communities,” the spokesperson added.Under the Trump administration, thousands of peopletargetedby ICE havenocriminalrecord, and numerousUS citizenshavealsobeendetained.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaBuilding powerUS economyMinnesota ICE shootingUS unionsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)EconomicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, a judge at a Delaware court rejected Paramount’s lawsuit.Paramount wants to nominate directors for election at WBD’s annual meeting, which is usually held in June, to try to derail the Netflix deal.To win what is known as a proxy fight, Paramount will have to convince enough WBD investors to cast their votes in favour of its nominees and replace existing, or new, directors proposed by WBD’s board.Paramount has also said it intends to propose an amendment to WBD’s bylaws to require shareholder approval for the proposed spin-off of the global networks business.Under the Netflix deal, the streaming company is poised to take control of WBD’s prize assets such as Warner Bros, the studio behind franchises including Harry Potter, Superman and Batman, as well asHBO, home to shows including Game of Thrones, The White Lotus and Succession.WBD’s board has twice told shareholders toreject the “inadequate” $108.4bnhostile takeover bid, calling it ​​the “largest LBO [leveraged buyout] in history” and arguing that the structure poses risks to the offer.Under the terms of its deal with Netflix, WBD would have to pay a $2.8bn breakup fee if it walked away from the agreement. Paramount Skydance’s revised offer also involved increasing its termination fee to $5.8bn, matching Netflix.However, WBD said if it were to accept the deal with Paramount it would incur $4.7bn in costs, including the breakup fee to Netflix, additional interest on debt and a $1.5bn fee for failing to complete a debt exchange.After Wall Street closed on Tuesday, Netflix announced it had surpassed 325 million subscribers in its latest quarterly earnings release, bolstered by the return of hit shows including Stranger Things and Nobody Wants This.It projected annual revenue at between $50.7bn and $51.7bn for 2026. The low end of this forecast fell below analysts’ estimates of some $51bn, and shares in the group dropped 4.5% during out-of-hours trading.Explore more on these topicsNetflixWarner BrosParamount PicturesMergers and acquisitionsTelevision industryTV streamingnewsShareReuse this content"

Its main medication is ozureprubart (Ozu), a long-acting treatment against food allergies in children and adults that is in mid-stage clinical trials in the US. It is designed to bind to and neutralise IgE, an underlying driver of food allergy reactions.Ozu is being tested on people with allergies to peanut, milk, egg, cashew or walnut. Data from the trial is expected next year, and late-stage clinical studies starting in the second half of 2027 will be focused on children and adults who are at risk.If the drug is successful in those trials, it could be launched in 2031, and is seen as a potential “blockbuster” drug – with annual sales of at least $1bn – for GSK, which istargeting total revenues of £40bnby that year.Current treatment for food allergies can involve injections every two to four weeks, which can be a significant burden, especially since most patients are children. Ozu is given every 12 weeks, and could be a new option for the 25% of patients who are currently ineligible for existing therapy.At the moment, Novartis’s Xolair – whose US sales are set to grow to more than $1.5bn this year – is the only FDA-approved antibody designed to target and block IgE.In the US, more than 17 million people are diagnosed with food allergies, and more than 1.3 million people suffer severe reactions, resulting in more than 3m trips each year to hospital and emergency care.About 6% of UK adults– 2.4 million people – have a food allergy, according to the Food Standards Agency. Peanuts and tree nuts such as hazelnuts, walnuts and almonds are most likely to cause an allergic reaction. Allergies to milk, fish and seafood are less common. Childhood food allergies persist into early adulthood, while about half of food allergies develop in later adulthood.Tony Wood, the GSK chief scientific officer, said: “The addition of ozureprubart brings another promising new, potential best-in-class treatment to GSK’s pipeline. Food allergies cause severe health impacts to patients.”GSK is paying RAPT shareholders $58 a share. The Nasdaq-listed shares jumped by 63% to $57.40 in pre-market trading, while GSK’s shares dropped by 1.5%.The acquisition gives GSK the global rights to ozureprubart, excluding mainland China, Macau, Taiwan and Hong Kong.Explore more on these topicsGSKPharmaceuticals industryAllergiesnewsShareReuse this content"

We have the ­feeling that everything is going wrong in many details and we have to try to change.”City have yet to record a league win in this calendar year and this ­painful reverse leaves them on 13 points in theChampions Leaguebefore ­Galatasaray’s visit next week to close out the league phase. For them, ­entering the last 16 directly is left in the ­balance.

The former teacher said: “It’s big for us to beat one of the best in the world. All the fans are happy, a day they will remember for the rest of their lives – a great day for a small club likeBodø/Glimt.“We all had to pull up our sleeves – that was our motto. City weren’t very physical. Tottenham was more ­physical [in the Europa League last season]. But no celebrations – we are in pre-season. That is off the table.”His men went close to a dream start. Bodø broke and Høgh, then Ole Didrik Blomberg, shot. City replied almost immediately. This time a Rayan Cherki snapshot was saved low by Nikita Haikin; Phil Foden dropped the resulting corner towards Max Alleyne’s head yet with a gaping goal he failed to connect. Erling Haaland – brought up in Byrne, about 1,800km south of here – was next put in along a right-hand channel but the No 9’s chip was gathered by Haikin.Quick GuideSalford beat Swindon to set up Manchester City tieShowSalford secured an FA Cup fourth-round visit to the Etihad Stadium with a 3-2 home win against Swindon. The hosts took a 2-0 lead with goals in the 11th and 52nd minute from Ryan Graydon on debut. Ollie Palmer pulled one back for the visitors in the 55th minute before James Ball equalised with half an hour left. Luke Garbutt, the Salford captain, curled in the 68th-minute winner from a free-kick 25 yards out. Swindon’s Ryan Tafazolli thought he had made it 3-3 late on but his strike was disallowed for a foul.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bodø showed how to finish – twice – through carbon‑copy moves. Each time City’s defence was exposed down its left, where Max Alleyne and Nico O’Reilly allowed Blomberg to scoop over crosses. Høgh’s first finish was a header, from a tight angle, to the left of goal. The second was more central, a little further out, and as composed, with his right boot.Cue bedlam from all inside the 8,000-capacity Aspmyra Stadion, minus the 404 travelling faithful who were as stunned as Guardiola was anguished. He had offered a no‑excuses line regarding the surface and the plunging temperatures; for this fishing village 80km north of the Arctic Circle the -1C at kick-off was actually temperate.When Sven Jablonski blew for ­half-time, Rodri’s moan to the ­German referee was emblematic of the state City were in – Bodø’s 31% possession telling the tale of their smash-and-grab act.Guardiola made zero ­adjustments, then watched Rodri aim a ­diagonal straight to a yellow shirt that caused him more despair. After Tijjani Reijnders’ effort went weakly into ­Haikin’s gloves, Bodø swarmed ­forward. Only Gianluigi ­Donnarumma’s leg thwarted Håkon Evjen, then the offside flag – correctly – denied Høgh his hat-trick.City were flat, bereft of spark, and when Hauge ghosted past a flailing Rodri, the ­finish beyond ­Donnarumma rocketed into the top-right corner, Bodø entered fantasy land.View image in fullscreenRodri is sent off for picking up two yellow cards inside two minutes.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockAt last City responded, Cherki’s low drive beating Haikin to his right. It came on 60 minutes, 120 seconds after Hauge’s strike. In the next 120, Rodri drew two bookings, both for similar cynical fouls to halt Bodø breaks, and off the captain went.This was all breathless. Hauge hit the bar, then Høgh had another goal wiped out for offside before Foden, again a non-factor, was replaced by Omar Marmoush. At the final whistle the delirious home support partied and City ­wandered off, schooled. The result and its buccaneering style is precisely why the sport can transfix.“Bodø played some incredible football and in the end it’s deserved,” Haaland told TNT Sports afterwards. “I don’t have the answers. I take full responsibility of not being able to score the goals I should do. I just apologise to every singleManchester Citysupporter, everyone that travelled today, because in the end it’s embarrassing.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBodø/GlimtManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

At the time, police said his death was being investigated as a possible overdose or suicide. No official cause was announced.A toxicology report obtained from the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner shows that Naroditsky had methamphetamine, amphetamine, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in his system at the time of death. The latter two compounds are the primary psychoactive ingredients in kratom, a plant-based supplement that can act as a stimulant or sedative depending on dosage.American chess grandmaster and streamer Daniel Naroditsky dies aged 29Read moreMethamphetamine and amphetamine are synthetic stimulants that can cause severe cardiovascular strain, organ damage and fatal overdoses. Kratom, which is legal in much of the United States but unregulated at the federal level, has been linked by the Drug Enforcement Administration to dependency, psychosis and withdrawal symptoms. All four substances are potentially addictive.Naroditsky was discovered unconscious by two of his close friends, Oleksandr Bortnyk, a fellow grandmaster, and Peter Giannatos, founder of the CharlotteChessCenter, where Naroditsky served as head coach and grandmaster-in-residence. Bortnyk said he went to check on Naroditsky after repeated calls and messages went unanswered.After Naroditsky’s death, Bortnyk said his friend had been deeply distressed in the days beforehand, particularly over a public dispute with former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, whom Naroditsky had once admired. Kramnik had accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games, allegations that were never substantiated and that Naroditsky consistently denied.On Tuesday, Kramnikissued a statementexpressing condolences to Naroditsky’s family while forcefully rejecting claims that his conduct played a role in the grandmaster’s death. Kramnik said that after Naroditsky died, he and his family were subjected to harassment and death threats, prompting him to consider legal action.“I deeply regret that this profound tragedy was exploited by various individuals and groups to advance their own agendas,” Kramnik said. “There can be no justification for such immoral conduct.”Kramnik added that he had previously urged Naroditsky’s friends to seek help for him after observing what he described as visible health concerns. He did not address the specific substances cited in the toxicology report.The International Chess Federation (Fide) has said it is examiningwhether Kramnik should face disciplinary measuresfor his statements about Naroditsky both before and after his death. The governing body said potential sanctions could include fines or suspension. Fide did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the release of the toxicology findings.Naroditsky’s death marked a devastating end to one of the most influential careers in modern American chess. A prodigy who learned the game as a child in California, he rose to national prominence by his early teens and became a grandmaster at 18. He later graduated from Stanford University with a degree in history and built a reputation not only as an elite competitor but as one of chess’s most gifted communicators.Known to fans as “Danya”, Naroditsky helped shape the game’s pandemic-era boom through his instructional streams and commentary on YouTube and Twitch, where he amassed more than 800,000 followers across the platforms. His ability to explain complex positions with clarity and warmth made him a fixture for beginners and experts alike.While he remained among the world’s top blitz players – winning the US Blitz Championship just months before his death – Naroditsky had also spoken openly about the psychological toll of the cheating accusations. In his final livestreams, he acknowledged feeling increasingly scrutinized whenever he performed well.Tributes poured in after Naroditsky’s death from players across generations. Magnus Carlsen described him as “a resource to the chess community”, while Hikaru Nakamura called him “the best of us”. The US Championship observed a moment of silence, while Fide has announced plans for a memorial award in Naroditsky’s name.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

I’d die for my team,” said Mendoza, the likely No 1 pick in this year’s NFL draft. “They need me to take a shot in front or the back, whatever it is, I’m going to do it, and I know they’d do it for me. That’s what makes us so close and this national championship so special.”Mendoza’s TD gave turnaround artist Curt Cignetti’s team a 10-point lead – barely enough breathing room to hold off a frenzied charge by the hard-hitting Hurricanes, who bloodied Mendoza’s lip early, then came to life late behind 112 yards and two scores from running back Mark Fletcher but never took the lead at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.“Let me tell you what. We won the national championship at Indiana University. It can be done! Words can’t describe it,” said Cignetti.The College Football Playoff trophy now heads to the most unlikely of places: Bloomington, Indiana – a campus that endured a nation-leading 713 losses over 130-plus years of football before Cignetti arrived two years ago to embark on an extraordinary revival.The pass of the century then brutal reality: the football gods won’t let the Bears have nice thingsRead moreIndiana finished 16-0 – using the extra games afforded by the expanded 12-team playoff to match a perfect-season win total last compiled by Yale in 1894.In a bit of symmetry, this undefeated title comes 50 years after Bob Knight’s basketball team went 32-0 to win it all in that state’s favorite sport.View image in fullscreenFernando Mendoza celebrates his team’s national title.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesPlayers like Mendoza – a transfer from Cal who grew up just a few miles away from Miami’s campus – certainly don’t come around often. Two fourth-down gambles by Cignetti in the fourth quarter, after Fletcher’s second touchdown carved the Hurricanes’ deficit to three, put Mendoza in position to shine.The first was a 19-yard-completion to Charlie Becker on a back-shoulder fade the pair have been perfecting all season. Four plays later came the kind of decision and play that wins championships.Cignetti sent his kicker out on fourth-and-four from the 12, but quickly called his second timeout. The team huddled on the field and the coach drew up a quarterback draw.Mendoza, not known as a run-first player, slipped one tackle, then took a hit and spun around. He kept his feet, then left them, going horizontal and stretching the ball out – a ready-made poster pic for a title run straight from the movies.“He’s so tough,” Cignetti said of his quarterback. “He keeps on getting back up. Just a great competitor. There’s no way this doesn’t get done without that kind of performance. I can’t say enough great things about him.”Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

And Osaka added another in MelbourneMorwenna FerrierTue 20 Jan 2026 12.32 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 13.22 ESTShareNaomi Osaka’s renowned 125mph serve is positively slow compared with a jellyfish’s sting, which can cover 10 to 20 micrometresin less than one-millionth of a second. But it wasn’t just the invertebrate’s speed that the tennis player was calling on when she wore a jellyfish-inspired outfit to face Antonia Ruzic of Croatia in their first-round match at the Australian Open.Entering Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena, the 28-year-old tennis player’s look consisted of a pleated miniskirt over wide-legged trousers, a wide-brimmed hat with a white veil and a parasol. Jellyfish-esque elements were also incorporated into her on-court outfit, which featured a watery turquoise and green palette and soft frills on the warm-up jacket and dress, alluding to tentacles.View image in fullscreenNaomi Osaka enters the court.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPAAs Osakatold Voguebefore the match, which she went on to win 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, the inspiration came when she was reading a storybook to her two-year-old daughter, Shai: “Reading to my daughter, discovering beauty in unexpected places like the underwater world, working with artists who care about meaning – those moments have all shaped the way I see this expression now.”‘Really weird and really beautiful’: why the jellyfish is 2024’s unexpected style iconRead moreIt is the outcome of a collaboration between Nike, Osaka, her longtime creative collaborator Marty Harper and the London-based couturier Robert Wun, who has previously dressed stars such as Beyoncé, Cardi B and Ariana Grande.Wun, who is reportedly a big tennis fan, had been inspired by Osaka for one of his previous collections. “One of the looks from myfall 2024 collectionwas inspired by her moment at court, whena butterfly landed on her face mid-match,” he told Vogue, referencing the moment during the 2021 Australian Open, a tournament she went on to win, when a butterfly landed on her face during her third-round match against TunisianOns Jabeur. Wun described it as “a simple, beautiful scene that went viral as she gently placed it aside. I wanted to revisit that story and weave it into this design and collaboration.” The design features butterflies on top of the hat and parasol.Over the years, tennis has had its share of noteworthy fashion moments. From Serena Williams in a Virgil Abloh x Nike tutu dress at the 2018 US Open to Suzanne Lenglen and her hemlines toAnne White, who wore a white catsuitto play at Wimbledon in 1985, andwas told not to wear it again. In recent years, heralded by Jannik Sinner wearing a duffel bagcovered in Gucci’s GG monogramfor his changing room to court walk at Wimbledon, the idea of tennis having its own version of a catwalk has been cemented. The NBA has its“tunnel fashion”, with players dressing to the designer nines to walk into the arena before a game, the Premier League has its bus-to-dressing-rooms runway, and all tennis tournaments have the changing-room-to-courtside saunter.View image in fullscreenSerena Williams in action at the 2018 US Open.Photograph: Juergen Hasenkopf/BPI/ShutterstockOsaka is aware of tennis’s sartorial chops.Speaking to Vogue, she said: “When I look back at the players who came before me, I think about how those moments – those looks – have become memories that live forever. So much of the time, other people get to write our stories for us.” Of her jellyfish-inspired ensemble, she added: “This felt like a moment where I could write a little bit of my own.”But this feels like it broke new ground. As Vogue noted: “Haute couture has never been worn in this way in a live sports setting.”Despite having toyed with style in the past – perhaps most playfully via bedazzledLabubudoll keychains worn to her matches – this feels like Osaka’s most dramatic style moment yet. Speaking to Vogue of a newfound confidence with clothes,Osaka said: “Fashion, for me, really opened up when I stopped thinking about how it would be received and started thinking about how it made me feel. The biggest shift really has been realising that style doesn’t have to be loud to be powerful. It can be quiet, emotional, layered. That realisation changed everything for me.”View image in fullscreenNaomi Osaka in acton against Antonia Ruzic.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPABut, Osaka to one side, the jellyfish is also a (supporting) star of the show, and it’s not the first time the otherworldly ocean creatures have had a moment of heightened popularity on land.In 2024, jellyfish inspired everything from haircuts to lamps to makeup and couture dresses.Their silhouettes are a gift to spectacle. As scientist-turned-science writer Juli Berwald, author ofSpineless: the Science of Jellyfish and the Art of Growing a Backbone, told the Guardian in 2024, around the time of the “jellyfish trend”: “Anyone with a sense of aesthetic would have to pause and say: ‘Wow, what is that?’” Plus, their grace of movement feels like something a tennis player might want to replicate – not to mention that signalling you have a sting – which can’t be bad from a sports psychology point of view, either.Explore more on these topicsNaomi OsakaAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Talks about the Greenland crisis were held informally on the sidelines of an event organised to celebrate the Hungarian football federation’s 125th anniversary, in the knowledge that a unified European response may be required should Trump seek to escalate the situation.Growing sense of embarrassment at Fifa over Donald Trump peace prizeRead moreFootball’s authorities have been reluctant to offer public responses to a fast-moving situation that threatens the territory of Denmark, aUefamember. But the demand for a reaction will intensify if Trump does not back down, particularly as the US will host 78 of the 104 games during the World Cup in June and July.Some senior figures believe military aggression to takeGreenland, which Trump has refused to rule out, would be the tipping point for a Uefa-led boycott or other major steps in protest at the US administration.Fifa’s leadership, who have forged close ties with Trump’s government, are thought to deem such a development unlikely at this point. Calls for a boycott have reared up in recent days, the German politician Jürgen Hardt suggesting recently that it would be a last-resort option and a petition in the Netherlands nearing 90,000 signatories by Tuesday evening.View image in fullscreenLocals play football in Ilulissat, Greenland. The territory has unsuccessfully applied to join both Uefa and Concacaf.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesThose present in Budapest are understood to have been united by deep concern about Trump’s actions, to an extent not previously seen during his presidency. There is a recognition that this is a critical moment for Europe’s security and broader future. The majority of football federations are likely to be guided by their governments’ responses to events around Greenland, although some sources have pondered how a more proactive approach would work. There is a sense that, should one of the continent’s bigger FAs make a stand, others would follow.Discussions are likely to continue, although no definitive steps emerged from the talks, with the situation fast-moving. Uefa’s executive committee will next meet formally in Brussels on 11 February, the day before the governing body’s annual congress.One item unlikely to be on the agenda next month is a dramatic acceptance to Uefa of Greenland, which is not a member of any confederation.The territory’s longstanding ambition to join was thwarted by a statute change in 2013 that forbade the acceptance of non-independent regions, but a fresh alteration has not been considered at this point. Greenland remains isolated in football terms after Concacaf, the confederation for North, Central America and the Caribbean, rejected an application to join last year.The Guardian reported on Sunday thatFifa insiders feel a growing sense of embarrassmentover the “peace prize” presented by Gianni Infantino to Trump in December. Fifa said in response that it stood by the award and noted “the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado]has given her medal to President Trump”.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026UefaFifaDonald TrumpGreenlandWorld CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

While Ellis said she had not heard of any such talks personally, she appeared to be open to the tournament being played in the Middle East.Qatar in talks with Fifa to host first Women’s Club World Cup in January 2028Read moreSuch a move could be controversial, not least given Qatar’s stance on LGBTQ+ rights and the extensive number of openly LGBTQ+ players and coaches working in the women’s game. When asked whether Fifa would have to consider women’s football’s prominent LGBTQ+ identity when choosing host locations, Ellis said, in comments reported by the Times and the Telegraph on Tuesday: “Certainly. I’m going to put my personal hat on.“There are over 500 bills in the US with anti-gay legislation on them. That was last year when I started researching. I say that because I also think more broadly, we all have to look at how we can continue to create different perceptions.“I think sport is a powerful conduit to do that. That’s just me putting my [personal] thing on. I will assure you that, but I also come from the US. Right now, there’s a big light being shone on that. I’m very, very careful not to throw stones in glass houses. We certainly will look at all of the bidding that comes in.“Sport has an incredible ability to transform, educate, and enlighten. I think the more people that can have access to this incredible game and see women play it, it’s for the betterment of everybody. That’s my personal opinion.”Ellis, who was born in England and is an American citizen, won the World Cup twice as the US women’s national team head coach, in 2015 and 2019.Asked about Qatar – which hosted the men’s World Cup in 2022 but has little history with the women’s game – as a possible women’s football host, Ellis responded: “I’ve not heard anything about that region at my level. There’s a bidding process the council has to vote on it. We will decompress, get this thing off the ground very quickly. The 2027 tournament hasn’t been decided, let alone 2028. We want to get as many people interested in this to want to host it. I think that would be pretty cool.“We’ve got to look at where we can visibly grow the game and have the most impact.”A smaller-format competition, the new women’s Champions Cup, organised by Fifa, gets under way on 28 January in London, as a precursor to the larger 2028 Club World Cup. The Concacaf champions Gotham FC, last year’s Libertadores Femenina winners, Corinthians, the European champions Arsenal and the African Champions League winners ASFAR are all taking part in the semi-finals. The final will be staged at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium on 1 February.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody had given Tottenham any hope afterthe Premier League disasterhere against West Ham on Saturday, one which came coated in vitriol for Thomas Frank. The fans had demanded his immediate removal as the manager, only for him to stagger on.The execution was stayed. But here wereBorussia Dortmund, the Bundesliga’s second-placed team, who had lost only three games all season, to apply the final cut.Gabriel Jesus stakes claim at Inter as Arsenal celebrate qualification in styleRead moreFrank could see the bones of his squad – 13 players unavailable, only 11 established outfielders from which to select. Yet Spurs rebelled. Frank rebelled. And when it was over, he could reflect on having taken a huge step towards direct qualification into the Champions League’s last 16.It was a fourth home win out of four for Spurs in the competition – and a fourth clean sheet into the bargain. Wasn’t this stadium supposed to be a problem?Xavi Simons was the star turn, shrugging off the pain of the swollen ankle he sustained against West Ham, and he had support around him. Starting with the excellent Wilson Odobert.The game was shaped in part by Daniel Svensson’s harsh red card for Dortmund in the 24th minute but Spurs were ahead by then courtesy of Cristian Romero. When Dominic Solanke – on his comeback to the starting XI after an injury-ravaged season – looked as though he had fluffed a straightforward finish only for the ball to rebound home off his trailing foot, Spurs felt it would be their night.Frank has a distance to goto convince a sceptical fanbaseof his worth and it was noticeable that there was not much applause for him as he departed the pitch. He will probably settle for no boos. The road ahead continues to look precarious – on to Burnley on Saturday. It feels that Tottenham cannot dispense with him before that.View image in fullscreenReferee Glenn Nyberg shows a red card to Borussia Dortmund’s Daniel Svensson during the first half.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I’m very happy,” Frank said. “Two big glasses of red will be necessary. But I am very aware we need to keep this consistency. The big thing is to build on this with a performance and win against Burnley.”Frank changed his system again, lining up with three central defenders, mirroring how Dortmund set up. It was Destiny Udogie, who was back from injury, on the left of the trio, Djed Spence at left wing-back. They would emerge with honours.It looked like an inspired move at the outset. Spurs tore out of the blocks, with Spence throwing down the gauntlet to the Dortmund right wing-back, Yan Couto. Spence had the size, strength and skill to trouble him while Simons and Odobert were determined to make their moves; to be direct. Simons’s first-time passes were especially easy on the eye.The breakthrough goal swelled an unexpected feelgood factor. Spence won a corner after another surge around Couto and when Serhou Guirassy could only half clear, Odobert swung at the dropping ball and missed. He was quick to react, quicker than Julian Brandt and blasted over a low ball. It was made to measure for Romero, who swept home.It was a golden first half for Frank and Spurs, everything going their way. From the red card to Solanke’s lucky finish. Svensson knew what was coming when the referee, Glenn Nyberg, a fellow Swede, was advised to go to the pitchside monitor. Svensson had taken a heavy touch and he stretched out a leg in a bid to recover the ball. He swiped and missed, going into the side of Odobert’s knee instead. It was one that looked worse on the replays.Bodø/Glimt give Manchester City one hell of a Champions League beatingRead moreThe Spurs fans rubbed their eyes in disbelief. Guglielmo Vicario took a poor touch on 21 minutes and had to clear for safety but Spurs were winning so no harm done. There were cheers upon the half-time whistle, the knowledge that Frank’s team could have been further ahead. Simons had two decent sightings before the interval.Solanke could smile broadly after his first goal of the season. Odobert had danced away from his man to cross low and Solanke had a tap-in. Except he got himself into a tangle, the attempted flick going into his front foot, bouncing back off his trailing one and ricocheting in.Niko Kovac made changes for the second half, introducing Julian Ryerson at left wing-back and Emre Can into central midfield. The 10 men stabilised. It was possible to feel a few nerves among the home support and Frank did not need to lose Lucas Bergvall to injury. On came the 17-year-old Jun’ai Byfield for his debut at right wing-back. Pedro Porro moved into midfield. Byfield was safe and solid.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank needs to translate Tottenham’s Champions League form into wins in the Premier League.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSpurs dug in because the fatigue levels rose, Simons leading by example. He launched into one tackle on Couto and whipped up the crowd. When he later bought a yard inside the area to work Gregor Kobel, there was a smile on his face.Randal Kolo Muani, on as a substitute, was denied one‑on‑one by Kobel but it was about whether Dortmund could do anything at the other end.Apart from a stoppage-time header from Nico Schlotterbeck which Vicario tipped over, they created nothing. Porro could not finish when he ran clear at the very last. Spurs had done more than enough.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueTottenham HotspurBorussia Dortmundmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A seventh win out of seven ensured Mikel Arteta’s side will head straight into the last 16 of this competition as one of the two top seeds after Gabriel Jesus scored twice – including their 19th goal of the season from a corner – to see off last year’s beaten finalists.It means that as well as getting one back over an Inter team that theylost to 14 months ago, Arsenal have surpassed their longest winning streak at this level. WhileManchester City’s surprise defeat in Norwayin the earlier kick-off had removed any jeopardy about them progressing, this was more evidence of the ruthless streak Arsenal have developed under Arteta. The only blot on the copybook in a fourth successive away game in four different competitions was Petar Sucic’s equaliser in the first half after Jesus had given Arsenal an early lead, although this was all about the Brazil striker even after the substitute Viktor Gyökeres sealed the points late on with a classy finish.Solanke eases Spurs past 10-man Borussia Dortmund to offer relief for FrankRead moreHaving just returned from 11 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, Jesus said on Tuesday that he wanted to fulfil his ambition of winning trophies with Arsenal. With his team seven points clear at the top of the Premier League and still in both domestic cup competitions, he will never get a better opportunity.“It’s a dream night,” said an emotional Jesus. “When I was a kid. I watched a lot of Serie A, so to be here in this stadium and score here – I had tears in my eyes because I always dreamed of being here.”Arteta was also full of praise for the 28-year-old and hopes the competition between him, Gyökeres and the returning Kai Havertz to start up front can inspire them to end the season with silverware.“We’ve been missing Gabi a lot,” he added. “I think he’s going to raise confidence levels in the teams because we now have different profiles in that position, like we have with the wingers in other positions. And the fact that those players are playing at that level gives the team a great impact as well in the game. It will only make us better.”Arsenal’s defeat by Inter in the group stages last year was still on Arteta’s mind in the buildup to this match, with a controversial penalty awarded against Mikel Merino proving decisive on that occasion. Despite the temptation to go strong in a bid to gain some revenge, he made seven changes to the side that drew with Nottingham Forest but still saw his players produce one of their most impressive performances of the season.Manuel Akanji had questioned whether Arsenal could be considered the best team in Europe beforehand, with the former City defender suggesting Bayern Munich are the team to beat this year. He may feel differently after the Serie A leaders were given a torrid time by Jesus and the outstanding Bukayo Saka.View image in fullscreenGabriel Jesus gives Arsenal an early lead with an acrobatic finish.Photograph: Ciancaphoto Studio/Getty ImagesThis grand old stadium is due to be demolished after Inter and their neighbours, Milan, purchased it from the city council in November and there was a cauldron of noise to greet the teams before kick-off. But it was Arsenal who seized the initiative immediately. Jesus was inches away from connecting with Jurriën Timber’s cross in the second minute and it was the same combination that found the breakthrough. Eberechi Eze’s pass into the penalty area was deflected into Timber’s path and his scuffed shot was diverted in by the alert Jesus, who was being played onside by Luis Henrique.Inter were level within eight minutes after William Saliba blocked a goal‑bound shot and it fell perfectly into the path of Sucic, whose strike took a tiny deflection off Martín Zubimendi’s heel to give David Raya no chance. Incredibly it was only the second time they have conceded in this year’s competition. Yet parity did not last for long. Arsenal went back in front when Leandro Trossard headed Saka’s corner against the crossbar and Jesus was on hand to snaffle the rebound.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres gets in on the act with a fine finish in a reminder of the depth of Arsenal’s striking resources.Photograph: Fabrizio Carabelli/PAThe home supporters felt they should have been awarded a penalty in the second half when Lautaro Martínez went down in the box under pressure from Saliba but the Portuguese referee was not interested. Compared with previous seasons, Saka has been rested far more in this campaign due to concerns over his workload and the benefits have been clear to see in recent weeks. A brilliant cross from the England forward picked out Trossard, only for his volley back across goal to miss the target.Saka was guilty of dallying when put clean through by Jesus and a last-ditch tackle from Alessandro Bastoni saved Inter. The substitute Pio Esposito almost made them pay when he found space inside the Arsenal area as Inter tried to step up the pressure. However it was Gyökeres who made sure of the victory when he latched on to a long ball from Gabriel Martinelli and beat Yann Sommer from outside the area to send an ominous warning to the rest of Europe.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueInternazionaleArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was something of a statement too, and not just in the goals scored but the reaction to them. Nine days afterXabi Alonso’s sacking, six after their captain said they had hit rock bottom withCopa del Rey eliminationand three after the protest of a generation, white hankies and whistles greeting the players and even the president, there were songs and support at last as Real Madrid defeated Monaco 6-1.Kylian Mbappé, Franco Mastantuono and Jude Bellingham all scored, while there was an own goal from Monaco’s Thilo Kehrer. More significantly still, the man who had been at the centre of the storm made three of the six goals and smashed in a superb strike of his own. And ifVinícius Júnior, who had stood accused before the game and stood with the MVP trophy at the end of it, wasn’t entirely ready to share his moment with fans yet, his first goal here since October saw teammates come to his side. He then hugged his new coach, Álvaro Arbeloa, who claimed that was the embrace of the whole of Madrid.Solanke leads Tottenham past 10-man Dortmund to offer relief for FrankRead moreCelebrations from his teammates were more demonstrative, speaking to what they had been through. Mbappé had marked the first of his two by asking for forgiveness, while Bellingham stepped round the keeper to add the sixth and celebrated with a drinking gesture following rumours of his supposed off-field habits and his part in Alonso’s fall. He had already called those “a load of shit” and, smiling now, his on-pitch response was even more pointed, and done from a position of power, at the end of an impressive performance.“A lot of people say a lot of things,” he told TNT after the game. “There are two ways you can take it: you can cry about it and moan or send a lawyer or you can just roll with it and enjoy it. I know the truth. I know what really goes on in my personal life, what I give. It’s nice to have a bit of a joke.”There was a smile too as Bellingham looked back on Saturday, when he and his Madrid teammates had been whistled for 90 long minutes. “It was a little bit different, yeah,” he said. “It’s not always very helpful and it’s not the nicest thing in the world. But the fans are entitled to their opinion, and the way we have to react is the way we have the last two games.”For Vinícius in particular, Saturday had been an ordeal and although the pain remained he reacted with a superb display here. The moment he had stormed off the pitch and down the tunnel during theclasicoin October had been seen as the beginning of the end for Alonso andagainst Levante he heard– shockingly loud and clear – what supporters thought. That he carried the blame, becoming an easy scapegoat, had hurt. “We have to support Vini,” Mbappé had said on Monday and now they did when the Brazilian had dribbled through the Monaco defence and hit a sensational shot into the top corner on 63 minutes.That was the fifth of what had been a fun night – there have been too few of those – and the Bernabéu erupted. Vinícius didn’t go towards the supporters; instead he went back to the centre circle head down, where teammates gathered. “The last few days were very complicated; I don’t want to be in the spotlight for what I do off the pitch,” he said afterwards.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham (right) plays to the crowd after scoring Real Madrid’s sixth goal.Photograph: Rubén Albarrán/Shutterstock“It hasn’t been the easiest week.” Mbappé had said. This on the other hand was, a first public apology coming early. They hadn’t been playing five minutes when Mastantuono and Fede Valverde teed up Mbappé to sweep in his tenthChampions Leaguegoal of the season. As he celebrated, he raised his hands in prayer position.Monaco put up little resistance, even if Folarin Balogun shot wide and Ansu Fati skied a shot over the bar from six yards. At the moment when it seemed Madrid were losing control they scored the second, soon reasserting themselves again. It was superbly constructed, too. A pirouette from Eduardo Camavinga found Arda Guler, who turned the ball into the run of Vinícius. With the outside of his boot, he played it across for Mbappé to score and make a point of signalling the passer.Something had shifted, seen too in moments when things went wrong. The shackles fell, as Bellingham put it: Vinícius, he said, needs to feel the love. And although some whistles met Vinícius losing the ball with a turn, they were immediately drowned out by applause and support. Fans had concluded that they too could help the healing and the third and fourth followed early in the second half, Vinícius creating both. First he found Mastantuono to steer in, then Kehrer turned his cross into the net.Vinícius maintained an unusual and conspicuous low profile in the celebrations, but from behind the goal came chants of his name which got even louder when he got the fifth, the Brazilian heading into the comforting embrace of his teammates. And although Madrid did concede through Jordan Teze, a sixth came too, Bellingham raising a smile and a glass.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridMonacoKylian MbappéVinícius Júniormatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 33-year-old’s Anfield future was shrouded in doubt before his departure for Morocco, having accused the club of throwing him under a bus in response to poor results and claiming his relationship with Slot had disintegrated.Edwards stuns Liverpool with Burnley equaliser as Szoboszlai pays the penaltyRead moreThe forward’s long-term position atLiverpoolmay still be uncertain but Slot said any lingering issues are not on his part and gave a clear indication that Salah will come straight back into the side for the Champions League match in France. A win in Marseille would secure Liverpool’s place in the knockout stages.Slot said: “There has been one moment in the season where I decided not to play Mo and one moment where I decided not to take him to the game [the win at Inter that followed Salah’s explosive interview]. For all the other games he’s been in the squad. He was the first substitution against Brighton, so there’s never been an issue for me, and the first time he’s able to be in the squad again, he is. Let’s see the lineup tomorrow if you still think there’s an issue.”Liverpool are unbeaten in the 12 matches since Slot firstdropped Salah at West Hambut the head coach said the team had missed the prolific forward’s influence. “I am really happy and pleased he is back,” Slot said. “In his absence I think we have done OK in terms of hardly conceding any chances and creating more and more chances. If you create more and more, then it is really helpful to have Mohamed Salah.“There has only been one player who scored more for this club but I don’t think I can still play Ian Rush!” Roger Hunt also scored more goals for Liverpool than Salah, albeit with some in Division Two. “It is really helpful to have him back. We will never know but the amount of chances and ball possession we had against Burnley we would usually score more with Mo.”Ibrahima Konaté has not travelled to Marseille because of a family matter. Slot was bluntly asked whether he felt under more pressure now that Xabi Alonso was out of work and, bizarrely, whether the former Liverpool favourite and target had been in contact with him.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai has denied disrespecting Barnsley during their recent FA Cup tie as talks continue over a new contract at Liverpool.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images“Yes,” Slot said. “He called me and said: ‘What do you think about the team because I am going to take over in six months? Can you tell me a little bit more?’ Maybe he takes over tomorrow. No, no. This is one of the weirdest questions I ever got. What is there to say?“I am working here for a little bit more than one and a half years and I really like my work over here. We won the league last season, struggled more in the league this season, that is obvious, so what is there left to say?”Dominik Szoboszlai has confirmed talks are progressing over a new contract but said no decision has been reached over his future.The Hungarian struck the bar with a penalty on Saturday during the 1-1 home draw with Burnley, which capped an awkward week for the midfielder who was accused by the Barnsley head coach, Conor Hourihane, of being disrespectful in Liverpool’s FA Cup win against the League One side. Szoboszlai, however, denies that was the case and insisted the slip that handed Barnsley their goal was a genuine error.He said: “For me, personally, it’s a tough one. I made a mistake against Barnsley but I have to make it clear it wasn’t disrespectful in my opinion and I would do the same against Arsenal, [Manchester] City and against Chelsea as well. I didn’t want to give it back to [goalkeeper] Giorgi [Mamardashvili]. I wanted to keep going but I tried to pretend that was playing it back, just to make it clear.“Against Burnley I missed a penalty but I’m going to keep on going, I’m going to take the next one and I’m going to score I’m pretty sure.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

The France striker is understood to have agreed terms with Juventus but the Italian side failed to reach an agreement with Palace over a loan that would include an obligation to buy at the end of the season.Premier League top scorers 2025-26: who is leading race for golden boot?Read moreJuventus are believed to have offered up to €30m (£26m), with Palace holding out for €40m. The Italian club are thought to be targeting Fenerbahce’s Morocco striker Youssef En-Nesyri instead, leaving the door open to Villa.Villa are in the market for a forward after selling Donyell Malen to Roma last week and are deciding whether to bid for Mateta. Only four players have scored more goals in the Premier League than Mateta since the arrival of Oliver Glasner as Palace manager nearly two years ago and the 28-year-old would add much-needed firepower to Villa’s squad.Unai Emery’s side have also been in talks with Roma over a move for Tammy Abraham, who is on loan at Besiktas. That has been complicated by the fact Roma do not have a recall clause for the former Chelsea striker and Besiktas have a conditional obligation to make his move permanent at the end of the season. Abraham spent a season on loan at Villa when they were in the Championship in 2018-19 and is thought to be keen to return to the Premier League.Palace, who remain in talks with Angers over a fee for the 19-year-old striker Sidiki Chérif, were interested in signing Guessand in the summer from Nice before he opted to join Villa for about £30m. The Côte d’Ivoire forward has started only six Premier League games and recently returned from the Africa Cup of Nations. Palace are understood to have inquired about his availability, with Guessand capable of playing wide or through the middle.Jørgen Strand Larsen of Wolves is another target should Mateta depart this month, and Palace are monitoring Andoni Iraola as a candidate to replace Glasner when he leaves in the summer. The Bournemouth manager is out of contract at the end of the season and has attracted interest from other Premier League clubs.Ethan Nwaneriis poised to joinMarseilleon loan until the end of the season, with Arsenal keen to allow the England Under-21 midfielder to depart given he has barely featured this season.Nwaneri has played 165 minutes in the Premier League, having excelled in his breakthrough campaign, when he scored nine goals in all competitions. He has not appeared in the league since the end of November, when he came on in the north London derby.Arsenal were initially reluctant to allow him to leave given they are still in four competitions but it is understood they have recognised Nwaneri needs game time. Crystal Palace and West Ham are believed to have also shown interest in a loan but Marseille, coached by Roberto De Zerbi, have emerged as his expected destination after positive talks with the Premier League leaders over the terms of a deal.The French side are to pay a loan fee but there will be no option to make his move permanent at the end of the season, with Nwaneri considered one of Arsenal’s brightest talents. Hesigned a new five-year dealin August after strong interest from Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund.The 18-year-old is with the Arsenal squad for their Champions League game at Inter on Tuesday and is expected to complete his move this week.Oleksandr Zinchenkoalso looks poised to leave, with Ajax in talks over a permanent deal for the Ukraine international.

The same would apply to cases where the wrong team had been penalised for an offence leading to a card. On corners, decisions can be reviewed if they were clearly wrong, provided the check “can be done immediately and without delaying the restart”.Ifab said the new rules were “specific extensions” of the VAR system and that it did not support expansion of VAR’s remit, arguing it should remain restricted to decisions involving goals, penalties, red cards and mistaken identity. The changes were backed at the body’s annual business meeting on Tuesday, and will probably be ratified at the organisation’s AGM next month.They were among a series of measures announced by Ifab, with most focused on limiting disruptions to play, a growing concern among lawmakers and competition organisers across Europe. There will also be a 10-second limit imposed on players for leaving the field when substituted.The news of greater VAR powers is unlikely to be welcomed by supporters, with frustration over the video technology showing no signs of abating despite many attempts to improve its processes.Last week there was afive-minute delayin the Carabao Cup tie between Newcastle and Manchester City after semi-automated offside technology – brought in to speed up decisions – failed because the system was unable to identify the location of the ball in the lead-up to a City goal which was eventually overturned.Explore more on these topicsLaws of footballVideo assistant referees (VARs)newsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday he was also ordered to pay £650 of costs and a £114 victim surcharge.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sentencing Dalal, the district judge Hina Rai said: “The nature and tone of the highly sexualised content was distressing and caused her to be fearful of her surroundings and affected her daily life.”In a victim impact statement Höbinger said the events had affected her performance on the pitch and added: “This incident has meant I now struggle to sleep. I live on my own, and being on my own at home I become anxious and scared – any noise I fear [he] may have found out where I lived.“Although I am in the public eye I do not feel it is acceptable to receive sexually explicit messages. I do not feel that it is acceptable that women’s football is sexualised and disrespected. No woman, no matter what her job, should have to put up with this kind of behaviour.”Dalal travelled to a Liverpool fixture in Manchester last February and was spotted by the pitch after the game. The court heard that he admitted this in a police interview but said he had been mentally unwell.His defence lawyer, Daniel Lister, said Dalal was of previous good character but was experiencing a psychotic episode at the time he was contacting Höbinger, and said Dalal had been seen barefoot and preaching sermons in the street.Explore more on these topicsLiverpool FC WomenWomen's footballWomen's Super LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

We said that after Leicester who are a strong team who played well here and we still won.“I thinkMillwallplayed well enough, they’re in very good form, and are a strong team who have a good idea about what they’re doing.

Ipswich leapfrogged Middlesbrough by a point, before Boro play on Wednesday.The hosts struck after eight minutes, with Clarke’s low effort into the bottom corner of the goal his ninth score of the season. Jens Cajuste spun in the City half and fed the winger who darted inside and finished across City’s Czech goalkeeper Radek Vitek from inside the penalty area. Ipswich stretched their lead in the 55th minute when Iván Azón picked up a headed clearance from Dara O’Shea and squared the ball to Clarke who fired past Vitek.Jannik Vestergaard’s 90th-minute equaliser deniedWrexhama win that would have put them within a whisker of the playoff places asLeicesterheld them to a 1-1 draw. Lewis O’Brien had fired Wrexham in front in the 63rd minute, no less than they deserved for a dominant second-half display in which Leicester rarely managed to break out of their own half. However, Vestergaard scored at the end with only Leicester’s second shot after the break. The result leaves Wrexham ninth, two points from the top six, while Leicester – without a clean sheet in their past 22Championshipgames – drop to 14th.View image in fullscreenMilutin Osmajic is shown a red card during Preston’s defeat against Hull.Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty ImagesLiam Millar scored against his former side before Oli McBurnie rounded offHull’s thumping 3-0 win againstPrestonin style.

The defender Akin Famewo doubled the lead just before half-time with a well-taken second before McBurnie acrobatically put the icing on the cake, scoring his 10th league goal of the season in the 53rd minute.A late red card for Milutin Osmajic, following a scuffle with McBurnie, simply rubbed salt in the wounds for Paul Heckingbottom.Derbyboosted their playoff ambitions with a rare win in London, 2-1 at lowlyCharlton. Macaulay Gillesphey’s own goal and Bobby Clark’s second-half strike made it back-to-back away wins for John Eustace’s side despite a goal for the hosts from Tyreece Campbell and a late red card for Matt Clarke. It was Derby’s seventh victory on the road this season, and their first in the capital since 2021.West Bromwere plunged into a relegation battle as the improving Norwich won 5-0 at the Hawthorns. Oscar Schwartau put Philippe Clement’s side ahead in the 16th minute, and a desperate first half for Eric Ramsay’s side was followed by second-half goals by Ali Ahmed (49), the half-time substitute Anis Ben Slimane (69), Ben Chrisene (73) and Mathias Kvistgaarden (90).Albion have now lost four Championship games in a row and have endured eight defeats in their past 10, Norwich moving to within a point of their hosts.Zan Vipotnik’s double helpedSwanseato secure a 3-1 home victory to pile more pressure on theBlackburnmanager, Valérien Ismaël. Vipotnik made it 15 goals in all competitions this season, with 13 of those coming in the Championship. But the Slovenian’s goals – together with an own goal by Rovers’ Connor O’Riordan – means it is just one win in 13 matches for Ismaël.

Ducksch broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute and Furuhashi sealed City’s first league win on the road since October with a second goal in stoppage time. The rock-bottom Wednesday hit a post through Bailey Cadamarteri early in the second half, but their winless league run was extended to 21 matches – the longest in the club’s history and also a record in the Championship era.The Wednesday players are still waiting to learn who their new owners will be after being placed in administration in October and docked 18 points in total. Henrik Pedersen, the manager, said: “I think, for all human beings who don’t know what’s happening in the future, there is a question in your head. And when you have a question in your head, you’re thinking a lot, and we all know that the best performances are when you are in the moment.“But how the players can put all this to the side and just perform, it’s amazing.

Larsson, who came on for Elias Achouri, saw his penalty saved by the keeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic but the Swede got to the rebound first and equalised a minute later.

Once upon a time aSix Nationssquad announcement would have topped the agenda across the country; on Tuesday it felt like a semicolon in a much bigger narrative. Even Wales have never selected seven players whose club is in imminent danger of being axed by their own union.The bare facts of the situation are increasingly stark for all involved. The existing owners ofOspreys, Wales’s most successful region of the past two decades, have just been nominated controversially as the preferred bidders for Cardiff, potentially clearing the way to reduce the number of Welsh professional sides from four to three. The internecine politics have become so increasingly toxic that Steve Tandy, the national head coach, had to plead for rugby‑related questions at his lunchtime squad announcement.The Breakdown | England prepare to reveal Six Nations hand with Borthwick aware of ticking clockRead moreGood luck with that. Barely had Tandy, a distinguished former Ospreys player and coach himself, completed his media duties in a soggy Vale of Glamorgan than a statement was being issued by the Ospreys squad on social media, accusing their owners and the Welsh Rugby Union of leaving them in the dark.“We struggle to believe the most successful Welsh team to exist with the biggest history is on the brink of nonexistence,” read the statement, making clear the players had yet to receive any notification of any kind. “We will continue to play for the fans and for the people who have stood by the Ospreys over the years.”The local Swansea West MP, Torsten Bell, also weighed in on X, accusing the WRU of behaving “disgracefully from start to finish” and suggesting legal action could follow, with Swansea council keen to keep the Ospreys in the city.This is a saga showing few signs of an amicable resolution: support is being canvassed for a potential extraordinary general meeting of the union while the WRU’s leading officials are also due to appear in front of a parliamentary select committee on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenSteve Tandy must focus on lifting his Wales players’ mood amid the domestic crisis.Photograph: Kian Abdullah/Huw Evans/ShutterstockAccording to Bell they will need “to justify their chaotic decision-making” which is fast escalating into a full-blown civil war with thefuture of Welsh rugbyat stake.The Welsh fly‑half legend Jonathan Davies believes it would be “a disaster for Welsh rugby” if an Ospreys‑Cardiff merger goes ahead, wondering how it would enhance the game in the Ospreys’ catchment area, which includes Aberavon, Bridgend and Maesteg, as well as other tribal heartlands such as Neath and Swansea.Trapped in the middle, likeWarren Gatland before him, is the unfortunate Tandy, a decent rugby man who would love to be attacking the Six Nations without any off-field distractions. Instead he is being left to try to fire a cannon from a desperately wobbly canoe, with the seven Ospreys in his squad in limbo regarding their club’s future.They include his squad captain, Dewi Lake, who has already signed for Gloucester, and the fly-half Dan Edwards, who recently turned down an offer from Leicester to re-sign with the Ospreys. The other five are Gareth Thomas, Harri Deaves, Kieran Hardy, Owen Watkin and Reuben Morgan‑Williams, with Tandy promising to do everything in his power to help players worried about their situation: “There is lots of history with every club. Whoever you represent, it’s going to hurt and there will be frustration and anger. One thing we can’t do is run away from it or pretend it’s not happening. If the players have got something to share, if they’re seeking more clarity or anything they want to talk about, then we have to be open.”Tandy’s task would also be easier if Wales were in a more buoyant place on the pitch. They have won just two Six Nations matches in their past four championship seasons and will be battling to avoid a third wooden spoon in a row. Their opening game this year is against England at Twickenham and the bookmakers have them at a distant 100-1 for the title. As Tandy wryly observed: “The bookies don’t often get it too far wrong, do they?”Quick GuideTownsend turns to France-based forward duoShowThe Scotland head coach, Gregor Townsend, has opted for experience and reliability by recalling forwards Jonny Gray and Dave Cherry for the Six Nations.In a 40-man squad of few surprises, the France-based pair were among the most notable inclusions given that they had not featured for the national team since last year's championship.Cherry, 35, was Scotland's first-choice hooker in the 2025 Six Nations but appeared to have drifted out of contention after joining French second-tier side Vannes in the summer and then being omitted for the autumn series. The Bordeaux lock Gray started four of the Scots' five championship matches last year but was not selected for either the summer or autumn campaigns.\"Experience with Dave,\" Townsend said, explaining the return of the forwards. \"He was a bit of a glue player for us around his set-piece and in attack and defence. He missed the summer tour with injury and we decided to look at different options in November. On form, Dave probably should have been in the November squad.\"Jonny hasn't had that many opportunities [at Bordeaux], but he's actually in really good form. He's looking fit and sharp, his work-rate is outstanding. Again, someone who played really well last year's Six Nations. He's someone that has played well for us and we can rely on him if required during this championship.\"Townsend and his experienced team have been the subject of scrutiny after back-to-back fourth-placed finishes in the Six Nations and a poor autumn campaign.\"I don't really think in those terms,\" he said when asked if he felt under extra pressure.\"I think I'm so privileged to be going into another Six Nations. I can't wait to be working with the players again. When I see the team, I see the players in really good form, it excites me for what's coming up ahead.\"Notable omissions include Andy Onyeama-Christie, Cameron Redpath, Alex Samuel and the uncapped Gregor Hiddleston.PA MediaScotland squad:Forwards (23): Ashman, Bayliss, Bradbury, Brown, Cherry, Cummings, Craig, Darge, Dempsey, Douglas, M Fagerson, Z Fagerson, Gilchrist,  Gray, McBeth, McConnell, Millar Mills, Rae, Ritchie, Schoeman, Sutherland, Turner, Williamson.Backs (17): Burke, Dobie, Graham, Hastings, Horne, Hutchinson, Jones, Jordan, Kinghorn, McDowall, Russell, Rowe, Smith, Steyn, Tuipulotu (capt), Van der Merwe, White.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.All he can do is extend a warm welcome to uncapped newcomers such as Leicester’s Gabriel Hamer‑Webb and Bath’s Louie Hennessey, pray the decisions to omit players such as Tommy Reffell, Rio Dyer and Jake Ball do not come back to bite him, and try to concentrate on things he can vaguely control. “The focus for us would be on our team getting better. I can’t control the odds, I can’t control England, I can’t control lots of off-field stuff.“I know there’s lots going on off the field but, ultimately, the better we get and the more support we have, the more we can produce something on the field and hopefully alleviate some of that other stuff.

It is understood that the Fifa executive has also been in discussions with the IFA.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Aida camp stands next to the West Bank separation barrier and was home to 7,244Palestinerefugees in 2023, according to UN agency for Palestinian refugees. The pitch, laid in 2021, is the only one in the camp and is used regularly by members of the community, including girls who have represented Palestine at youth level. It became the focus of global attention this month after it was reported that Israeli authorities had served notice that the pitch was to be removed because, the Israel Defense Forces said, it was built unlawfully.“We can confirm that theUefapresident has been in contact with the Israel football federation regarding the preservation of a football pitch in a refugee camp in the West Bank,” Uefa said. “We take the opportunity to thank the president of the federation, Moshe Zuares, for his efforts to help protect the site from demolition. We hope the pitch can continue to serve the local community as a safe space for children and youth.” Zuares is a member of Uefa’s executive committee.The change of direction by Israeli authorities comes amid consistent pressure on football’s governing authorities to take action against the IFA. A ban on the country and its clubs from taking part in Uefa competitions was believed to be on the verge implementation last autumn before the latest ceasefire in Gaza was agreed.Fifa is also under pressure to resolve a long-running inquiry into allegations that teams based in illegally occupied Palestinian territory have been allowed to compete in the Israeli league.Explore more on these topicsFootballPalestineIsraelWest BankUefaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, another coaching source is reportedly over with the Tennessee Titans hiring San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.Hafley replaces Mike McDaniel,who was fired earlier this monthafter going 35-33 in four seasons. The Dolphins also fired longtime general manager Chris Grier during the season. Saleh spent this season as the San Francisco 49ers’ defensive coordinator, his second stint in that job after spending three-plus seasons as coach of the New York Jets. He did not have a winning season with the Jets and was fired after a 2-3 start in 2024, going 20-36 overall. But the 46-year-old still had a strong reputation around the league and was a sought-after candidate in this busy coaching cycle.“Playing for him was such a blessing. He’s a defensive mastermind,” 49ers cornerback Deommodore Lenoir said earlier Monday. “I think he’s one of the best to do it.”Buffalo Bills fire head coach Sean McDermott after latest playoff failureRead moreDolphins owner Stephen Ross praised Hafley in Monday’s statement that confirmed his hiring. “I believe great things are ahead for the Miami Dolphins with Jeff Hafley leading the way,” Ross said. “Jeff is an accomplished coach with a proven track record as a leader and motivator. He has tenacity and grit, while at the same time establishing trust with his players in order to get the most out of them.”Hafley, who spent two seasons in Green Bay, met with the Dolphins for a second interview earlier on Monday before he was offered the job. He will rejoin new GM Jon-Eric Sullivan in Miami.The 46-year-old Hafley left his job as head coach at Boston College in 2024 to become defensive coordinator in Green Bay, where he worked with Sullivan for the past two seasons. Hafley also coached San Francisco’s defensive backs from 2016-18 after spending two years as Cleveland’s secondary coach.Sullivan, formerly Green Bay’s vice president of player personnel, spent 22 seasons with the Packers before becoming the Dolphins’ GM.“Jeff is a man of integrity, intellect and great passion who players will buy into and play for,” Sullivan said. “He has a vision for the kind of team we will be and the ability to motivate them to move in one direction on the path towards that goal. I’m thrilled to go on this journey with him and together we will build a winner that this organization deserves.”Under Hafley, Green Bay’s defense ranked in the top 10 of theNFLin yards per play (5.0), yards per pass play (6.01), goal-to-go percentage (68.9) and quarterback hits (98). Packers players, who spoke highly of Hafley, had been preparing for the possibility he would become a head coach. He also interviewed for Tennessee’s coaching vacancy.“That shit would suck,” Packers safety Javon Bullard said this season. “But, you know, that’s the beauty of this profession. That’s the sad part about this profession but it’s also a beautiful thing too. You want everybody to succeed and level up, because that’s the same thing with somebody here going to get a new contract somewhere else.”The hiring of Hafley continues Dolphins owner Stephen Ross’ trend of gambling on candidates without prior NFL head coaching experience. Ross has not hired a proven NFL head coach since becoming the Dolphins’ majority owner in 2009. He previously took chances on Joe Philbin (2012-2015), Adam Gase (2016-18), Brian Flores (2019-21) and McDaniel (2022-25).“I am excited to see where Jeff leads us,” Ross said, “alongside Jon-Eric Sullivan and our entire football operation, as we seek to return the Dolphins to sustained success.”McDaniel was let go after going 7-10 and missing the playoffs for the second straight year. That set up an organizational reset that will likely include finding a new quarterback and moving on from former first-round pick Tua Tagovailoa.Tagovailoa was benched for the final three games of the 2025 season after throwing for 2,660 yards with 20 touchdowns but showing stark declines in accuracy and mobility. He signed a four-year, $212.4m extension in July 2024 but finished 2025 with 15 interceptions, second-most in the NFL and a career high.Tagovailoa is guaranteed $54m for 2026, and the Dolphins would incur significant hits to the salary cap by releasing him.The Dolphins also interviewed Saleh and former Cleveland coach Kevin Stefanski, who was hired as Atlanta’s coach this week; Seattle offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak; Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula; and Jacksonville defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile, among others, during their search.Explore more on these topicsMiami DolphinsGreen Bay PackersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

At what point should the league be worried, if top USWNT talent trickles across the Atlantic? And what, if anything, can be done to stop the flow?The questions swirling stateside have been around for quite some time, though they once operated in much different conditions – a less competitive global landscape, diminished investment abroad, NWSL’s formal management by US Soccer.Trinity Rodman: why US soccer could lose its most compelling star to EuropeRead moreThose conditions have drastically shifted over the past decade, especially in the past six years. Since winningOlympic gold at the Parc des Princes, some of the USA’s biggest names moved abroad. That includes the starting right-back Emily Fox (Arsenal), the centre-back and sometimes captain Naomi Girma (Chelsea) and the ascendant winger Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea). Key players such as Catarina Macario, the captain Lindsey Heaps (who has signed forher home town club in Denverthis month), Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Lily Yohannes were already abroad.Asthe Guardian notedafter the defensive midfielder Sam Coffey – who was among the team’s top scorers in 2025 – signed for Manchester City, if Rodman moves abroad, she would be the sixth starter from the Olympic gold-medal match now plying her trade in Europe.One thing is clear: the NWSL regards the outward flow of the USWNT’s marquee names as a matter of grave importance. Given the historic link between US national team stars and the NWSL’s biggest crowds and marketability, that concern is merited. (Though notably, the league’s health isn’t as solely reliant on national team marketability as it has been in the past.)But what the league can do to stymie the flow – and whether the present trend is worthy of outright panic – is less obvious.The league’s initial attempt to stop the flow (and prevent Rodman’s departure in particular) is the High Impact Player Rule, which has already been officially contested by the NWSL Players Association. The NWSLPA alleges that the terms of the HIP Rule violate the terms of their collective bargaining agreement, as well as federal labour law, and advocates for raising the league’s salary cap instead.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Thompson, who joined Chelsea from Angel City last September, celebrates a goal for the WSL club.Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesNicknamed the “Rodman rule”, the HIP Rule lays out criteria for identifying highly sought-after international talent, and allocates an additional $1m beyond the salary cap to accommodate them in the roster. Criteria includes things such as minutes on the USWNT, and a high ranking on year-end lists such asESPN’s top 50andthe Guardian’s top 100.Emma Hayes has told the press that she was not consulted on the league’s criteria for the HIP Rule and that it would not change her approach to management of the team. The former Chelsea manager has addressed this topic at several points publicly, always emphasising that she is there to support each player in their own decisions, and is not pointedly directing them abroad.So far as the HIP Rule itself is concerned, the NWSLPA may be correct to suggest that renegotiating the salary cap is a better way to stay competitive. But to some extent, it’s worth noting that USWNT talent going abroad isn’t all about the money. Coffey, for example, moved to Manchester citing the same reasons international talents such as the Spain striker Esther González (who was the top scorer at last summer’s Euros) or the Germany goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger gave when they came to NWSL; moving either way across the Atlantic provides players with new challenges in different systems.With the game growing globally, expecting any international star to play out their entire career in one league could be unrealistic. From the individual or national team perspective, it may also limit the growth of that player as they seek out new elements to their game. In the case of USWNT players moving to Europe, the unique experience of playing in the Champions League – which challenges players to adjust to a variety of styles across Europe’s top leagues – is irreplaceable. Fox cited the opportunity to compete in the Champions League as a key motivator in her move to Arsenal, going on to win the competition in her debut season. Hayes has emphasised Champions League experience is a valuable tool for her players to have as they prepare for the 2027 World Cup.To help assuage fears, at the opposite end of migration, returning to NWSL remains an appeal for USWNT players such as Heaps or Catarina Macario, who have long charted their careers abroad. And while the league hustles to keep Rodman in the US, the other two members of the famed“triple espresso” forward triothat combined for 10 goals in Paris (Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson) are set to return to action in 2026, with all the star power they bring.Eyes remain trained on the future for Rodman, and the NWSL is right to attempt to keep her in the states. Whether the HIP Rule proves consequential on that front (as well as any renegotiated salary cap) is highly uncertain. But long term, USWNT stars spending some time overseas may not necessarily be cause for panic, and from a national team perspective, may add dynamism to the team as they seek to compete at the next World Cup.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Despite facing two set points in the opener, Keys showed her mental fortitude as she advanced to the second round with a 7-6 (6), 6-1 victory.Maya Joint falls at first hurdle as Tereza Valentová scores Australian Open upsetRead moreThis was an essential victory for Keys, but in many ways her 25-year-old Ukrainian opponent, competing in a grand slam main draw for the first time, stole the show. On the court, she has enjoyed a dramatic breakthrough year, rising from No 297 last March to her current ranking of No 92. She won 57 matches last year and seven titles, all on the lower level WTA 125 and ITF circuits.Keys quickly learned exactly why Oliynykova has won so many matches as the Ukrainian disrupted her veteran opponent with her expert junk-balling throughout their opening set. Oliynykova deprived Keys of any rhythm, racing to a 4-0 lead. She then led 4-0 in the tie-break before earning two consecutive set points at 6-4. Keys responded with an astounding sequence of points, eviscerating four consecutive winners to take the set without hesitation. With the first set miraculously secured, the American rolled to victory.Asked when she last faced a similar playing style, Keys was effusive about her opponent’s level. “Like 12-and-under,” she said. “And that’s obviously no disrespect to her at all, but it’s just been a really long time to play someone who plays that style, but she does it so effectively.”View image in fullscreenOleksandra Oliynykova returns in unconventional style.Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPA“They’re so high and they’re so deep. It was really hard. I felt like I couldn’t really take a swing volley or kind of like take it off of the bounce just because she hits such a good ball off of that.”This was by far the biggest moment of Olynikova’s career, a grand slam main draw debut against the Australian Open defending champion, and she saluted the occasion by wearing temporary tattoos depicting blue flowers on her face to match the colour of her outfit and her countless permanent tattoos.‘I don’t want to be a punching bag’ – retirements mar dramatic day at Australian OpenRead moreOliynykova’s story away from the courts is even more striking. In 2011, she and her family wereforced to leave Ukrainefor Croatia as political refugees due to her father’s opposition to Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian president at the time. Despite Russia’s continued invasion and bombing of her country, she now lives in Kyiv. Since 2014, her father has been a volunteer for the Ukraine army. Rather than her own name, Oliynykova’s Instagram username is @_drones4ua.org_, the URL ofthe websiteshe runs to raise funds for her father’s drone unit in the Ukrainian Defence Forces, the 412th Separate Brigade of Unmanned Systems.“I’m alone here, and before I was travelling with him,” she said. “My father is my biggest support since my childhood in everything. But I’m so proud of him. Actually, this is something that is keeping me motivated even more. After he joined the military, I progressed over 200 [ranking] positions, because I know it was his dream to see me on this court. I cannot explain this feelings, but when you are in this situation, you can put that priorities in your life. I will do everything to make him even more proud.“When he told me that it was amazing match, he just texted me, and yeah, I made his dream come true in such a situation. What could be more? What could be biggest motivation? I cannot imagine this.”View image in fullscreenUkraine's Oleksandra Oliynykova serves to USA's Madison Keys.Photograph: Martin Keep/AFP/Getty ImagesSuch was Oliynykova’s inexperience, the WTA communications staff had to direct the Ukrainian to her obvious seat in the centre of the room for her press conference. She entered the room wearing a white shirt with black writing instructing journalists that she would like to speak further about the Ukraine war, but that she would like to do so outside the tournament.“I did preparation for this tournament in Ukraine, and during the preparation, I was hearing explosions,” she said. “There were a couple of massive attacks the last night I spent in Ukraine before the trip here. There was an explosion just near my home, and a drone hit the home just across the road. My apartment was literally shaking because of the explosion. I know how people can help to protect Ukrainians, to protect them against these drones, but we will need to speak outside about this.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After an initial pilot period beginning in April, the team planned to start the study itself in October, with the first results expected in summer 2027.Members of the House of Lords are preparing to vote on an amendment brought by John Nash to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill which would introduce an outright ban on children using social media.The amendment has the support of some Labour peers, and if it passes in the Lords it will then be debated in the Commons, where 61 Labour MPs recently wrote a letter to the prime minister urging him to bring in a ban.Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, reassured MPs on Tuesday that the government’s consultation on the issue would only take a few months and that it would have a firm position by the summer.However, Nash insisted he would press ahead with his attempt to legislate immediately for a ban, saying on Tuesday: “The time for delay and procrastination is over. Without swift action to raise the age limit for social media to 16, we are at risk of a societal catastrophe.“That is why I am urging all fellow peers to vote for my amendment, which has the backing of peers from every major party, to end the disastrous harm being done to our young people by social media and to give them their childhood back.”While the researchers have noted that the study, called the IRL trial, has limitations – for example students may use devices that belong to other people or may choose not to participate – they said they hoped the results would shed light on the effect of restricting teens’ social media use.“The participants’ levels of anxiety is our key outcome, and we’re also interested in depression,” said Dr Dan Lewer, who leads theBradfordCentre for Health Data Science and is co-lead of the study. The researchers would also explore the impact by looking at which apps were used and when, as well as participants’ sleep patterns, experiences of bullying, time spent with friends and family, and how they compared themselves to other young people, he said.The trial was independent from the UK government’s announcement of aconsultation on whether to ban under-16s from social media, Orben said, adding that the results may be valuable for other countries debating the issue.“The decision that policymakers need to make is up to them,” she said. “We’re really just delivering the best quality evidence we can in the timeframes that are available.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaSocial media bansSocial media banUniversity of CambridgeChildrenInternet safetyBradfordnewsShareReuse this content"

More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.Ryanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”Muskwrote in a replyto a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”All this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.However, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.Musk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.The row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,”he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”He claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”O’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.Ryanair was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskRyanairMichael O'LearyAirline industryIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Plus, a look at the US datacenter boom and the effects of Australia’s social media banBlake MontgomeryTue 20 Jan 2026 10.55 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 12.06 ESTShareHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, the Guardian’s US tech editor.One year ago today, Donald Trump was inaugurated as president of the United States. Standing alongside him that day were the leaders of the tech industry’s most powerful companies, who had donated to him in an unprecedented bending of the knee. In the ensuing year, the companies have reaped enormous rewards from their alliance with Trump, which my colleague Nick Robins-Early and Iwrote about last monthafter Trump signed an executive order prohibiting states from passing laws regulating AI. Trump has sponsored the tech industry with billions in government funding and with diplomatic visits that featured CEOs as his fellow negotiators inmassive, lucrative deals.As year two of Trump’s second term begins, Silicon Valley’s titans appear poised to enrich themselves even more with the president’s enthusiastic aid.Today in tech, we’re exploring the political consequences of the expansion of datacenters in the US and Europe as well as taking stock of Australia’s under-16 social media ban.Trump thinks datacenters might cost his party an electionView image in fullscreenDonald Trump is worried about datacenters and their effects on an already expensive US electricity market.Composite: Thalia Juarez;  Jim Watson/The Guardian; AFP via GettyDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his goal of total deregulation of AI and his party’s November election ambitions?Trump’s anxiety is evident in two actions last week. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.““We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”And then on Friday, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, perBloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.Trump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as my colleagues Oliver Milman and Dharna Noorreported over the weekend, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitivelyraisecostsfurther for domestic consumers.Power prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue which has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.As ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On Thursday, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI hadillegally been operating methane-powered generatorsat its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like the rest of us (Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon). Musk and xAI have not commented.European governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters, but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. InNovember, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to asurvey published in October.In the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those of the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost of living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technologyproposedin November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.A nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity useovertook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.The next stop in the datacenter boom: the Middle East, where energy is cheap but water is not abundant, and India, where the power grid is not as reliable …The effects of Australia’s social media banView image in fullscreenLawmakers in the UK and around the world are calling for bans on social media.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersLawmakers in the UK and around the world are calling for bans on social media accounts for teenagers and children in the wake of Australia’s successful social media ban for under-16s. My colleague Josh Taylor offers alook at how the ban is playing out in its native country. Despite social media companies reporting millions of accounts deleted in compliance with the ban, the opposition party is questioning its effectiveness:More than 4.7m social media accounts held by Australians who platforms have judged to be under 16 years of age were deactivated, removed or restricted in the first days after the ban came into effect on 10 December, the prime minister has said.Despite the high numbers, the federal opposition, which campaigned for the policy before it was adopted by the government, last week said the ban implementation had “fallen flat”.“New accounts are being created and the age-verification tools that the government assured Australians would be effective, have proven laughably easy to bypass with some makeup and good lighting,” said the shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh.The wider TechScapeHe called himself an ‘untouchable hacker god’.

It is being used to automate administrative tasks or even help with core operations, including processing insurance claims and assessing customers’ credit-worthiness.But the UK has failed to develop any specific laws or regulations to govern their use of AI, with the FCA and Bank of England claiming general rules are sufficient to ensure positive outcomes for consumers. That means businesses have to determine how existing guidelines apply to AI, leaving MPs worried this could put consumers and financial stability at risk.“It is the responsibility of the Bank of England, the FCA and the government to ensure the safety mechanisms within the system keeps pace,” said Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury committee. “Based on the evidence I’ve seen, I do not feel confident that our financial system is prepared if there was a major AI-related incident and that is worrying.”The report flagged a lack of transparency around how AI could influence financial decisions, potentially affecting vulnerable consumers’ access to loans or insurance. It said it was also unclear whether data providers, tech developers or financial firms would be held responsible when things went wrong.AI bubble: five things you need to know to shield your finances from a crashRead moreMPs said AI also increased the likelihood of fraud, and the dissemination ofunregulated and misleading financial advice.In terms of financial stability, MPs found that rising AI use increased firms’ cybersecurity risks, and left them overly reliant on a small number of US tech companies, such as Google, for essential services. Its uptake could also amplify “herd behaviour”, with businesses making similar financial decisions during economic shocks and “risking a financial crisis”.The Treasury committee is now urging regulators to take action, including the launch of new stress tests that would assess the City’s readiness for AI-driven market shocks. MPs also want the FCA to publish “practical guidance” by the end of the year, clarifying how consumer protection rules apply to AI use, and who would be held accountable if consumers suffer any harm.“By taking a wait-and-see approach to AI in financial services, the three authorities are exposing consumers and the financial system to potentially serious harm”, the report said.The FCA said it had already “undertaken extensive work to ensure firms are able to use AI in a safe and responsible way”, but would review the report’s findings “carefully”.A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We’ve been clear that we will strike the right balance between managing the risks posed by AI and unlocking its huge potential.”They added that this involved working with regulators to “strengthen our approach as the technology evolves”, and appointing new “AI champions” covering financial services “to ensure we seize the opportunities it presents in a safe and responsible way”.A spokesperson for the Bank of England said it had “already taken active steps to assess AI-related risks and reinforce the resilience of the financial system, including publishing a detailed risk assessment and highlighting the potential implications of a sharp fall in AI-affected asset prices. We will consider the committee’s recommendations carefully and will respond in full in due course.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessAI (artificial intelligence)Bank of EnglandFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The modern internet was just a decade old, mobile phones were far from universal and our social lives were mostly physical – and local.In the 25 years since, technology has changed how we live in profound ways. Most people check their phone within minutes of waking and return to it on average186 times a day. Computers and the systems that sit behind them mediate every aspect of modern life, shaping how we move through the world.The time we spend with screens now dwarfs that spent interacting with others. In 2024, the average Australian spent two hours and 13 minutes a day on screen-based activities – nearly half their free time – but just 38 minutes socialising in person. Young Americans now spend70% less time attending or hosting partiesthan they did 20 years ago, and have among the highest screen time of any age cohort. Meanwhile, consistent surveys show a trend towards people, particularly men, having fewer close friends. As our reliance on technology has increased, the time we spend with others has shrunk.With the arrival of AI, our social connections are further endangered, and many people now turn to chatbots for advice or comfort instead of friends. Technology promises more connection, but in practice we’ve become more insular.Increasingly it can feel that instead of enabling our social lives, technology is controlling them – who we see, what we know and how we connect. We use it to “optimise” our time, remove inefficiencies and smooth over social frictions by removing interactions. But in doing so we risk losing a fundamental part of what it is to be human: the messy, unexpected nature of life.However, unlike wars and climate change, the antidote is almost entirely in our hands – shaped by everyday decisions to choose the human over the technological. As we enter the second quarter of this century, here are some ways in which you can “re-humanise” your life.Take out your headphonesWearing headphones in public has become a routine for many people. While headphones offer comfort and distraction, they signal we are closed off to others, reducing opportunities for casual interactions and new connections, however fleeting.The business of silence: is there a hidden cost to noise cancelling?Read moreBut it’s not only others we block out. Dr Jim Taylor, a psychologist and the author ofRaising Generation Tech, says we often use headphones to distract ourselves from our own thoughts too. “You’re caught in a netherworld where you’re both not inside your head and you’re not engaging with the world – and those are the two things that make us human: our ability to think and our ability to feel,” he says.Taking out your headphones, even occasionally, allows space for reflection, observation and connection. It opens the possibility of overhearing a conversation you relate to, listening to the sounds of nature or simply letting your mind wander. “It’s amazing what will happen when you’re open to the world – or open to yourself,” says Taylor. “But it’s difficult to do when you’re listening to a podcast.”Make better introductionsModern social life often begins on screen. Digital profiles invite us to inspect the lives – and social circles – of friends, colleagues and strangers. Before meeting someone new, chances are we may have scanned their Instagram, LinkedIn or dating profile, forming assumptions from a carefully curated snapshot of their life. Somewhere along the way, we’ve forgotten the value of a considered, human introduction as the foundation for genuine connection.Bridget Jones’s Shazza had it right when she said that makingintroductions with thoughtful detailscan go a long way: mentioning an unexpected talent or hobby, highlighting a mutual interest or sharing a funny anecdote.A well-made introduction reminds us that a complex, multidimensional person exists in front of us – and invites further questions. It’s best to avoid theMark Darcy techniqueand stick to positives that you know the other person will appreciate. Essentially, you are selling the prospect of an interesting future conversation, peppering details they can pick up on after you leave.Done well, a proper introduction will not only help others connect, but leave those we have taken the time to introduce feeling valued and seen. As the behavioural neuroscientist Dr Lynda Shaw puts it: “Feeling significant – feeling noticed – is one of the greatest gifts we can give someone. Why do we so often wait until a eulogy to say the good stuff?” If we’re lucky, that person will pay forward when introducing you in future, too.Talk to people outside your generationFor younger generations, social media is now the primary source of news and ideas, with algorithms prioritising novelty and speed. Older people tend to occupy different digital spaces, and the result is age-segregated conversations where meaningful exchange between generations is harder to sustain.This new order poses risks to all: young people lose out on insight and wisdom that can’t be found online, and older people – who already often report feeling invisible – feel disconnected. Prof Hugh Mackay, a social psychologist and researcher, says age is a form of diversity that is all too often forgotten – and intergenerational contact enriches both sides.Taking time to speak to those outside your generation can offer a new perspective and help you break out your digital bubble. It could be as simple as carving out half an hour to have a proper conversation with someone in your family or workplace. If that feels too daunting, you could try a “deeds not words” approach and invite them to an activity that you do regularly. That way there’s some structure to the interaction, but they will understand more about your life, and have the chance to meet other people too.We ignore intergenerational wisdom – and sage advice – at our peril.Say it with handwritingCommunication is easier than ever before; but while we are communicating with more frequency, it is often with less depth. Birthdays are a good example: a text message is easy; a card takes effort. Writing by hand engages more of the brain and creates emotional benefits for both giver and receiver, says Shaw. “Altruism puts the brain in one of the most pleasurable states it can be.”Signature moves: are we losing the ability to write by hand?Read moreUsing AI to write a card may save time, but it also defeats the point. The value lies in the thinking, remembering and choosing of words, says Shaw, not just the final message. Avoiding these rituals, and exercising the neural pathways they use, may make expressing emotions more difficult further down the line, Shaw says. “What we don’t use, we lose.”A birthday needn’t be the only excuse: a heartening handwritten note for someone you live with has much more impact than sending a text, revealing traces of personality in the loops and lines of your handwriting.Read – and share – poetrySure, memes are great, but oral traditions like poetry are the oldest form of social media. William Sieghart, founder of the UK-basedPoetry Pharmacy, prescribes poems to people who come to his “pharmacy” sessions with emotional ailments. He has noticed that more and more people are arriving feeling anxious and overstimulated, which he puts in large part down to phones keeping us in a state of constant alert. “Lots of people tell me that they wake up in the morning and they’re kind of in fight or flight before they open their eyes,” he says.In a world of distraction, reading a poem aloud – or to someone else – can create space for emotional honesty. “People have written about every human experience,” says Sieghart. “[A poem] will make you realise you’re not alone, you’re not mad. Even if the poem was written hundreds of years ago.” Sieghart suggests starting withthis.Avoid technological shortcutsSelf-checkouts, QR codes, video calls and chatbots are designed to save time and reduce friction. But the small exchanges they replace recharge what Mackay calls our “social batteries”.“Human beings thrive on interpersonal interaction and suffer without it,” he says. “Neuroscientists tell us eye contact is like the super highway to the emotions. You can’t get that through a screen.”Choosing to speak to strangers helps us break out our social bubbles and reminds us of the people who exist around us. We all benefit when we understand differences in others, even if they don’t align with our worldview.Many of these technological tools – like self-checkouts – were introduced by companies to save on labour costs. Lining up to use the staffed counter might take longer, but a positive, friendly human exchange will help you remember that social contact is not an inefficiency to be eliminated, it’s part of the joy of being human.Take fewer photosEarly research suggests our information-heavy media diet of videos and photos is affecting our memories. Agen Z podcasthost recently (and somewhat ironically) went viral for a sobering reflection: “I heard that our generation will be the first to die with more memories of other people’s lives than our own lives because of social media.”While cutting down on social media is an obvious choice for reducing information intake, our own photo taking habits are just as important:studies have shownthat those who took a photograph are less likely to remember a moment than those who didn’t.This doesn’t mean never taking photos. But being more intentional allows experiences to lodge more deeply in memory. Sometimes, the best way to remember something is simply to live it.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleHealth & wellbeingFriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is an adaptation of a Japanese folk tale, the story of a princess from the moon discovered inside a bamboo stalk in a poor rural village. A decade ago, Studio Ghibli adapted the tale intoa gorgeously animated moviewith a traditional, lovingly hand-painted feel. This film could not be more different, a trippy, high-energy, techno anime set in the near future, half of it in a virtual reality world – and TikTok-ifed with emojis and stickers exploding all over the screen.It begins when a 17-year-old high school student called Iroha finds a baby girl inside a glowing lamppost (rather than the bamboo stalk of the original). Iroha (voiced by Dawn M Bennett in the English dub) is a sensible kid, a talented musician and grade-A student who has already moved out of the family home and is living alone, working all hours to pay the rent of her tiny studio flat. In any free time she does have, Iroha follows her idol, AI musical megastar Yachiyo, in a crazy, chaotic virtual reality world called Tsukuyomi.Iroha takes the baby home. But overnight, the tiny newborn grows into a crawling toddler. Within days she is a pre-teen, a pale ethereal beauty called Kaguya, who, it transpires, is a runaway from the moon. This girl who fell to Earth is an impulsive ball of energy; she persuades Iroha to collaborate with her on songs to win a competition to perform with superstar Yachiyo, none of them remotely catchy. The plot pings about hyperactively, so dizzying that Cosmic Princess Kaguya! may leave audiences over 15 years old feeling more ancient than the original tale.Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is on Netflix from 22 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeAI (artificial intelligence)Virtual realityJapanMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Greenland is a moment of great ruptureChristopher S ChivvisTrump’s demand for Greenland is a throwback to the 1884 Berlin conference: a transaction of land and people driven by a might makes right worldviewTue 20 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 17.23 ESTShareThe announcement on 17 January that Washington will imposepunitive tariffsof 10% to 25% on eight European allies – unless they facilitate the “complete and total purchase” of Greenland – is likely to be the death knell of the post-1945 transatlantic order. By linking the territorial sovereignty of a Nato ally to trade access, the US has transitioned from Europe’s security guarantor to a 19th-century imperial rent-seeker.This is a moment of profound rupture. For decades, the western world believed that raw imperialism had been relegated to the past among advanced industrial powers. Even China, for all its assertiveness, largely couches its ambitions in the language of revanchism – the “reclaiming” of lost territory. Washington’s current demand for Greenland, by contrast, is a throwback to the age of the 1884 Berlin conference: a transaction of land and people driven by a might makes right worldview.To be sure, this act of raw aggression faces pushback within the US. Senator Thom Tillis has rightly criticized the coercive effort andpublic pollingshows that while a segment of the Republican party favor a purchase, only 8% of Americans support the use of force to acquire the territory. But Europe must realize it is dealing with a president drunk on executive power, undeterred by congressional dissent or a skeptical public that he views as malleable and more concerned with the cost of living and culture wars than Arctic sovereignty.The strain is already intense for Europe. Trump’s pressure is designed to expose EU fault lines and sow internal division by forcing member states to prioritize different existential threats and divergent interests. Denmark has a near-existential interest in preventing this annexation. France and Germany have an interest in demonstrating EU cohesion, yet risk seeing their vital access to US export markets severed.The most tragic tension, however, is on the eastern flank. Poland and the Baltic states view Russian aggression as an immediate, physical threat that only American boots and missiles can deter. To maintain that shield, they will want to stay silent on Greenland. Yet Trump’s policy presents them with an impossible paradox: the very coercion being used to force a deal on Greenland undermines the logic of the security guarantee itself. What responsible sovereign power in Warsaw or Tallinn can put stock in the word of an ally that uses the threat of abandonment to compel the sale of a neighbor’s territory?Brussels isalready reachingfor its most powerful defensive tool: the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI). This “trade bazooka”, designed to bypass national vetos through qualified majority voting, allows a range of EU retaliation. But firing it against Washington would be a major escalation – and probably irreversible. For the eastern flank, activating the instrument risks acting on a suicide pact; for Paris and Berlin, failing to activate it could be the end of European sovereignty.In the face of this trauma, the traditional European habit will be to try to weather the storm. There is a deep-seated institutional hope in Brussels and Berlin that this is a temporary aberration – that if Europe simply absorbs the tariffs and waits until 2028, transatlantic relations will return to “normal”.This reflex must be actively resisted. The wait and see approach is no longer a strategy. It is a recipe for perpetual vassalage. The Greenland crisis is not just bad weather. It is a structural shift. European leaders must use this crisis as the necessary political catalyst to further the continent’s own sovereign defenses.To survive, Europe must overcome the bureaucratic and nationalistic resistance that has long stalled defense integration. It must seize on this crisis to force recalcitrant national defense industries into irreversible cooperation. To fund this, leaders need to break long-standing taboos to re-energize the continent’s economy through a radical mix of immigration, economic liberalism and wise industrial policy that boosts Europe into the first tier of technological powers.Doing so will generate turmoil by challenging entrenched interests on both the left and the right. The urgency of the mid-21st century will not permit a gradual approach. Producing the financial resources for an independent defense will take years; every month spent debating is a month lost. The choice is no longer between the status quo and integration. It is between a painful European rebirth or a slow descent into a world where the EU collapses internally, its security is in tatters and it becomes a target for expansion in Moscow.Christopher S Chivvis is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former US national intelligence officer for EuropeExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

But legal troubles have not damaged the fortunes of her partyTue 20 Jan 2026 13.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 15.18 ESTShareIn a Paris courtroom, the first act of the 2027 French presidential election is already under way.On TuesdayMarine Le Pen began to answer judges’ questions in her appeal against a conviction relating to the embezzlement of European parliament funds. If she wins, the far-right leader will be free to run for the presidency for a fourth time. If the sentence is upheld, her 30-year-old protege, Jordan Bardella, is almost certain to take her place in the race.Having presented the original verdict as an assault on democracy by judges bent on thwarting her political ambitions, Ms Le Pen hassoftenedher stance. If the appeals court is swayed by arguments that offences committed by her National Rally party were inadvertent, a five-year ban on running for public office may be reduced or overturned. Even if she loses, however, her political opponents may not be inclined to celebrate too enthusiastically.Mr Bardella is seen by many voters as the likelier candidate to pull off a historic far-right triumph in 2027. Since Ms Le Pen’s conviction last March, he has performed a tricky balancing act, protesting her innocence while demonstrating his own credentials for taking her place. As party president, he has used the time to try tobroadenits appeal beyond a mainly blue-collar base, wooing the traditional right and business interests.More broadly, and ominously, the French far right may be dismantling the “republican barrier” which has hitherto blocked its route to the Élysée. Pollingpublishedthis month in Le Monde suggests that Ms Le Pen’s legal troubles have had little or no impact on her party’s fortunes. Instead, its ideas are steadily penetrating the mainstream while retaining an insurgent, anti-establishment appeal.More than 40% of respondents to the poll believed that the National Rally would improve the situation in France when it came to security, reindustrialisation, the quality of public services and the cost of living. Around one-third said that it was “the only party that can do things differently”. Growing numbers of voters are sympathetic to the policy of “national preference”, which would license discrimination against foreign residents in relation to housing, welfare and jobs.Virulent ethnonationalism has, of course, always been at the heart of Ms Le Pen’s politics, and the same goes for Mr Bardella. But the failure of mainstream governments to protect living standards and boost growth is allowing the far right to posture as a “patriotic” solution to a wider socioeconomic malaise.Mr Bardella’s assiduous courting of elites with promises of corporate tax cuts and deregulation represents a shift of emphasis, compared with Ms Le Pen’s focus on working-class concerns and the cost of living. But a strategy of being all things to all people is easier to pursue when there is no track record in power to critique.As the United States actively seeks tounderminethe European Union, and promote far-right nationalist parties as a kind of enemy within, the stakes in 2027 will be vertiginously high. Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former adviser and outrider, hasidentifieda far-right victory in France as a key stage in “killing” the EU.Whether their eventual opponent is Ms Le Pen or Mr Bardella, France’s mainstream parties have less than 500 days to find a way to see off a threat that has never been more real.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Late last year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)suedPenn to force compliance with this chilling demand, made in the name of fighting antisemitism. Jewish and non-Jewish community members at Penn and beyond haveunitedtosupportthe university’s resistance to compiling and releasing data about members of campus Jewish organizations, the Jewish studies department, and individuals who participated in confidential listening sessions and surveys about antisemitism.That such a diverse array of organizations, including Penn’sHillel and Meor chapters,AAUP-Penn, theAssociation for Jewish Studies, the American Council on EducationandPen America, as well as local chapters of theAnti-Defamation League, the Jewish Federation and the American Jewish Committee, have all spoken against the EEOC’s lawsuit reflects how deeply disturbing it is to think of the government demanding such a list. TheTrump administrationclaims to act in the name of Jewish safety and against antisemitism, but this common reaction from groups with often divergent views may reflect a growing concern that its actions belie those laudable aims.If history teaches us anything, it is that making lists of Jews, no matter the ostensible purpose, is often a prelude to their and others’ persecution. Many Jewish people affiliated with US universities, ourselves included, have family who escaped or died at the hands of authoritarian regimes that persecuted Jews and others based on their religious or political beliefs. Even if the EEOC is collecting Jewish community members’ personal data in a good-faith effort to ensure safety, lists of Jews can later be leaked, or deployed to other, more sinister ends. History is replete with examples: a census of Jews undertaken by the Dutch government in 1941, for instance, allowed the invading Nazis to target Jewish citizens for death camps and extermination.At both an intellectual and a visceral level, then, the government requiring the university to hand over the personal contact information – including addresses – of Jewish students, faculty and staff, over strong objections, would be profoundly chilling under any circumstances. It is especially so in a political environmentincreasingly saturatedwithunvarnished hate, includingantisemitismandwhite supremacyendorsed byindividuals within the governmentand amplifiedby figures with outsize influenceon some of its most powerful leaders. And the demand is especially concerning in light of the Trump administration’s broader assault on universities, free speech and academic freedom, immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, other vulnerable communities and political dissent more generally.The Trump administration has used allegations of antisemitism – along with criticism of ideas and policies around race and gender – asa justification to attack universities, including suspensions of federal funding for lifesaving scientific and medical research, and attempts to enforceideological uniformity on college campusesand beyond. The EEOC’s demand for a list of Jews at Penn, while distinctive in its breadth and specificity, is an extension of tactics the government has already employed against others: violently detaining and seeking to deportinternational students who voiced disfavored views; demanding lists of patients frommedical centers; and collecting information about Jewish employees at other schools, includingBarnard College.Against this backdrop, the Trump administration’s demand for a list of Penn’s Jews may seek to establish the government’s power to compel such disclosures, with staggeringly broad implications. Today, the administration asserts its prerogative to demand lists of Jewish community members in the name of protecting Jews from antisemitism. Tomorrow, it may extract from universities the names and personal contact information of faculty, staff and students associated with other religious, cultural or identity-based campus organizations or academic departments; or of individuals who were born outside the United States or who study ideas the government deems “harmful” or “anti-American”. The administration appears to be laying the groundwork to more aggressively surveil and silence ideas and individuals with which it disagrees and to exert control over institutions that might serve as sites of civic resistance.Notably, this threat is not confined to colleges and universities. Unlike Title VI and Title IX, provisions of civil rights law that apply only to educational institutions, Title VII’s prohibition of employment discrimination covers most public and private employers. If the EEOC can force Penn to disclose a list of Jews, the door is open to the government’s (mis)use of such newly established authority to investigate discrimination claims as a wedge to demand lists of employees, their addresses and personal phone numbers and email addresses, from virtually any employer for purposes of surveillance, harassment or punishment. The Trump administration’sdisregard for data privacyand its cavalier approach to data collection, storage andsharing acrossgovernment agencies heightens that danger.Many Jews, including our own relatives, came to the United States to flee governments that used lists of Jews and political dissidents to round up and persecute those considered enemies of the state. The government’s demand for a list of Jews at Penn must be seen for what it may portend not only for the Jewish community but for all of us: unfettered government power to stifle opposition, impose ideological uniformity and undermine civil society. We must resist the government’s demand so that everyone – regardless of race, religion, national origin or ideology – may live free from the fears that have led so many to seek refuge here.The authors are members of the University of Pennsylvania faculty but write here in their individual capacities.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionAntisemitismJudaismReligionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Countries across the world are scrambling to adjust. Canadahas announceda trade realignment towards China – andtalk growsof counter-sanctions in Europe. If the UK wants to avoid being caught in the crossfire, there really is only one alternative: to finally take the brakes off rebuilding our common future in Europe.In the past few weeks, Nato has suffered life-changing injuries. This should not be surprising, given the repeated signals from Washington, from the anti-European screed in Trump’sNational Security Strategyto theharassment of President Zelenskyyat the White House. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time and act accordingly.There is no easy solution – but, as ever, there are always ways to make a bad situation worse. Green party leader Zack Polanski, for example, demands we get ready to evict US bases from British soil, and says the UK should “ditch Trident – and fast.” He claims this could be done without undermining Ukraine or Nato, while still standing up to “Putin’s imperial ambitions”. But in reality, an emotional response to the US will do little to stop Trump dealing with Russia over the Ukrainians’ heads. Scrapping Trident is the precise opposite of what our European allies want or need. It abandons a key part of our commitment to their security as well as our own, and leaves Putin with only the French nuclear arsenal to contend with, should his ambitions spread further across Europe. What may sound bold in the echo chamber of the Greens’ social media would not survive the stark reality of the horrified response to unilateral British disarmament from our German or Polish counterparts.Yet progressives’ biggest mistake would be to think that the pressure on Europe comes from Trump alone. Back in 2011, dismayed by Europe’s inability to sustain fighting in Libya, Barack Obama’s defence secretary Robert Gates warned thatAmericans would lose patienceif Europeans didn’t spend more on defence. It is the size and shape of the Chinese military and the prospect of a war in Asia – not Russia, and defending Europe – that drives thinking in Washington, among Democrats as well as Republicans. Even if a future administration was less erratic or more collegial, this fundamental realignment will not change.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Donald Trump at the Sharm El Sheikh peace summit, Egypt, 13 October 2025.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/PAOn its own, the UK has limited resources and political bandwidth to withstand bullying from any direction, let alone from its allies. The very core of its defence strategy, on nuclear weapons and intelligence, is primarily intertwined with the US. The UK has already reportedly promised a contingent ofup to 7,500 troopsto monitor a hypothetical peace in Ukraine – but even deploying that number would be stretching the British army to its limits.The conclusion is inescapable: now is the time for the UK to reinforce, not wreck Europe’s security relationships, both through the European pillar of Nato and through cooperation with the EU. That means developing its own military capabilities as the US pulls back, as well as exploring a UK role in potential decision-making bodies such as a European security council. Labour should lead the charge for these new alliances and roles, not wait to be dragged into making them. Not only does Britain face tariffs, the US is also demandingit bends to their trade standards, and so diverge further from Europe. Capitulating to this would be a form of self-harm at a time when Trump is proving how little worth his past promises of a trade deal carry.For years, Brexiters have behaved as though defence and trade were two separate issues. Trump has proved that wrong by using economic sanctions to pursue his own national security ambitions – so the UK should join the dots between its security and post-Brexit trading arrangements.This is not a moment to be half-hearted about our national interest – not least because the UK’s allies in Europe know how to play hardball too. It was mind-boggling to see the European Commission, egged on by some of our closest allies, askingfor a huge sumfor the UK to join the Security Action for Europe scheme (Safe) to fund joint EU defence projects, a stancethat led to the UK backing away. But the status quo won’t do. We must break the cycle of posturing, and urgently resume the Safe talks for the benefit of all concerned.And the UK should go further. A customs union is not a serious offer, in these circumstances, for addressing how trade can be weaponised against us. Labour should be open to renegotiating all barriers to cooperation – including integration with the single market in a Swiss-style deal.It’s tempting to be cautious and hope things will blow over, but true progressive politics compels a bolder approach. While others see electoral opportunity in deriding Nato or fixating on Trump, the security of our constituents compels us to get real and bold on the EU reset. The UK cannot play at being an economic rival to the EU while the machinations of Trump, Putin and Xi require us to be the closest of strategic allies. The UK’s future withEuropeis its future national security. That’s the reality we must now embrace.Stella Creasy is chair of the Labour Movement for Europe and the Labour and Cooperative MP for WalthamstowExplore more on these topicsForeign policyOpinionTrump administrationKeir StarmerDonald TrumpNatoEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

One is the story told by the ruling classes in Denmark, the other is the narrative that unites progressives and nationalists in Greenland.The moral of the first tale is that Greenland, as a part of the Danish kingdom, has managed the extremely challenging transition to a modern society without sacrificing its culture or identity. This is a rare and impressive achievement. Greenlanders are among the only indigenous people in the world with their own parliament, political institutions and education system and who have maintained their own language. And they have access to the same welfare services as other citizens ofDenmark.This has been achieved under difficult conditions by only around 55,000 inhabitants on a vast island in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, isolated from the rest of the world. True, the people of Greenland were not asked to consent when they were integrated into the Danish kingdom in 1953, after more than 200 years as a Danish colony. But in referendums in 1979 and 2008 a majority of them voted in favour of a revised arrangement that allowed them to expand political control over their own territory and resources. Greenland’s constitution calls the period from 1953 to 1979 a phase of “hidden colonisation”, but also recognises that the next decades constitute an era of “decolonisation”.View image in fullscreenResidents of Nuuk, Greenland, on 18 January 2026.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesIn this narrative, the Danish kingdom has served as a formidable vehicle for Greenlanders to achieve self-determination. Freedom for Greenland from this perspective is not about formal independence or liberation from old masters, it’s about gradually building institutions and the capacity for self-determination – under the Danish crown.Colonialism continuedThe other narrative sees Greenland’s recent history as merely a continuation of colonisation. It claims that the Danes have never respected Greenlanders as equals, and that the Danes have always been illegitimate rulers. Here in fact is the “hidden colonisation” in question: a term that reflects the unequal pay between Danes and Greenlanders, the negative attitudes of Danish employers in Greenland and the way in which the Danish media talk about Greenland in general.Those who tell this story point to scandals such as the practice in the 1960s and 70s of Danish doctorsimplanting contraceptive IUDsin the wombs of thousands of Greenlandic women and girls without their consent or knowledge, as part of a campaign to limit Greenland’s birthrate. The Danish government hasofficially apologised, but approximately half the fertile women in Greenland wereforcibly fitted with contraceptionat the time. Then there’s the 22children who were taken from their familiesin Greenland and transported to Denmark, where they were supposed to be educated as the next generation of the colony’s capable rulers. The Danish prime ministerhas acknowledgedthese moral failures. But such dark episodes reveal, according to this narrative, that the Danes saw themselves as the white masters on a mission to bring civilisation to savages.Where the story held by the ruling classes often refers to institutional progress and welfare reform, the story of those who demand Greenland’s independence speaks of persistent and institutional racism in Denmark against people from Greenland.This iswidely documentedand I think anyone who has lived here in Denmark has encounteredexamples of racismagainst Greenlanders. The fact that there is a demeaning phrase for heavy intoxication that refers to being “as drunk as someone from Greenland”, so commonly used that it’s in the officialDanish dictionary, speaks of ongoing humiliation and a denial of human dignity to Greenlanders.You could say Greenland’s people have been institutionally decolonised but still seek the dignity and pride of being their own masters.Battles of modernisationSo you have the ruling classes insisting that Greenland’s consent is the first and decisive premise for the present arrangement. There is a very broad public consensus that Denmark cannot rule Greenland against the will of its citizens.At the same time, many people in Denmark say that Greenland still lacks the capacity to deal with its own social problems or its economy. They point to the €600m that Greenland receives every year from Denmark as proof that their freedom is paid for by their so-called colonisers, and argue that blaming everything on Danish colonialism is a way of escaping responsibility for their own failures.These two narratives can be a feature of any society that has gone through a process of rapid modernisation.But in the case of Greenland and Denmark, the tensions have been intensified by cultural and geographical distance. It is morally and politically difficult to defend an arrangement in which a huge island is governed by a small country with an entirely different social and cultural history, thousands of miles away, unless the people of Greenland choose it as their collective path to greater self-determination.I’m not saying you have to choose between these two stories. Most people accept that both perspectives are part of the same complex history. And the political divide in Greenland is not between those who want independence and those who want to remain in the kingdom of Denmark. Rather it is between those who want formal autonomy in the near future and those who consider it a long-term goal. The broad but fragile government stresses that it wants to remain in the kingdom, but only “for now”; it is a temporary arrangement.View image in fullscreenA demonstration in Copenhagen, Denmark, against US interference in Greenland, 17 January 2026.Photograph: Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg/ShutterstockEven after thedirect threat of annexationby the Trump administration, most public figuresin Greenland refused to explicitly recognise the kingdom of Denmark as their political home. The distance between the Danish and Greenlandic governments has been revealed in numerous public statements in recent months. Danish leaders have insisted on a united “we”, whereas Greenlandic voices have repeated that they are neither Danish nor American. This changed on Tuesday last week, when Greenlandic government leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen said during a joint press conference with the Danish prime minister thatGreenland would pick Denmark over the USif asked to choose, “here and now”.For the first time, the two parties almost managed to speak with one voice. This past weekend marked another moment of historic solidarity, when peoplein both territoriescame together to demonstrate against Trump’s threats. Protesters in a number of Danish cities waved Greenland flags.Exploiting divisionsThe great irony of this story is that theTrump administration, which leads a culture war against “woke” post-colonial ideology in American universities, has understood thepolarising potential of the division between the former coloniser and the colonised. This is why Trump makes appeals to anti-colonial forces in Greenland.Much of what the Americans say about Greenland displays both their ignorance and their own imperial arrogance. It’s not true that they need ownership of Greenland for national security. Thanks to a 1951 treaty, the US military has had unlimited access to all parts of the island and maintains its own Greenland base.The US already possesses the military monopoly on legitimate violence in Greenland. JD Vance often emphasises that the Danes havenot lived up to their security obligationsin Greenland, which is true. But neither has the US, which has also done very little for security there.The claim that it needs Greenland for rare-earth minerals and resources is also unconvincing. Greenland has long been open for business and invited investors to the country. But the Americans have not taken up these opportunities. The decisive challenge here is not access to resources, but building the infrastructure required to exploit them. It’s a high-risk investment, and the US currently lacks the capacity to cultivate rare-earth minerals.View image in fullscreenJD Vance visiting the US military’s Pituffik space base in Greenland, 20 March 2025.Photograph: Jim Watson/ReutersDespite so many false claims and so much misinformation, the Trump administration’s approach to Greenland is clever. It says that if Greenland does become independent, it will be so strategically attractive and at the same time so politically weak, that it will besnapped up by China or Russia. The US cannot allow that to happen, it says.Consequently, if the call for independence in Greenland and the resistance to Denmark is strong, it delivers a kind of legitimacy for a US conquest. If, on the other hand, Denmark and Greenland speak with one voice against the US and for self-determination within the kingdom, it will make it a lot harder for Trump to take it.But the Trump administration has actually managed to expose the divisions between the two stories that Greenland and Denmark tell themselves. Even though there’s a clear legal and political answer to thequestion posed by Trump’s aide Stephen Millerquerying Denmark’s right to rule over Greenland, it does challenge the moral legitimacy of the arrangement.The dilemma for GreenlandThis places Greenland in a dilemma. Its best leverage against the old colonial master, Denmark, is that it is now attractive to the US administration. But its best defence against a new imperial master is the recognition of the legitimacy of the old one. Either it uses Trump to pressure Denmark or it uses the Danish kingdom to protect itself from him.After years of being ignored, Greenlandic voices and preferences are being listened to and transmitted to a global audience. They can use Trump’s interest to pressure a Danish government that has suddenly shown a great deal of interest in the wellbeing of Greenlanders. The government has even proposed a strategyto combat anti-Greenlandic racism in Denmark, which is remarkable for a leadership that has challenged international law to make life hereless attractive for immigrants.This recognition of Greenlanders’ consent and agency does give them some dignity. But for a very small population in a geo-strategically vital position to insist on their independence and dignity is dangerous.As the true nature of Trump’s offensive emerges, this danger is becoming increasingly clear. He makes appeals to anti-colonial impulses in Greenland even as he openly reveals his true imperial ambitions. Yet he is no longer polarising Danes and Greenlanders, but uniting us.From a Danish perspective, it’s hard to refute the challenge from Miller. The status quo is the result of an arbitrary deal that made Denmark the ruling power in Greenland.As Danes, we don’t “deserve Greenland”; Greenlanders deserve freedom under the conditions they choose.But for the people in Greenland this is existential. Their basic conditions of life will be radically changed if they become part of Trump’s US empire. They will lose rights and protections. Maybe they will be paid generously on the first day and get access to other opportunities. But their lives will be less secure, more vulnerable and less dignified. They will be offered a deal by a man who neither respects any political commitment nor cares about people. He does not even celebratehuman rightsand political freedom in principle. He’s not transactional, he’s extractive.We know by now that what he wants in Greenland isabsolutely unacceptable, but also not impossible. He wants ownership, this is “psychologically needed”, he says. It’s not about security or minerals, it’s about the ambition that the French called “la gloire” (the glory). He has a yearning to become a historic president, to expand US territory.This is the tragedy of the people of Greenland: when they finally get the leverage to assert their dignity and demand recognition from their old master, they are confronted with a new, much stronger and more ruthless colonial master. And all of this is happening in a new geopolitical era, where an old phrase from Thucydides seems to describe the worldview of today’s rulers: “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”Rune Lykkeberg is editor-in-chief of the Danish newspaper InformationExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDenmarkColonialismDonald TrumpEuropeUS foreign policyTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But I don’t believe the regime will fallAnonymousI wish I were wrong, but all I see is a paranoid state digging inTue 20 Jan 2026 07.09 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 07.12 ESTShareIran is caught in yet another round of widespread civil unrest. These lines are written amid an internet blackout and I didn’t know if I’d be able to send them out. Ever since the 2009 post-election uprising, sporadic outbursts of public anger have become somewhat the order of the day, mostly silenced – brutally for a while – only to fester and uncork again on another occasion.The street protest is not the sole medium through which opposition has tried to convey its dissent. Iranians have tried everything – be it the very narrow and funnelled channel of elections between thelimited choicesoffered by the state, or on social media, in universities and at public events. The demand for meaningful change is repeated through different means, again and again, yet to no avail. Ever since the 2000s, the Iranian state heeds little in the way of democratic demands. And when there has been a narrow crack in the state bulwark, the likes of Donald Trump – by the reimposition of sanctions andviolating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action– sabotaged and derailed civil attempts at reforming the Islamic republic.And here we are again. Many of us Iranians grapple with the feeling that our agency counts for little. The dilemma we face does not stop here. Not only are many of us unrepresented inside Iran, but also among its opposition. For many, the man who is talked about as the main opponent to the Islamic republic, the heir to Iran’s former monarchical tyrant,Reza Pahlavi, is not our cup of tea. The sheer idea of returning to dictatorship and one-man power, secular though he might well be, makes one’s hair stand, let alone returning tohim, widely seen asan Israeli stooge, surrounded by anti-democratic forces, patriarchal to his core, inexperienced and distanced from Iranian society by his expat status.What is more, there is a high chance that the unpredictable man in the White House, drunk with his exhibition of power in Caracas, couldmilitarily intervene. And that could be an act sure to lead to an extended period of violence and probably years of war. Trump has shown that despite his “America first” rhetoric he is willing to toy with the idea of reincarnating a new form of western imperialism. He hesitates little to use military means for political ends. His threats and “big, beautiful” presence cast a shadow over any discussion, and how ugly his words about us are: the orientalist image of west Asians as barbaric people who cannot move their country in the right direction and, indeed, need a white saviour in the shape of a Marvel hero, Captain America. At any rate, the memory of his recent bombardment of Iran is still fresh, and it is not one many of us remember fondly.Iran cannot be bombed into democracy. But it can be helped to find its way there | Simon TisdallRead moreThis is another sorry episode for Iran, and I inhabit a social bubble mostly formed of academically educated individuals who, so far as I can tell via limited means of communication, view this episode with trepidation. Now, the streets are no longer the stage for protest, but when they were, it wasmessy, bloody and apocalyptic. The funeral of 100 policemen was held last week at Tehran University, and only God knows how many protesters have met their demise in return. This level of violence is unprecedented, and such spectacles scare many.We are not strangers to revolution in Iran. We still live through the repercussions of the last revolution in 1979. And precisely because of that, many of us are fearful. The collapse of the state is disruptive. It begets violence and uncertainty. It scares people into migration; thus, nothing to be looking forward to.And the possibility of the Islamic republic collapsing is far-fetched. This political entity has roots in many social groups and a dedicated base that will stick with it through thick and thin. The Islamic republic is likely to remain, and one can assume when it is presented with such massive and widespread demonstration – backed by foreign powers – its paranoia gains fresh currency. The state starts to see itself under existential threat, putting up its guard and more vociferously relegating any voice for change. Which, of course, leads to another round of civil unrest in the near future. Unless the Iranian state begins giving way to meaningful, fundamental changes, what one can see awaiting Iran is repetitive recursion of social unrest on the one side, and shows of force by the state on the other. A circle of attrition whereby the country erodes and sinks down, instead of moving towards a democratic form of politics.I can’t remember a time like this at any point in my life, where I felt so downcast and pessimistic about the future of my country. It is sad, yet I never wished I was wrong in my pessimism moreso than I do now.The writer lives in IranDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is a historic moment – and a time to actTue 20 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 07.45 ESTShareAEuropean-wide chorus of resistance, ledthis morningby Keir Starmer, has greeted Donald Trump’s plan totake over Greenland, by force if necessary, and to start a tariff war if any country stands in his way. Have no doubt, this is a moment: if pursued as a non-negotiable demand, Trump’s plan ends any lingering hope that the liberal rules-based order can stumble on through his remaining time in office. The real question now is whether the 2020s will be defined by the complete collapse of the order’s already crumbling pillars and the atrocities accompanying it, or whether an international coalition of the willing can come together to build a new global framework in its place.For, in quick succession, the US has abandoned its longstanding championing of the rule of law, human rights, democracy and the territorial integrity of nation states. Gone is its erstwhile support for humanitarian aid and environmental stewardship. Gone, too, is the founding principle of the postwar settlement: that countries choose diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over aggression and unilateral action. We cannot doubt any longer that the president meant it when he said he doesn’t “need international law”, and that the only constraint on his exercise of power would be “my own morality, my own mind”.Indeed, in the past few weeks, every single promise of the US-ledAtlantic charter, authored by Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, which foreshadowed theUnited Nations charterand which includes “freedom of the high seas”, free trade and freedom from colonial aggrandisement, has seemingly been cast aside. For Trump, as his political adviser Stephen Miller tells us, the world is to be “governed by strength … by force ... [and] by power”.But if Greenland marks the end of the world looking to the US for leadership, it has also become the moment for Europe and the democracies of the global south to lift their heads out of the sand. They, and other democracies, should now set out a new statement of values and rules that show how we will champion peace, stability and justice, and deliver meaningful progress in areas where international cooperation is essential. AsKeir Starmer hasargued,reaffirmedby the attorney general at the80th anniversary celebrationof the United Nations in Londonon Saturday, this now means reinvigorating, for a new age and new challenges, the enduring shared values on which the post‑1945 institutions were founded.So how to proceed? The democracies of the world should draft a short values statement, echoing the UN charter’s starting point – “We the peoples …” – and this time showing we mean it. Its first section would assert our full support for self-determination and the mutual recognition of nation states; for the outlawing of war and coercion; and for the primacy of law, civil rights and democratic accountability as the essential means by which human dignity is advanced. A second section would outline the rules that govern the cooperation essential to guarantee food, water and security, economic opportunity and social justice, and climate resilience and health for all, including pandemic prevention.View image in fullscreenUN secretary general António Guterres with Keir Starmer at 10 Downing Street, London, 16 January 2026.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/ReutersSuch a charter should make it clear that no one need apply for the vacant leadership of the global order for, in our new multipolar world, power has to be shared among countries, each with vastly different traditions, ethnicities and ideologies. But neither can the new world acquiesce in what the US, Russia and China now threaten: a return to the19th-century arenaof spheres of influence and great-power domination.Instead, we have to ask how we can advance multilateral cooperation in a multipolar world, and so a charter has to take fully into account what has fundamentally changed long before the Trump presidency, and what was never considered seriously in the constitutions of 1945: the existential nature of the climate crisis; the rightful demands for gender equality; the modern threat of terrorism and the role of other non-state actors, including those with vast concentrations of accumulated wealth and technological power. Also the previously neglected but now rising aspirations of the global south; and perhaps most of all, the need to reach across borders to reflect our increased and inescapable interdependence.For one thing seems clear: the truth is that an “America first”, us-versus-them, nationalist politics that despises international cooperation does not have the support of the global public. In fact, they are ahead of leaders in understanding that the sheer extent of our dependence on each other gives us no other option but to work together. And whether it be the stranglehold China has through its monopoly of rare earths, or the maritime choke points that canclose downthe Strait of Hormuz and other trade corridors, we know that to prevent interdependence being weaponised in hostile ways, the rest of us must act together.We have arrived at a moment of truth for Europe. For too long, its voice has been silent as the Trump administration hasviolatedinternationally agreed trade rules; savagelyslashedinternational development aid; and threatenedCanadian,PanamanianandMexicanneighbours. This month, Trump’s US iswalking out of66 international organisations, most of which the US itself had created, while at the same time making the momentous decision to constitute an alternative, a “board of peace”, with a remit for interventions far beyond Gaza, and with membership offered to about 60 favoured states, including Russia.But no global initiative can hope to command wide support or be seen as legitimate if it is merely elites agreeing how to balance their power. And any new charter has to make the connection between meeting local needs and aspirations and the global cooperation that can bring this about. We need to reaffirm for a new generation the need for equality of opportunity and fairness of outcomes, and for what Roosevelt called thefour freedoms– of speech and worship, from want and from fear.Years from now the history books will tell us that Trump could have declared a quick victory in negotiations over Greenland – accepting theDanish offerof virtually unlimited military bases and access to Greenland’s25 critical minerals. But,to quotethe Danish foreign minister after his Washington talks: “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland.” With that Trump has truly signalled the end of the era when people in every continent saw the US as “a shining city on the hill”.That does not mean the US cannot lead again. In his 1961 inaugural address, President John F Kennedysaidwe must build “a new world of law where the strong are just and the weak are secure and the peace preserved”. That is a path the US, and the world, must walk again.Gordon Brown is the UN’s special envoy for global education and was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsOpinionGreenlandKeir StarmerDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

In return you’ll get a report (sometimes generated by AI) outlining your food sensitivities, metabolic fitness, and what pathogens or fungi you’re harbouring.These at-home gut microbiome tests or “GI mapping” kits are frequently promoted by influencers as a way to “hack your health” and “take control” through analysing some of the trillions of organisms that live in your digestive tract.But how much can an at-home gut test really tell you, and are they actually worth doing?Even experts struggle to interpret at-home microbiome testsProf Rupert Leong, a gastroenterologist and microbiome researcher based at Macquarie university hospital, is increasingly seeing patients alarmed by gut microbiome reports they don’t understand.Leong said depending on what is being analysed, gut microbiome testing can be “very powerful and accurate” in detecting microbial markers. But interpreting what those markers mean for an individual remains a major challenge, and different labs vary in their methodology, leading to differing results.“We are still in the infancy of understanding how to interpret them,” he said.Crunch time: are freeze-dried fruit and veg actually healthy to eat or just chips in a different form? | AntiviralRead moreIf a gut microbiome test is ordered by a specialist doctor or accredited dietitian with a clear clinical reason, sent to a reputable lab, and interpreted by someone trained to make sense of the results, it can be genuinely helpful.Leong recently saw a patient with inflammatory bowel disease and rectal bleeding who had already undergone standard medical tests. The microbiome results, in that case, helped confirm dietary issues and guide further treatment once simple and important issues had been ruled out.But these cases are the exception, he said.A healthy mix of organisms in one person could be problematic in another; “The same organism has different species and acts differently in different individuals,” Leong said.It means for the vast majority of people who order these tests online, and who may be curious about their gut health or wondering about their symptoms or foods to avoid, “there are no translatable benefits” to ordering a test, he said.Temporary dietary changes, medications or illness could all affect the results, and what those results actually mean for an individual’s health outcomes isn’t well understood.False alarms can cause distressOne of Leong’s patients who took a commercial home test came to him panicking about bowel cancer after the report suggested she had certain inflammatory markers.Leong said a colonoscopy remains the definitive test to investigate bowel polyps and cancers. The free home bowel screening test issued by the Australian government, which looks for hidden blood in stool, is an evidence-based way to detect early warning signs of bowel cancer and may prompt follow-up testing, including a colonoscopy.And while some home gut microbiome tests claim to offer insights into metabolism or inflammation, “very few experts can use these results appropriately at present,” Leong said, including gastroenterologists.This is because clinicians aren’t trained to interpret the complex outputs the tests generate, the science is still developing, and there aren’t clear guidelines on what to do with the information.The illusion of controlAt-home microbiome tests are spruiked by online influencers as a way of empowering people who want more insights into their health. But Dr Erica Zurawski, an assistant professor in environmental studies, said this encourages consumers to internalise health responsibility while giving their personal data to large for-profit companies.More kissing, less kimchi: seven surprising ways to boost your gut healthRead moreHer researchhas examined howdirect‑to‑consumer microbiomeare often pitched “as a wholesale solution to myriad health issues when, in fact, they oversimplify the complexity of the inner workings of the gut, its malleability, and the impact external factors have on it,” she said.It makes people feel they are doing something wrong, “while the underlying issues that cause poor gut health,” including the influence of harmful industries and government policies, are “side-stepped,” she said.“Thiscomplexity gets smoothed over and ignored… testing kits fail to account for things such as stress, pollution, or access to meaningful health care to address adjacent health issues.”Back to basicsSo how can you actually support gut health?Leong says: “A diverse diet, high in fibre” is a sensible place to start.Zurawski adds that governments have a responsibility to address the broader social and environmental conditions that influence gut health, including poverty, housing, pollution, and access to affordable, nutritious food.If you are experiencing gut symptoms or concerns, Leong recommends seeing a qualified dietitian or GP before jumping to expensive, at-home testing.Melissa Davey is Guardian Australia’s medical editorAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

We must fight and win itRayner urges Starmer to keep promise on leasehold reformTue 20 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 13.29 ESTShareAt cabinet last Tuesday the prime minister reportedly made a powerful case for a government that serves the interests of those struggling to get by. He is right. The cost of living emergency is the issue of our time.It is a crisis not months, but years in the making. For more than two decades, living standards have been crushed and there is an increasing sense of a country where people cannot get on, of a system stacked against them.In the face of this deep-set disillusionment,Labourin government has been at its best when challenging the status quo. By standing firm in the face of established interests who have had it their own way for decades – that’s exactly what the landmark Employment Rights Act and Renters’ Rights Act have done, delivering new protections for millions.And now, this government has a fresh opportunity to show whose side it is on – by ending the scandal of unregulated and unaffordable ground rents faced by leaseholders, as we pledged in our manifesto.Millions of people suffering from this scandal expect action in the imminent draftleasehold and commonhold reform bill. Many of them are young families who have tried to do everything right. They entered the jobs market in the teeth of a great recession; they endured the worst collapse in living standards in generations; and they scrimped and saved and managed to get their foot on the housing ladder.Yet despite owning their home, they hand out hundreds, and in some cases thousands of pounds a year in ground rents to unaccountable investors, often from overseas, for the right to occupy the land on which the home they live in was built. Unlike service charges, leaseholders get nothing in return for these payments. And for many this is made worse because the rates at which they pay can escalate with total impunity, in some cases doubling every five to 10 years.In the past, ground rents were of a low or a symbolic peppercorn value. Over recent decades, though, ordinary homeowners have been charged high and escalating amounts of ground rent, leaving them in financial distress and often unable to sell or remortgage their homes.The Competition and Markets Authority has found that nearly 1m leases have one of these escalating or onerous ground-rent clauses. Where they are replaced, it’s often made even worse, with a formula pegged to inflation, leading to huge and unpredictable increases for hard-pressed homeowners.All this misery for ordinary homeowners to do nothing more than sustain the unearned income stream of unaccountable investors – it’s not right.Labour made a promise to leaseholders that we would fix this injustice, but ministers are currently subjected to furious lobbying from wealthy investors trying to water down this manifesto commitment.There are those who argue we cannot act on our promise as it could risk a backlash from investors, including pension funds. It’s hardly surprising – the system works just fine for them. They get an annual return for doing absolutely nothing, they can raise ground rents and pile up service charges without transparency, with total impunity, regardless of the devastation it causes to families.But only a very small amount of UK pension fund assets are actually dependent on ground rents. The government’s own figuressuggest this could even be below 1%and easily absorbable. They are also niche investments with little risk to wider investor confidence. In any case, this unproductive investment does nothing to grow our economy. Incentivising investors to move towards productive investments – such as infrastructure, technology and capital to help businesses scale up – is exactly what we should be doing to promote growth.As things stand, this Labour government has a record on leasehold reform we can be proud of. We have already switched on a range of new protections and rights for leaseholders. Our draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill can move us on from the feudal leasehold system – but not without meaningful action to tackle ground rents; at the very least, an annual cash cap.If Labour cannot fix such an obvious injustice and show families whose living standards have been crushed that we will fight for them, then we shouldn’t be surprised if they lose faith that anything can change.This battle is a symbol of so much more. It is about whose side we are on, and who we are in government to fight for. Last week the prime minister powerfully made that case at cabinet. Now it is on all of us in government and parliament to deliver on it – so let’s get the job done.Angela Rayner is the Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and a former deputy prime ministerExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionLeaseholdPropertyLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

At time of writing,the storyabout his Instagram broadside against his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, accusing them of treating him as a commercial prop all his life was by far, far and away the best read on the Guardian site, as well as the most deeply read. Again, I’m glad this blow-up wasn’t used as geopolitical cover, because if there was a time for Trump to invade Greenland largely unnoticed, maybe this was it.Whoever wrote Brooklyn’s intercontinental ballistic Instagram – and it wasn’tthe childlike authorial voicebehind regular “I always choose you baby … me and you forever baby” posts to his wife – the sentiments will be his. Here’s a sample: “My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family ‘love’ is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp …”Wow: elephants.Brooklyn Beckham can’t photograph thembut he sure can address them when they’re in the room. If you watched Victoria Beckham’s lavishly produced Netflix documentary last October, you might have wondered why it didn’t even glance on the biggest elephant in Brand Beckham’s room:the clear and agonising no-contact riftwith their eldest son that has been festering since last year and beyond. But most big documentaries these days aren’t documentaries any more in the way previous practitioners of the craft might have understood the word. As her husband’s was before it, Victoria’s doc was a self-commissioned advertorial on which the subject also served as executive producer. This is the haute version of the curated, public-facing existence that defines our dysfunctional age, but it trickles all the way down via fourth-tier influencers and that friend of yours who can’t stop posting about her perfect life. The Beckhams, at the vanguard of celebrity culture ever since both it and they exploded in the late 90s, are a part of how we all got here.Before I go on, I should say I find this family rift desperately sad. I can’t imagine the agony of being cut off by a child, and hope I never have to. All parents make mistakes, and all children do too. I believe the Beckhams truly and deeply love their children – but, to adaptLogan Roy, they have made it hard for them to be serious people.12:46Beckham feud: why has Brooklyn gone nuclear? | The LatestBrooklyn Beckham has been commodified since he was a foetus. The story of Victoria’s pregnancy was sold by his parents. When he was born, David and Victoria sold the first pictures of him. They sold intimate looks around their home and his nursery. They sold their wedding, staying up till 3am on the night of that big day, deciding which pictures would be featured in OK! magazine. They sold everything – mostly, back then, to OK!. Its proprietor,Richard Desmond, wrote in his autobiographyabout spending what felt like every Friday at Victoria’s parents’ house with the young couple, where they would all “plot and plan the next features we’d do”. A huge cheque was always involved, and the Beckhams wanted the limelight – all of it – so much.But as time went on, David and Victoria acquired more sophisticated advisers who understood the rapidly morphing potential of controlling image and brand, and built a vast and diversified empire for them off the back of it. When social media came along, the Beckhams channelled their business through its pipes.As I’ve written here before, they were past masters at not simply turning to their children and telling them they loved them, but photographing them, tagging them and sending the message of love via social media. Alchemically lucrative – but an accident waiting to happen?I honestly think the Beckhams are now so lost to this commercialised version of family life that they probably long ago lost the ability to comprehend how weird and potentially corrosive it is. I keep thinking of the line in Goodfellas where the mafia wife Karen says: “And after a while it got to be all normal.” And maybe there is something rather “family” with a capital F about the Beckham mob. The trouble is, with families not being meritocracies, every now and then the gene pool is going to throw up a Fredo Corleone or a Christopher Moltisanti who just isn’t suited to the weird life, and can only play out as a liability. Again, as covered here before, it has happened a couple of times with that other deeply strange family business, the Windsors.The Windsors, of course, don’t have a choice. The Beckhams’ wealth is estimated at abouthalf a billion. That is more money than even they could ever spend, and the only truly credible explanation for why they continue to live their life so remorselessly out loud is because they still crave the attention. And, realistically, because they have forgotten how else to live.They are the unicorns of this lifestyle, but not exactly alone. Some of us have always been Instagram and Facebook refuseniks, and never publicly posted pictures of our lives or families or any of it. But it’s not the norm, and billions of people have entirely forgivably got sucked into a world where they are the product, where they work for free for the tech lords, who successfully devalued the idea of privacy at the altar of their big lie: that “being connected” via their networks is far more important than privacy; that it is a win for humanity; that it is social. But it isn’t. Societies are in a mess. Literacy’s in a mess. Young people’s mental health is in a mess. The world’s in far more of a mess than it was when the techlords found it.I see Keir Starmer’s thinking aboutbanning social mediafor under-16s, so maybe someone could stick an amendment on any bill, banning parents from plastering their kids all over it from the moment they’re born. Maybe they can’t meaningfully consent to working in Mark Zuckerberg’s content mines any more than celebrity kids can meaningfully consent to being monetised by their parents. Or maybe all those ships have sailed.As for what David and Victoria Beckham will do, David waspictured at Davosthis morning. Encouraging times. But clearly they will also be locked in crisis talks, and my bet is that they’ll issue a statement saying how much they love Brooklyn and always will, and something like how there will always be a place waiting for him at their family table. And I truly believe all that. As someone behind the scenes will say as the team approves it, it’sauthentic. But even that word has been corrupted, hasn’t it? It has come to suggest a monetisable easy charm, an ability to make staged commercial situations seem appealing, an instinctive capability of embodying a brand or a lifestyle. We live in an age of dangerous slippage, from private to public, from living to trading, from the idea of ourselves as agents of free will to unpaid and unwitting products. Not to interrupt his brief main character moment – but Brooklyn Beckham’s the least of it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Or was he trying to answer the challenge of the moment, which many of his former colleagues simply preferred to ignore?This is politics we’re talking about, so there is no doubt that personal ambition played its part in last week’s events. But the real danger to the Tory party of Jenrick’s defection is that it encourages its complacency, with the wing of the party that never liked Jenrick seeing his departure as an opportunity to retreat to its comfort zone.Kemi Badenoch handled the defection about as well as she could have, and deserves the plaudits. Her position as leader of the party is much more secure than it was a week ago, and not just because her most obvious rival has left it.Leaked Jenrick defection plan calls him ‘the new sheriff in town’Read moreThe Tory ship is still on stormy waters, and one reef is clearly visible. MPs on the left of the party have made no bones about their hopes that this departure will lead to a change of course, and this has been echoed andamplifiedbyeditorialsin sympathetic newspapers such as the Times.For this Tory tendency, Jenrick’s departure is the vindication of good tactics, but poor strategy. Like him or not, he was the focus of the2024 leadership contest; the final decision boiled down to “Robert Jenrick” or “Not Robert Jenrick”, and Badenoch adroitly positioned herself to scoop up the larger pool of “Not Robert Jenrick” votes.The problem is that Jenrick’s critics didn’t, and don’t, have an alternative diagnosis of what ails the party or the country – they just know that they don’t like his prescriptions. The choice in November 2024 thus resembled nothing so much as the choice between getting out of bed and hitting the snooze button. And as anyone who hates mornings will tell you, the snooze button doesn’t make the alarm clock, or the world, go away.Hence the endless attempts to insist that theConservativeslost the 2024 general election not because of any intellectual, ideological, or even policy shortcoming, but on “competence”, a pseudo-profundity that implodes at the slightest serious inquiry. Was it incompetent to oversee an increase in immigration, or to promise not to? To endlessly raise taxes, or to say they’d cut them? To shut more than 20 prisons, or to talk tough on law and order?Dig into those issues, or any other possible manifestation of lack of “competence”, and you get to the two things to which today’s Conservative party is deeply allergic: discussion of serious divisions in philosophy and policy, and the risk of embarrassing former ministers who now sit in the shadow cabinet.Whatever the balance of his motivations, there was enough truth in that part of Jenrick’s broadside against his former party for the blows to land. Badenoch stood for the leadership promising a thorough interrogation of the party’s failures in office, and then pivoted smoothly to insisting it had already taken place.Jenrick’s opponents clearly hope that his departure is an opportunity for a return to something. But to what? A Conservative party that runs on promises to cut taxes and immigration while taking both to historic highs? That it managed to get four terms of office out of saying things but not meaning them was remarkable; there is no future in chasing a fifth.It is a sad fact of democracy that politics must be conducted with reference to the electorate. There has always been a tendency in the Tory party which insisted that if onlyNigel Faragewere ignored, he and his various parties would simply go away.This was understandable, if not wise, when he was merely topping the polls in European elections. But Reform UK has been leading the national polls for months. A “mainstream party of the right” needs the right, as well as the mainstream; the alternative is shrivelling into a rump party for people who take themselves too seriously to be Liberal Democrats.However much she might dislike Jenrick personally, Badenoch cannot do without the Conservative members and voters he – until the end the most popular member of the shadow cabinet in ConservativeHome’sleague table– represented.Nor can she afford to retreat into the politics of word over deed that Jenrick’s bitterest critics seem too often to favour. Their triumphalism over the weekend has been a gift to Farage, reinforcing Jenrick’s charges even as Badenoch tried to rebut them. Her future now depends on proving not merely her critics, but her most voluble and least helpful supporters, wrong.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionRobert JenrickConservativesNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Our suburban streets doubled as rinks; the choppy slap of tennis balls reverberating against hockey sticks a constant sound. As pre-teens, my friends and I would put on lip gloss and tight jeans to hang out at the Friday night junior hockey games. I still find comfort in the sound of skate blades slicing across ice and that sweaty, chemical odour of public arenas.My experiences are not unique in a country with a 95-year-old broadcast institution calledHockeyNight in Canada. Rachel Reid, the Nova Scotian author of the queer hockey romance Heated Rivalry, grew up a hockey fanatic, more interested in playing the game than ogling boys. Jacob Tierney, who wrote and directed the TV adaptation of Reid’s 2019 bestseller, was raised in Montreal, where the Canadiens (or the Habs, as the team is affectionately known) are considered sacred.This is not to romanticise a sport fraught with a history ofracism, misogyny andhomophobia. In July last year, six months before Heated Rivalry aired and became a cultural juggernaut, five junior hockey players wereacquitted of sexual assault. And there still isn’t an openly gay player in the National Hockey League (NHL). The NHL released an innocuous statement acknowledging the show’s popularity but not the issues it addresses: “There are so many ways to get hooked on hockey and, in the NHL’s 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans. See you all at the rink.”Reid and Tierney combined their adoration of our national sport and reimagined its possibilities for those of us who can’t get past its toxic culture. Heated Rivalry may be a tender romance with plenty of butt shots, but it is also an outsider tale that resonates with how many Canadians view themselves in the world. We are often at our best when we tell stories from the periphery. Schitt’s Creek is a classic outsider comedy, as is the delightful Inuit-led North of North.Politically, the series couldn’t be more perfectly timed. Last year, “Elbows Up!” became a rallying cry adopted by Canadian prime minister Mark Carney to express national solidarity in the wake of US president Donald Trump’s tariffs war and threats to annex Canada as the 51st state. The slogan comes from hockey legend Gordie Howe and his signature move, using his mighty elbows both as protection and as a weapon against his opponents.I would argue that Tierney, in shielding the books’ eroticism and heart, kept his elbows up while making Heated Rivalry. In interviews, he’s spoken about pitching the series to studios who wanted to make major changes, such as playing down the sex or shifting the perspective away from the main characters, Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, played by Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie. The show maintains its Canadianisms: Ilya serving Shane his favourite ginger ale feels particularly Canuck, as does the iconic trip to the cottage.View image in fullscreenLeft, Shane Hollander, played by Hudson Williams, and Ilya Rozanov, played by Connor Storrie, in Heated Rivalry.Photograph: Sphere Abacus/PABeyond all the Hollywood shoutouts and photo-ops with Williams and Storrie, I have observed swelling pride that Heated Rivalry is an all-Canadian production. Americans who refer to it as an HBO Max show on social media are quickly corrected that it was produced by Crave, a Canadian-based streaming service. It’s also very Canadian to see people posting how happy they are that their tax dollars are going toward the show through the public Canadian Media Fund and other granting agencies.Tourism agencies are also having a ball. For once, they get to promote their own cities and towns as they exist, and not as transformed locations for American productions. Ottawa Tourism changed its social media bio to the “birthplace of Shane Hollander,” and Hamilton, Ontario, where some of the series was shot, has been marketing the locations. It’s refreshing to see conservative cities promote themselves through queer stories.At the Golden Globes on 11 January, Storrie and Williams gave a cheeky shoutout onstage to the mums and daughters who watch the show. A week before it aired, I attended a fan event at a local romance bookstore in Toronto. Among the hundreds of people lined up to meet Reid, Storrie and Williams were those moms and daughters and other fans of the books. Reid was already a star to them even though, like most romance authors, she works outside of the traditional literary establishment. Even her publisher Harlequin was caught off guard by the depth of the fandom and had to scramble to keep up with demand. Weeks before the premiere, I visited four bookstores before I found a single copy.This is also a destructive Canadian trait: as self-declared underdogs, we often do not trust or invest in our own artists until there’s commercial success stateside. Indigo, Canada’s only national book chain,just announcedthat sales for Heated Rivalry are up 5,805% since the show aired. A day after announcing Reid’s next book in the series, Unrivaled, it became Indigo’s biggest pre-order romance title to date. The chain also predicts it will have the year’s highest book sales.Heated Rivalry is a phenomenon like I have never witnessed in the two decades I’ve been covering arts and culture. This week I’ve seen Instagram ads for local Heated Rivalry queer dance parties, drag brunches, trivia nights, comedy and art-making events. But I hope we get those elbows up and embrace new stories, too. Right now there’s an energetic social media campaign to bring Crave’s upcoming series Slo Pitch, about a lesbian slow-pitch beer league, to American HBO Max.Sue Carter is a Toronto-based freelance writer and arts workerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It can feel like a betrayal of self, a betrayal of values, and certainly a betrayal of one’s community or cause.Nor is it sensible to expect it of everyone. But we must demand it of the custodians of our culture. This is the way forward.SA premier ‘fundamentally opposed’ Randa Abdel-Fattah appearing at Adelaide writers’ week, letter to board showsRead moreOur own problems are, frankly, at the lower end of difficulty. We are, after all, an extraordinarily safe community, even given recent events.I remember another writers’ festival I attendedin Myanmarin 2015, during what proved to be a brief interregnum of a moderately authoritarian regime between brutally repressive ones.There, among the writers, were those who had cooperated with the previous regime, even written its propaganda, alongside those who had been jailed and tortured by that regime.Understandably almost every day one group or the other had threatened to walk out if the other were not cancelled. There was nothing cosy or comfortable or culturally “safe” about the exchanges.Yet the festival proceeded, the exchanges were had, and there was no violence. That was a very good thing – a shining moment in history, perhaps. Within Myanmar the memory remains a talisman of hope.So what do we mean by freedom of speech?Consider two statements. In 2014, George Brandis – then attorney general – said in parliament that people have “the right to be bigots”.Thirty-two years earlier, one of his predecessors, Justice Lionel Murphy, said in a high court judgment that Percy Neal, an Indigenous man and chair of the Yarrabah Aboriginal council in northern Queensland, was “entitled to be an agitator”. He had been sentenced to jail for spitting at and verbally abusing a white man.“If he is an agitator, he is in good company,” said Murphy, before going on to quote Oscar Wilde: “Agitators are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them … Without them, in our incomplete state, there would be no advance towards civilisation.”Both Brandis’s remarks and those of Murphy concerned freedom of speech. And they illustrate what it does and doesn’t mean.A right to freedom of speech is fundamental, though most of us, including myself, recognise there are limits around inciting hatred and violence. And so we should.But it is not a right to be taken seriously, to be regarded with respect, or to have others refrain from disagreeing with you. Nor is it a right to be “platformed”, to use the ugly modern verb.A bigot is entitled to be a bigot, but part of moral political and cultural leadership is to make clear that some speech is not to be admired or respected or given a privileged place.And part of such leadership is to recognise that the speech of the oppressed will rarely be polite, or comfortable.That is why we have editors, directors, curators and boards – of the ABC, of art galleries, of media publications and writers’ festivals. They make the judgments on who deserves not only to speak but to be in a privileged position to be heard.They have a greater responsibility than ordinary citizens to tolerate and “platform” uncomfortable views.Call this social cohesion? The war of words that laid waste to the 2026 Adelaide writers’ festivalRead moreTo take the current example, Randa Abdel-Fattah is an agitator, in Murphy’s words. As she is entitled to be. She is also a writer of many years’ standing, and an academic, who has recently written a favourably reviewed novel that directly addresses some of the issues that have placed such a strain on our public life.She is a perfectly reasonable person to invite to a writers’ festival, in my view. Which is not to say I agree witheverything she has saidand done. It should be obvious that that is not the point.Likewise, Thomas Friedman is a Pulitzer prize winner and a weekly columnist for the New York Times.His record justified an invitation to the festival in 2024, though I was horrified by the repugnant column that prompted Abdel-Fattah and others to petition he be removed.We might accuse Abdel-Fattah of being a hypocrite for seeking to remove him, while defending her own right to speak. Similarly, pro-Israel activists who sought to cancel her, while defending their own right to speak, might be regarded as hypocritical too.For both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel activists, allowing the other to be “platformed” without protest must be close to impossible – an assault to the sense of self and, yes, an assault to “cultural safety”.But the custodians of cultural life must meet a high standard. They must be up to the largely thankless and extremely difficult job of practical implementation of freedom of speech. That is, exercising wise judgment and then holding the line.The problems we have seen – at the ABC, at Bendigo, at Adelaide and elsewhere – flow from custodians who have not understood this, or not been up to the job.Sadly governments have been very careless in appointing the boards of cultural institutions. Sometimes such positions have been used as rewards to cronies. Or they appoint nice people, who crumble under pressure. Or good people who simply don’t understand the nature of the task.Culture is not necessarily nice. Niceness is not enough. To be a cultural custodian takes intellectual rigour, moral muscle and courage.Governments must take notice. These jobs should be held by the best of us. The judgment, strength and courage required are extraordinary. Yet on them the health of our national conversation, our democracy and the nature of our country depends.Margaret Simons is an award-winning freelance journalist and author.

She’s extolling the virtues of the high-street baker after I jokingly suggested that’s what she could have for lunch, now she’s back in the UK from her base in Los Angeles. Despite being Stateside for the best part of a decade, she has lost none of her Manchester twang or sense of humour.“You know what I love about Greggs?” she asks, leaning in. “In each city, they have something specific to that place. So in London, they’ve got the Tottenham cake. Manchester’s got the Eccles cake. In Liverpool, they’ve got the scouse pie. In Newcastle, they’ve got … a ton of breads. You can’t get them anywhere else!”You don’t appreciate the cost people pay to assimilate into a country, the tax on their spiritMosaku learned all about Greggs’regional delicacieswhile touring her first play, straight out of Rada back in 2007. She played “the World” in The Great Theatre of the World,a 17th-century mystery play, and it took her all over the country.

This is who I am’ … Mosaku in Sinners.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe fame has brought levels of attention that aren’t always welcome. Mosaku announced she was pregnant with her second child in Vogue, to coincide with the Golden Globes – in part to put to bed growing speculation. “In my Nigerian culture,” she wrote, “we don’t really announce this kind of news. It’s meant to be protected. Everything in me resists sharing it publicly – not because I’m not grateful or joyful, but because this feels like one of the few things that truly belongs to me.”Mosaku managed to hide her first pregnancy while playing the lead in ITV’ssupernatural police procedural Passengers(think Happy Valley meets The X-Files). But this time, with the heightened attention brought by Sinners, she was under pressure to announce. “I was really against it,” says Mosaku. “But then I thought, If I’m gonna do it, I want to do it with the caveat that I say, ‘I don’t want to do this, but I feel like Ihave tobecause you all comment on our bodies.’” She’d watched her Sinners co-star Hailee Steinfeld endure months of speculation before telling her Instagram followers she was expecting a baby with her husband, NFL star Josh Allen.This is new territory for Mosaku, who broke through after winning a Bafta for her performance asDamilola Taylor’s mother Gloriain a 2017 BBC drama, before moving to the US, where she has oscillated between Marvel epicLokiand grittier fare, such as David Simon’s 2022 police corruption seriesWe Run This City.It could all have been so different. Mosaku’s parents, both academics, moved their family to Manchester from Zaria, Nigeria, when Mosaku was one. Later in life, she considered following their path by becoming a maths professor. She had a university place but decided to try acting, and auditioned for Rada instead. Her father wasn’t too enthusiastic but her mother backed the decision. “If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be here,” says Mosaku matter of factly. Her mother gave her £30, which was enough for her to get to London and back on the Megabus and buy some food.But the pair made a pact: if Mosaku didn’t get a place at Rada, she’d be off to uni in Durham to study maths and economics. “No one thought I’d get in,” she says, but she impressed the panel by playing Helena from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Queen Margaret from Richard III, and various parts from Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.Moving to London wasn’t easy. Chorlton-cum-Hardy, the south Manchester suburb Mosaku grew up in, might be characterised as a leafy middle-class enclave today, full of BBC execs pushing up house prices, but that wasn’t her family’s experience. Although Mosaku’s parents were academics in Nigeria, in the UK life was very different. Neither could find work in their desired fields of architecture and chemistry – so made do with what they could. Money was in short supply. “We were on the council estate,” says Mosaku. “My mum worked really, really hard. We were definitely one of those families that, if someone rang the doorbell, the kids all hid, because you couldn’t say mum was out at work.”View image in fullscreenSuperpowered … Mosaku with fellow Rada alumnus Tom Hiddleston in Loki.Photograph: Chuck Zlotnick/©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights ReservedAll this made the move to Rada fraught. Mosaku was the only black girl in her class, something that wasn’t easy at an institution which, in 2020, admitted it wasinstitutionally racistafterpressure from former students. Mosaku was one of many talented young actors: her future Loki co-stars Tom Hiddleston and Gugu Mbatha-Raw were there at the same time. But she remembers an environment where some teachers struggled to see her as anything more than a bit player. “I never got a lead role,” she says, recalling the time she was cast as a 50-year-old ship captain. “Never got to play an ingénue.”She asks: “Why restrict how I imagined my career? I think teachers are the most important people in a person’s life. They make you either bloom or shrivel away. I was really lucky that I had teachers likeBill Gaskell, who made me believe I could bloom, but I had so many people along the way that made me feel like, ‘Oh, this isn’t for you.’”In Ryan Coogler, she found a kindred spirit. After seeing Mosaku in We Own This City, he thought she’d be perfect as Annie and the pair set up a 30-minute Zoom call that ballooned into an hour-and-a-half heart-to-heart, during which they discussed their motivations and the people who inspired them. “We bonded on our first Zoom about those teachers, the ones who really put you on the path and the ones who nearly got you off it.” (Coogler brought his college professor Rosemary Graham, who told him he should write scripts in Hollywood, toa recent awards show.)Actors often peddle the same few well-polished anecdotes on the awards-season merry-go-round, heaping praise on colleagues. But when Mosaku is asked about Annie, she speaks about it as a transformational experience, like a religious convert testifying to the unanointed.View image in fullscreenDazzling … Mosaku on the red carpet at the Golden Globes earlier this month.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesTo prepare for her role as Annie, who loses a child with one of Michael B Jordan’s twin characters, Mosaku studied Hoodoo, which has its roots in the traditional Yoruba religion brought to America by enslaved Africans. This led to a deep connection with her Yoruba roots – and the language she began learning five years ago finally started to click for her. She likens the experience to an archeologist slowly unearthing a long lost civilisation during an excavation. “Oh,” she said to herself. “This is where I’m from. This is who I am. This is part of my survival.” The other thing that dawned on her was just how detached she had become from her own culture.Mosaku puts this down to her upbringing in Manchester. She should already be fluent in Yoruba, but her parents were discouraged from teaching their children the language because it would give them “funny accents”. For Mosaku, who has playedimmigrants throughout her career, that is the steep price new arrivals pay: people are asked to cut off parts of their own culture to “fit in”.How Sinners became the most culturally important film of 2025Read more“That’s the stuff that’s really important,” she says, becoming noticeably moved. “You don’t appreciate the cost to people, the tax on a person’s spirit in order to assimilate into your country – and for what? It’s superiority. It’s ego. It’s brutal. It’s a cultural genocide.”Does she see herself ever coming back to the UK? “A lot of people make me excited about working in the UK,” she says, listing director Akinola Davies Jr, Joan Iyiola’s Apatan Productions and Bolu Babalola. “I never take my eye off the UK for work,” she adds. “Artistically, I do feel like the work in America has been more satiating. I just want to make sure that in the UK I’m not always playing a police officer, you know?”Ahead are roles in Apple’s This Is How It Goes, alongside Idris Elba, and a part in Aaron Sorkin’s The Social Reckoning, his follow-up toThe Social Network. The jury is still out on whether the UK can keep up, but if she does decide to come back, Greggs will be waiting.Sinners is available to buy or rent nowExplore more on these topicsSinnersMarvelOscarsPeriod and historical filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsAwards and prizesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

She talks about untimely deaths – and being left speechless by Judi DenchTue 20 Jan 2026 09.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 20 Jan 2026 12.15 ESTShareWhitney White is practically swooning. “I have more respect and love for William Shakespeare than I can honestly communicate,” she says on a video call from Stratford-upon-Avon. When she went toHoly Trinity Churchto visit his grave, she says: “I just wept, because the language is so beautiful to me.”White’s first encounter with Shakespeare’s work was in Chicago at high school, where A Midsummer Night’s Dream unleashed her inner “theatre nerd”, she says. “I remember thinking, ‘Shouldn’t all theatre have music and dance and text and fights and be as full as possible?’ Then you grow up and start doing theatre – and we segment the business into musicals and plays.”For so long, we were told that only some people could do these stories. I think that’s not trueExcept that White didn’t. A Tony-nominated director (forJaja’s African Hair Braiding), performer and songwriter, her first exposure to theatre was at her grandfather’s church, which had a 50-strong choir. So it follows that the musicality in Shakespeare is key for her, the metre every bit as valid as the meaning. She realised that when she took a theatre programme at Brown University in Rhode Island. “I was assigned what you call an epic speech. I will never forget the feeling when I finished it. It was like the sky clearing.”Singing was “the first thing I ever did”, she says. “And I was like, ‘Wow, Shakespeare makes me feel the same way. It feels like a song.’” Although she recognises so much of her world in his, she says that: “For so long, we were told that only some people could do these stories. I think that’s not true. I think whoever Shakespeare was, he made them for all of us to be doing them.”View image in fullscreen‘The show is a look at fatal female arcs’ …. another moment from rehearsals.Photograph: Nicola YoungBut as a performer, she found she would only be cast in supporting roles such as the nurse inRomeo and Julietor Maria in Twelfth Night. That was the extent of the diversity of casting 10 years ago. “To be a leading lady still felt reserved for some people – and I think that’s really what kicked all of this off.”She is referring to her boundary-breaking gig-theatre, All Is But Fantasy. About to be staged by theRoyal Shakespeare Companyin two parts, it mixes characters from various Shakespeare plays: Lady Macbeth and Othello’s Emilia in one, Juliet and Richard III in the other.When she began the project, music was paramount. “I readMacbethand I heard rock’n’roll. To me, Lady Macbeth sounded like Tina Turner. She was saying, ‘I want more but the world won’t give me more.’” After a while, White realised: “Wait, I don’t just love Lady Macbeth. My favourite characters are also Juliet, Emilia, Cleopatra. But uh-oh, why do all those women die by act five?”My favourite characters are Lady Macbeth, Juliet, Emilia and Cleopatra. But why do all those women die by act five?For all her adoration of Shakespeare, there is a reframing of these characters and an interrogation of female ambition, power and mortality in the productions. “In the midst of all this, I lost two women in my family and I’m still not OK with how I lost them,” she says. “The show is a look at fatal heterosexual female arcs … I feel like we’re all a little too comfortable with women meeting an untimely end.”The last element she added to the show were the witches from Macbeth, who are front and centre. “As a Black woman, I don’t want to tell this story alone. It’s not just my story. I needed allies on stage to process the trauma and weirdness.” The witches are bossy, funny, humane, and sing in a mix of what sounds like gospel and hymn.“A spell is a prayer, and a witch is a holy woman, right? That didn’t feel like a big leap to me. I also wanted to set the shows in a space in which communal witnessing could happen and that’s the church. If you go to the church I grew up in, the whole community is there, watching. That’s how I was raised, and I don’t understand the world without a community of women watching me, telling me what’s good and what’s bad. My whole life has been my mother and her two sisters guiding me. The three witches are those people – my aunts and my mother are on stage with me every night.”View image in fullscreen‘A spell is a prayer and a witch is a holy woman, right?’Photograph: Nicola YoungHas her relationship to Shakespeare changed after this examination of his women? “It’s complex. If anything, my relationship to ‘us’ has changed becauseOthellois what it is, but why Othello is still relevant is our fault. I think Shakespeare captured something 400 years ago but why haven’twechanged? It’s about us. We’re the problem, not Shakespeare.”At the beginning of her version of Macbeth, she states that “irreverence is everything”. With that in mind, she says: “I have so much reverence for the text that I think it allows me to play with it, because I’ve read and studied and sat with the language and tried to meditate on how the narratives are alive in the newsfeed. That was another big way that I wrote these plays.”So, for example, All Is But Fantasy traces a line between the speech on abused women by Iago’s wife, Emilia, and the rise in domestic abuse during the pandemic and subsequent years. She is trying to take the audience on the ride that her mind went on when she read the plays. “I have an opinion about them that comes from my lived experience and I think I have the right to marry those two things and ask a lot of questions.”To be at the RSC brings a nervousness nonetheless. “I’ve never been more scared in my life, but I’ve also never felt more alive. I met Ian McKellen and Judi Dench and I couldn’t even speak. They have the armoury here where you can pick weapons for the show: think about how many hands have touched those weapons! Being in the church of Shakespeare, I definitely bow down at the altar – but I’d like to add a new song to the mass.”All Is But Fantasy is atthe Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 21 January to 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreWilliam ShakespeareRoyal Shakespeare CompanyMacbethOthelloRomeo and JulietRichard IIIinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Although it’s starting to feel like a different show altogetherHannah J DaviesTue 20 Jan 2026 17.30 ESTShareThe first series of Things You Should Have Done aired on BBC Three in early 2024, a dry and quirky comedy about a recently bereaved “stay at home daughter” from middle England. It was the brainchild of Lucia Keskin, better known online as Chi with a C, and the show marked the then 23-year-old’s transfer from internet comic (her repertoire ranged from parodies of American Horror Story to impressions of Gemma Collins) to TV star. It also came with the co-sign of Roughcut, the production company behind People Just Do Nothing andStath Lets Flats, helmed by The Office producerAsh Atalla.The premise was almost unbearably sad (inept young girl loses her parents in a horrifying car crash and has to navigate life without them, as per a list they left for her), but the end product was zany rather than gloomy. An episode on getting a job saw Chi (Keskin) decamp to a care home, embracing an early retirement in a bid to avoid employment at all, while the chapter devoted to learning to cook ended with two family members being admitted to hospital. The tension between Chi and her bitter aunt Karen (Selin Hizli) was a constant, complete with insults about Chi’s “fat ham hock legs”. Not one but two characters spat into a bowl of pancake mix and no one so much as flinched. And there was a truly unforgettable rendition of Pure and Simple by Popstars winners Hear’Say. The characters tended towards their own nonsensical idiolect and failed to understand the most basic of concepts (see: Chi thinking a breast screening was some kind of peep show), giving the programme more than a dash of Stath-like incompetence. Frequent ghostly appearances by Chi’s dead parents added a sadcom touch, although – wisely – it was never enough to feel truly devastating.Series two opens – major spoiler incoming – with another untimely death in the family, this time of aunt Karen. Presumably Hizli was unavailable (she also stars in the excellentAm I Being Unreasonable?with Daisy May Cooper), otherwise I cannot think of any good reason to have given her the chop. Unfortunately, her absence is glaring – so many of the show’s best scenes involved Karen scheming about how to get the family home back from Chi, or merely making her meek husband Dave’s (Daniel Fearn) life a living nightmare. Her funeral does, at least, tee up some good gags, such as Chi accidentally downloading the template for a best man’s speech instead of a eulogy (“Dave is a very lucky guy today …”). Karen tripped over a vacuum cord at work and fell down 86 steps, leading Chi to believe that her aunt has been reincarnated as a vacuum cleaner. Yet killing off one of the cattiest characters and someone who detested Chi doesn’t make for a particularly emotional storyline – although Keskin does get to say excellent, unhinged lines such as: “My dead auntie is inside this Drift-max cordless IZ900!”View image in fullscreenStarting fights in the food bank … Bridget Christie as Ruth in Things You Should Have Done.Photograph: BBC/Roughcut TV/Jack BarnesThank goodness for Bridget Christie, as a therapist capitalising on Chi’s grief, overstepping all kinds of professional boundaries, and doxing her clients in the process. Ruth isn’t Karen 2.0, but she fills the need for another jittery side character – not least when she gets into a fight while working at a food bank. More good news: Sarah Kendall is back as Sarah Gilbeaux, the down-on-her-luck comic last seen working as a lifeguard, barmaid and compere at a holiday campsite. Juliet Cowan is also very watchable as Dave’s rich and seemingly unstable sister Claudia, who sometimes speaks like Dr Seuss (“Of course I’ve got a horse!”) and is conned by Chi and step-cousin Lucas (Jamie Bisping), who return her cat for a reward before stealing her again. Meanwhile, Keskin remains perfectly gormless as Chi, occasionally aided by miniature versions of her heroes (“Help me, Lily Allen,” she pleads as she tries to figure out what food to donate to charity. “You’re working class, aren’t you?!”)In series one, the fact that the list was a very loose narrative conceit didn’t matter too much, but in series two, it is so loose as to be almost nonexistent, with Ruth now providing the suggestions for Chi based on their therapy sessions. Coupled with no more Karen, Things You Should Have Done now feels like a different show altogether, despite the flashes of brilliance (Keskin did win a Bafta for emerging talent last year, after all). I am still hoping and praying that Karen has faked her own death à laCan You Keep a Secret?, and that she’ll be back someday. But until then, if you want to see a horse – and a cleaner – being liberated to the sound of Spanish one-hit wonders Las Ketchup, boy have I got the show for you.Things You Should Have Done aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTV comedyTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

In terms of straight plot, it’s the story of a man who is drawn into a conspiracy after a chair breaks when he sits on it. But beyond that, it’s honestly anyone’s guess.View image in fullscreenAnyone’s guess … Tim Robinson in The Chair Company.Photograph: HBO/WarnerSo much of it defies logical explanation. Why does that one guy only listen to recordings of men screaming at each other? Why was there a vampire in it, and why did it lure people in by inventing a brand new shape? Why did the show’s big antagonist end up having a baby’s head? None of these questions will ever be answered properly, because The Chair Company would clearly prefer to splash around in its Lynchian weirdness. This is by far the most baffling television show I have ever loved, and I say that as someone who has watched Lost all the way through four times.Stuart HeritageIndustryView image in fullscreenWhat I’m really here for … Marisa Abela as Yasmin dressed as Marie Antoinette in Industry.Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf Productions/HBO/Simon RidgwayThe finance jargon of Industry is impenetrable to the likes of poor me. I could not tell you a single financial transaction that took place on the trading floors. When I naively recapped the first season for another outlet, I apologised more than once for having “no idea what Harper does”. Even when they’re not talking shop, I need the subtitles on for this verbose lot.Does it make me feel like an idiot? Yes. But maybe that’s the point: this is an exclusive world in which only the wicked and wealthy whose first language is money get to play. Even co-creator Konrad Kay, who worked in the City,admittedthat a term like “DV01” is “financial gibberish” that he doesn’t fully know the meaning of. His partner Mickey Downcalled it“technobabble” and said they have tried to dumb it down. Ha!

I have learned to gauge the “vibe” of a business scene – trouble ahoy, big win celebration, burn-this-place-down disaster, etc – while waiting for the frequent payoffs from what I’m really here for: sex, drugs and fights. I’m a bit like a kid saying I’ve finished a book with a grin on my face, after flicking straight to the picture pages.Still, when I get to an episode where, say, all hell breaks loose at the Muck manor Marie Antoinette party, for a devilish moment it all makes sense.Hollie RichardsonTwin PeaksView image in fullscreenWonderful, impossible … Kyle MacLachlan as special agent Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty ImagesI’m not sure anyone, even David Lynch himself, could coherently explain what was going on Twin Peaks, a show where characters gettingtrapped for eternity in doorknobsandDavid Bowie’s reincarnationas a giant kettle apparently seemed par for the course. While I managed to just about cling on to the coattails of the plot of its more conventional (though still pretty damned unconventional) early 90s seasons, my grip had entirely loosened by the time of the far loopier mid 2010s revival.View image in fullscreenBefuddling … Catherine E Coulson as the Log Lady in Twin Peaks.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty ImagesNot that that was a turn-off. The befuddlement you felt was much of the fun in watching Lynch and Mark Frost’s misshapen murder mystery, as a succession of wonderful, impossible images and ideas flew at you from out of the screen. And even if I wasn’t exactly able to summarise its plot, at a purer and more primal level I definitely understood and was moved by the show. After all, at its centre is a simple and affecting story: a dogged detective embarks on a decades-long quest to get justice for a murdered teenager. It just so happened that on this conventional hero’s journey, there was the occasionalpulsating brain treeorbackwards-talking little personthrown in to keep viewers on their toes.Gwilym MumfordHouse of the DragonView image in fullscreenThe mad king? … Paddy Considine in House of the Dragon.Photograph: Album/AlamyI’ll admit it: I found the first season of Game of Thrones hard going. Largely because trying to decipher the various family connections between the 7,000 characters felt like a GCSE history lesson with added bum-flashing. But at least they got one thing right: they didn’t give everyone nigh-on identical names, and create entire families whose offspring are indistinguishable from one another.Not soHouse of the Dragon, where the future of the seven kingdoms seems to rest on whether the next ruler comes from the brunette family or the one whose hairdresser has a job lot of ice-blond dye they’re trying to shift. Maybe some of them are related to the mad king? Or was Paddy Considine the mad king? Or has the mad king not happened yet? Oh God, the amount of questions each scene throws up: why does every family come up with one preposterous name, then slightly change the letters for the rest of their gigantic haul of sprogs? Are we really expected to also remember an entire lineup of dragons with no distinguishing characteristics apart from “likes fire”?Thank God, then, for young Jace Velaryon, the only one with a vaguely normal name – presumably named for his mum Rhaenyra’s love of Jason Donovan’s verse on that 1988 classic, Especially for You. Although why they shorten “Jason” when they’re perfectly capable of pronouncing words like “Rhaenyra” is beyond me. Oh wait, just Googled: he’s called Jacaerys. This bloody show.Alexi DugginsLostView image in fullscreenTV had never felt so thrilling … Matthew Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Josh Holloway and Dominic Monaghan in Lost.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyI was fully invested in Lost. I once watched so many hours of season one back-to-back that I left my friend’s house square-eyed and paranoid that the Others were out to get me. When that episode ended with the reveal of the Hatch – well, TV had never felt so thrilling had it? And, of course, I will never forget the code 4 8 15 16 23 42, which had to be pressed every 108 minutes to save the world.So many of us lapped up Lost from the start right through to the divisive purgatory ending, in which it was revealed that they were absolutely not all dead the whole time. (“You’re real. Everything that’s happened to you is real.”) Yet from the get-go, the plane crash saga was a baffling and ludicrous ride you just had to embrace.The black smoke monster. The Dharma Initiative. The polar bears, for pity’s sake. The fact that the island cured people of their ailments. The temples and assorted other key buildings that they didn’t find for years! The humongous Egyptian foot statue. The giant frozen wheel at the centre of the island that meant it time travelled, and at one point disappeared? None of it hung together, but I loved letting it all wash over me anyway.

Why is Julianna Margulies so evil? Why does a TV executive live in a palace fit for a billionaire despot? Why are so many company employees being outed and having photos leaked? Who is acquiring what now?These are just some of the many questions that go through my head when watching The Morning Show, which started as a sharp post-#MeToo drama about the systemic cover-up of sexual misconduct by powerful men, and swiftly devolved into rot of the glossiest and most fabulous kind. At this point, it’s all surface – smouldering surface in which Jennifer Aniston’s character gets off with Jon Hamm’s definitely very wicked Elon Musk type – and I’m not complaining.You could say that in itself is a trenchant comment on how hard news fails to compete with sexier content these days. But it’s best not to overthink it and just let the comically overreaching storylines about AI and Iran’s nuclear programme wash over you like luxury bath oils.Laura SnapesThe RehearsalView image in fullscreenThrows you for such a loop … Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.Nathan Fielder’s show Nathan for You saw the Canadian deploy absurdist business advice – poo-flavoured froyo, a fake Starbucks justified via parody law – as cringe comedy meets late-capitalism critique. When his follow-up The Rehearsal was announced for HBO, with a blank cheque to deliver something truly bananas, I was ecstatic. Its premise sounds almost reasonable: many people avoid difficult conversations or scenarios. What if you could “rehearse” them on elaborate sets with trained actors?But the actors don’t know what they’re signing up to before surrendering to the “Fielder Method” – essentially stalking a real person before adopting their persona on television without their knowledge. In the heartbreaking season one finale, a six-year-old actor “playing” Fielder’s son begins to believe Fielder is actually his father.Fielder is disarmingly honest about making it up as he goes along and his show’s potential to literally ruin people’s lives. While a voiceover helps orient viewers, the subterfuge, metanarrative and straight hijinks remain baffling. Where does Fielder get these ideas and what is he really hoping to achieve?Season two uses a more structured approach: Fielder sincerely attempts to reduce plane crashes by staging pre-flight mediations between pilots, until the finale throws you for such a significant loop that you’ll find yourself thinking: “What did I just watch?” and “How can I enjoy a ‘normal’ show now?”Sasha MistlinScandi noirsView image in fullscreenWhat’s going on here? … Sofie Gråbøl as Sarah Lund in The Killing.Photograph: Nbc/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe Killing. Borgen. The Bridge. It really was a small screen mini golden age and most of us couldn’t get enough. A big part of the appeal of these moody Scandi-epics was their exoticism. The language was a tantalising riddle: subtitles were obviously essential but it was fun to land upon the occasional familiarity of a recurring phrase and luxuriate in the singular tone and texture of the dialogue. Then there was the aesthetic mood – all snow crunching under sturdy boots, delightful knitwear and urgent conversations animated by billowing clouds of ice crystals.There was a lot to think about beyond the plotting nuances which, in my case, often came a distant second (or even third or fourth) to enjoying the general vibe.

After his mother died, his grandmother needed help raising his sister, brother and him, and placed him with a white missionary family from Florida. He was the only member of his family to escape the war. “That is something that weighed heavy on me as I grew,” he says. “Why was it me? Why couldn’t my siblings come, or why wasn’t it one of them?” It would be years until he knew what became of them.Today, his stage name – he was born Janjay Lowe – is a stylised version of the Liberian capital Monrovia; his songwriting addresses his fractured identity, and the spectre of colonialism that surrounded him in Liberia and the US, applying emotional intimacy to global realities. His approach, he theorises, “starts with people trusting that you’re not afraid to be vulnerable in your own way. Then you start talking about the bigger picture.”Of all the coffee shops in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the one Lowe chooses for our interview is in a downtown business district that appears to have cleared out for the holidays. Only a handful of patrons trickle in while we talk over mint tea on a December afternoon, and that suits him. “I don’t really like to be noticed,” he says, casually attired in a dark, plaid flannel shirt. That kind of modesty is his trademark: at his sellout shows, he avoids grand gestures and invites audiences into his clarifying calm. But despite his aversion to attention, Lowe stands out among a new generation of singer-songwriters translating TikTok fame into tangible success.Mon Rovîa: Bloodline – videoOn his debut album, Bloodline, the arresting serenity of his music is in deliberate contrast to his harrowing past. Listeners have compared him to Nick Drake and Labi Siffre, cult heroes of elegant folk sensitivity. He dubbed his music Afro-Appalachian folk, having learned that a predecessor of the banjo also originated in west Africa, and enslaved musicians and their descendants helped create the string band music associated with the region he now calls home. “You just see that these things have been whitewashed over time,” he says.Before he became Mon Rovîa, Lowe grew up in a white, American, middle-class background – radically different environment from the one into which he was born –and relied on his keen perceptiveness to acclimatise. “The real person that I am was never really shown,” he says. “I understood what it was to be the funny guy. I had friends easily.” But when he was alone with his thoughts, “that was a whole other journey of loneliness”. Deep down, he acknowledged: “I’m not OK at all, but I’m in this American space being what I need to be, the token Black guy.”Lowe accepted his adoptive family’s evangelical Christian faith, and life revolved around church. Attending private Christian schools insulated him from much of American popular culture, although when he was in high school, the family moved to the Bahamas for mission work and he gained two foster brothers who introduced him to Fleet Foxes and Bon Iver. Soon he was poring over Mumford & Sons lyrics like a seminal text. “I spent a lot of time with their songs because there was a religious aspect of struggle, and I was intrigued,” he says. When his foster brothers formed a band, he wrote eagerly, but left the lead vocals to them.With no particular career ambitions, Lowe seized the opportunity to play football for his conservative Presbyterian college near Chattanooga. Living alone for the first time, he “was battling a lot of different things, when it comes to adoption and identity and survivor’s guilt”. And he couldn’t help but consider how entangled his experience was with the history of colonisation. Music became a way of processing his experiences. Taking his stage name was a way of symbolising his commitment to “remember my people, remember the journey and the blessing of my life, and my mother, and my siblings that I’ve not thought about in years”.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t think I would ever be able to put my full mind into music’ … Mon Rovîa.Photograph: Carter HoweAt first, he dabbled in melodic rap and digitally programmed bedroom pop. “If you’re a Black American, you gotta kind of lean that way,” he says of the race-based genre parameters by which he initially felt confined. But nothing clicked. Then he posted an acoustic clip of an original for a lark and received enthusiastic feedback from his friend – and future manager – Eric Cromartie. In a separate interview, Cromartie recalls advising him: “‘Go to TikTok, put the beats down and just go with your ukulele.’ And within three weeks, he blew up.”In 2020, Lowe started self-releasing EPs while working everyday jobs, but in 2024 he signed with Nettwerk Music Group, the Canadian indie label that launched Sarah McLachlan’s career, and dropped the side hustles. “I didn’t think I would ever be able to put my full mind into music,” he says, “and now I get to.”Bloodline benefited from that freedom. The call to collectively resist abuses of power in the gently galvanising Heavy Foot emerged in part from a study of leading thinkers in the American civil rights movement, including James Baldwin. Contemplating the south’s romantic distortions of the American civil war gave rise to Somewhere Down in Georgia, whose circling guitar figure, pensive vocals and naturalistic imagery feel haunted by the unreconciled traumatic history of the south. “They refuse to look at it clearly and do the things necessary to make those amends,” he says of the region. “A lot of the south lives in this place of deterioration because of that.” Despite these heavy themes, Lowe’s delivery is a gentle marvel.‘I ate acid for two months straight. It was the best time of my life’: Americana anarcho-punk Sunny War on booze, drugs and the KKKRead moreHe also conjures and recasts his own painful memories. Pray the Devil Back to Hell, informed by a documentary of the same name, conveys his awe at the Liberian women who ended the war. Black Cauldron traces his evolving perspective on his relationship to his mother. Though her life ended tragically early, he points out: “The story doesn’t end. She has a son who miraculously gets rescued and gets to help other people on a journey of healing.”Plenty of pop and hip-hop artists have used voice recordings as tone-setting interludes, but on Bloodline, Lowe shares audio clips of life-altering significance. They’re excerpts of WhatsApp messages from the Liberian sister, now a mother herself, with whom he only recently reconnected. “That’s really where I’ve gleaned a lot of my own history,” he says. In the intro to his searching song Whose Face Am I, she can be heard addressing him in Kolokwa – Liberian English – as Janjay and telling him that the father he never met was Senegalese.Soon after the album’s release, Lowe will embark on his second European tour, and he longs to return to Liberia. Bloggers there started posting about him last year, he has seen videos of Liberian musicians interpreting his songs and the Liberia music awards recently named Mon Rovîa outstanding artist of the year for 2025. “It’s been the biggest joy of my life,” he says, “to be welcomed back to a place I didn’t think I would ever be welcomed to.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockFolk musicLiberiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

These subjects are at the heart of A Giant on the Bridge, the singer-songwriter Jo Mango and the theatre-maker Liam Hurley’s urgent piece of gig-theatre, which premiered in 2024 and heads out on tour acrossScotlandnext month.It was born from a research project, Distant Voices: Coming Home, that revealed dire statistics for the number of people who come out of prison and then go back in again, says Mango. “Research showed that the process is often less about the individuals and more about societal and structural issues – whether they can get a job when they come out, whether they have any family left who are there to support them.” A Giant on the Bridge emerged as “a kind of way of writing an essay about what we learned”, Mango says, but using songs co-written by people who have lived experience of the prison system.For the project’s research associate, Phil Crockett Thomas, that songwriting process revealed something profound. Over about 20 intensive sessions in open and closed prisons and community justice settings, the team worked with roughly 200 people. “Coming home, punishment and disconnection from the world outside are extremely distressing experiences,” she says. “What we found was that collaborative songwriting allowed more space for people to explore those issues in the way that felt right to them.”Often, participants chose not to write directly about prison at all. “They wrote about completely different things,” Crockett Thomas recalls. “Or they wrote daft and wonderful songs.” Music, she realised, functioned as “a resource for the self”, sometimes “a quiet form of resistance” within the prison environment.View image in fullscreenEmotional journey … Louis Abbott in A Giant on the Bridge.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanOne of the most striking moments of the show comes from a song audiences often assume was written by someone incarcerated. “It’s actually written by a prison officer,” Mango explains. The song reflects on a child whose father is absent because of military service, stressing that “although his daddy isn’t here in person, he’s around by phone and in our memories”.Another song, Bars and Multicoloured Chairs, was written by someone nearing the end of their sentence. The lyrics highlight the complicated emotions that can be associated with release: “Don’t count the days, make the days count / Learn to cope, nose like a sniffer dog, I can smell home / We are human when we walk in / We turn to numbers, and we are forgotten.”One audience favourite, Fuck It Button, emerged from a songwriting session that brought community members into prison spaces. Written by a participant in recovery, its blunt refrain – “I know you want to press the fuck it button, to oblivion and beyond” – resonates far beyond its context. “That moment where you decide whether you’re going to go ‘fuck it’ or not – that exists across loads of spectrums,” Mango says. “It’s an example of the way songs brought different people together and integrated different types of experience.”Hurley, whose co-writing credits includeMixter Maxterfor National Theatre of Scotland and Rowan Rheingans’ Fringe First-winningDispatches on the Red Dress, led on the collaborative writing of the script that went alongside the songs. He brought to the project a recognition of theatre’s ability to hold emotional and ethical complexity. “It’s not a topic that I was engaged with before getting involved,” he says, “but I saw the opportunity to have an intelligent, emotional and human conversation through theatre, building on the songs that had already been created, around an issue that doesn’t really get spoken about with much compassion or nuance.”View image in fullscreenPlurality of voices … the rapper Dave Hook.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanCentral to the show’s power is the plurality of voices, and on stage, these songs are performed by a remarkable ensemble of Scottish musicians whose individual identities help shape the storytelling. Alongside Mango herself, the cast comprises Louis Abbott from the group Admiral Fallow, Kim Grant (aka Raveloe), Jill O’Sullivan and the rapper Dave Hook.Hurley describes them as “a Scottish indie folk supergroup” and says the piece’s theatrical magic lies in the act of collective imagination. “It’s that moment where a live performer is telling a story as themselves, and then they become the character,” he says. “You don’t need lights or sound or high production values for that to happen. It’s that spark of intimacy and connection. And we couldn’t be prouder of the cast, because none of them had considered themselves storytellers, and certainly not actors.”Over many iterations, the show has grown more confident in its own shape. “At the start, everyone was trying so hard to do justice to the complexity and all the stories and all the people we’ve met,” Crockett Thomas reflects. “What’s been so good to see is that the show has become something of its own out of that. It’s got this confidence and this independence, and it’s still absolutely sensitively relating back to those earlier steps.” Hurley adds: “The audience experiences one story. Despite the disparate stories we start off with, it’s one satisfying emotional journey.”For Crockett Thomas, theatre’s value lies in its capacity to hold contradictions. “Art can allow us to vicariously live through experiences we’ve not had ourselves,” she says. “And theatre can do justice to the messy complexity of homecoming.”The team is clear-eyed about the political context in Scotland. “I’d like to see more challenge to the undeserved image of Scotland as progressive on justice issues,” Crockett Thomas says. Despite some reforms, imprisonment rates remain high, and deaths in custody are among the highest in Europe. “Why are we building more and bigger prisons rather than trying to decarcerate?” she asks.Ultimately, A Giant on the Bridge doesn’t give simple answers. What it offers instead is a shared space – to listen, to feel, and to sit with discomfort. Hurley hopes audiences leave “emotionally opened, intellectually stimulated, but also productively discombobulated”. He sums up the spirit of the piece: “We can’t all talk at the same time, but we can all sing at the same time.”A Giant on the Bridgeis at Cottier’s theatre, Glasgow, 25-26 February.

Without giving too much away for those who haven’t seen it, Ralph Fiennes dancing semi-naked among piles of human bones to Iron Maiden’s The Number of the Beast is not how you expect one of our greatest thespians to deport himself on screen.View image in fullscreen28 Days Later: The Bone Temple director Nia DaCosta.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images“Alex Garland chose that song,” says the film’s director, Nia DaCosta. “He wrote it into the script. And you can’t get better than that in a film about satanists.”Indeed you can’t. From the track’s spoken intro by actor Barry Clayton – “Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number. Its number is six hundred and sixty six” – to Bruce Dickinson concluding with “I have the fire, I have the force / I have the power to make my evil take its course”, it is a shade under five minutes of nothing but the dark lord.The song was the title track of Maiden’s 1982 album, their third, and first with singer Bruce Dickinson, and it moved them to the peaks of the metal world – their first UK No 1 album and first US top 40 album. Released as a single in 1982, the track reached No 3 in the UK in 2005, and that remains the highest ever UK chart position for a song about Satan (in the US, that honour belongs to the Charlie Daniels Band’s The Devil Went Down to Georgia, also a No 3 single).It’s a far from usual track: Clive Burr’s drum patterns judder awkwardly and, as Maiden are wont to do, they put multiple sections in. “That makes it so fun,” DaCosta says, “and gives you so many options in terms of when and how to cut.” The scene had to contrast the world of the Jimmys – a Satanist gang – with that of the warm, humanist Fiennes character. “We wanted it to feel as erratic and crazy as it was when we shot the Jimmys being violent in their scenes, but also having the romance of Ralph’s character’s world – which is why there is fire and warm tones. And that song gave us a lot to work with.”View image in fullscreenIron Maiden in 1983: from left, Dave Murray, Steve Harris, Bruce Dickinson, Nicko McBrain and Adrian Smith.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesIron Maiden seldom license their music for use in film and TV. “The biggest thing to consider,” says Dave Shack, one of the trio who run the band’s team Phantom Music Management, “is: are we going to be made fun of?” Given popular culture’s propensity for mocking metalheads, that rules out a huge number of proposals off the bat. He still regrets the band allowing one character in Hot Tub Time Machine to wear anIron Maidenshirt throughout. “That was a litmus test of what happens if you grant the licence and take the fee. We’re not bloody Spinal Tap or Steel Panther.”Even with a great script, fantastic cast and crew, and amazing director, it can all go wrong, he says. “What happens on the day can completely kibosh it – we all accept that risk.” This time, though, everything went perfectly to plan. After the BFI Imax screening, DaCosta approached Shack and asked if he was happy. “Am I happy? Are you kidding me? People stood up in the cinema and clapped for it!” The scene itself might be startling, but Maiden don’t come out of it looking at all silly.It’s the second time in weeks that Maiden have been at the centre of a pop-culture moment on screen. Their 1983 track The Trooper featured in the Stranger Things finale, and within seven days its streaming numbers across all platforms rose by 252%.It’s worth noting that both 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple and Stranger Things were big budget, prestige productions, both of which used music as an integral part of plotting and character. Maiden, a band who were refusing to do things “for the exposure” long before the internet made it commonplace, have always maintained a sense of their own worth.“The music budget is usually the ass end of everything,” Shack says. “That’s a big part of the reason why, historically, Maiden have said no. If you make a $10m film, why don’t you put half a million aside for music and licensing? They’ll tell you it’s crucial to the scene, that it’s the only song the director wants. Then pay some money for it.”From Ralph Fiennes to Jeffrey Wright: the most overlooked performances this awards seasonRead moreDaCosta quickly realised this scene would have an impact. It was shot over three nights, and within a couple of days her editor had prepared a cut of it. “It was so amazing, and in that moment I felt: Oh, we did it. I couldn’t have predicted people would be cheering or getting out of their seats and dancing. But I felt the impact from the first cut. If you have a needle drop in a movie it had better be great, because sometimes it’s used to blast over a scene that’s not so good. But when you use it right, it can be amazing.”It’s another semi-naked snake-hipped showstopper for Fiennes after his dance to the Rolling Stones’ Emotional Rescue in Luca Guadagnino’s A Bigger Splash, and it’s all worked out very well for Maiden, too, albeit inadvertently. The band are currently in the midst of their 50th anniversary world tour. Both Stranger Things and 28 Years Later were under way long before that. Shack knows it was chance, but still he says, “Maybe they were vindications. But the big picture is that you’re always looking for validation from a new audience. And Iron Maiden are no different in that.”This article was amended on 20 January 2026. An earlier version incorrectly said Iron Maiden had not released any greatest hits compilations. This reference has been removed. Also, The Number of the Beast reached No 3 in the UK singles chart in 2005, not 1990. Its 1990 release was part of a box set that reached the same position in the albums chart.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMetalIron Maiden28 Days Later28 Years LaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sabrina Sutherland, who worked with Lynch on Twin Peaks and Inland Empire, said the mysteries at the heart of the films were meant to be open to interpretation.“David left it open to the viewer to come up and formulate their own ideas, and whatever it means to you is the meaning of the piece,” she said. “Nobody has the answer.”View image in fullscreenDavid Lynch with Sabrina Sutherland.Photograph: BFILynch, a lifelong smoker, died after beingdiagnosed with emphysema. Sweeney,who wrote The Straight Storyand is a professor at the University of Southern California, said she and their son, Riley, tried many times to encourage him to stop smoking.“Just a couple weeks before he died and we were Zooming with David and he out of the blue said: ‘You know, you tried to make me stop and I wouldn’t listen to you.’ It was heartbreaking.”Lynch’s films are being celebrated ina new season at the British Film Institute, which is called David Lynch: The Dreamer and includes screenings of Lost Highway, Inland Empire and Eraserhead.Earlier this week, Clare Binns, the creative director of Picturehouse Cinemas,encouraged directors to make shorter filmsin order to create better experiences for audiences.Recent critically acclaimed films have gone of the three-hour mark, such as Martin Scorsese’sKillers of the Flower Moon(206 minutes) and Brady Corbet’s The Brutalist (215 minutes).“I talk to producers about this and say: ‘Tell the director you’re making the film for an audience, not the directors,’” she said.Explore more on these topicsDavid LynchSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Tatum and British actor Gemma Chan play the young girl’s parents seeking justice for the victim.Rosebush Pruning by Brazilian festival favourite Karim Aïnouz assembles a starry cast including Turner, Anderson, Riley Keough, Jamie Bell and Elle Fanning for what Tuttle called a “twisted thriller” set at a villa in Spain.A New Dawn, the first solo feature by Japanese anime artist Yoshitoshi Shinomiya, tells the story of boy who lives in a fireworks factory that is about to be shut down as he tries to unravel the mystery of his father’s disappearance.View image in fullscreenNo holds barred …  Charli xcx in  The Moment.Photograph: © A24French screen legend Juliette Binoche joins Britain’s Tom Courtenay in dementia drama Queen at Sea by US director Lance Hammer in what Tuttle called a film “exploring some of the ethical questions that arise around agency and consent”.Rose stars acclaimed German actor Sandra Hüller, following her acclaimed performances in Anatomy of a Fall and The Zone of Interest, in a period picture about an enigmatic soldier arriving in an isolated village at the end of the Thirty Years’ war.Rupert Grint of the Harry Potter franchise appears in the dark fairytale Nightborn by Finnish director Hanna Bergholm.Charli xcx is due on the red carpet in the Panorama sidebar section to present The Moment, billed as a mockumentary by her music video collaborator Aidan Zamiri about her no-holds-barred 2024 summer tour, co-starring Alexander Skarsgård.Walters will present his directorial debut Animol, a coming-of-age tale set in a tough youth offender detention centre, in the festival’s Perspectives section for first films. The picture features his Adolescence co-star Stephen Graham.“Somehow, our small, low-budget indie Animol has politely elbowed its way into the Berlin film festival,” Walterswrote on Instagram. “The start of a beautiful journey for this film – and a new chapter for me as a director. Can’t wait to share it with you.”View image in fullscreen‘A new chapter’ … Tut Nyuot in Ashley Walters’ Animol.Photograph: Ed Norton Photography/© Anthony DickensonThe festival previously announced it would open with No Good Men by Shahrbanoo Sadat, described as a romantic comedy set in a TV newsroom in Afghanistan on the eve of the Taliban’s return in 2021.And Malaysian Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh will pick up an honorary Golden Bear for lifetime achievement in films such as Everything Everywhere All at Once and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.As film-makers face the ravages of streaming, industry consolidation and Hollywood dominance, Tuttle told reporters she saw the Berlinale in a “battle for this art form that we love so dearly”.“It’s a battle to keep independent cinemas open, to keep distributors and exhibitors who champion independent film thriving and making sure they can still take risks,” she said.She called cinema-going “the most powerful way to see an artist’s creation”.“But it’s also a really terrific place, a really important place to sit with strangers and friends and try to build a potent and communal experience together,” she said. “And right now we need more communal experiences rather than fewer.”The Berlinale, which was launched during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between east and west, ranks with Cannes and Venice among Europe’s top film festivals.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalFestivalsAshley WaltersAmy AdamsCharli xcxnewsShareReuse this content"

It is one of several hoards deposited during the 1060s, a period of significant political turmoil, but this find contained only coins from Harold II’s short reign.View image in fullscreenA group of early medieval objects found in Wiltshire.Photograph: British Museum/PAThe museum said one possibility is that the hoard was deposited late in Harold’s rule, buried around the time of the Norwegian invasion of England in September 1066 by King Harald Hardrada. Harald is known to have briefly captured York after a battle at Fulford, only a short distance from where the hoard was found.Also on display was a complete copper-alloy Roman vehicle fitting probably dating from about AD43 to AD200, which was discovered by a detectorist in Essex. The museum said vehicle fittings of this type were rare in Britain, and it was probably attached to the body of a carriage or wagon or to the yoke that hitched draught animals to the vehicle.The final showcased finds were a number of early medieval precious metal objects found in plough soil in Wiltshire. These included a silver, gold and garnet bird’s-head terminal with elephant ivory inlays, possibly from a drinking-horn, several gold rings and other metal objects.The pieces were discovered by detectorists metres apart and may form part of a high-status early medieval burial. Together, they provide a window into elite lifestyles and international connections during the period. A follow-up excavation will be led by Cardiff University and the Portable Antiquities Scheme [PAS] in the coming months.View image in fullscreenParts of a complete Roman vehicle fitting from AD43 to AD200, found by a detectorist in Essex.Photograph: British Museum/PADr Nicholas Cullinan, the director of the British Museum, said the PAS and Treasure process were “vital tools for preserving and recording Britain’s past, ensuring that remarkable discoveries made by the public are protected, studied and made accessible to everyone”.In total, there were 79,616 finds recorded in 2024, up from 74,506 in 2023 and 53,490 in 2022, and 1,540 treasure cases were reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland during 2024, representing an increase of 163 on the previous year.According to theTreasure Act 1996, treasure is defined as any metallic object, other than a coin, provided that at least 10% by weight is precious metal (gold or silver) and that it is at least 300 years old.The counties recording the most PAS finds were Norfolk (7,120), Suffolk (5,410), Lincolnshire (5,133) and Gloucestershire (5,034), all agricultural counties known to have a rich archaeological heritage. During the same period, Norfolk (138), Hampshire (110) and North Yorkshire (109) recorded the highest numbers of treasure finds.More than 92% of objects were recovered from cultivated land, where archaeological material is especially vulnerable to agricultural damage.Ian Richardson, the acting head of portable antiquities and treasure at the museum, said the continued rise in the number of finds was a “testament to the dedication of finders across the country”.He added: “Their responsible reporting allows us to build a richer and more detailed picture of life in the past, while ensuring that important objects are preserved for public benefit.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyBritish MuseumMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

The band confirmed his death on Tuesday afternoon.“After fighting heroically for almost three years, Rob is now free of pain - ‘a glimmer of tiny light in the wilderness’,” they wrote in a statement on social media. “He died peacefully, surrounded by loved ones. The family asks that anyone wanting to honour Rob donate toPankind, Pancreatic Cancer AustraliaorSupport Act.”In 2025 Hirst spoke about his support for voluntary assisted dying, which he was eligible for in New South Wales.“Why should you have to die in terrible, drawn-out pain?” hetold the Australian. “When you’ve had this amazing life – a life like I’ve had – why should end-of-life be so ­horrific when there’s an alternative?”Midnight Oil: their 20 greatest songs – sortedRead moreHaving formed Midnight Oil in 1976, Hirst was best known for his furious drumming abilities, but he was also the cowriter of the lyrics and melodies for many of the band’s best-known songs including Beds Are Burning, The Dead Heart, Short Memory, The Power and the Passion, Forgotten Years and King of the Mountain.“Rob was brash, funny and super intelligent, contrary to the clichéd view of drummers,” his band mate Jim Moginie wrote in his 2024 memoir The Silver River, calling him Midnight Oil’s “engine room, onstage and off”.Hirst was also a member of several other bands: Ghostwriters, Backsliders, the Angry Tradesmen and the Break.Born in NSW in 1955, Hirst was given his first drum kit after a benign tumour was discovered in his right leg when he was 12 and he underwent surgery.Hirst formed a band with his school friend Moginie in 1972; the band was initially named Schwampy Moose, then Farm (which stood for Fucking All Right Mate).Hirst placed an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald for a singer to join Farm, which Peter Garrett answered in 1975. With Garrett on vocals, Hirst on drums, Moginie on guitar and keyboards and Andrew James on bass, the four were joined by Martin Rotsey on guitar and their “sixth member”, manager Gary Morris, and changed their name to Midnight Oil in 1976. James was later replaced by Peter Gifford, then Bones Hillman.Midnight Oil released 13 studio albums over almost 50 years. Hirst remained in the band until they took a prolonged hiatus in 2002, when Garrett left to pursue a career in federal politics. The band resumed playing in 2017.During another Oils hiatus in the 1990s, Hirst joined guitarist Andrew Dickson and Hoodoo Gurus bass guitarist Rick Grossman to form the Ghostwriters, who released four albums. He was also a member of the Backsliders, a blues group, with vocalist Dom Turner, with whom he also formed another band, the Angry Tradesman, which blended drum and bass and experimental post-punk.Hirst and his Oils bandmates Moginie and Rotsey also formed surf rock band the Break, with Violent Femmes bass player Brian Ritchie and Hunters & Collectors trumpet player Jack Howard. The Break released two albums, in 2010 and 2013.Hirst is survived by his wife, Leslie Holland, their two daughters Alexandra and Gabriella, and his eldest daughter Jay O’Shea, also a musician, who was given up for adoption after she was born when Hirst was 17 and her mother was 15. O’Shea and Hirst reunited in 2010.“It’s been absolutely better than anything anyone could ever ask for,” he told the Australian in 2025, of his life. “And so, if my life is attenuated by this tiny little tumour that threatens to do me in, then I will still consider myself incredibly fortunate.”Explore more on these topicsMidnight OilPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

In one episode before Rob becomes an author, we see him as a sexually pent-up teacher abroad, masturbating over an essay he’s marking. That the scene is an echo of one in Michel Houellebecq’s Atomised (once named by Doyle as the best book from the past 40 years) hardly lessens our discomfort, and it’s hard not to feel that our unease is precisely the point. “Frankly, a lot of my life has been disastrous,” he once told an interviewer – which might not be quite as self-deprecating as it sounds, given that Doyle has also argued that “great literature” is born of “abjection” not “glory”.The autofictional game-playing continues in his new novel, Cameo, but instead of self-abasing display, we get a perky book-world send-up for the culture war era, cartoonishly dramatising the ups and downs of creative life. It takes the form of a vertiginous hall of mirrors centred on gazillion-selling Dublin novelist Ren Duka, renowned for a long novel cycle drawn on his own life, the summaries of which comprise the bulk of the book we’re reading. Duka’s work isn’t autofiction à la Knausgård: hardly deskbound, still less under the yoke of domesticity, he leads a jet-set life of peril, mixing with drug dealers, terrorists, spies, and eventually serving time for tax evasion before he develops a crack habit, a penchant for threesomes in Paris and – perhaps least likely of all – returns to his long-forsaken Catholicism.The matter-of-fact present tense narration, sprightly with hyperbolic intensifiers, generates terrific momentumWriterly pettiness is an ever-present source of comedy: abducted in Iraq (long story), Duka finds himself recording propaganda for Islamic State, during which he has the presence of mind to denounce “his literary rivals, including writers barely known beyond Dublin publishing circles”. Punctuating the action are free-floating monologues from voices recalling their connection to Duka, including an actor bitter about no longer playing him on screen, a punk novelist akin toVirginie Despentes, and – naturally – one Rob Doyle. There are excerpts, too, from the memoir of an unnamed author recalling his boyhood breakthrough of writing a story in the voice of the Predator (“It just hadn’t occurred to me before that I could enter the sensorium of an extraterrestrial psychopath”); plus – on top of all that – snippets from a near-future novel about a cab driver in a time of pan-European war, alien sightings and “cartel leaders in Mexico worshipping a new AI”.Away from our anticipation as to how these strands fit together, Cameo’s energy lies largely in that sort of larky detail, narrated in a winningly deadpan register caught between bewilderment and weariness. The matter-of-fact present-tense narration, sprightly with hyperbolic intensifiers (he’s especially fond of “satanic”), generates terrific momentum and the satire is wicked. At one point, Duka – reinventing himself as an anti-woke comedian – is in demand as a rightwing talking head: “Whenever an interlocutor, invariably in firmer command of facts and statistics, seems poised to get the better of him, Ren accuses them of racism. If he feels he is in a particularly tight corner, he accuses them of paedophilia … Two months after his stand-up tour ends, he writes an article for the New Statesman titled ‘I’m Sorry’.”While I frequently lost track of whether I was reading the life of the fictitious author Ren Duka or the story of what his fictional avatar gets up to in the novels written by him, you might take that as a mark of the immersion generated by Cameo’s conceit. It’s not all laughs, either; there’s a kernel of emotion when, on the brink of drug-induced breakdown in Berlin, “Rob Doyle” rings his sister for help – but she’s still unhappy because of her portrayal in a previous book, and the call ends disastrously when, deep in his own plight, he’s oblivious to hers.Overall, though, such moments are rarer than in Threshold and Doyle’s 2022 memoirAutobibliography, as if he wanted a break from hanging himself out to dry as the bad guy. But that only makes this slippery jeu d’esprit harder to pin down. Is Duka’s improbably storied narrative – the writer as action hero, a fantasy of literary celebrity – a comic riposte to the accusation that autofiction looks no further than its own navel? Whatever the case, I suspect some readers will hate it – but also that Doyle wouldn’t want it any other way.Cameo by Rob Doyle is published by W&N (£20).

Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is an adaptation of a Japanese folk tale, the story of a princess from the moon discovered inside a bamboo stalk in a poor rural village. A decade ago, Studio Ghibli adapted the tale intoa gorgeously animated moviewith a traditional, lovingly hand-painted feel. This film could not be more different, a trippy, high-energy, techno anime set in the near future, half of it in a virtual reality world – and TikTok-ifed with emojis and stickers exploding all over the screen.It begins when a 17-year-old high school student called Iroha finds a baby girl inside a glowing lamppost (rather than the bamboo stalk of the original). Iroha (voiced by Dawn M Bennett in the English dub) is a sensible kid, a talented musician and grade-A student who has already moved out of the family home and is living alone, working all hours to pay the rent of her tiny studio flat. In any free time she does have, Iroha follows her idol, AI musical megastar Yachiyo, in a crazy, chaotic virtual reality world called Tsukuyomi.Iroha takes the baby home. But overnight, the tiny newborn grows into a crawling toddler. Within days she is a pre-teen, a pale ethereal beauty called Kaguya, who, it transpires, is a runaway from the moon. This girl who fell to Earth is an impulsive ball of energy; she persuades Iroha to collaborate with her on songs to win a competition to perform with superstar Yachiyo, none of them remotely catchy. The plot pings about hyperactively, so dizzying that Cosmic Princess Kaguya! may leave audiences over 15 years old feeling more ancient than the original tale.Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is on Netflix from 22 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeAI (artificial intelligence)Virtual realityJapanMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

That one is the Holocaust-themed feature based on the novel Wartime Lies by Louis Begley thatStanley Kubrick tinkered with for years before finally abandoning; Suspiria director Luca Guadagnino is now rumoured to be trying to get it off the ground. Like the Kubrick/Guadagnino, this Aryan Papers, written and directed by ultra-low-budget film-maker Danny Patrick (The Film Festival, The Irish Connection), takes its name from theNazi-issued certificate, also known as theAriernachweis, which people were compelled to carry during those dark times to prove they weren’t Jews, Roma or from another persecuted minority.Apparently, Kubrick abandoned his Aryan Papers in part because he feared it wouldn’t do as well at the box office if it came out after Schindler’s List – just as Full Metal Jacket appeared to have been eclipsed by Platoon. Fortunately for Guadagnino, no matter if and when his Aryan Papers comes out, he will have little to worry about with regards to Patrick’s film, a work that with any luck will be forgotten by next week. Like the embarrassingly bad comedy The Film Festival (AKA The Worst Film Festival Ever), this is a shockingly poor effort on just about every level, from the inept, back-of-a-beer-mat script, the lazy use of obviously not-German, non-period-proofed locations (a modern plastic wheelie bin is visible in several shots), to the frankly insultingly bad acting throughout.The plot, if you must know, is set mostly near Stuttgart in 1942. Patrick’s fractured editing, perhaps guided by random coin flips, makes it particularly confusing to work out the timeline but basically we are following characters living at a facility dedicated to breeding Aryan babies known as the Lebensborn programme, by pairing vetted young women with Nazi officers. One of the women, Spanish-born Gisella (Celia Learmonth, one of the film’s more able performers, struggling mightily with what she has to work with), eventually tries to smuggle two Jewish young people, Benjamin (Jacob Ogle) and Judith (Niamh Ogle), across the border to safety. Her plans are foiled in part by evil blond bitch Helga (mostly played by Leona Clarke, but also by Cara Chase in a present-day framing device), who is shagging the unit’s commander and is quite willing to shoot crying mothers.One could forgive the slapdash, budget-challenged look of the proceedings, but less goodwill can be dispensed for the painfully under-rehearsed, monotone performances. It’s as if Patrick recruited the cast with an advert in a newsagent’s window and paid everyone in sandwiches and soda pop for a day’s work. There is a sincerity here that suggests Patrick and his cast and crew mean well enough, but honestly this is a bit of an insult to the victims of theHolocaust.Aryan Papers is on digital platforms from 26 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWar filmsSecond world warHolocaustreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s dancer Amy Thake’s toe, her sole thrust forth with implacable strength, that digit stretching away, bristling with intention. If you can get that much out of one foot, just wait till everything else starts moving. Thake’s solo isDeep Song by Martha Graham, from 1937, made in response to the Spanish civil war. It’s only six minutes long, but it is an intense six minutes: the exactitude of Graham’s stripped-to-the-core style, the weight and grace and power. Among other things it is a picture of a kind of exhaustion when one’s soft edges are shorn off by the load borne.As well as reviving 20th-century gems – such as Bella Lewitzky’s Kinaesonata (1970), danced with racing speed and millimetric accuracy –Yorke Dance Projectis trumpeting two premieres in this rich and really excellent programme.

The songs, and Cohen’s deep drawl of a voice, are hugely atmospheric. It’s three-piece suits and wine-red dresses, scenes from a half-remembered midnight in a smoky club. They tango through love, desire and fallibility, but Bruce never settles for the obvious in these couplings, always inventive, as are the endless rhythmic variations of the steps within the frame of a 4/4 beat. The craft is clear; Bruce has still got it.Up-and-coming choreographer Liam Francis also knows the value of a good soundtrack. Composer Jethro Cooke’s creation for Cast|X| uses fragments of film dialogue: “What have you done?” “I had no choice!” There are immediate parallels with choreographer Crystal Pite, bodies moving in response to quickfire text, but Francis’s movement is more amorphous – you can sense guilt, uncertainty, accusation, interconnectedness, without it coming into sharp focus. It’s promising.View image in fullscreenStarkly beautiful … Jonathan Goddard and Eileih Muir in Lacrymosa.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBest of the night isLacrymosa, made for the company in 2015 bythe late Robert Cohan, inspired by the idea of Mary losing her son Jesus to his calling.

In Snowdonia?” I asked incredulously. “That’s right!” came the enthusiastic reply from our newest hostel companion. We were standing in the large kitchen of The Rocks hostel in Capel Curig, a village in the north-east of Eryri national park (Snowdonia), chatting amiably while waiting for our teas to brew.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

You’ll see a sign warning about feeding them,” he said. “But even if they’re hiding and you don’t see one, it’s one of the best walks in the area.”Spotting a penguin in the Welsh mountains seemed unlikely, but that hardly mattered, least of all to my 11-year-old son, who was thrilled by the idea of a day spent hunting for penguins. And with that, our daily adventure plans were settled, inspired not by an internet search or guidebook, but by the easy exchange of recommendations that happen so often in the communal spaces of hostels.Childhood memories of communal dinners filled with laughter made me wonder why privacy was so covetedIt was our fourth and final day at The Rocks and, to my relief, we’d settled into a comfortable rhythm: exploring the mountains by day and spending evenings relaxing at the hostel with fellow residents. Initially, my suggestion to try something different for our family holiday by staying at a hostel had been met with scepticism. My husband, haunted by memories of school trips, imagined bleak dormitories with creaking iron beds and draughty communal spaces, while our sons (one teen and one tween) were unenthusiastic about shared living spaces and polite chit-chat.View image in fullscreenTravel tips are swapped over communal meals.Photograph: James VincentStill, I was eager to give it a go. Lately I’d begun to feel uninspired by holidaying in the UK. Endless scrolling through lists of private rentals – cottages, lodges, cabins – was exhausting and downright unaffordable. Seclusion, it seemed, had become highly prized and came with a hefty price tag. Yet I found myself thinking back to childhood memories of hostel holidays: communal dinners filled with laughter and nights spent tearing around with other kids. It made me wonder why privacy was so coveted.In the golden era of travel, around the late 19th and early 20th centuries, meeting new acquaintances while away was common. Think of Lucy Honeychurch’s transformative trip to Florence in EM Forster’s A Room With a View, shaped largely by her meeting the Emersons in theirpensione. Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile also reminds us how trips were once far more social affairs – even if the passengers did keep bumping each other off. By retreating into isolation, have we lost the very essence of travel: the pleasure of meeting new people; sharing stories; hearing word-of-mouth tips; and stepping outside our familiar routines?Our snug but smart private family room was kitted out with comfy mattresses, soft sheets and Welsh woollen blanketsHostels offer a gateway to those old ways of travel.First established in the UK in the 1930sto provide affordable accommodation, especially for young travellers, while also encouraging outdoor pursuits and socialising, their core purpose has changed little over time. What has evolved are the standards and the demographics. Today, private rooms are commonplace alongside bunk rooms, and guests range from solo travellers and students to families, couples and groups of friends.To my delight, standards at The Rocks were exceptional: bright and stylish interiors ran throughout, with Scandi-style wooden furniture and colourful cushions. The fire in the shared lounge was a beacon of warmth, while the firepits outside allowed us a night of stargazing and marshmallow toasting. Upstairs, our snug but smart private family room was cosy and warm, kitted out with comfy mattresses, soft sheets and Welsh woollen blankets. Even my luxury-loving eldest son was impressed.View image in fullscreenThe Rocks has bright and stylish interiors, with Scandi-style furniture and colourful cushionsBut what about the social element? Would this be an opportunity to meet like-minded folk, or just a series of awkward encounters to be endured before scuttling away to hide in our room? I needn’t have worried. Conversations flowed easily between guests, whether cooking dinner in the well-equipped kitchen, eating together in the airy dining room, surrounded by maps, games and puzzles, or gathering around the fire. There was a comforting pattern of change, with people coming and going, and new friendships forming quickly.As we hiked up Moel Siabod, with the crunch of snow underfoot and the promise of mountain doughnuts in our backpacks, I felt deeply satisfiedAfter our daily adventures, we looked forward to returning to the hostel and sharing our experiences. One evening, over cards and a glass of rum with two lads from the Midlands, we learned the recipe for “mountain doughnuts” (banana, jam and peanut butter spread between slices of bread, wrapped in tinfoil and gradually squished in a backpack during a hike). I picked up tips on thermal gloves from an army nurse who shared my despair over cold fingers, and talked 90s rave music with a couple from Spain. The children made friends instantly, disappearing for snowball fights and board games until bedtime. There was no pressure to socialise – some guests retreated to their rooms or books, others dipped in and out of communal life – and that flexibility was part of the appeal.After a challenging few years through Covid,hostelling is enjoying a quiet revival. According to Sam Dalley, founder of theIndependent Hostelsnetwork, “hostelling is in better health than ever. People want inexpensive stays where mingling is part of the adventure. There are more hostels now than at the height of the youth hostel movement in the 1950s.”View image in fullscreenA tip from another guest led to a hike on Moel Siabod in search of penguins.Photograph: Georgie DuckworthWith places such as The Rocks combining comfort with affordability, privacy with community, the future looks bright for British hostelling, proof that meeting new people and sharing experiences can still be found at the heart of travel.As we hiked up Moel Siabod, with the muffled crunch of snow underfoot and the promise of mountain doughnuts in our backpacks, I felt deeply satisfied. The trip had sparked an appreciation for something I hadn’t realised our holidays were missing; a sense of community. From now on, hostels will be my go-to for adventures like this, rather than the closed doors of private rentals. We never did see those elusive penguins, and we’re still baffled by the mysterious “Do not feed the penguins” sign perched on that remote Welsh mountainside, but who knows what adventures our next hostel stay may lead to?The Rockshas dorm beds from £36pp, private family rooms from£115.60Explore more on these topicsWales holidaysHostelsFamily holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It never goes mouldy, so am I wasting my time doing it the “proper” way?Dagna, Berkhamsted, HertsYou can’t get much sweeter than marmalade, and this is most likely the reason for both Dagna and her son’s success, despite their differing strategies. “The chance of mould developing is low because there’s so much sugar to balance the bitterness of the orange peel,” saysCamilla Wynne, preserver and author of All That Crumbs Allow. “Mould needs water to do its thing, and sugar binds to water.” She recalls a former student who, like Dagna’s son, simply ladled her marmalade into jars and closed the lids. All was fine until one day the student’s latest batch of marmalade was covered in mould: “She’d been reducing the sugar in her recipe over the years, so her method no longer worked because there was available water for mould to grow.”But back to the particulars of the family dispute. “He’s more right than she is,” says Pam Corbin, author ofPam the Jam: The Book of Preserves. “Nowadays, we have fantastic food-grade lids, which have a wax seal inside and keep preserves safer than a wax disc and cellophane would.” Some people put a wax disc under the twist-on lid, too, but for Corbin that’s a hard no: “As the marmalade cools, condensation forms on top of the paper, so you’re more likely to get mould.”What’s “most important”, however, is to use only clean new lids, Wynne says: “This will help them seal properly, and if your marmalade is sealed, you won’t be worrying about anything untoward happening.” Depending on how many jars you’re making, this can be an expensive strategy: “If you want to reuse your lids – and I do – make sure there aren’t any dents or odours,” Corbin says. “If they’re damaged or smelly, throw them out. Otherwise, pop them in a pan of water and simmer for five minutes to make sure they’re clean.”On to the jars, which is where opinions divide. “You definitely want to heat them, because that’ll make sure there’s no mould or yeast that could potentially cause problems,” Wynne says. Corbin, meanwhile, doesn’t think this is strictly necessary – so long as the jars are sparkling clean, that is. “I would warm jars only if I was making a reduced sugar preserve, because you won’t have that high temperature,” she says (the sugar is what allows marmalade to reach a high temperature). “I’m also mindful that people have done things the same way for generations, so if it makes them happy, let them do it.”What is unforgivable, though, is overcooking your marmalade, Corbin says: “It’s the biggest crime of marmalade making. When I’ve been a judge, a lot of marmalade tastes like barley sugar, because it has become too caramelised.” So how do you know it’s good to go? “When all the light, white bubbles have disappeared and it begins to look glossy on top. There will also be a slower, more relaxed rhythm to the boiling.” Finally,alwaysfill those jars practically to the brim: “I see people on Instagram filling them only halfway, but any air in the jar can bring contaminators,” Corbin warns.

It feels decadent, so it’s best served with a simple fennel salad, zingy with apple cider vinegar and mustard. It’s excellent eaten while still warm from the oven (be patient!), but even better as leftovers, because I have a soft spot for cold eggy tarts.Caramelised miso leek custard tart with apple cider vinegar fennel slawShop-bought pastry can, of course, be used, but making it from scratch is what makes this dish that much more special.Prep30 minChill1 hr 15 min+Cook45 minServes6-8For the pastry185g plain flour, plus extra for dusting1tsp salt100g cold unsalted butter, cubedFor the leeks2tbsp vegetable oil350g leeks, trimmed, halved lengthways and cut into 3cm segmentsSalt2tbsp red miso2tbsp honeyFor the egg mixture5 eggs150ml whole milk1tbsp dashi granules1tbsp sesame seedsChives, thinly sliced, to garnishChilli oil, for servingFor the slaw300g fennel, trimmed and thinly sliced or cut using a mandoline2 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, tender stems and leaves chopped2tbsp apple cider vinegar1tsp dijon mustardFirst make the pastry: in a food processor, blitz the flour, salt and butter into a breadcrumb-like consistency. With the motor on pulse, slowly add 65ml cold water, until a rough ball of dough forms. (Alternatively, sift the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl and rub in the cubed butter. Add the water slowly and mix gently to make a dough.) Wrap the dough in clingfilm or baking paper and chill for at least an hour.Put the vegetable oil in a pan on a medium heat and cook the leeks with a small pinch of salt for seven to 10 minutes, until fully cooked and starting to brown.In a small bowl, dissolve the miso and honey in two tablespoons of cold water, then pour over the cooked leeks. Reduce for a few minutes on a low heat, until the leeks are jammy and most of the liquid has evaporated, then set aside.On a floured surface, roll the pastry into a disc to fit a 20cm round loose-bottomed tin. Lay in the pastry, pressing it into the tin, then prick the base with a fork. Return to the fridge for 15 minutes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and put a baking sheet inside to heat up. Line the chilled pastry shell with baking paper and weigh it down with baking beans. Blind bake for 15 minutes, then remove the beans and paper, and bake for five minutes more, until lightly brown. Remove and trim any overhanging pastry, and turn down the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and dashi granules. Spoon the cooked leeks into the pastry shell, then pour in the egg mix. Bake for five to seven minutes, until the custard is slightly set. Sprinkle the sesame seeds on top and bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the sesame seeds toasted. Cool to room temperature.Meanwhile, make the slaw by gently massaging the sliced fennel with the remaining ingredients, then season to taste.To serve, slice and garnish the tart with chives. then serve with the slaw and the chilli oil.Ferment: Simple Ferments and Pickles, and How to Eat Them, by Kenji Morimoto, is published by Pan Macmillan at £22.
