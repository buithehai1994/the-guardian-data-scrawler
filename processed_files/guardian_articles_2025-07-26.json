Sunlight danced on the concrete in my garden and dappled the laundry drying on the line. On a walk, I remember all the grass as wispy strands of ochre and burned yellow.I was having an extended golden hour, pumped full of maternal love with no baby to hold. Hormones, I suspect – which I was surprised to find that you get, even if your baby dies during delivery.“Will I still get the baby blues?” I asked one of the midwives who sat beside me on my sickbed.“A bit more than that I think, babe,” she said. I had taken an antenatal class with her, back when I was still sure of myself: specific about what I would need during labour, encouraged by what had been a healthy pregnancy. And now, we were here.My son Mo Ibrahim Lingwood-Noor was born on 15 July 2023. There is an old adage that this date will set the tone for the rest of summer: if it rains that day, the whole season will follow suit.I cannot remember if it was glum or sunny outside on Mo’s birthday. From my aseptic hospital bed, I didn’t notice the weather. But weirdly, I remember that whole summer as warm, hazy, almost shimmering.I was in the middle of labour when I found out Mo had died. Perhaps I should have known when the nurse started making comments about my baby “hiding” while I was having contractions, or when she called doctors to get a second and third opinion. But it did not make sense to me: I had braced myself for something to go wrong formethis far along. I never thought it would happen tohim.I had gone into the hospital frequently in the weeks preceding Mo’s birth in the way that first mothers often do: to check on a leak, to enquire whether a lack of movement indicates something awry. None of these visits had flagged anything to be nervous about. In fact, my pregnancy seemed so routine that often I suspected the midwives wondered why I had come in at all.View image in fullscreenAbout two weeks before Mo was born, a midwife recommended I get checked at the hospital. I had been leaking clear fluid she said would be worth looking into.“You’ll be OK,” she giddily told me and my husband, Louis. We headed up the pale blue staircase into the stuffy waiting room for the emergency obstetric unit, which was always too hot and too full with expectant parents sitting sullenly on their phones, waiting to be called in. “Something is definitely happening!” the midwife shouted as we disappeared around the corner. All the signs pointed to a successful labour – days, if not hours, away.But the experience that followed was deeply unpleasant. The emergency unit’s midwife, a nun whose headgear made her appear even more strict than she already was, chastised me for coming in for something so trivial.“If you’re so sure your waters have broken, I’ll just induce you!” she threatened.Her tone felt disbelieving and calculated, like she was trying to catch me out for being over the top. I tried to explain that I wasn’t sure of anything, and that I had just been sent here by her colleague.I required pain relief during cervical checks, because (unusually, for me) examinations had become unbearably uncomfortable – to the point of tears. But when I told her this, it was like I had crossed a line.“Fine,” she said. “I’ll give you a paracetamol, and you can wait three hours in the waiting room for it to kick in.”Her response angered me, and I asked to see another midwife. My request was granted, and the rest of the visit was lovely. I left safe in the knowledge that the baby and I were fine.So you can imagine my horror when I arrived at the hospital on the night of Mo’s birth, only to be greeted by the same dismissive midwife.I was terrified of being dragged through one procedure after another, of having my body needlessly decimatedI had been awoken that night by a pain so preoccupying I could not see or speak. I walked into a wall on my way in and pushed it away, thinking it was my husband. I could not sit in the car. I could not pee. I could not be examined.I have gone over the following events so many times that I know them better than almost any other detail from that night, including the actual birth.My first instinct when faced with the midwife was to get away from her by any means possible. But then she started asking questions, all of which seemed, to me, like they would lead to more time under her care.“How are your son’s movements? Have you felt him in the last few hours?” she asked.“I don’t know, I’m in labour,” I said.“If you can’t feel him you’re going to have to go to the ward,” she told me.She was gentler this time, but I still found her punitive. I felt scared, feral and alone. I wanted to go to the natural birthing suite, where you could lie in a double bed with your partner, and have your baby in a pool. I was terrified of being dragged through one procedure after another, of having my body needlessly decimated – only to greet my son as a shell of myself in a noisy ward where everyone was screaming.But in my state, I had little means to communicate. And I felt so certain that he was going to be OK. So I lied.“Sure, I can feel him,” I said.View image in fullscreenSometime later – maybe hours, but probably less – I ended up going to the ward anyway. That is when we found out Mo had died.They traced a wand over my gelled-up tummy, trying to will a different answer into existence. When they turned the screen towards me, it was like Mo had gone floppy: no longer the animate, sturdy, little figure that responded to prods and presses. Instead he swayed lifelessly at each prompt like an idle jellyfish.“I’m very sorry,” said the senior doctor who had come in to look at the screen. I do not remember his words after that, just that our baby had died.I did not let out an anguished scream. I did not cry. I just felt sluggish and unavailable. I can still recall the exact feeling: like hot concrete was being poured down me, leaving me stuck in place. “How can you tell me that?” I repeated blankly for the next few hours.When the clumsy anaesthetist came in around 3am – he looked about 24, with glasses that magnified his terrified expression and long limbs that accentuated the sense that he was out of his depth – I asked him to knock me out and cut me open. He concurred that I had chosen the best course of action.So I went to sleep. At some point between early morning and dawn, I turned sheepishly to Louis to ask:“Lou, what will happen when he comes out? Will you look?”“I don’t know,” he said, conveying, in one expression, all the confusion and bewilderment that I felt.“You have no good options here,” our consultant told us. “But some options will be less bad than others.”It was around three in the morning, several hours after we had been admitted to the ward. I was still having contractions, with no pain relief other than gas and air. I tried to take in our options. The more involved we were in our son’s birth, she explained, the more we would be able to process his death. No part of me wanted to deliver vaginally – the thought of Mo’s limp body between my legs too much to bear – so I opted to have a C-section, but to stay awake.“There is one more thing,” she said.“You have to meet your baby. It is up to you how you do that, but you have to do it.”She gave us choices: they would bring Mo into our room in a crib, and we could hold him and dress him if we wanted. If we found that too hard, we could just look at him from a distance. The hospital had a special ward for babies who had died where we could go and visit him. We could keep doing so for as long as we liked; his crib would be temperature controlled, so he would continue to look alive, or somewhat alive, for a few days.To my great shame, just a few hours earlier, I had convinced myself that I could forgo meeting him. Perhaps I could go to sleep, have him disposed of, pretend like my entire pregnancy had never happened. “You can’t love somebody you’ve never met,” I told myself. I even told myself that, seeing as this pregnancy was a dud, I could do better on the next one – like my son’s death was akin to a failed test.Everything in your body tells you to run a mile from death. Yet here I was, being confronted with the decision of whether to hold, kiss and dress itThat the hospital gave us no choice about meeting him was a kindness I could not yet comprehend. I did not know it then, but if I had not met Mo, I would have found the experience of losing him all the more disembowelling.But I was also terrified. Horrified, even. I learned somewhere that smells trigger some of the most profound emotional responses. What if he smelled rotten? What if he looked weird? Contorted? Sick?There are so many incongruous things you have to hold side-by-side when your baby dies. Cradling him dead; carting him around in a temperature-controlled crib until you can comprehend that he was never truly alive; and trying to feel the tender, warm, totally accepting feelings you are meant to feel towards a baby towards a corpse instead.These conflicting realities were one hell of a thing to comprehend. Everything in your body tells you to run a mile from death. Yet here I was, being confronted with the decision of whether to hold, kiss and dress it.Meeting my son was, simultaneously, the worst and the best moment of my life.We had waited eight hours to go into surgery, constantly bumped to the bottom of the queue because the other people who needed emergency C-sections were most likely going to end up with living children.During this lull, I was so determined not to deliver vaginally that I convinced myself I had the will to keep Mo inside my tummy. If it was not so sad, it probably would have been funny: the sight of me, clenched in a permanent Kegel, a constipated look on my face, refusing to tell anyone whether or not my contractions were progressing.But I made it to the theatre. Around 10am, I was wheeled into a room where what seemed like a dozen doctors were waiting. They stuck a long needle in my back and sprayed a cold liquid on my body, checking if I could feel it to confirm my lower body was numb. I felt tugging, similar to when the dentist roots around your mouth to pull out a tooth while you are under a local anaesthetic – only in my abdomen.View image in fullscreenNext thing I knew, the doctor had Mo in her arms.“Poppy, I can see him. He is gorgeous. I am going to clean him up, and then you’ll get to meet him,” she said.Until that point, I still believed they might find him alive.Instead, Louis sat by me, holding my hand and crying. I stared blankly at the ceiling while the surgeons cleaned up underneath a tent they had created from the waist down, preventing us from seeing anything.We were taken into a private room, and Mo was carted over in a little see-through tank.“He’s very beautiful,” one of the midwives said.I found her words surprising: so gentle and accepting like a tonic, slowly bringing me back to life.I was afraid to look. But it was comforting to watch Louis, who did not hesitate, immediately hugging Mo as you would after a normal birth. He kissed him, put a nappy on him, and dressed him in dungarees and a dinosaur T-shirt meant for a six-month-old – because Mo, to our surprise, was quite tall.I fumbled when Louis passed him over, my mind and my body still disconnected.One of the hardest things about Mo dying before he was born is that I knew so little about himBut then there he was. This perfect boy that I had grown from just a seed, his face arranged by our DNA; billions of pairs, prudently linked like figurines in a paper chain. He had this mouth just like mine: shaped like a wooden bow, full, rigid and curved. We wowed at his roman nose, far too adult-like for his soft baby face. And I softly opened the lids of his eyes to see his eye colour.We were with Mo for half an hour or so before family started coming in. And in that time, we somehow became more human. We passed our baby around and watched him being greeted with deep sorrow, but also curiosity and delight, by all the people who had waited so long to meet him.When everyone had left, Louis perked up with a cheeky grin, and asked:“Do you want to see something funny?”I did not think that anything funny could happen at that moment.With a little chuckle, he lifted Mo’s legs to reveal some unexpectedly huge testicles.“Who do you think he got those from?” he asked.And we erupted into fits of laughter, if only for a short while.After meeting Mo, I emailed HR from the toilet cubicle next to my bed: the sort of thing a deranged person, mad from loss, does when her primal brain reminds her that some self-preservation is necessary to survive.I let them know I had lost my baby in delivery and asked them to make sure my maternity pay still came through.We stayed in the hospital for a few days while I healed, waiting and moving slowly. We visited Mo on what they called the angel ward – although he was the only baby in it – never staying too long in case we got too accustomed to the idea of him. His pretty little face. His wrinkly, too-long fingers.And then we got ready to leave.During my pregnancy, I spent a lot of time sitting in the waiting room, on the other side of where all the action takes place. It was always such a fun moment when families would burst through the double doors, triumphantly, baby in hand. I had been excited for the day we did the same.Instead we walked out empty-handed: me, Louis and the sweet midwife from the antenatal class trailing behind us, all of us weeping.Amid the paperwork were questions about what we wished to do with Mo’s body. We felt too fragile to think about our son being picked at and jostled in his death to say yes to anything. So to begin with we said no to it all: photographs, postmortem, investigation.But we began to regret not getting a photograph. One of the hardest things about Mo dying before he was born is that I knew so little about him. I do not know what his smile would have been like, how his cry sounded, or whether his eyes would have stayed blue or turned brown in the end. I suddenly wanted to see him from every angle, to ensure against the fading of my already very finite memories.View image in fullscreenSo a week after we got home, we called and asked if we still had time to have pictures done.A volunteer photographer called back. He was from acharitythat handles the delicate work of taking photos of stillborn children, making portraits of them as precious as if they were born alive. He said he would have a look at Mo, who was still in his crib at the hospital, and see how much he had deteriorated to discern if it would be appropriate to take a picture.We received a little USB stick in the post just in time for his funeral.I knew it was coming and awaited it like the most exciting gift. I just could not wait to see Mo one more time. And when I did, I thought:There’s our boy. He looked so cute: his cheeks all puckered up in rest; his head less cone-shaped than after delivery; his wavy, dark hair flicking up around his ears and at the top of his head like Angel Delight.I kept the photos on a computer and gave myself a daily allowance of time to look at them, before eventually putting them on my phone and looking at them whenever I wanted.I wanted to show everyone – as parents are wont to do after having a child. But I pained over how, exactly, to ascertain whether people wanted to see photos of him, or whether all they would see was a dead baby.Mo’s body was too small for a coffin, so he went below ground in a Moses basket instead. We drove with him in a black cab to a cemetery a few miles down the road. Only Louis and I attended.We played a few songs, and I was surprised to find myself beset with grief listening to “Father and Son” by Cat Stevens. It is not a happy song, but I guess I was most looking forward to the time in life where Mo had his own mind and disagreed with us.View image in fullscreenWhen they lowered him into the dirt, I watched until I could not any more. I had always marveled at how I had built Mo’s spine: a structure so sturdy and yet so intricate. Now all I could imagine was it being crushed beneath the soil.Later people came around for the wake. I had rehearsed my speech so many times that I did not cry when I gave it, although everyone else did.I read out letters from friends who had watched us wonder at Mo while he was growing inside me; friends who felt like they knew Mo too. People signed a book that we left in his bedroom with goodbye messages.At the end of the night, I think we went to bed smiling.While working on this piece, I had to rework several sections because they were written in the second person.“The reminders jump out at you, evil in all their mundanity,” I wrote about experiencing my home like a house of horrors, an assault course in which I would constantly have to duck and dive baby nostalgia to make it through a single day.But these things didn’t jump out atyou. They jumped out at me.Sleights of hand such as these reveal something: in my case, that I am still so dissociated from losing my baby that I cannot describe it as having happened to me. My mind does backbends to keep everything I went through at arm’s length – even as the rational part of me makes all the right, therapised sounds of acceptance. This is one of the many layers of self-deception I have had to peel away since Mo died. It has been two years, and I still have not fully been able to take it all in.I had been proud of myself in pregnancy, feeling strong and functional. Something about reaching this rite of passage and passing all of the necessary milestones without concerns triggered all of my childlike impulses: the need to do well and be praised. So when I could not deliver Mo safely, it registered first as a grave failure of my body.I pictured all of the women throughout time, without medicine or hospitals, sometimes in war zones, crouching in bushes and on toilet seats, birthing babies. It’s a ridiculous depiction, but next to it, I felt pathetic.My body became a site of grief, a sad and empty space beset by the postpartum symptoms I still had to go through – without the salve of a child to go with themIn the following months, whether or not my body would fail me again became a constant preoccupation – as did finding out why it had done so in the first place.I spent time obsessively Googling things such as:If you have a stillbirth once, will you have one again?Why couldn’t I birth my baby?Underlying conditions that cause stillbirthMy body became a site of grief, a sad and empty space beset by the postpartum symptoms I still had to go through – without the salve of a child to go with them.View image in fullscreenAs my uterus deflated over the course of the next few weeks, a pain similar to contractions ensued, landing me in a strange limbo where part of me believed Mo was still coming. Each fake contraction reminded me of being in labour, that forlorn resignation I felt when I knew he had died but had to continue anyway flooding back. I jacked myself up on morphine in the hospital and a concoction of other drugs at home, wanting to ward off any contraction-like feeling before it happened. I vomited and shook and had migraines that left me laying stationary with a towel over my face for hours on end.But I was also healing. I focused on walking and sitting up and getting stronger. It was all so preoccupying; I felt I was attending to my grief. And to some extent I was. But there was far more to reckon with than what had happened to my body.Once I was mobile enough to do anything other than lie around, the months ahead of me stretched out, long and unwinding. I felt the wind knocked out of me every time I remembered there was more than today to get through. Then I would remember that I would feel some version of this for the rest of my life, and I would feel my brain whirring around in my skull.“Let’s leave that for now,” I would have to tell myself.But the reminders were so quotidian. I sobbed at the sight of a bright purple yoga ball in our living room. I had incessantly bounced on it in late pregnancy, willing my baby out, and then during early labour to ease the pain. Now, it seemed to tease me.A jolt of sorrow hit me when my husband mentioned eating the food we had lovingly stocked in the freezer, back when we imagined this time would be spent bleary-eyed, cuddling with the baby, unable to cook for ourselves. The hospital bag we had so expectantly packed remained the same way for over a year – a museum of our hopes kept perfectly intact.I managed to convince myself that my pain was somehow less torturous because Mo had not been bornWe kept Mo’s room as a shrine to all the things we had hoped to dress him in (as well as the many strange grieving gifts we got and could not bear to explain to new people). And although I unsubscribed from all the email reminders of what my baby’s development should be at this stage, it took a long time for me to stop thinking of months in relation to how old Mo would have been.I entered a phase of monk-like piety (“I will never wear lipstick, like a normal person who hasn’t lost her baby would, again; I will never sit on the rocking chair where I planned to feed him again; I will never watch Barbecue Showdown, which I watched before going to the hospital, ever again!”), followed by toxic positivity (“I will always love these stretch marks! They’re the only thing of my son I have left!”). And although all this was bracketed by profound sorrow (a guttural scream in our little toilet by the kitchen that opens to the garden, door ajar, facing outside with abandon while I cry-peed), I still found it hard to come to terms with the depths of my aching.View image in fullscreenI managed to convince myself that my pain was somehow less torturous because Mo had not been born – that I couldn’t possibly know the pain of losing a child, because I had not had one.I would surprise myself with slips of the tongue, when I would let out a wail, saying something like: “I just want my baby” or “I miss him” – before hastily rearranging myself, assuming I had reached for the closest, cliche expression that did not accurately reflect my own experience.But the truth of how I felt was all there in my dreams, where I would see babies coming back to life, only to wake up in that foggy gold glow, desperate to return to slumber.And each night, I would go to bed with my most desperate thought. Sometimes, I still do:We were so close.In the daytime, I was consumed with guilt.When I was pregnant, every decision I made haunted me. No pain relief except Tylenol – but only if necessary. Hot baths, but with my hands, feet and head lifted out. Running was accompanied by fastidious watch-watching, to ensure my heart rate never stayed consistently above 145bpm (all followed by a days-long panic that I had caused great harm).But even though I had tried so hard to follow the right rules – the rules that were backed by science! – I could not shake the idea after Mo died that I had killed him somehow.I would find myself raking over the past, searching for tiny clues amid the piles of innocuous memories. I became convinced I murdered Mo when I asked my husband to use a massage gun on my lower back during labour; that I was negligent for not noticing the peak in my hunger around weeks 38 and 39, which were a sure sign he was starving to death. I scrolled through photos on my phone like a maniac, searching for symptoms that I should have noticed: was my bump hanging too low? Was that the last time I felt him kick?Whenever I did this, I felt like I was watching a horror movie, wanting to scream at my past self: “Get out! Make a different choice now before it’s too late!”My body hurled itself out of bed in the middle of the night, awake with thoughts:I was five days overdue!Was he still alive when we got to the hospital?Two years later, I still spend whole days swimming through a list of possibilities – each one ending with a living Mo.What if Ihad gone in earlier?What if Ihad taken the epidural?Why didn’t I just get induced?My decision to lie to the midwife is still part of the everyday flotsam I fish out of the “Reasons I Killed My Baby” swamp in my brain. I replay endless scenarios where I told the truth, was whisked to the ward and met Mo in my arms – his eyes open instead of closed.View image in fullscreenMy rational brain knows that I could not predict what happened. But in the place where my mind and my heart connect, I still believe that I killed him when I lied.For this, I cannot believe my husband does not hate me.This was not my first rodeo when it comes to unexpected, mind-bending, heart-wrenching life affairs; I have been around the block once or twice when it comes to the shock of early loss. And so when I lost Mo, one of the things I was most immediately furious about was that I had not seen it coming.What an idiot, I thought, for naming my child as if nothing might go wrong, for so naively bestowing him with a personality and tastes (“He loves raspberries! And the granola with the chocolate and honey clusters!” I told my friends, certain his love for sugar, inferred by his kicks, meant he was an extrovert).But at some point, things started to feel lighter. My friends arrived every evening with beers and takeout and anecdotes about the world outside that were more interesting than mine and Louis’s slow-paced, unmoving days. People sent so many flowers that we could not sit at our dining table for a month. We received so many hampers it is a mystery we did not grow larger than we did. And all of these things gave me an appreciation of earnestness: a trait I had previously despised.One of the things I have learned since his death is that I can be a cynic as a defense mechanism: I am afraid to appear humorless, or to look like someone who believes good things will happen to them, because I will feel like an idiot when they ultimately do not. I complained often in my pregnancy about all the things I thought would ruin me – how I would be awful on no sleep; and how I did not want to go to the sing-song play groups that I found moronic; and how I was just maybe not the kind of woman who isthatinto being a parent–because I was scared of stating my hopes.I was afraid to admit that, actually, I had always been compelled by – and perhaps even well-suited to – parenthood.Losing Mo made me realize that all of my guardedness did not make the pain more bearable. If anything, I wish I had more openly loved him, that I had been even more vulnerable in my willingness to accept how much of it I thought I would love. I could have sat in that joy a little longer before he was gone.I do believe Mo’s life contained whole worldsDon’t get me wrong – I do not think all of motherhood is a breeze. My second son, Kamil, is a delight, but while it’s not like I enjoy wiping his snot or pulling a piece of grass out of his poo, I have become a much more honest person about the glorious parts, much more willing to admit that I experience them.There was a point when I found it strange to listen to people share how they had been shaken by Mo’s death, too. How they had taken the day off work or broken down into tears or spent a week feeling distraught after they heard of what happened. And then, one day, that changed too. I think I found it hard to see how upset people were at our loss, because it brought home how universally damning it was. Part of accepting that means being able to feel truly sorry for yourself, and that’s something I’ve always struggled with.Soon, instead, I started to feel seen when people told me they loved Mo, and they mourned him too. “Grief is just love with nowhere to go,”someone told me. And so I began to grieve him and love him more openly. To listen to people’s stories about how sorry they were, without wanting to correct them, or feel angry at their pity.View image in fullscreen“Mo’s life would be full of whole worlds,” Louis said to me one day, talking about all of the people, places and moments that he would have known.It was such a tender thought. Such a specific thing to miss without ever having experienced it. It sort of sums up what it was like to miss our unborn child.I do believe Mo’s life contained whole worlds. From the moment he existed, he changed us, and watching our elation changed other people, too.My friend wrote a letter that we read out at his funeral about how her love for my son grew in proportion to my ever-expanding tummy. She admitted how scared she was that we were going back to London to give birth and start a new chapter, and how that would put thousands of miles between us. But she also explained how, ultimately, that fear turned into admiration.“I started to see you as someone who would expand, not shrink from me and the rest of the world. Sometimes, I could see glimpses of how you’d mother Mo: hugging him, telling him off, feeding him all kinds of different foods at six months,” she wrote, continuing:“A baby at one day old hasn’t done much, on paper … Another way to look at it, though, is that a baby at one day old – even if he never had the chance to take a breath – already changed everything.”It was Mo’s second birthday this month. So on 15 July, we bumbled over to his grave with Kamil.After we first buried him, I found it overwhelming how quickly the cemetery got full: a reminder that this ever-so-delicate, unique experience we were going through was actually not very unique at all. I hated looking at the balloons by graves, marking third and 13th and 33rd birthdays.What a way to spend a birthday, I thought.But when I plopped Kamil down on the dirt, where his brother lay underneath, he laughed and smacked the ground in glee. He seemed to say: “Actually, this is a great way to spend the day.”That evening, we went home, and played the songs from Mo’s funeral. Our house, which one year ago had felt so empty, suddenly felt so full. And when it started raining outside, we scarcely even noticed."

Where the early English kings fought off the Danes and whereChurchill launched secret flightsto aid resistance fighters keeping the Nazis at bay.But the historic earthworks, wheatfields and RAF base of Tempsford may yet prove no match for a chancellor bent on housebuilding and growth, armed with thinktank reports and a 10-year infrastructure strategy.Before Rachel Reeves announced plans to accelerate a “growth arc” between Oxford and Cambridge, the name of this tinyBedfordshirevillage was likely unknown to most.Then, last month, the government confirmed plans to make it the site of a new railway station, wherethe planned East West Rail linking the university citieswill meet the East Coast mainline from London.Tempsford could be an appealing commuter base for workers in any of those cities, but some see more potential still. As Labour came to powerpledging 1.5 million new homes, areport from UK Day Oneurged that they should be built asnew towns. And there was one obvious location.A map showing Tempsford on the as-yet-unfinished train line between Oxford and Cambridge, at the point where it intersects with the line to LondonIt was, said David Sutton, the chair of the parish council and landlord of the village pub, quite a moment when the 600 residents of Tempsford learned of plans to swell their ranks to 350,000 people.A previous local Bedfordshire plan had identified possible development opportunities, and the county has seen plenty of fields give way to housing estates, solar farms and wind turbines. But, Sutton said: “There had been talk of 10,000 or 20,000 houses, then out of nowhere came this 350,000 [people] figure.”He said local reaction ranged “from apathy, saying, ‘well, nothing’s happened yet,’ to ‘we have to move away.’”The post-war new towns of Stevenage and Welwyn, and the success story of the 1960s wave, Milton Keynes, are all relatively nearby. But as they thrived, Tempsford saw its century-old station axed in theBeeching cuts, and the expanded A1 road cut the settlement in two.On the east side of this division is Station Road, ending in a level crossing where East Coast main line trains whizz between London and Edinburgh. To the west is the pub, various Tudor buildings and the church. Union jacks fly over centuries-old thatched cottages and – if you can ignore the sound of the A1, tucked out of sight behind strategically placed trees – the ruralEnglandvibes are strong.Sutton’s pub, the Wheatsheaf, reopened last year, and claims a history dating back at least as far as a coaching house on the site in the early 16th century.View image in fullscreenDavid Sutton is the chair of the parish council and landlord of the Wheatsheaf in Tempsford.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“There’s an element of being the only traditional pub in a city of hundreds of thousands of people that isn’t all bad,” Sutton said. “Milton Keynes shows how it could be done. But it isn’t pretty.”The neighbouring village, Roxton, is already seeing development and could be swallowed up by the new town. Behind the bar of the Wheatsheaf, Fiona Nicholl said she recently sold her home in Roxton to move to Tempsford. “I used to look out of my windows and see fields,” she said. “Then I watched the road and houses grow up ... All this rural land disappeared.“It just doesn’t make any sense – it’s just taking away the beauty of a rural area. The amount of stress it puts on the whole community is mad.”Roxton residents have just lost a planning appeal to stop a development that was admitted to be environmentally damaging. “But that didn’t outweigh the benefits of new housing,” said Deborah Jackson, a Wheatsheaf regular. “If a council hasn’t met its housing need, then the planners can ride roughshod over the rest.”It is very much the direction of travel, as the new Labour government has signalled, to favour the builders over the blockers. And Tempsford, unlike many new developments, will at least be well connected. As well as the promised new train station, work is underway to reshape the nearby Black Cat roundabout. Part of a £1bn investment by National Highways, this will complete the dual carriageway between Milton Keynes andCambridge.View image in fullscreenTempsford resident Fiona Nicholl.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“It seemed like the perfect location,” said Kane Emerson, one of the UK Day One report’s two authors. “We were motivated by our strong feeling that new homes should be well located for transport.”Emerson, who is also the head of housing at the Yimby Alliance (“Yes, in my back yard”), added: “The government speaks a lot about economic growth – and if you look at where homes will deliver the most growth, it’s near where the average earnings to house price ratio is at its highest – essentially those places with really good opportunities such asOxford, Cambridge and London.”Developers had already spotted the potential. About 850 hectares (2,100 acres) of the land around Tempsford is optioned by Urban&Civic, a developer owned by the Wellcome Trust.The case for Tempsford improves further, the UK Day One report said, with a tax or other mechanism to claim some of the massive uplift in land value for the state.“The agricultural price per hectare is about £35,000,” Emerson said. “Once you get planning permission you are looking at £3m per hectare. The government should be capturing a significant chunk of that – it’s kind of free money.”Emerson’s co-author, Samuel Hughes, is an editor at Works in Progress magazine. He said this money could finance long-desired upgrades to the East Coast main line: expanding the King’s Cross terminus and relieving the bottleneck at Welwyn – where four tracks become two, forcing high-speed and stopping services on to the same lines.“The two big questions are over land value capture and scale,” Hughes said. “Is it 10,000 or 100,000 dwellings?” After visiting the village, he still favours the latter.“The residents were remarkably polite to me, all things considered,” he said. “Unfortunately, there is an overwhelming case for building at Tempsford.”View image in fullscreenTrains speed through Tempsford on the route between London and Edinburgh, but have not stopped in the village since 1956.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe future for Tempsford may well depend on the government-commissioned new towns taskforce, which is due to report in September. But others concur that going big beats small, scattered areas of new homes.Steve Chambers is the director of the charityTransportfor New Homes. He has visited plenty of housing developments that don’t work. “We term them cowpat estates – plonked in the fields,” he said. “Every single trip they generate is in the car, in the vast majority of cases. If it’s remote, it needs to be big enough to support amenities – you’re talking about tens of thousands of homes.“What we like about the new towns plan is the scale. They really do have the potential because they can support having a high street, a bus service … And Tempsford on those two rail lines will effectively be a transport node. But it has to be built at scale if it is to be successful.”Massive urban development still feels a long way away in the Wheatsheaf, where a tank of racing snails takes pride of place. Looking across the road, over fields that lead to the river Ouse, and his own Tudor house, Sutton said: “I remember as a lad going down the A1, through this village that was cut in two, thinking that’s a weird place.“Yes, it is a weird place. But I love it.”A neighbour pulled up, and wound down the window of his electric Porsche. He was sceptical that widespread housing could come to this side of the village, having previously put sandbags out to protect his own home from theflooding river.But across the A1, he reckoned, 20,000 homes were a given. How did that make him feel? “It’s progress,” he said, sombrely, before brightening: “I’ll be in there,” he added, pointing to the nearby graveyard, “long before it happens”.Explore more on these topicsHousingPlanning policyBedfordshireRail transportRoad transportTransportTransport policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I say, Are you early or am I late?“I’m always early,” says the actor, deadpan. “Or as my elder daughter refers to me, ‘aggressively early’.”Curtis is in a plain black top, heavy black-framed glasses and – importantly for this conversation – little or no makeup, while behind her in the gloom, a dog sleeps in a basket. She won’t say what part of the US she’s in beyond the fact it’s a “witness protection cabin in the woods” where “I’m trying to have privacy” – an arch way, I assume, of saying she’s not in LA – and immediately starts itemising other situations in which she has been known to be early: Hollywood premieres (“They tell me I can’t go to the red carpet yet because it’s not open and so my driver, Cal, and I drive around and park in the shade”); early-morning text messages (“I wake people up”); even her work schedule: “I show up, do the work, and then I get the fuck out.”This is the short version; in full, the opening minutes of our conversation involve Curtis free-associating through references to the memory of her mother and stepfather missing her performance in a school musical in Connecticut; the negotiating aims of the makeup artists’ union; the nickname by which she would like to be known if she ever becomes a grandmother (“Fifo” – short for “first in first out”); and what, exactly, her earliness is about. Not, as you might imagine, anxiety, but: “You know, honestly, I’ve done enough analysis of all this – it’s control.” Curtis knows her early arrivals strike some people as rude. “My daughter Annie says: ‘People aren’t ready for you.’ And I basically say: ‘Well, that’s their problem. They should be ready.’”“That’s their problem” is, along with, “I don’t give a shit any more” a classic Curtis expression that goes a long way towards explaining why so many people love her – and they really do love her – a woman who on top of charming us for decades in a clutch of iconic roles, has crossed over, lately, into that paradoxical territory in which she is loved precisely because she’s done worrying about what others think of her. Specifically, she doesn’t care about the orthodoxies of an industry in which women are shamed into having cosmetic surgery before they hit 30. Curtis has spoken ofhaving a procedure herselfat 25, following a comment made on the set of a film that her eyes were “baggy”. Regretting it, she has in the years sincemade the genuinely outlandish and inspiring decision to wear her hair grey and eschew surgical tweaks. That Curtis is the child of two Hollywood icons, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, and thus an insider since birth, either makes this more surprising or else explains it entirely, but either way, she has become someone who appears to operate outside the usual Hollywood rules. “I have become quite brusque,” says Curtis, of people making demands on her time when she’s not open for business. “And I have no problem saying: ‘Back the fuck off.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mary Rozzi/The GuardianI have become quite brusque, and I have no problem saying: Back off!I can believe it. During the course of our conversation, Curtis’s attitude – which is broadly charming, occasionally hectoring and appears to be driven by a general and sardonic belligerence – is that of someone pushing back against a lifetime of misconceptions, from which, four months shy of her 67th birthday, she finally feels herself to be free. Curtis is in a glorious phase of her career, one that, despite starring in huge hits – from the Halloween franchise and A Fish Called Wanda (1988) to Trading Places (1983), True Lies (1994) and the superlativeKnives Out(2019) – has always eluded her. The fact is, celebrity aside, Curtis has never been considered a particularly heavyweight actor or been A-list in the conventional way. At its most trivial, this has required her to weather small slights, such as being ignored by the Women In Film community, with its tedious schedule of panels and events. (“I still exist outside of Women In Film,” she snaps. “They’re not asking me to their lunch.”) And, more broadly, has seen Curtis completely overlooked by the Oscars since she shot Halloween, her first movie, at the age of 19.View image in fullscreenWith her Oscar for best supporting actress for 2022’s Everything Everywhere All at Once.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesWell, all that has changed now. In 2023, Curtis won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Deirdre Beaubeirdre in the genre-bending movieEverything Everywhere All at Once. That same year, she appeared in a single episode of the multi-award-winning TV showThe Bearas Donna Berzatto, the alcoholic mother of a large Italian clan – she calls it “the most exhilarating creative experience I will ever have”. Anyone who saw this extraordinary performance is still talking about it, and it led to a larger role on the show. Doors that had always been shut to Curtis flew open. For years, she had tried and failed to get movie and TV projects off the ground. Now, she lists the forthcoming projects she had a hand in bringing to the screen: “Freakier Friday, TV series Scarpetta, survival movie The Lost Bus, four other TV shows and two other movies.” She has become a “prolific producer”, she says, as well as a Hollywood elder and role model. All of which makes Curtis laugh – the fact that, finally, “at 66, I get to be a boss”. You’d better believe she’ll be making the most of it.The movie Curtis and I are ostensibly here to talk about is Freakier Friday, the follow-up to Freaky Friday, the monster Disney hit of 2003 in which Curtis andLindsay Lohanappeared as a mother and daughter who switch bodies with hilarious consequences. I defy anyone who enjoyed the first film not to feel both infinitely aged by revisiting the cast more than 20 years on, and also not to find it a wildly enjoyable return. The teenage Lohan of the first movie is now a 37-year-old mother of 15-year-old Harper, played by Julia Butters, while the introduction of a second teenager – Harper’s mortal enemy Lily, played by Sophia Hammons – allows for a four-way body swap in which Curtis-as-grandma is inhabited by Hammons’ British wannabe influencer. If it lacks the simplicity of the first movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to taking my 10-year-old girls when it opens next month.View image in fullscreenAs a baby with parents Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh and sister Kelly, 1959.Photograph: Donaldson Collection/Getty ImagesI witnessed my parents lose the very thing that gave them their fame and their life and their livelihood, when the industry rejected them at a certain ageIt is also a movie that presented Curtis with an odd set of challenges. She has a problem with “pretty”. When Curtis herself was a teenager, she says, she was “cute but not pretty”. She watched both her parents’ careers atrophy after their youthful good looks started to wane. Part of her shtick around earliness is an almost existential refusal to live on Hollywood’s timeline, because, she says: “I witnessed my parents lose the very thing that gave them their fame and their life and their livelihood, when the industry rejected them at a certain age. I watched them reach incredible success and then have it slowly erode to where it was gone. And that’s very painful.”As a result, says Curtis: “I have been self-retiring for 30 years. I have been prepping to get out, so that I don’t have to suffer the same as my family did.I want to leave the party before I’m no longer invited.” In the movie, Curtis was allowed to keep her grey hair (although it looks shot through with blond) but her trademark pixie cut was replaced with something longer and softer. I take it with a pinch when she says things such as, “I’m an old lady” and, “I’m going to die soon” – even in age-hating Hollywood, this seems overegged – but one takes the point that she found the conventional aesthetic demands of Freakier Friday, in which she “had to look pretty, I had to pay attention to [flattering] lighting, and clothes and hair and makeup and nails”, much harder than playing a dishevelled alcoholic inThe Bear.View image in fullscreenIn Halloween, 1978.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesOn the other hand, Curtis is a pro and, of course, gave Disney the full-throated, zany-but-still-kinda-hot grandma they wanted. (There is a scene in which she tries to explain various board games – Boggle, Parcheesi – to the owl-eyed teens that reminds you just how fine a comic actor she is.) It’s the story of how Freakier Friday came about, however, that really gives insight into who Curtis is: an absolute, indefatigable and inveterate hustler. “I am owning my hustle, now,” she says and is at her most impressive, her most charming and energised when she is talking about the hustle.To wit: Curtis was on a world tour promoting the Halloween franchise that made her name and that enjoyed a hugely successful reboot in 2018, when something about the crowd response struck her. “In every single city I went to, the only movie they asked me about besides Halloween was Freaky Friday – was there going to be a sequel?” When she got back from the tour, she called Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO. “I said: ‘Look, I don’t know if you’re planning on doing [a sequel], but Lindsay is old enough to have a teenager now, and I’m telling you the market for that movie exists.’”As the project came together, Curtis learned that Disney was planning to release Freakier Friday straight to streaming. “And I called Bob Iger” – it’s at this point you start to imagine Iger seeing Curtis’s name flash up on his phone and experiencing a slight drop in spirits – “and I called David Greenbaum [Disney Live Action president], and I called Asad Ayaz, who’s the head of marketing, and I said: ‘Guys, I have one word for you: Barbie. If you don’t think the audience that saw Barbie is going to be the audience that goes and sees Freakier Friday, you’re wrong.’”This is what Curtis means when she refers to herself as “a marketing person”, or “a weapon of mass promotion”, and she has done it for ever. It’s what she did in 2002 when she lobbied More magazine to let her pose in her underwear and no makeup – “They didn’t come to me and say: ‘Hey Jamie, how about you take off your clothes and show America that you’re chubby?’ The More magazine thing happened because I said it should happen, and I even titled the piece: True Thighs.”And it is what she was doing a few weeks before our interview when she turned up to the photoshoot in LA bearing a bunch of props she had ordered from Amazon, including oversized plastic lips and a blond wig. Curtis says: “There are many, many actresses who love the dress up, who love clothes, who love fashion, who love being a model. I. Hate. It. I feel like I am having to wrestle with your idea of me versus my idea of me. Because I’ve worked hard to establish who I am, and I don’t want you to … I have struggled with it my whole life.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPortraits: Mary Rozzi/The GuardianCurtis is emphatic that her ideas be accurately interpreted and, before our meeting, sent an email via her publicist explaining her thinking behind the shoot. “The wax lips is my statement against plastic surgery. I’ve been very vocal about the genocide of a generation of women by the cosmeceutical industrial complex, who’ve disfigured themselves. The wax lips really sends it home.”Obviously, the word “genocide” is very strong and risks causing offence, given its proper meaning. To Curtis, however, it is accurate. “I’ve used that word for a long time and I use it specifically because it’s a strong word. I believe that we have wiped out a generation or two of natural human [appearance]. The concept that you can alter the way you look throughchemicals, surgical procedures, fillers – there’s a disfigurement of generations of predominantly women who are altering their appearances. And it is aided and abetted by AI, because now the filter face is what people want. I’m not filtered right now. The minute I lay a filter on and you see the before and after, it’s hard not to go: ‘Oh, well that looks better.’ But what’s better? Better is fake. And there are too many examples – I will not name them – but very recently we have had a big onslaught through media, many of those people.”Well, at the risk of sounding harsh, one of the people implicated by Curtis’s criticism is Lindsay Lohan, her Freakier Friday co-star and a woman in her late 30s who has seemingly had a lot of cosmetic procedures at a startlingly young age (though Lohan denies having had surgery). In terms of mentoring Lohan, with whom Curtis remained friends after making the first film, she says: “I’m bossy, very bossy, but I try to mind my own business. She doesn’t need my advice. She’s a fully functioning, smart woman, creative person. Privately, she’s asked me questions, but nothing that’s more than an older friend you might ask.”But given the stridency of Curtis’s position on cosmetic surgery, don’t younger women feel judged in her presence? Isn’t it awkward? “No. No. Because I don’t care. It doesn’t matter. I’m not proselytising to them. I would never say a word. I would never say to someone: what have you done? All I know is that it is a never-ending cycle. That, I know. Once you start, you can’t stop. But it’s not my job to give my opinion; it’s none of my business.”As for Lohan, Curtis says: “I felt tremendous maternal care for Lindsay after the first movie, and continued to feel that. When she’d come to LA, I would see her. She and I have remained friends, and now we’re sort of colleagues. I feel less maternal towards her because she’s a mommy now herself and doesn’t need my maternal care, and has, obviously, a mom – Dina’s a terrific grandma.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At the back of my mind, however, I have a small, pinging reservation that I can’t quite put my finger on. I suggest to Curtis that she has natural advantages by virtue of being a movie star, which, on the one hand, of course, makes her more vulnerable around issues of ageing, but on the other hand, she’s naturally beautiful and everyone loves her, and most average women who –“I have short grey hair!” she protests. “Other women can –”They can, of course! But you must have a physical confidence that falls outside the normal –“No! No!” She won’t have it. “I feel like you’re trying to say: ‘You’re in some rarefied air, Jamie.’” I’m not! She responds:“By the way, genetics – you can’t fuck with genetics. You want to know where my genetics lie?” She lifts up an arm and wobbles her bingo wings at me. “Are you kidding me? By the way, you’re not going to see a picture of me in a tank top, ever.” This is Curtis’s red line. “I wear long-sleeve shirts; that’s just common sense.” She gives me a beady look. “I challenge you that I’m in some rarefied air.”I think about this afterwards to try and clarify my objection, which I guess is this: that the main reason women in middle age dye their hair is to stave off invisibility, which, with the greatest respect, is not among the veteran movie star’s problems. But it’s a minor quibble given what I genuinely believe is Curtis’s helpful and iconoclastic gesture.And when she talks about cosmetic surgery as addiction, she should know. Curtis was an alcoholic until she got sober at 40 and is emphatic and impressive on this subject, the current poster woman – literally: she’s on signs across LA for an addiction charity with the tagline: “My bravest thing? Getting sober”. I’m curious about how her intense need for control worked, in those years long ago, alongside her addiction?View image in fullscreenWith her mother Janet Leigh in LA, 1979.Photograph: Ron Galella Collection/Getty Images“I am a controlled addict,” she says. “In recovery we talk about how, in order to start recovering, you have to hit what you call a ‘bottom’. You have to crash and burn, lose yourself and your family and your job and your resources in order to know that the way you were living didn’t work. I refer to myself as an Everest bottom; I am the highest bottom I know. When I acknowledged my lack of control, I was in a very controlled state. I lost none of the external aspects of my life. The only thing I had lost was my own sense of myself and self-esteem.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mary Rozzi/The GuardianExternally, during those years of addiction, she seemed to be doing very well. Her career boomed. She married Christopher Guest, the actor, screenwriter and director, and they have two children and have stayed married for more than 40 years. (There’s no miracle to this. As Curtis puts it, wryly: “It’s just that we have chosen to stay married.And be married people. And we love each other. And I believe we respect each other. And I’m sure there’s a little bit of hatred in there, too.”) I wonder, then, whether Curtis’s success during those years disguised how serious a situation she was in with her addiction?“There’s no one way to be an addict or an alcoholic. People hide things – I was lucky, and I am ambitious, and so I never let that self-medication get in the way of my ambition or work or creativity. It never bled through. No one would ever have said that had been an issue for me.”Where was the cost?“The external costs are awful for people; but the internal costs are more sinister and deadly, because to understand that you are powerless over something other than your own mind and creativity is something. But that was a long time ago. I’m an old lady now.”She is doing better than ever. With the Oscar under her belt, Curtis has just returned in the new season of The Bear and has a slew of projects – many developed with Jason Blum, the veteran horror producer with whom she has a development deal – coming down the line. Watching her bravura performance as Donna Berzatto, I did wonder if playing an alcoholic had been in any way traumatic. She flashes me a look of pure vehemence. “Here’s what’s traumatic: not being able to express your range as an artist. That’s traumatic. To spend your entire public life holding back range. And depth. And complexity. And contradiction. And rage. And pain. And sorrow.” She builds momentum: “And to have been limited to a much smaller palette of creative, emotional work.View image in fullscreenAs Donna Berzatto, the alcoholic mother of a large Italian clan, in The Bear.Photograph: FX“For me, it was an unleashing of 50 years of being a performer who was never considered to have any range. And so the freedom, and the confidence, that I was given by Chris [Storer, the show’s creator], and the writing, which leads you … everywhere you need to go – it was exhilarating.”She continues: “It took no toll. The toll has been 40 years of holding back something I know is here.”Well, there she is, the Curtis who thrills and inspires. Among the many new projects is The Lost Bus, a survival disaster movie for AppleTV+ about a bus full of children trying to escape wildfires. The idea came to Curtis while she was driving on the freeway, listening to an NPR report on the deadly wildfires of 2018 in the small town of Paradise, California. She pulled over and called Blum; the movie, directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matthew McConaughey and America Ferrera, drops later this year. For another project, she managed to persuade Patricia Cornwell, the superstar thriller writer, to release the rights for her Scarpetta series, which, as well as producing, Curtis will star in alongside Nicole Kidman.This burst of activity is something Curtis ascribes to the “freedom” she derived from losing “all vanity”, and over the course of our conversation “freedom” is the word she most frequently uses to describe what she values in life. Freedom is a particularly loaded and precious concept for those on the other side of addiction and, says Curtis, “I have dead relatives; I have parents who both had issues with drinking and drugs. I have a dead sibling. I have numerous friends who never found the freedom, which is really the goal – right? Freedom.”View image in fullscreenWith husband Christopher Guest and daughters Ruby and Annie.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPA-EFE/ ShutterstockIt’s a principle that also extends to her family. Curtis’s daughter Ruby, 29, is trans, and I ask how insulated they are from Donald Trump’s aggressively anti-trans policies. “I want to be careful because I protect my family,” says Curtis. “I’m an outspoken advocate for the right of human beings to be who they are. And if a governmental organisation tries to claim they’re not allowed to be who they are, I will fight against that. I’m a John Steinbeck student – he’s my favourite writer – and there’s a beautiful piece of writing from East of Eden about the freedom of people to be who they are. Any government, religion, institution trying to limit that freedom is what I need to fight against.”There are many, many other subjects to cycle through, including Curtis’s friendship with Mariska Hargitay,whose new documentaryabout her mother, Jayne Mansfield, hit Curtis particularly hard, not least because “Jayne’s house was next to Tony Curtis’s house – that big pink house on Carolwood Drive that Tony Curtis lived in and Sonny and Cher owned prior to him.” (I don’t know if referring to her dad as “Tony Curtis,” is intended to charm, but it does.) There’s also a school reunion she went to over a decade ago; the feeling she has of being “a 14-year-old energy bunny”; the fact we’ve been pronouncing “Everest” wrong all this time; the role played by lyrics from Justin Timberlake’s Like I Love You in her friendship with Lindsay Lohan; and the “Gordian knot” of what happens when not being a brand becomes your brand.Curtis could, one suspects, summon an infinite stream of enthusiasms and – perhaps no better advertisement for ageing, this – share urgent thoughts about every last one of them. In an industry in which people weigh their words, veil their opinions and pander to every passing ideal, she has gone in a different direction, one unrestrained by the usual timidities. Or as she puts it with her typical take-it-or-leave-it flatness, “the freedom to have my own mind, wherever it’s going to take me. I’m comfortable with that journey and reject the rest.”Freakier Friday is in Australian cinemas from 7 August and from 8 August in the UK and USJamie Lee Curtis wears: (leopard look) jacket and skirt, byRixo; T-shirt and belt, both byAllSaints; boots, byDr Martens; tights, byWolford; (tartan look) suit, by Vivienne Westwood, frommytheresa.com; tights, byWolford; shoes, byBy Far.

I loved the job and was having a ball. Three years in I was offered a rare opportunity to train for a top-secret role at a base in Queensland. Me and the two other girls were to be deployed to Singapore 12 weeks later. That was before my radio broke down.One afternoon, midway through my stay in Queensland, I had some issues with my electronics and called for a technician. I’d expected to get my radio repaired and get on with the day, but then the most gorgeous guy I’d ever seen walked right in and changed the course of my life.John was as cool as a cucumber as he got to work and I was struck dumb, just in awe of this incredibly handsome man. I didn’t know how I was going to get him to notice me, but I was determined.View image in fullscreenThe couple on Phillipa’s 40th birthdayA few days later there was a social evening at the base. It was casino themed and I spent the night following John around, making sure I was always in his eyeline. It wasn’t the most sophisticated tactic, but it worked. By the end of the evening he’d asked me out.Our first date was seeing Johnny (as he was then) Farnham sing at Lennon’s hotel in Toowoomba and it was perfect. We stole as many nights out together as we could over the next six weeks and I was going more and more gaga by the day.As my time at the base came to an end I still wasn’t sure if John wasasswept away by our romance as me. He always played it so cool. As we approached my last night, he arranged a getaway at Noosa to go surfing together and a stay at a motel. In 1969 this was very risque, but I had zero hesitation.Somewhere in the middle of the night he asked casually: “What would you say if I asked you to marry me?” If this was a hypothetical question, he had no hope of getting out of it. I flew right off the bed, jumped on top of him and yelled at the top of my lungs: “Yes, yes, yes!” I didn’t give it a second thought.View image in fullscreenLetters John wrote to Phillipa while they were apartWe set the wedding date for October – just a few months later – and I had to request a discharge from the forces; back then women couldn’t serve if they were married. The whole time I was back down south John wrote me letters – 30 in all. I still have them. They were so full of love and adoration and excitement about the future we were going to have together. It was like living in a dream.Then it was time for him to drive the 1,700-odd kilometres to Menindee, where I was from – a tiny, one-horse town on the Darling River and 100km out of Broken Hill.As his little red Datsun came up the dirt road, my stomach lurched. For the briefest second I was seized by uncertainty. I couldn’t even remember how tall he was.But the moment he stepped out of the car, I fell into his arms and those worries dissolved. The love I felt for him was so overwhelming. I knew this was going to be the best thing that ever happened to me.I was so smitten with John, there’s no doubt we rushed into things. We really knew nothing about each other. It turns out we’re exact opposites, but are such a wonderful foil for each other’s personalities. I think my lively nature has kept him interested all these years, while his calmness has kept me grounded.The moment I knew: as the curtains fell on our first performance, the electricity between us was palpableRead moreOur first child lived for just half an hour, and while it isn’t always the case, that terrible time really brought us closer together. When our son and daughter arrived safely in the coming years, I felt like the luckiest mum in the world.At a time when not all husbands were so supportive, John encouraged my desire to study to become a teacher. And just like always, once I knew he had faith in me, I felt I could do anything.To this day I wonder about how I knew, or if it was just amazing luck. But either way I’ve been married to the love of my life for over 55 years, so my instincts weren’t bad. He’s still just as gorgeous to me today as he was that afternoon in 1969.Being with John has always felt to me like living under a lucky star – everything seems to work out just how it’s supposed to.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Vance’s wife, Usha, and their three young children had to abandon aski holiday in Vermontin March after they were met with crowds of protesters with signs reading “Go ski in Russia”. The Vances were also jeered at Disneyland in California after part of the park wasclosed offfor their sole use.For some, such as the comedian and former chatshow host Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, the actor Portia de Rossi, outrage at the Trump administration has gone further. The couple moved to the Cotswolds earlier this year and now regarded it as permanent,DeGeneres said last week, explicitly so they could escape the Trump administration. Luxury estate agents say they are amonggrowing numbers of wealthy Americansseeking a foothold in what some, inevitably, are calling the English Hamptons (others, on account of the many posh people here already, prefer to call it “the Couttswolds”).And now, the VP? He may not be popular, but in Stow at least, the Vance resistance did not yet appear to have mobilised earlier this week. Local people know the value of the tourist dollar or yuan, and despite the crowds of tourists disgorging from coaches and the backed-up traffic on the A429, they welcome them, if occasionally through gritted teeth.“That’s the balancing act that [we live with],” said Ken Greenway, who had ridden his scooter into Stow “to escape the crowds in Burford”, his equally picturesque village nearby. Vance and his compatriots were welcome, he said, “and anybody who has got a business must be over the moon to see all these people coming in. But the locals, we’re struggling. I mean, it’s taken me 20 minutes to come two miles [into town] on the main road.”View image in fullscreenKen Greenway says the tourism is a ‘balancing act’ that residents of the Cotswolds live with.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianSome of the VP’s countrymen are less polite about his trip. “I’m glad we’ll have gone by then,” says Laurelyn Karagianis, visiting with a family party from Los Angeles. It had been a dream for a decade to visit the Cotswolds. “When I think about a cosy, Christmassy holiday, I think of Bourton-on-the-Water, Castle Combe,” she says, adding that it is a shame that US politics has followed the family down the winding lanes.“I just met with a [British] friend who I haven’t seen in 15 years, and that was the main topic of discussion over dinner. It’s sad that our politicians are kind of a laughing stock that the world has to protest,” Karagianis saysWhatever the cause – US political refugees, a post-Covid exodus of London’s wealthy, orsun-dappledsocial mediapostsin which Americansvisit a pubortry to work an Aga– most local people agree that visitor numbers have swelled significantly in the past decade.For some, enough is enough. After eight years living in Stow, Lesley Webb is moving to West Sussex after a change in her circumstances – which she admits is a relief. “It’s an awful thing to say, but for me, it’s just become too touristy. Stow itself has got busier and busier and busier. It’s just the volume of people, everywhere,” Webb says.Perhaps happily for the village, rumours now suggest the Vances may end up not in this idyllic part of Gloucestershire so favoured by Americans, but across the Oxfordshire border, closer to Chipping Norton. The Spectator,quoting “almost impeccable sources”, reported that “a filthy rich Anglo” could be lending his own home to the second family to spare them the deprivations of Airbnb.“Apparently some senior British political figures, who have knowledge of Cotswolds social scene, are helping the Vance family plan their trip,” the magazine said.

Wendell Daniel, a former Labour councillor who is now a film-maker for Robinson’s Urban Scoop video platform, turned his microphone to a young woman on the edge of the protests in the Essex town.“Look into that,” he said pointing to the camera. “Talk to Tommy, tell him you want to see him coming down here.”“Tommy,” she responded, “I think you should definitely come down because you will help out the situation so much more.”Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was quick to respond: “Hear you loud & clear, I’m coming to Epping next Sunday ladies & bringing thousands more with me,” he said on X. The actor and rightwing activist Laurence Fox was coming along too, he added.For days,Epping has been the scene of demonstrationsoutside the town’s Bell hotel after the charging of an Ethiopian asylum seeker – recently arrived on a small boat – with sexual assault against a local girl.With the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, talking up the risk of the disorder spreading further, it had appeared the perfect opportunity for Robinson, with a so-called “migrant hotel” providing the focus.View image in fullscreenProtesters march from the Bell hotel, where refugees are being housed, to Epping civic centre, where a council meeting was due to take place.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianTwenty-four hours later, Robinson appeared to have gone cold on the idea. It might not benefit him and it might not benefit Epping, he mused on camera.It might appear an awkward volte-face, but Lucy Brown, once a right-hand woman to Robinson, chronicling his every stunt and provocative comment for social media for two years, had seen it all before.It was, the 34-year-old suggested, an insight into both his frustrating tendency to act on instinct and a reliance on the colourful team behind him, an inner circle that includes the son of a Krays’ gangster, the Canadian publisher of a far-right platform and a Sikh convicted of being part of a robbery in which a shop worker was threatened with having his throat slashed.“He’s very reactive,” Brown said of Robinson. “It’s often just what comes into his head. He’s very quick to believe his own myth. It takes probably a bunch of messages from people saying, ‘Don’t do it’. And finally he has to begrudgingly say: ‘Oh, maybe it’s not a good idea’.“He’ll just rush in, straight away, whatever feels right at the time. He just does not think. Which is why he falls in [to] prison all the time, because he’s always saying stuff that he shouldn’t.”Brown was with Robinson at some of the key moments early in his rise, including escorting him to what would be a highly lucrative first meeting with Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist to Donald Trump. Bannon thought he was ex-army, a bemused Robinson disclosed to her at the time. Brown left Robinson’s side after a bruising falling out, but suspects that his enthusiasm for Epping dulled when he was alerted by his entourage to appeals from leading figures in the local protests for him to stay away.Will the Epping hotel riots spark another summer of unrest? – podcastRead moreRobinson may appear to be a one-man band, marshalling his significant following in the UK and a trans-national far-right community that is particularly strong in the US thanks to Bannon and Elon Musk. This week, Robinson sent out an email to followers to raise £106,000 to fund an upcoming demonstration, according to one recipient.In truth, the 42-year-old sits at the centre of an ecosystem of long-term acolytes and more recent hangers-on, who are key to facilitating what even his harshest critics will admit is a successful campaign to put himself at the heart of national debate.When Robinsonjudicially reviewedhis “detention in solitary confinement and treatment” at HMP Woodhill, wherehe was jailedfor repeating false claims about a 15-year-old Syrian refugee in defiance of a court injunction, the judge ruled against him on the grounds that it was for his protection and he had enjoyed “80 social visits, not including those from family members”.On leaving prison, Robinson told a friendly podcaster that he had planned from his cell a ‘Uniting the Kingdom’ demonstration in London to be held on 13 September, all with the help of regular communication with his lieutenants.Who then is Team Tommy? Brown, who at one point moved to Bedfordshire to work more closely with Robinson, stopped working with him seven years ago, but the core around him has remained remarkably stable for at least a decade, according toJoe Mulhall, director of research atHope Not Hate.On leaving HMP Woodhill, Robinson had words of thanks on the steps of the prison for Ezra Levant, the Canadian owner of Rebel Media, a social media platform similar to the better known Breitbart, for helping his family while he was in jail.View image in fullscreenTommy Robinson after his release from HMP Woodhill in May. His 18-month sentence for contempt of court was reduced by four months at the high court.Photograph: @TRobinsonNewEra/PANine years ago, he had started paying Robinson £200 a video for Rebel. The platform generates revenue through donations from viewers and crowdfunding campaigns. Brown, who was the helping hand with the camera at the start of that relationship, said Robinson had become a big earner for the businessman.“Ezra Levant is very important, definitely kind of like the show runner, and it’s fascinating seeing him still around,” she said. “He is the one that goes down to the court cases with [former Sun journalist] Dan Wootton and spins the story to make sure that everyone knows that Tommy’s actually the victim, guys. He is perpetuating the Tommy myth despite seeing him up close and personal. But it is a business to him.”While it was with Levant that Robinson did his first interview after leaving jail, the second was on a podcast called The Dozen hosted by Liam Tuffs, son of Peter Gillett, a registered sex offender who was said by Reggie Kray to be his “adoptive son”.Tuffs, who runs a security firm and has described his father as an “animal” and “narcissist”, has interviewed figures such as Laurence Fox (in a episode entitled “British Culture is under Attack”) but he has also featured Adam Kelwick, the imam at the Abdullah Quilliam mosque inLiverpool(an episode entitled “Death Cult or Peaceful Religion? Muslim Leader Quizzed over Radical Islam”).“He’s a friend of Tommy that now and again would go on stage and compere for him,” said Brown of Tuffs, who is regarded as a calming influence on Robinson, who has been diagnosed with ADHD. “I’ve watched him sidle his way in. He likes to tell people that he helps Tommy get sober, but I’m not sure if we can trust that Tommy is sober, to be honest with you.”It was Tufts and Guramit Singh, a former leading member of the English Defence League (EDL), who was with Robinson at the Hawksmoor restaurant on London’s Air Street last month when they were asked to leave because staff “felt uncomfortable serving him”.Singh, from Nottingham, was sentenced in 2013 to seven years and three months in jail for his role in a robbery during which a shop assistant was pinned the ground and made threats to slash his throat if he did not hand over cash.View image in fullscreenTommy Robinson speaks to supporters and media as he leaves Westminster magistrates court in June.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesThere is a further tranche of Robinson devotees at Urban Scoop, the so-called “independent journalism” website to which Robinson is a consultant. It was set up by Adam Geary, better known as “Nem”, and one of Robinson’s closest advisers since the rough and ready days of the EDL.You give Tom everything and he just wants more and more until you have nothing left to give. And then he doesn’t want to know youRobinson today emphasises the peacefulness of the protests he organises and the relationship with the police that he has sought to build. But Brown said that those who crossed him were well aware of his ruthlessness.In his biography, Tommy, the Hope Not Hate founder, Nick Lowles, reported how Robinson failed to visit his cousin, Kev Carroll, a former leader of the EDL, for six months when he was on remand after he was caught wielding a machete while standing on the bonnet of a car.“I’m 52 years old and I’ve got nothing to show for it,” Carroll later wrote. “You give Tom everything and he just wants more and more until you have nothing left to give. And then he doesn’t want to know you.”Lowles recalled how Robinson doorstepped him at his home alongside “self-confessed bomb-maker” Peter Keeley to accuse him of paying people to “make up information about him”. His behaviour towards a female reporter at the Independent, after she investigated his finances, compelled her to apply for an interim stalking order.What, then, keeps people by Robinson’s side? “A lot of these guys around him seem to have the same kind of modus operandi of ‘protect the source’ – because I guess they’ll probably make money as well from association with him”, said Brown. “Many of them have their own little YouTube channels, with varying degrees of success.”There was a darkness to her experience with Robinson, she said. She remembered “the dodgy guys that look and dress just like him” and the drink and drugs binges. Her memoirs, The Hate Club, are expected to chronicle some of the sleazier moments in her time with him when she self-publishes next month. Robinson has admitted to past heavy drug use while denying claims that he used donations to buy cocaine and pay for the services of sex workers.But he has a charisma that lures people into his circle, said Brown, who is married to Sascha Bailey, the son of the photographer David Bailey.“It’s like being around Peter Pan or something,” she said. “You just have to keep up the myth. You’re either in or out. He wines and dines them all, you know. ‘Come out. We’ll go for drinks’. He schmoozes people, and he knows what they want. That’s something I noticed when we were working together – he knows what people want to hear.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Health officials in the strip recorded 43 deaths from hunger over three days this week. There had previously been 68 in total.Médecins Sans Frontières said on Friday that the severe malnutrition rate among children aged under five at its Gaza City clinichad tripled in the last two weeks. The Guardian reported this week that skeletal children were filling hospital wards, and the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) said his frontline staffwere fainting from hunger.‘We faced hunger before, but never like this’: skeletal children fill hospital wards as starvation grips GazaRead moreThe UK joined 27 other countries in issuing a joint statement earlier this weekcondemning Israel for depriving Palestinians of “human dignity”as they issued a call for the immediate lifting of restrictions on the flow of aid and an end to the war in Gaza.They also described proposals by the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, to move 600,000 Palestinians to a so-called “humanitarian city” in Rafah, an area that has been heavily damaged by Israeli bombing, as “completely unacceptable”.The Israeli foreign ministry rejected the joint statement hours later, saying it was “disconnected from reality”.David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesperson, told Sky News on Wednesday: “There is no famine in Gaza. There is a famine of the truth.”The Israeli military announced on Saturday it would start airdrops with humanitarian aid in Gaza, and humanitarian corridors would also be established for UN convoys. The military also said it was prepared to implement “humanitarian pauses” in densely populated areas.It had said on Friday that it had agreed to let Jordan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) airdrop aid into Gaza. Each flight carrying aid is far more expensive and holds fewer supplies than lorries do.The UAE’s foreign minister on Saturday said the country would resume aid drops over Gaza “immediately” citing the “critical” humanitarian situation.“The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached a critical and unprecedented level,” sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said in a post on X. “We will ensure essential aid reaches those most in need, whether through land, air or sea. Air drops are resuming once more, immediately.”Starmer is facing intense pressure from his most senior cabinet ministers and more than a third of MPs to move faster on recognising a Palestinian state.The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, are among those understood to believe the government should take the lead on Palestinian statehood alongsideFrance.The foreign secretary, David Lammy, faced questions on Monday from dozens of furious MPs across the house who called on the UK government to do more, including recognition of a Palestinian state.Kit Malthouse, a Conservative MP, said he was “frankly astonished” by Lammy’s statement “at a time when we’ve got daily lynchings and expulsions on the West Bank [and] dozens being murdered as they beg for aid”.He said he was “just beyond words really at [Lammy’s] inaction, and frankly, complicity by inaction at what is going on”, which he said carried the “personal risk” of ending up at The Hague.Lammy said he understood “the fury that [Malthouse] feels”, to which Malthouse shouted back: “Why don’t you feel it?”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaKeir StarmerFranceGermanyIrannewsShareReuse this content"

It concluded at Parliament Square with speakers including Heartstopper and Doctor Who actor Yasmin Finney.The event’s theme was “existence and resistance” in response to the UK supreme court ruling in April that said the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.Lewis G Burton, one of the founding members of London Trans+ Pride said: “This year’s London Trans+ Pride made history once again, with over 100,000 trans+ people and allies marching through central London – smashing our own world record of 60,000 and continuing our legacy as the biggest trans+ pride event in history.“It was an emotional and powerful day. At a time when the supreme court is making sweeping decisions about trans people without consulting a single trans person or organisation, and when a small, well-funded lobby of anti-trans campaigners continues to dominate headlines and waste public resources, our community came together to show what real strength, solidarity and care looks like.“I feel honoured to have platformed some of the most inspiring activists, organisers and trans people from across the globe. London Trans+ Pride was a vital act of resistance and joy – a reminder to trans+ people that they are not alone, that they are celebrated, and that they belong.View image in fullscreenThe London Trans+ Pride 2025 parade.Photograph: Levi Ocean/Trans pride“The message was clear: we will not be erased. Our existence is natural, historic and enduring. You can try to take away our rights, but you will never remove us from society. We are a part of humanity – and the public will not stand by while harm is done to our community.”Alex Parmar-Yee, from Trans+ Solidarity Alliance, said: “It’s important to turn up en masse to make sure that it’s very clear what the feelings are in terms of the rights which we’re fighting for, but also in protest of some of the harmful proposals that are currently being considered.”Referring to the Equality and Human Rights Commission interim guidance, she added: “This guidance has not provided any additional clarity, and actually is going to devastate the lives of trans people (who) will lose access to essential services and spaces.“The main concern really here is that it feels like there’s not been a consideration of trans members of the community, and that this guidance will pass behind closed doors, without the scrutiny, and without visibility, and without democracy.”Parmar-Yee also raised concerns about the rhetoric used in public and online discussions of trans rights, saying: “The rhetoric is not helping. There is a lot of hate which is amplified.“And I think you sort of see this happening around the world, and then you see it mirrored in the policy.“You look at the bathroom ban that’s being proposed, and you sort of realise that, although we may consider the UK quite different from a country like America, it’s a bathroom ban that would make someone like Donald Trump proud.”She said the next step for Trans+ Solidarity Alliance, a not-for-profit organisation supporting trans rights organisations and activists, was a call for transparency over the guidance in the wake of the supreme court ruling.“There is a lack of transparency and I think we cannot be a nation that accepts a bathroom ban becoming law behind closed doors,” she said.Meanwhile, in Berlin, tens of thousands danced to techno beats to celebrate the German capital’s Pride parade, one of the largest LGBTQ+ celebrations in Europe.View image in fullscreenThe route wound through Regent’s Street, Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square before ending at Parliament Square.Photograph: Chloe’ Dall’Olio/ Trans prideThe parade took revellers past the Brandenburg Gate and through the Nollendorfplatz neighbourhood, home to the city’s gay culture.German news agency dpa reported that a rightwing counter-demonstration featured 30 to 50 protesters.Six people, including the protest’s organiser, were arrested on their way to the demonstration for alleged weapons and explosives violations as well as for displaying anti-constitutional symbols, dpa reported, according to the Associated Press.Amsterdam Pride saw thousands of people march in a festive and political mood, as they emphasised the need to defend LGBTQI+ rights, which are increasingly under threat around the world.Organised by the Pride Amsterdam foundation, the march, which had the theme “love”, kicked off a week of festivities in the Dutch capital, culminating next weekend in a huge parade on the city’s famous canals, AFP reported.“People are not so aware about the march, because it has turned into too much of a party and does not so much focus on why we do it,” said Ben Thomas, 44, from Amsterdam, who teaches young refugees. “We’re not just here to party, but we’re here to be equal citizens. We’re here for our rights.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderProtestLondonLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Stop the windmills. You’re ruining your countries. I really mean it, it’s so sad. You fly over and you see these windmills all over the place, ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and killing your birds,” he said. “On immigration, you better get your act together,” he said. “You’re not going to have Europe any more.”On Saturday morning, he abandoned a scheduled meeting with the press, who travelled with him on Air Force One, for a round of golf at his seaside course with music blaring from the buggy he drove.Sky News, stationed next to the course, reported the songs included Billy Joel’s Uptown Girl, Elaine Paige’s Memory and Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge over Troubled Water.Billed as afour-day family visit to Scotland, Trump is meeting European leaders and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, raising hopes of new and refined trade deals with the EU and the UK.On the prospects of an EU trade deal, the US president has said there were “20 sticking points”. When asked what they were, he said: “Well, I don’t want to tell you what the sticking points are.”He described von der Leyen as a “highly respected woman” and said the meeting on Sunday with the EU chief would be “good”, rating the chances of a deal as “a good 50-50”.It is understood von der Leyen and her aides will fly in on Saturday, with the European trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, arriving on Sunday morning.It is expected the deal will centre on an outline agreement in principle over 15% tariff rates for exports including cars, but with a 50% tariff continuing on steel. There may also be a breakthrough deal on pharmaceuticals, setting a rate of 15% for exports.Although this would breach a longstanding World Trade Organization agreement that medicines are rated at a zero tariff, it would be a far cry from the 200% tariff Trump threatened to impose on pharmaceuticals earlier this month.This would have triggered a highly damaging trade war not just with Ireland, where many US multinationals are based, but Germany, Denmark, Belgium, France and Spain.As an American in Scotland, I know we need many things – but Donald Trump isn’t one of them | Krystal EvansRead moreVon der Leyen’s spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said: “Intensive negotiations at technical and political [level] have been ongoing between the EU and US. Leaders will now take stock and consider the scope for a balanced outcome that provides stability and predictability for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.”It is believed the meeting will be held in Turnberry late afternoon and will be followed by a series of meetings with Starmer on Monday, with hopes he will widen thebare bones trade deal he struck in May.Trump’s arrival in Scotland has required the biggest security operation since Elizabeth II died in 2022. More than 5,000 police and security personnel are involved in the four-day visit with no risks taken after theassassination attempt on the president a year ago.High perimeter fences have been erected around the coastal golf course with naval vessels patrolling the shore while security drones overhead and dozens of security detail staked out the resort early on Saturday.The heavy security presence may be a foretaste of events to come later in August when the US vice-president, JD Vance, and his family arrive for a holiday in the Cotswolds, reportedly in the village ofCharlbury.Locals who resisted the expansion of Trump’s golf course in the past haveasked who would be footing the billfor the security arrangements.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropeKeir StarmerTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

Politicians and campaigners have also reacted angrily to bill increases allowed in April by the regulator, Ofwat.The pay figures raise questions about the effectiveness of the government’sefforts to limit water executives’ pay. Ofwat gained powers last year to insist that bonuses were paid by shareholders rather than through customers’ bills, before new rules in June that allowed a ban on bonuses for bosses of companies guilty of the most serious environmental damage.The biggest pay increase was enjoyed by Keith Haslett, the chief executive of Affinity Water. He was awarded an extra £844,000,doubling his total pay to £1.6m. Portsmouth Water’s boss, Bob Taylor, also doubled his pay, to £754,000.‘Outwitted’: have water companies managed to sidestep Labour’s bonus ban?Read moreSix companies – Thames Water, Anglian Water, Southern Water,United Utilities, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water – werebanned from paying bonusesfor the 2024-25 financial year to their chief executives and chief financial officers. The bonus ban did appear to have an effect, with pay falling 8% to £5.5m across those six suppliers. Most of that drop was driven by Thames Water, whose boss, Chris Weston, received £1m, after he and three predecessor chief executives received a total of £1.7m the year before.View image in fullscreenSewage floats on the River Thames in Datchet, Berkshire.Photograph: Maureen McLean/AlamyDespite the bonus ban, Southern Water awarded its chief executive, Lawrence Gosden, an 80% pay increase to £1.4m.After theGuardian revealed the increase, the environment secretary, Steve Reed, said Gosden should turn down the extra money. Southern Water said the pay increase complied with the rules. A spokesperson said it was not a bonus but part of a “two-year long-term incentive plan”. Not all the money was paid during the financial year, and he may not receive all of it if Southern fails to achieve an adequate environmental rating.Sophie Conquest, lead campaigner at We Own It, a group campaigning for public ownership of water, said: “The public is rightly angry about the obscene levels of cash being handed over to the private water bosses.“What has their highly valued commercial brilliance delivered for us? Water bills hiked by 30% and the ongoing vandalisation of our rivers and lakes. No new reservoirs built in 30 years, and 3bn litres of water lost daily to crumbling pipes.“Never in the field of essential public services has so much been earned by so few for doing so little.”Pay for chief financial officers pay fell 3% to £7.6m for the 12 water companies who disclosed it, although that decline was driven by a steep drop from £1.3m to £636,000 for the since-departedAlastair Cochran at Thames Wateras the company neared collapse. Aside from Thames, CFO pay rose by 7% on average during the year.The highest-paid water boss was Liv Garfield, of Severn Trent, a FTSE 100 company that supplies 4.6m households across the Midlands and northWales. She was granted £3.3m during the financial year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We also have ringfenced customers’ bills to ensure investment must be spent on new sewage pipes and treatment works, not bonuses.“Any instances of companies trying to circumvent the new rules are completely unacceptable. The government will leave no stone unturned against any bosses being made these payments.”A spokesperson for Water UK, a lobby group, said:“Executive pay in the water industry is independently determined by remuneration committees, which abide by the laws and regulations set by government.“Water companies are focused on investing a record £104bn over the next five years to secure our water supplies, end sewage entering our rivers and seas and support economic growth.”Explore more on these topicsExecutive pay and bonusesWater industryThames WaterPayEnglandWalesPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

He wasfound guiltyin February of murder, attempted murder and hate-crime charges in the death of Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of the boy’s mother, Hanan Shaheen.The 73-year-old Czuba targeted them in October 2023 because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas, which started days earlier.Czuba died Thursday in the custody of theIllinoiscorrections department, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, citing the Will county sheriff’s office. The law enforcement agency did not return a call seeking comment on the death.Ahmed Rehab, the executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations’Chicagooffice, said in a statement on Saturday that “this depraved killer has died, but the hate is still alive and well”.Evidence at trial included harrowing testimony from Shaheen and her frantic 911 call, along with bloody crime scene photos and police video. Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes before handing in a verdict.The family had been renting rooms in Czuba’s home in Plainfield, about 40 miles (64km) from Chicago when the attack happened.Shaheen told jurors Czuba attacked her before moving on to her son, insisting they had to leave because they were Muslim. Prosecutors also played the 911 call and showed police footage. Czuba’s wife, Mary, whom he has since divorced, also testified for the prosecution, saying he had become agitated about the Israel-Hamas war, which had erupted days earlier.After the start of the war, Czuba told Shaheen that they had to move out because Muslims were not welcome. Later, he attacked her and her son.“He told me: ‘You, as a Muslim, must die,’” said Shaheen.Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds.Czuba attacked her with a knife before going after her son in a different room. Police said Czuba stabbed the boy 26 times, leaving the knife in the child’s body. Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee’s relatives.The case, which generated headlines around the world, comes amid rising hostility against Muslims and Palestinians in the US since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing roughly 1,200 Israelis, and Israel’s attack on Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians.The attack hit particularly hard in Plainfield and surrounding suburbs, which have a large and established Palestinian community. Wadee’s funeral drew large crowds, and Plainfield officials have dedicated a park playground in his honor.Marina Dunbar contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsIllinoisUS politicsIslamophobiaChicagonewsShareReuse this content"

I came into this world fighting,’” the boy’s father, Randall Keen, said in an interview that Guinness published on Wednesday. “‘And I’m going to leave fighting.’”The organization’s database of about 40,000 records has long inspired fascination from the public. And Nash’s path to that database began on 5 July 2024, when he was born at the gestational age of exactly 21 weeks at the University ofIowaHealth Care Stead Family Children’s hospital in Iowa City.Nash’s birth came 133 days ahead of Mollie’s expected due date, based on a typical full-term pregnancy of 280 days, an article onguinnessworldrecords.comsaid.His birth was the second time in less than two years that Mollie had given birth prematurely. She recounted how she and Randall lost their daughter, McKinley, after she was born at a gestational age of nearly 18 weeks.After the couple became pregnant with Nash, “we were so excited, but also very nervous”, Mollie said. “We didn’t get our hopes up.”Nash weighed only 10 ounces (283 grams), which is about the size of a soap bar, when he was born. He had to spend the next six months in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) before he was allowed to go home in January to Ankeny, Iowa.View image in fullscreenIn this undated photo provided by Mollie and Randall Keen, their son, Nash, is photographed at three weeks old.Photograph: APMollie recalled to Guinness that she and Randall “weren’t sure if he’d even survive those first critical hours. But we wanted to give him the best chance.”The baby underwent “highly specialized care, constant surveillance and frequent monitoring” while he faced a series of substantial “challenges early on”, Dr Amy Stanford – a neonatologist who helped care for Nash – told Guinness.Yet “he showed remarkable resilience”, Stanford added. “After those first few extremely delicate weeks, he began to make steady progress, which was truly extraordinary to witness.”As the Associated Pressnoted, Nash’s story illustrates thegrowing numberof extremely premature infants who are receiving life-saving treatment and surviving.Nash emerged from his NICU stay with as good an outcome as could be hoped for by medical science, as his doctors see it.At just over a year old, Nash still required oxygen to help him breathe, and he was nourished exclusively through a feeding tube. His parents had been preparing for him to try pureed foods.Nash’s doctors were optimistic that a minor heart defect would resolve itself as he grew up. And he was not quite yet crawling, though he had started rolling over.None of those developmental realities had barred him from demonstrating his budding personality, Randall told Guinness.“Whenever you call him ‘Nash potato’, or you cheer him on when he’s trying to pull himself up … he just hams it up,” Randall said. “It makes him want to succeed and do more.”A small gathering of close friends joined Nash and his family to celebrate his first birthday. He was feted with new outfits, educational toys, diapers and the certificate from Guinness – now that he had beaten out by a single day the organization’s previous most premature baby record holder, who was born in 2020 in Alabama.Mollie told Guinness she and Randall are as happy as Nash has been.“I love waking up to him,” she remarked. “He’s truly … the best thing that could have happened to us.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGuinness World RecordsIowaPremature birthnewsShareReuse this content"

If it’s the company that built the building that hires the person to do it, they could be biased as they are on their payroll.”He added: “Our point is that once the building goes up and if they haven’t done the soundproofing, the council won’t make them rip the walls down and put it in.”London-based gig venueMoth Clubhas also seen support from a 20,000-strong petition against two separate planning applications for new blocks of flats beside it.The venue said the blocks, which are due to be considered by Hackney council in the coming months, would have “devastating consequences” for the future of the club.The new protection will be ushered in under the “agent of change principle”, with the Department for Business and Trade saying it will consider further options to support established venues under the new framework.Other measures in the overhaul include simplifying the process of opening and operating hospitality venues, scrapping local rules that delay small businesses from opening.The business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Red tape has stood in the way of people’s business ideas for too long. Today we’re slashing those barriers to giving small business owners the freedom to flourish.”New “hospitality zones” are also envisioned, with more leniency on permissions for street parties and extended opening hours to usher people back on to high streets.Speaking on the new changes, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said pubs and bars were “at the heart of British life”.Reeves said: “For too long, they’ve been stifled by clunky, outdated rules. We’re binning them – to protect pavement pints, alfresco dining and street parties – not just for the summer, but all year round.”Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryBars, pubs and clubsPlanning policyManchesterBrightonGreater ManchesterClubbingnewsShareReuse this content"

He took the mic, described their singing as a “terrible racket” and told them to get out, leaving the 360-odd people in the room shocked and dumfounded.“You are in my house, can you leave it now please,” he said. The man, it appears, was Jonathan Baker, the bishop of Fulham. In avideoposted on social media, the bishop can be seen telling the choir it’s past 10pm and calls for the night to be “over”.“It was so bizarre,” said Leigh Stanford Thompson, the choir director, describing the incident that took place on Friday night. “I’ve never experienced anything like it.”By chance, it was also his final concert directing the choir, and the night was “designed as a celebration”.“A lot of people thought it was some weird thing that I had organised, like a parting thing, but I knew exactly what was happening,” he said.This was the initial thinking of a choir member. She said: “At first, I thought it was a comedy act or some actor doing a scene. But when we realised, oh no, this isn’t an act, this is real, it was just a bit surreal.”The choir was nearing the end of their special summer concert on Friday, which this time took place in St Andrew church in Holborn,London. The choir had booked the venue, which is available to hire, and used it previously with no issue.Describing the sequence of events, the choir member said: “We were singing away. This was our penultimate song. Then, we were going to do one final number and get everybody out of the aisles and dance.“Then, all of a sudden, the lights went out. At first I thought there may have been a power cut. But then the instruments were still playing.“We were picking back up to sing when all of a sudden everything went quiet. I could see this guy in what looked like a dressing gown talking to the audience on the mic.”After Baker’s on-stage interruption, a church employee took the mic and apologised but told everyone they needed to leave because “this is a residential home”.“I must ask you to leave quietly, thank you for your attendance,” said the church worker, before addressing the choir. “Would you leave the stage,” she said.The choir member said: “There were boos and everything, it’s just really disappointing. At the end of these concerts, we always end on a real high and everyone goes home full of joy, but this dampened things.”Baker’s comments about the “racket” being produced did not sit well. “I think we produce a beautiful sound,” said the choir member.“If he just waited for five minutes, we would have been done and out, but because of what happened there was lots of booing, shouting. Then people were applauding the choir.”The final song was going to be a fully staged rendition of Abba’s Dancing Queen. As outrage bubbled up, the choir began performing an a cappella version on stage and finished it on their way out to a loud, rapturous reception. “Everybody was clapping as we were making our way out,” she said.“All of that took far longer than if he allowed the concert just to end at the right time.”Thompson said the impromptu ending “was really lovely and quite moving”.“We all went out to the pub afterwards and took it all in. Everyone was in astonishment really.“I do find it funny. I’m not particularly upset. We had a really good concert but I think it’s a real shame that we didn’t get a chance to finish. But now looking back, what a way to go out,” he said.A diocese of London spokesperson said: “Bishop Jonathan reached out to the organisers on Saturday to apologise for his late-night appearance at the concert, which he now understands had overrun due to earlier technical difficulties.”Explore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

But the most recent clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have been fuelled by another factor: a bitter feud between two powerful political patriarchs.Hun Sen, 72, and Thaksin Shinawatra, 76, former leaders of Cambodia and Thailand, were once such close friends they reportedly called one another brothers. Hun Sen has, over the years, supported Thaksin’s family during their long-running power struggle with Thailand’s military. Thaksin and his sister Yingluck stayed at Hun Sen’s home after they were ousted from power, while Hun Sen appointed Thaksin an economic adviser to the Cambodian government. Thaksin frequently visited Cambodia, and Hun Sen was the first foreign guest to see the former Thai leader after hereturned home after more than 15 years in self-imposed exile.Why are Thailand and Cambodia engaged in a border conflict?Read moreBut relations have broken down spectacularly over recent months. The exact reasons for their feud are unclear, but analysts say it has created an additional layer of volatility that is exacerbating deadly clashes on the neighbouring countries’ border.Hun Sen and Thaksin are no longer in office in their respective countries, but both remain powerful. Hun Sen ruled for almost 40 years until 2003, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister after runningvirtually uncontested in a sham election. Thaksin’s daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister last year.View image in fullscreenHun Sen ruled Cambodia for almost 40 years until 2003, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister.Photograph: Heng Sinith/APThe extent of their falling out became clear last month, when Hun Senleaked a recording of a phone conversationbetween himself and Paetongtarn.In the call, which was about the border dispute, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen “uncle” and told him if there was anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made disparaging comments about a senior Thai military commander.The leaked recording caused uproar in Thailand. Critics accused her of kowtowing to Cambodia, putting her family connections before the country’s national interests. She wassuspended from officeby the constitutional court in July pending an investigation into ethical violations.It’s not clear why Hun Sen chose to turn on his former friends. He has accused Thaksin of betrayal and threatened to reveal further sensitive information about the Shinawatras. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way,” Thaksin said later, declaring their friendship over.The leaked phone call that could ring the changes for one of Thailand’s most powerful dynastiesRead moreSome analysts say Hun Sen may be trying to whip up nationalism domestically to increase support for his son, Hun Manet.Others suggest Hun Sen has been angered by Thailand’s efforts to crack down on so-called “scam compounds” where trafficked workers are held and forced to target people around the world with online scams. This form of lucrative criminal activity has proliferated in the region over recent years, especially inCambodia.“The popular narrative in Thailand is that the two men may have had some kind of personal dealings behind the scenes that did not go according to plan and the fallout has spilled over into the realm of national interest,” said Tita Sanglee, associate fellow with ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.Whatever his motivations, Hun Sen has succeeded in damaging Thaksin’s position, exploiting divisions between his family and the military, and creating a power vacuum in Thailand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has stamped out virtually all opposition voices and independent media. “When he chooses to take a strong stance, militarily or politically, it has immediate and direct consequences.”On Thursday night, Thaksin said he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate the border dispute, but would like to wait, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and first teach this cunning Hun Sen a lesson.”Given Thaksin’s weakened position, he may not have a choice but to let the military take the lead.Last week Thailand downgraded it diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador, and saying it would expel the country’s envoy in Bangkok.Thaksin has denied the families’ feud was the cause of the clashes. However awkward questions about his friend turned foe are likely to continue.As he visited communities sheltering from the conflict in Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, a woman confronted him: “You’re Hun Sen’s friend, aren’t you? Is he your friend? Why do you allow Cambodia to shoot Thai people?”Solving territorial disagreements is difficult in any context, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. “No country would like to sacrifice any inch of sovereignty,” he said. But the personal conflict between Hun Sen and Thaksin has, he added, made their countries’ dispute even more unpredictable.Explore more on these topicsCambodiaThailandAsia PacificThaksin ShinawatraanalysisShareReuse this content"

The question now, as they prepare to face Spain in Sunday’sWomen’s Euro 2025final in Basel, is can they pull yet another rabbit out of the hat?Perhaps the only thing we know for certain is that the country will be watching. More than 10 million saw England’s womenclaw their way past Italyin Tuesday’s semi-final, a figure that brought in ITV’s highest viewing figures of the year. After that, though, everything is up for grabs.Lionesses of 2025 echo Southgate’s 2024 England with bumpy ride to Spain finalRead moreThe former tennis player Brad Gilbert wrote Winning Ugly: Mental Warfare in Tennis, about how to emerge victorious when not playing well or facing a superior opponent. In Switzerland, the Lionesses have often served up the football equivalent. Yet they are just 90 minutes away from planting their size 6s in the pantheon of great England sports teams.That may raise some eyebrows. But make no mistake, Sarina Wiegman’s side are a staggering success story hiding in plain sight. Since she took over as manager in September 2021, England’s women have won 34 of their 47 competitive matches, drawing six and losing seven – an impressive win percentage of 72.5%.That record, as sports data company Opta shows, compares favourably with the “golden generation” of the England’s men’s team between 2001 and 2010, led by David Beckham, Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. They won 45 out of 67 matches – a win percentage of 67% – although they never got beyond the quarter-finals of a major tournament.It is also better than Gareth Southgate’s record of 61 wins from 102 matches between 2016 and 2024, a win percentage of 59.8%, although England did reach two Euro finals and a World Cup semi-final along the way.In fact, perhaps the closest parallel with the Lionesses is with the heyday of Sir Alf Ramsey’s World Cup winners, who won 26 out of 36 competitive matches between 1966 and 1971, a win percentage of 72.2%.Incredibly, Sunday will mark England’s fifth final in as many summers, with the men having reached the Euro finals in 2021 and 2024, and the women having lifted the Euros in 2022 before losing to Spain in the 2023 World Cup final. As a nation England gone from expecting heroic failure to being almost blase about a golden age.It is also easy to forget just how far women’s football has travelled. Just before the London 2012 Olympics, for instance, organisers withdrew 500,000 tickets for the football tournament from public sale because of a lack of interest – with Team GB women’s first game against New Zealand filling just a third of what was known then as Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, which has a capacity of 74,500.“There will not be many events over the coming two and a half weeks with so many no-shows and the attendance of 24,549 was a clear disappointment,”the Guardian wrote. “But to put it into context, the crowd was almost five times the number that watched Arsenal play Chelsea in last season’s women’s FA Cup final.”View image in fullscreenWomen’s football has come a long way since 24,549 watched Team GB narrowly beat New Zealand 1-0 at the 2012 Olympics.Photograph: Paul Harding/Action Images/ReutersIn a quirk of fate the 2025 Women’s FA Cup final,between Chelsea and Manchester Unitedat Wembley, was watched by 74,412 people. Enough to pack out the stadium in Cardiff. If you had predicted that in 2012 you would have been sneered at.Of course, England’s latest European adventure has been far from smooth. They were outplayed in their opening game against France. Then, in the quarter-finals against Sweden, they first came from 2-0 down with 11 minutes remaining to make it 2-2, before winning the penalty shootout after the Swedes missed two chances to knock them out.If that wasn’t fantastical enough, England also appeared to be going out in their semi-final against Italy until a late equaliser from the substitute Michelle Agyemang in the final minute of injury time. And there was then even more drama as Chloe Kelly scored the winner deep into extra time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can’t believe it myself.”Speculating how they compare with other great England and British national teams is one for the pub or posterity. However, to these eyes, they do not have the dominance of the England men’s Rugby World Cup winners in 2003, who won 42 of their 47 competitive matches between 2000 and 2003, a success rate of 89.4%. Many of the same players made it to a second World Cup final in 2007 too, though with a much poorer win record after their 2003 triumph.The England team who won the 2019 men’s Cricket World Cup, led by Eoin Morgan, will also have their supporters. Not only did they win 48 out of their 63 completed one-day matches between 2016 and 2019 – with one tied – for a win percentage of 76.2%, they attacked with rare fire and freedom.Those of an older vintage would probably also point to UK Athletics during the golden era of middle distance running in the 70s and 80s, when Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram won Olympic gold medals and world championship titles and smashed 20 world records between them. Especially as Daley Thompson, Tessa Sanderson and Fatima Whitbread were regularly winning medals too.But for sheer achievement, the extraordinary performance of Team GB Olympians takes some beating. In 1996, Britain won a solitary gold medal, along with eight silvers and six bronzes, finishing 36th in the medal table. Yet thanks to a huge injection of government and lottery funding, they have won more than 60 medals in each of the last four Olympics – including finishing second in the table at the Rio Games in 2016.Yet the Lionesses’ achievements should also not be underestimated. And they still have plenty of time to strengthen their case, starting on Sunday.It could yet be a classic. Spain like control, England thrive in chaos. The Spanish have the Ballon d’Or Feminine holder, Aitana Bonmatí, and another two-time winner in Alexia Putellas. And while England have great players too, they also have something much harder to define: that mystical combination of luck, fate, randomness and sheer bloody-mindedness.

It’s like 2021 all over again.But the latest meme-stock rally could be even bigger than its predecessor four years ago, when investors piled into recognizable but unloved stocks, such as the video games retailer GameStop and the movie theatre chain AMC, according to the founder of theRedditforum that helped whip up the frenzy.Retailer Kohl’s, camera firm GoPro, fast-food chain Wendy’s and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme each staged rapid rallies this week, driven by abrupt surges in trading volume reminiscent of the the meme-stock craze of 2021, when social media memes boosted a collection of struggling stocks, triggering extraordinary and volatile leaps in value.Actress Sydney Sweeney helped bring clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters into the mania after it was announced the Euphoria and White Lotus star would front the brand’s latest marketing campaign. The company’s shares surged about 10% in trading on Thursday.Meme stocks are “about to leap-frog in size and scope and scale, so that retail traders are going to redefine what matters”, according to Jaime Rogozinski, founder of thewallstreetbetsReddit forum behind many of the volatile rallies.“The world of finance is clearly changing, with blockchain technologies encroaching, and AI agents that trade on their own,” he said. “And the collective of retail traders is adapting along with it.”Rogozinski founded wallstreetbets in 2012, but said Reddit ousted him as a moderator in 2020. His bid to sue the social media company for trademark infringement was dismissed by the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit last month.The forum’s users home in on stocks and share their own research. “It’s a decentralization of power of who can be financial analyst,” said Noor Al, a moderator on wallstreetbets. “Great ideas can now come from anyone, anywhere.“We’re seeing the power of retail push stocks, sometimes to the tune of billions of dollars, through the power of ideas, the power of community and the power of the people,” he added.The meme-stock craze of 2021, whichproduced stars such as Roaring Kitty, was a product of the Covid era, when many amateur traders were stuck at home and flush with pandemic stimulus cash.Whether this latest frenzy produces similar winners is not yet clear. Kohl’s finished the week up 32%, GoPro was up 66% and Krispy Kreme was up 41%. The rallies show some investors are willing to take on more risk, as stocks scale record highs and the market, dominated by big tech, becomes harder to beat.Often, meme-stock bets are unbound from economic fundamentals, as investors move to support a brand for romantic or ideological reasons. Donald Trump’s Trump Media & Technology Group, home to Truth Social, is valued at more than $5bn on quarterly revenue of about $1m.The wallstreetbets ethos “has always to some extent been about flaunting and exploiting the ironies, relevance or irrelevance” of the stock market, said Rogozinski, who pointed to Wendy’s, the hamburger chain, as a good example. “Wendy’s has always been a meme that goes back a decade. It brings a smile to my face, because on Reddit there’s always been this thing where they say: ‘Sir, this is a Wendy’s.’“It’s an inside joke, and I don’t even get where it started. It’s just a meme,” he added. The stock’s fleeting rise – it rallied 10% in two days, but finished the week broadly flat – shows some retail investors do not necessarily care about the typical factors that drive the market, such as tariffs and war in the Middle East. “It’s this ability for us to almost make fun of the financial system.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a good time to tune in, because retail players can react and provide insight faster.”Days traders are not necessarily bothered by a company’s financial performance, said Rogozinski. “You have this activist, elective investor who is saying, ‘I don’t care what the financial statements look like, I don’t care what the discounted cashflow is, I like the food, I like the video-game store, I like the meme. So dude, you can go back to Excel spreadsheets if you want, but I really like the chicken tenders,’” he said.There is now a “third component” to investment, beyond supply and demand, he claimed, “which is, ‘dude, I don’t care if you think it’s going to go up or not, or if they have assets or liabilities. I care about this company and I’m going to help it out. I’m going to go buy my jeans from American Eagle.’”Explore more on these topicsStock marketsRedditEconomicsUS economyRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photographer Alicia Canter spent four months capturing people facing the end, and bereaved relatives desperate to see the law change – even if it will be too late for some. Interviews: Gabrielle SchwarzSat 26 Jul 2025 07.38 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Jul 2025 16.55 EDTShare‘Knowing there might be an alternative brings relief and hope’When she was only 18, a few months into an undergraduate degree in classics at Warwick University, Maddie Cowey was diagnosed with a rare cancer called sarcoma. She had gone to the GP about a lump on her shoulder that had been growing for 18 months. Soon after, she learned that the cancer had spread and was incurable.As there are no approved treatments in this country for Cowey’s type of cancer, it has been managed so far through a mix of clinical trials and compassionate-use (individual, rather than group trial) drugs. “The cancer is not completely stable,” she says. “The aim is to slow it down. If it shrinks, that’s great.” Now, aged 27, she isn’t experiencing any symptoms from the cancer itself. “I’m in reasonably good health. Most of the issues I’ve had have been side-effects from the treatment.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenCowey photographed with her parents Jane and Colin (above) and at home taking her medications (top left), some of which is stored in her fridge“I’ve definitely had times where I feel like my young adult years have been taken away from me and I felt more bitter about it,” Cowey says. “I’ve had to process a lot of different things, but I’m in quite a good space now, where I feel accepting of it.” She has just returned from a two-week trip to visit her sister in Vietnam and currently works four days a week for a disabled persons’ charity.“I know the biggest opponents to assisted dying are the disability rights activists,” Cowey says. “As someone living with a life-limiting health condition who will have to rely on the state at some point, I completely get the perspective of a disabled person. But the assisted dying bill is specifically for dying people.“Cancer can be so uncertain, especially when it spreads to your organs, and you don’t know which one it’s going to decide to destroy and how painful it’s going to be,” she says. “Knowing there might be an alternative brings a lot of relief and hope. We deserve the right at the end of life to say how it’s going to go.”‘I’m not giving up– I’m facing reality’View image in fullscreenMiranda Ashitey, photographed by South Norwood Lake, south LondonMiranda Ashitey died of metastatic breast cancer on 26 June, less than three weeks after her 43rd birthday. A former administrator and VW camper van driver, she is seen here in South Norwood Lake in south London, close to where she lived.Ashitey was first diagnosed with stage two breast cancer in 2014. She went into remission for about three years before learning that the cancer had spread in February 2019. “What I thought was a seasonal cold lasted a long time, so I eventually went to the doctor,” she later recalled. “They said I had a chest infection, to take some antibiotics, it’ll be fine. It wasn’t fine.”Throughout her illness, Ashitey campaigned to raise awareness and improve treatment for those with secondary breast cancer, focusing in particular on the experiences of Black and LGBTQ+ people. Fundraising efforts for cancer charities included the Great North Run, which she completed five times, and a skydive in 2022.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAshitey’s bag with a badge saying she is shielding (above left) and her walking stick with its pink ribbon (above right)On assisted dying, Ashitey said she could “see both parts”, especially why disabled people might “feel under more pressure to make a decision that might not be in their interest”. Coming from a west African background also made discussing the possibility of an assisted death with some members of her family “a bit difficult”.“But then people need to be able to have that choice if they want to end their lives,” she said. “It’s like I’m saying, ‘I’m giving up’ – but I’m not giving up: I’m facing reality. Being matter-of-fact rather than emotional is how I deal with things, and how this should be dealt with.”‘Discussing my potential death so publicly over the last18 months has been intense’View image in fullscreenSophie Blake, 52 (in pink), with her mother Christine (left), daughter Maya (second right) and sister Lucy (right)“I have a family with a lot of cancer in it, and I’ve known people to suffer as they die since I was a teenager,” says Sophie Blake, 52, a former TV presenter and prominent campaigner for assisted dying. “So I’ve always 100% believed in the right to choose. When I was diagnosed myself, it seemed natural to help campaign for it, whether it happens in my lifetime or not.”Blake, who lives in Brighton with her 18-year-old daughter Maya, received her initial primary breast cancer diagnosis in December 2020. Despite her family history, she was mistakenly told that she had a low risk of recurrence. But as soon as she finished treatment, she started feeling unwell. In May 2022, Blake learned the cancer had metastasised – to her lungs, liver, pelvic bone and abdominal lymph node. There was also new cancer on the skin where she’d had her lumpectomy.While the cancer is incurable, Blake has responded well to treatment and there is currently no evidence of active disease in her body – though the drug holding it at bay comes with challenging side-effects, including fatigue, cornea damage and bone and joint problems. But she’s happy to put up with all of it to stay alive: to keep “making memories with friends and family, travelling, adventures, being a mum”.Blake recognises the “irony” of this focus on extending life alongside campaigning for “the right to have a peaceful and dignified death”. But she required multiple surgeries after Maya’s birth, and learned then that she is allergic to opioid painkillers. “They couldn’t manage my pain properly,” she recalls. “It was awful.”The idea of going through a “potentially excruciating death” with unrelieved pain terrifies Blake but, even more, she doesn’t want her daughter to see her in that state. “I don’t want that to be her final memory of me,” she says. Last year, Maya, who is studying music performance at college in Brighton, joined her mother in campaigning for the assisted dying bill. “If more people who were against it read up on it,” Maya says, “they wouldn’t be against it as much.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBlake with her daughter at home in Brighton (top) and some of the supplements she takes alongside her cancer medication (above)Mother and daughter were in the House of Commons, along with Blake’s mother and sister, whenMPs passed the billin June. “The relief was overwhelming,” Blake says. “Campaigning and discussing my potential death so publicly over the last 18 months has been an intense process, and I was so worried it would have all been for nothing. When the result was read out, I burst out crying – which isn’t like me at all.”‘She was determined to stay alive – then the treatment stopped working’View image in fullscreenRichard Tingey and his daughter Heidi photographed near his wife Barbara’s woodland burial grave in SuffolkBarbara Tingey died of bowel cancer at the age of 76, in July 2023. She was diagnosed two years earlier, six months after her daughter Heidi’s husband John had died of the same disease. A former deputy headteacher at a secondary school in Norfolk, Tingey had taught chemistry since the 1960s. After taking early retirement, she and her husband Richard went on holidays, mostly to France, and spent time with family: Heidi, their other daughter Katie, and their three grandchildren.“She was so determined to stay alive and beat the odds,” Heidi says. Her mother had three rounds of chemotherapy – “Then the treatment stopped working.” From early 2023, her condition deteriorated rapidly. Although her family didn’t know it at the time, Tingey decided to stockpile pain medication.View image in fullscreenRichard and Barbara are pictured on their wedding day in 1976“She didn’t talk about the pain much, because she was trying to not draw attention to the fact she was stockpiling morphine,” Heidi says. But Richard recalls “months of sheer agony”, despite good palliative care. At the beginning of July, she attempted to overdose. She was transferred to a hospice and died just over a week later.“I think Mum did what she did because she was suffering and she couldn’t control when she was going to die,” Heidi says. The experience has convinced Richard to support the right to an assisted death “with safeguards in place … I don’t want my two daughters to suffer what we went through with Barbara,” he says.‘He would be horrified to know I have PTSD from seeing him die’View image in fullscreenLucy Davenport and her son Joss photographed on the seafront in ScarboroughLucy Davenport’s husband Tom, a musician and music teacher in Scarborough, died of complications caused by bile duct cancer in August 2023 at the age of 48. He received his diagnosis just a year earlier – the first sign was the whites of his eyes turning yellow – and was given 11-12 months to live.Throughout Davenport’s illness, the couple discussed whether Lucy should help him die “if he got to the point where it was too much”. But they knew she couldn’t risk being arrested and leaving their son Joss, now 10, alone. Lucy recalls that at one stage her husband asked a doctor  “for something to just make him go to sleep so he didn’t wake up again. The doctor’s response was, ‘Not unless you grow another two legs and a tail’ – a really blunt statement that I think sums the situation up,” says Lucy.“That year that we had together we really did it well. We went to Disneyland. Tom and Joss saw Kissand met them.” They organised a fundraising gig with performances by many of Davenport’s students, friends and bandmates past and present. “It was beautiful – like a living wake.”And in June 2023, the couple – who had met on a dating site 10 years earlier – had a surprise wedding (people thought they were going to Lucy’s 40th birthday party).View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLucy Davenport looks through her and Tom’s wedding album (top left); Tom’s ashes (top right); Lucy and Joss (above)During his second round of chemotherapy, Davenport became too ill to continue. In hospice, he was made as comfortable as possible. But the cancer had spread to his bowels, causing an obstruction that resulted in faecal vomiting for five hours. Eventually he choked and died.“It was very, very traumatic. I have PTSD,” Lucy says. “He would be horrified that we went through that.”Lucy and Joss now live with her friend Alice, whom she met many years ago through Davenport. She continues to feel his presence. “He’s definitely still around. I was listening to a playlist, really silly pop stuff. ThenWorking Man by Rushcame on – one of Tom’s favourite bands. So I just went, ‘All right, I’ll leave it on for you.’”‘A change in the law would bring the greatest comfort as I try to settle into my last weeks’View image in fullscreenNathaniel Dye in Hainault forest preparing to run the 2025 London MarathonNathaniel Dye , a 39-year-old music teacher living in Essex, started running about a decade ago with what he calls “the zeal of a late convert”. With hindsight, the first sign that there was something wrong with his health was probably a “small deterioration in training”. In October 2022, he was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer. Soon it was discovered to have spread to his lymph nodes. The five-year survival odds were 10%.In the face of this prognosis, Dye set about cramming as much life in as possible. A year after his diagnosis, he completed a 100-mile run from Essex to London – possibly the farthest distance anyone has undertaken with a stoma. In April 2024, he did the London marathon while playing the trombone, and that summer embarked on a 60-day, 1,200km walk from John O’Groats in Scotland to Land’s End in Cornwall. “It just feels like the biggest gift that my body let me do that,” Dye says.In February, with mounting health issues, he was told he probably had one year to live. “This may well be my last July. Try getting your head around that,” he says. He saw running the London marathon this past April as a “last chance” and completed it in just under eight hours (although, as a former ultramarathon runner, he admits he “found it difficult to accept any praise for the achievement”). Since diagnosis, Dye has also raised more than £40,000 (and counting) for Macmillan Cancer Support, receiving an MBE at the end of last year for his efforts.Less than a month after the marathon, Dye was taken to hospital with a near-fatal pulmonary embolism. He is less and less mobile, which, “as someone formerly so active, is very hard to deal with”, and has decided to take early retirement this summer, after being signed off work sick for most of the past two years. He hopes soon to be able to go on a long-discussed canal holiday with a small group of friends. “It’s just a case of constantly reassessing expectations based on what my body can do and getting the most out of every day, week, month, whatever timescale it is.”It’s important for Dye to emphasise how much he wants to keep living while also supporting assisted dying. “The notion of ‘assisted suicide’ really, really gets to me, because if there’s anything I’m not, it’s suicidal,” he says. He has in the past struggled with suicidal ideation but since getting his diagnosis “it’s been the total opposite … That intent to keep going is not, for me, mutually exclusive with the concept of assisted dying at the point where there isn’t any light at the end of the tunnel.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDye and his brother Jon running this year’s London Marathon (top) and receiving his MBE at Windsor Castle in MarchIn written evidence submitted to parliament, Dye described the passage of the assisted dying bill as his “dying wish”. Now, he says, he “won’t quite believe it’s real until it becomes law. I don’t speak for all dying ­people, but I know a change in the law would bring me the greatest comfort as I try to settle into my last weeks and months.”‘The end of my life is going to matter to me as much as the rest of it’View image in fullscreenJosh Cook photographed at home in Huddersfield“I grew up knowing I was at risk of Huntington’s and that my mum had it,” says Josh Cook, a 34-year-old rugby coach from Huddersfield. Children have a 50/50 chance of inheriting the gene that causes the fatal neurodegenerative disorder. The disease – which shares symptoms with Parkinson’s, dementia and ALS – goes back generations in Cook’s family. At 18, he learned he had the gene, too. “We’ve just been unlucky at every coin toss, but I’m not going to have children, so it will stop there,” he says.Cook’s mum, Lisa, took her own life last year at the age of 57. Her symptoms had begun several years earlier: slurring of speech, involuntary muscle movements, loss of balance. The prognosis was unpredictable; patients usually live for 10-30 years after symptom onset.“I knew she would never go through with the illness,” Cook says. “My mum watched my great-grandma go through every stage of it at home. One thing that sticks with me was that Mum saw her wear a hole through the carpet in front of her chair from twitching her legs. My mum didn’t want that for herself.”View image in fullscreenCook with his mum at a wedding in 1993 (above, top right) and after she gained her degree from the University of London (above, right bottom). His mum had long been a campaigner for assisted dying – she is seen (above left, back right) delivering a petition to No 10 with others in 2002Cook, who so far hasn’t had any symptoms, believes he would make the same decision as his mother. That’s why a change in the law is so important to him: “So that people can stop the generational trauma.” He wouldn’t qualify for assisted dying under the law currently being proposed, as in the final stages of  Huntington’s mental competency is affected. But he is hopeful that the law would give people with this disease a basis to go to court and express their wishes in advance.“We are still afraid of death in this country,” he says. “For a very small group of us, this is something we think about because we have to. The end of my life is going to matter to me as much as the rest of it.”‘They wanted to die in a dignified way’View image in fullscreenMick Murray and Carol Taylor photographed in the Peak District close to the wall where their friend Bob Cole first noticed he was out of breath walking uphill – which was unusual as he was a mountaineerA married couple living in Derbyshire, Mick Murray and Carol Taylor have spent the past decade campaigning for assisted dying in memory of their longtime friends, husband and wife Bob Cole and Ann Hall.In 2013 Hall, a social worker and activist, was diagnosed with a rare terminal neurological condition called progressive supranuclear palsy. Quickly deteriorating, she decided to travel to Dignitas while she was still able in February 2014 –she was 68. Just over a year later Cole, a former town councillor, learned he had mesothelioma, an aggressive form of lung cancer likely caused by him working with asbestos as an apprentice carpenter in his teens. In August 2015, he, too, madethe journey to Dignitas, aged 68.“They actually had a choice over the way that they died, and they wanted to die in a way that was dignified,” says Taylor. Murray adds: “The opponents call it assisted suicide. But the root of suicide is loneliness, despair and depression. This is due to illness. It was almost life-affirming, being there for the actual event. It was really sad, but it certainly wasn’t suicide.”View image in fullscreenThe Sun’s coverage of Cole’s death at Dignitas in 2015, which he had invited the newspaper to report on. He was 68But Murray and Taylor are adamant people shouldn’t have to go to Dignitas. “Bob and Ann didn’t have any children. They didn’t have any parents alive. When you’ve got family, making that decision, to go and die before you need to, is more difficult,” says Taylor. And beside the often-prohibitive cost, there are bureaucratic challenges, because medical services don’t always cooperate in providing the necessary records. “No ill person could navigate this system, so other people have to navigate it for them. And in so doing, you become complicit,” says Murray.On the prospect of the law changing in the not-too-distant future, Taylor says: “It’s got to be time, hasn’t it?”‘He had a full life and was fearless’View image in fullscreenPauline McLeod, photographed at her home near York“He was very anxious about what was going to happen to him,” says Pauline McLeod, whose husband, Ian, died of motor neurone disease at the age of 76 in 2023. Life expectancy for someone with MND sufferer is typically one to five years – McLeod had been diagnosed two years earlier. Over the course of the disease, McLeod lost his mobility and his speech and experienced difficulties with swallowing and breathing. “Not having control was terrifying for him,” Pauline says.Pauline is pictured here in the home she and Ian, a management consultant, shared in North Yorkshire. But they spent a lot of time travelling as well – to Singapore, Indonesia, Australia. “He had a very, very full life: travelled a lot, liked fast cars and was pretty fearless, really,” Pauline recalls.“And then the diagnosis was just so devastating – he couldn’t cope with the restrictions that brought for him. He knew that all he had to look forward to was a steady decline.” McLeod would wake up at night with panic attacks that required sedation. An especially difficult milestone was selling their collection of classic cars. “I caught him in the garage crying. They were his passion; he lost everything he cared about,” says Pauline.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotographs taken by McLeod (top) and a small replica Ferrari given to him (above) – he was obsessed with collecting cars but sold them before he diedIn June 2022, McLeod attempted to take his own life. Eventually, after he stopped eating and drinking, he was admitted to a hospice where he could die peacefully. “We were very lucky that they took him, because it’s not the same everywhere,” Pauline says. The prospect of legalised assisted dying would, she thinks, be a form of “closure … nobody else has to go through what Ian and I had to go through”.‘His death was a lonely, dangerous one’View image in fullscreenAnil Douglas, photographed in Golders Hill park, Golders Green, London, where he used to visit with his fatherAnil is the son of Ian Douglas, who took his own life in February 2019, the day before his 60th birthday. Douglas was suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, having been diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease in the 1980s. While MS is incurable, it is not usually considered a terminal illness. However, Douglas’s GP had confirmed that his condition was terminal due to the progressive weakening of his immune system. Largely paralysed and in increasing pain, hedecided to end his own lifewhile he was still physically able. In a letter to be read at his funeral, he wrote, “This was not a cry for help, and I end my life not distraught or depressed, but as happy as I can be in the circumstances.”However, the circumstances of his death were “deeply traumatic”, says Anil, who found his father as he was dying. “Nothing can prepare you for that experience of grief in real time, like watching a car crash unfold before your eyes.” It later became apparent that Douglas had already made two attempts on his life in the previous weeks. “His death was a really lonely, dangerous one. He obviously couldn’t tell any of us about his decision.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAnil as a baby with his dad Ian (top); with his sister Anjali, 34 (above), on Hampstead Heath near Kenwood House, where they used to take their dad in his wheelchairThe trauma was compounded by a police investigation, which saw five police cars show up at the family home. Anil and his sister’s phones and their father’s electronic devices were confiscated, and the siblings later had to give formal interviews. The investigation “hung over our heads for months”.Afterwards Anil, who also went through the death of his mother Reena from cancer in 2008, began to campaign for changes to the law. “Bad deaths scar you for ever,” he says. “Whereas the law currently being proposed would lead to so many more good deaths, where people have the chance to come to terms with the reality of their death.”‘I’m very happy with the life I’ve had’View image in fullscreenSteve Gibson, photographed at Westway Coaches in south London, where he used to workSteve Gibson, a 67-year-old former coach driver from south London, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in January 2023. Timelines vary for the terminal illness, also known as ALS, but there is no cure or treatment. Gibson, who lives with his daughter Emma and two of his grandchildren, seems to be a slow progressor. But MND will take away his ability to walk, talk, eat and eventually breathe. He has noticed his already deep voice getting “croakier” due to increased difficulty clearing his throat. As a sociable person, losing the ability to communicate is especially scary; he recently started using a voice-banking app suggested by the NHS. “My big concern was: am I still going to sound like a south Londoner? And, secondly, can I swear? The answer to both was yes.”Life-extending options for MND include a feeding tube and a tracheostomy to assist breathing. “Initially, I said, ‘Yeah, I want everything’, because you want to live for ever,” Gibson says. But he’s since changed his mind. After “a long discussion” with his neurologist, he signed a do not resuscitate order. He remembers taking care of his dad, who died from a different neurological disorder, in the last years of his life. “My mum couldn’t deal with it. Emotionally, it wrecks you. I don’t want to be like that.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenGibson at Westway Coaches with Dave, his friend and former boss (top) and with his daughter Emma and granddaughter Nellie-RoseGibson wishes he could afford to go to Dignitas, and hopes changes to the law will happen soon enough for him to benefit. He wants to be able to decide when to call it quits. “I’m very happy with the life I’ve had. People ask if I’ve got any regrets. Well, yeah, maybe, but you can’t do anything about it. So we move forward as we are. That’s good enough for me.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingHealthPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it isn’t a joyful memory that comes to mind; it is the painful recollection of driving home from school and seeing the sheriff changing a lock on her house.Then a teenager, Bonnie and her family were about to be evicted. And the Verve’s song was everywhere.“It was a big hit at the time, and it just seemed to be playing all the time, in takeaway shops and shopping centres, on the radio in the car. I just couldn’t get away from this song,” she says.To this day the 46-year-old who lives in Canberra, Australia, says she will change the radio or leave the location where the song is playing to avoid hearing it. “The lyrics of this song too closely described our situation,” she says.Indeed, many people avoid particular tunes because they are attached to the memory of an event that was either upsetting, or was once pleasant but has since become painful to recall.For Matt, 52, an engineer in the north of England, the entire oeuvre of Neil Diamond is to be avoided after a partner with a love of the singer confessed to having lied about the nature of a relationship with a colleague.“We used to like Friday night kitchen discos. We used to listen to all kinds, and usually Neil Diamond would be on,” Matt says, adding his former partner had been to several Neil Diamond concerts, including one with her boss before she met Matt.The colleague, the woman insisted, had just been a friend. But after three years in a relationship with Matt, she confessed she had had an affair with her boss while she was married to her former husband and still had feelings for the colleague.Now, says Matt, when a Neil Diamond song comes on the radio, he has to skip the track. “If I go into my local pub and it’s on the jukebox I’ll go into the other room or go outside,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe music of Neil Diamond has become associated with feelings of betrayal for one former fan.Photograph: APAccording to Ilja Salakka, a doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, the relationship between music and memories is linked to emotions.“Emotions play a key role in long-lasting memories generally, and since music can evoke strong emotions, it is likely that music can enhance the memory related to an event,” he said. “Of course, this can also work in reverse: an event itself may be emotional and strengthen the memory of a situation that involves music.”Dr Stephanie Leal, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkley, said that when emotionally arousing music occurs, or is paired with, an emotional experience, it can be difficult to pin down which is causing the emotions that help instil the memory. “The type of emotional response can really dictate what we’re holding on to in our memories,” she said.In one study, Leal and colleagues found when people listened to music that induced either very strong or very weak emotions they were better able to remember the gist of an event, whereas they were better able to remember details when they had a more moderate emotional response.Salakka added that typically it is music from a listener’s teenage years or early adulthood that evokes most memories.“[The] majority of memories attached to music tend to be positive in nature,” he added. But that is not always the case. “Positive music-related memories are often more general in nature, whereas negative memories tend to be related to more specific events,” he said.As Matt’s experience shows, however, the emotions attached to a song, and its associated memory, can change. “Now it’s drawing up negative memories in that [it’s] stirring up new emotions that weren’t originally there,” said Leal.While that may seem like the perfect reason to avoid a song, perhaps it could also bring hope. Although experts say there is a dearth of research in the area, they say it could be that listening to a painful song in new, happier contexts could rehabilitate it.Memories of my magical mix tape summer | LettersRead more“If it’s a very, very negative association with that song, maybe you’ll never get over it,” said Leal. “But the way to try is repeating it with new events that do make you happy and to hope that it overpowers and kind of reconnects your brain and rewires it to this new association.”Prof Renee Timmers of the University of Sheffield added that these new associations must involve strong emotions, ideally occur in a social context, and be meaningful.But Timmers also suggested another potential approach. “Rather than seeing the music as something that is there, you can’t do anything with it, and you are the victim of it, you can actually actively engage,” she said, adding that could involving humming along or even improvising on the music.“Then the music becomes the active thing that you’re engaging with, rather than the memory.”Explore more on these topicsPsychologyMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like all deceptively simple products, such as wine, coffee and chocolate, tofu’s character is rooted in its terroir: the soil, biodiversity, climate, plant species and production process. Most tofu is made by curdling soy milk with nigari, a coagulant made from magnesium chloride, which is naturally derived from seawater. It’s an ancient method still used across Japan and south-east Asia.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To keep things fair, I tasted each tofu cold, straight from the packet, then boiled and fried (without pressing or seasoning) each one to observe its flavour, structure and performance. Boiling showed that all the tofus held their shape, while frying brought out major differences in colouring, crust and bite: some crisped up beautifully, others stayed soft and chewy, so if you mainly fry your tofu, that’s worth bearing in mind. It’s also worth noting that organic tofus are GMO-free by definition.The best supermarket tofuBest overall:Plant Menu organic super-firm tofuView image in fullscreen89p for 180g at Aldi (49p/100g)★★★★★A small, beige block with rounded edges and a sweet, familiar soya aroma. It’s a super-firm tofu with a dense, satisfying bite that holds up brilliantly to cooking, especially frying. Made with 57% EU-grown organic soya, it’s very high in protein (14g a serving) and astonishingly good value. A real standout.And the rest …Sainsbury’s So Organic super-firm tofuView image in fullscreen£1.34 for 300g at Sainsbury’s (45p/100g)★★★★☆A great blank canvas with a subtle aroma and gentle, sweet taste. Firm but moist, and transformed by frying to a golden-crusted, deep flavour. Made from organic, non-EU soya (34%), it’s high in protein and excellent value. Though a little lower in soya content, it delivers fantastic performance in the pan and at an incredible price.Cauldron organic authentic tofuView image in fullscreen£2.90 for 396g at Ocado (73p/100g)£3 for 396g at Waitrose (76p/100g)★★★★★Distinctively marbled and off-white/grey, this has a subtle aroma and a clean, complex flavour. Very firm and reacts well to frying, forming a satisfyingly thick crust. Made with 35.8% organic soya, using a mix of EU and non-EU beans, it’s high in protein and has strongsustainability credentials. A well-rounded option that’s a very close runner-up to the best overall.The secret to crisp tofu | Kitchen aideRead moreThe Tofoo Co Naked organic tofuView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 280g at Sainsbury’s (82p/100g)£2.30 for 280g at Tesco (82p/100g)★★★★☆An irregularly marbled block with a deep umami, almost smoky aroma and a lovely firm bounce. One of the densest, less traditional tofus tested, with a chewy bite. When fried, it forms a good golden crust with loads of flavour. Made in Yorkshire using organic soya from EU and non-EU farms. Great Taste Award-winning, very high in protein (16.5g per 100g) and a bold, characterful choice.M&S Plant Kitchen organic super-firm tofuView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 300g at Ocado (83p/100g)★★★★☆A uniform block with a sweet, subtle aroma, a soft bite and a gentle soya flavour. Holding its shape and forming a delicate, uniform golden crust when fried, this has one of the best textures in the whole test group. Made from organic, non-EU soya, it has 34% soya content and a respectable protein level. Strikes a solid balance between taste and texture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Flavourful and pleasantly sweet, it’s perfectly crunchy and delicious when fried, with a consistent golden crust – perhaps the best overall for frying. Certified organic with non-EU soya, it’s been handmade in Devon since 1984 and holds a Taste of the West Gold award.Tesco Plant Chef organic firm tofuView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 399g at Tesco (49p/100g)★★★☆☆A uniform, cream block with a sweet, clean smell and a gentle flavour. Its soft texture makes it satisfying to eat raw, though it doesn’t crisp up easily when fried, hence the lower score (instead, it develops a chewy, caramelised edge with a spongy interior). Made from organic, non-EU soya (34%), it’s a good source of protein and exceptional value for organic tofu.Waitrose PlantLiving organic firm tofuView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 300g at Waitrose (65p/100g)★★★☆☆A gentle, savoury aroma and a soft bite with a slight sweetness. The texture is on the delicate side, especially when boiled, and it doesn’t fry especially well (pressing first will help). Made with 34% organic, non-EU-grown soya, it’s certified organic, but lacks firmness. Decent value, but there are more versatile options at a lower price point.House Foods premium firm tofuView image in fullscreen£3 for 400g at Ocado (75p/100g)★★★☆☆A white block with a soft bite, this has a sweet, subtle aroma and a clean soya taste. Despite being one of the softest in the test, it crisps up surprisingly well when fried, forming a light but satisfying crust. However, it’s the only non-organic product tested, and made with just 16% soya – far lower than the others. Limited provenance or sustainability information, so with such strong competition, it offers less value for money.Biona organic plain tofuView image in fullscreen£5 for 500g at Ocado (£1/100g)£29.94 for 6 x 500g at Amazon (£1/100g)★★★☆☆An irregular, mottled, off-white block that looks hand-shaped, and that’s full of bubbles. One of the firmest to bite with a complex, soya-forward flavour. Fries very well, forming a great crust. Certified organic with non-EU soya, it’s the only product tested with a fully reusable and recyclable container. Owned byWindmill Organics, a great company committed to organic farming, which earns it a bonus point.Explore more on these topicsTofuThe FilterFoodVegan food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a playground for the rich’: is Manchester turning into London?View image in fullscreenIs Manchester becoming less Mancunian?Composite: Derek Elliott/The GuardianHelen Pidd was the Guardian’s North of England editor, based in Manchester for 12 years. As she changes roles to become a presenter on the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast, she looked at the rapid transformation of her home city and complaints from its proud locals that it’s being “Londonised”. Is it the case, she asked, that Manchester is becoming less Mancunian? Or are Mancunians just changing, along with their ever expanding, shape-shifting city?Read more2.‘My parents got me out of Soviet Russia at the right time. Should my family now leave the US?’View image in fullscreenTime to move again?Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The Guardian“I have written dystopian fiction before, and my latest novel, Vera, or Faith, is a continuation of the natural outcome of my birth in Leningrad and my removal, at age seven, to Reagan’s America. I think I have predicted the future with fairly good aim in novels such asSuper Sad True Love Story, where social media helps to give rise to a fascist America, although my timeline when that book was published in 2010 was 30 years into the future, not a decade and change.”When Gary Shteyngart left the Soviet Union for a new life in the US, the novelist never imagined he would live under another authoritarian regime. Then Trump returned to power … Is it, he asked, time to move again?Read more3.The go-between: how Qatar became the global capital of diplomacyView image in fullscreenQatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani.Composite: Guardian Design/Reuters“The power Qatar has come to wield has taken many observers by surprise,” wrote Nesrine Malik in this fascinating long read. “As a conservative Muslim monarchy in the Middle East, Qatar is a new kind of location for the sort of high-stakes geopolitical deal-making transacted until recently in Geneva and Oslo. Yet since 7 October, the precarious nation’s investment in becoming the world’s go-between has come into its own.”She explained how, having long cultivated close relations with both the US and Hamas, Qatar has become the locus of ceasefire negotiations, as well as discussions over aid and evacuating the wounded. “As the conflict expanded into the wider Middle East and drew in the US, Qatar’s mediation has grown from a strategy to enhance its own safety into a role that underpins the entire world’s security.”Read more4.In Ukraine’s bombed out reservoir a huge forest has grown – is it a return to life or a toxic timebomb?View image in fullscreen‘A big natural experiment’ in Ukraine.Photograph: Vincent MundyTwo years after the Nova Kakhovka dam was destroyed in Ukraine, nature has returned in abundance to the drained land in a “big natural experiment” – but could it be lost as quickly as it appeared?

It’s a five-hour train ride from Berlin, a city that has often stolen the electronic music spotlight from the rest of Germany due to its mythologised hedonism and notoriously selective scene, credited to clubs such as Berghain. Yet since opening in December 2023, Open Ground has become a pilgrimage site for nightlife enthusiasts and DJs from all over the world. British musician Floating Points has called it ‘probably the greatest-sounding club in the EU’. Drum’n’bass DJ Mantra said: ‘It can almost bring you to tears.’”Whitney Wei headed to a former second world war bunker that is now Germany’s buzziest dance venue.

The mistake by Lucy Bronze that allowed Olga Carmona to score the only goal of the game; Lauren Hemp hitting the crossbar; the opportunities not taken; the surges of momentum not rewarded; the sense of a golden inheritance slipping inexorably through their fingers. For the players who remain, and for coach Sarina Wiegman, Sunday’s European Championship final offers a chance for redemption.If all this is normal and regular enough, then what is perhaps more unusual is that much of the above is also true for their victorious opponents.England v Spain: where the Women’s Euro 2025 final could be won or lostRead moreRestitution, revenge, a chance to erase painful memories, a collective resolve that this moment will not be taken from them, the chance to secure a meaningful legacy: these will be the stakes for Spain in Basel.Winning the World Cupin 2023 was a monumental achievement immediately tarnished by the actions of their federation. This final, by contrast, feels like more of a clean slate.Spain should win. They have been the outstanding team of the tournament so far, effortlessly gifted on the ball, ruthlessly disciplined without it, adding layers of complexity to their famous passing game, defending gallantly when the situation has demanded it. There has also been a sense of quietly building momentum not just in the tournament but through the year as a whole: pieces falling into place, players becoming more and more comfortable in their roles.But as Montse Tomé’s players have consistently made clear, Spain are competing for more than trophies. The bitter legal and public battles fought with their federation, the RFEF, are part of a longer struggle for recognition and equality, for respect and dignity. After all, if the greatest moment of their careers could be so cruelly taken from them, then what ultimately was the point of it?The 2023 World Cup was not the unifying moment for Spanish football that it could have been. Fifteen players had quit the national team before the tournament; three ultimately returned, and so for a squad marooned on the other side of the world, loyalties split between their present task and their absent comrades, a begrudging truce had been maintained with their disliked coach Jorge Vilda and the suits above him. It was a fragile show of unity, maintained only by their quest for a first major trophy. Once it had been secured, all hell broke loose.In hindsight, the unwanted kiss that Luis Rubiales planted on the lips of Jenni Hermoso was simply the trigger. The unresolved issues and grievances within Spanish football had lain unresolved for decades, and probably would not have been purged in any other way. The actions of Rubiales himself were egregious enough; what really hurt was the way the mechanisms of power and influence instinctively mobilised to protect him.Hermoso was urged to appear in a video publicly defending him, and after she refused, a statement insisting the kiss was consensual was written and published by the federation without her knowledge. “While the world has seen this, attitudes like this have been part of our team’s daily life for years,” she wrote on social media.When Rubiales finally resigned in an interview with Piers Morgan, having blamed “false feminism” for the storm of protest against him, he did so not out of genuine remorse or contrition but – as he admitted – out of a desire not to hamper Spain’s bid for the 2030 men’s World Cup. A Spanish courtfound him guilty of sexual assaultin February, and after ignoring an appeal from prosecutors who sought a jail sentence, fined him all of about £9,000.View image in fullscreenAitana Bonmatí scored Spain’s winner against Germany in the Euro 2025 semi-final.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APHas anything really changed? Rubiales is gone, as are many of the figures around him when he was at the RFEF.Vilda was sackedafter the tournament, and will take charge of Morocco in Saturday’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final. But the moment they shared and the platform it could have provided: they have gone forever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bronze remembers playing training games at Barcelona and encountering “like, clones and clones and clones of these amazing, technical, intelligent players”. And the 11 who will take the field against England on Sunday are the very best of them.It is not just the World Cup fallout for which Spain are trying to atone. Twelve months later they travelled to Paris as the overwhelming favourites for Olympic gold, only to be stunned 4-2 by Brazil in the semi-finals after a performance littered with defensive errors. They didn’t even win bronze, Germany beating them in the third-place playoff. The goalkeeper Cata Coll was inconsolable afterwards, but here has talked about how “life has given us a second chance”.This is a better team than 12 months ago, arguably a better team than two years ago, “like a steamroller” as Carmona describes them, albeit with an occasional habit of getting stuck in neutral. Capitalising on these fleeting passages is England’s best hope of upsetting the odds, picking their moments to attack, using their press and their physicality and their technical ability to rattle Spain off their game.And perhaps, for a country for so long indifferent to women’s football, where the sport was banned until 1980, where the women’s team have often been treated as an afterthought, Spain can finally enjoy their moment in the spotlight. There are big screens being erected across the country, from the Parque de Berlín in Madrid to the Plaza del Pilar in Gran Canaria. This is a team united and content again, longing above all for a chance to write their own story.*Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballSpain women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Most of India’s morning was of the hands-on-hips variety, an homage to a crestfallenDwight Schrute listening to Everybody Hurts, 135 overs in the field to blame. Jasprit Bumrah found space to detonate the top of Liam Dawson’s off-stump but Brydon Carse – half-centurion at Lord’s, beefing up England’s tail at 10 – remained at ease.This was a welcome situation to end the drought.Ben Stokeshad a mixed Friday, sliding into Joe Root’s passenger seat, taking his customary blow to the box on 13, then retiring hurt with leg cramp on 66. He returned before the close, finishing unbeaten on 77 to guarantee Old Trafford’s attention when play resumed on Saturday. It had been nearly two years since his last century in any game.Harry Brook drops the devilry but takes catch before India keep eye on the ball | Simon BurntonRead moreThere was a bit of tension on 99. He found air with an attempted cover drive off Bumrah, faced three dots off Washington Sundar and one off Siraj. But a glance down the leg side for four prompted a look to the skies and an arm round Carse as he waved the bat. With it he became the fourth Englishman to hit a hundred and take a five-wicket haul in the same Test, the kind of stat you would have expected him to already hold, Ian Botham having done it five times.Stokes has had it tough with the bat over the past couple of years, underlined by the absence of a Test hundred since his pyrotechnics in the Ashes. But while he isn’t the miracle man anymore, the drop in form has never been severe. Seven matches in Asia, conditions he’d never mastered on previous tours, have contributed to the quiet period, as have his hamstring troubles, ruling him out of four Tests last year. Five innings at home against West Indies last summer returned three half-centuries and there were several starts in this series before Old Trafford (including a peculiar run of three consecutive second-innings 33s).View image in fullscreenEngland’s Ben Stokes hits a six.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAHis 141 here was not one of the classics, having come out to bat when his side trailed India by nine runs. Even if there was a touch of magic with a one-two off Sundar – six down the ground was immediately followed by an outrageous reverse sweep to the ropes – it came after England had crossed 600, the first time they had done so at home in 14 years.What the knock did was add to Stokes’s story this summer, that of the resurgent player. Much of the past three years has been about his position as captain, how he directs England in the field and instructs the team to play. When he has missed matches, how Ollie Pope goes as the stand-in leader has felt more pressing than the runs and wickets lost in his absence. But Stokes has lived up to his post on X in December after tearing his left hamstring, promising to “fuck some shit up” when he returned. He is still very much a cricketer, not just a fount of wisdom at mid-off or coach with whites on. He has found nip and danger under the sun, taking more wickets than anyone else in this series. He has the score now, too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last of Botham’s ton-and-five-wicket-haul combos was at the age of 28. On Friday evening Pope acknowledged Stokes’s batting retirement as the result of how much he had pushed his body in recent weeks. How he would move in the field after facing 198 deliveries was the next issue. When Chris Woakes took two in two in his opening over, it felt a bit irrelevant, and continued to do so when Jofra Archer found late swing into Shubman Gill after lunch.Then cameGill and KL Rahul’s resistance, and the question of when Stokes would bowl, this being the perfect situation for his right-arm heat. On came Carse, then Dawson, and Root got it to twirl, too. Stokes stuck to the director’s chair, resuming his role of late, his fitness unclear, every walk to the stumps a tease, his cap still on as he discussed tactics with the bowler.“He’s a bit stiff and sore,” revealed Marcus Trescothick, England’s batting coach, at the end of play, no certainty offered on whether Stokes will bowl on the final day. “He’s had quite a big workload in the last few weeks. And then batting in the first innings, he was getting quite a bit of cramp. Hoping with another night’s rest and a bit more physio work overnight he’ll be back in and doing a bit tomorrow.“You’ll probably see Joe Root bowl a little bit more if he’s not available, but let’s wait and see. Hopefully, fingers crossed, it will be OK by tomorrow.” Stokes has rediscovered his rhythm, but the pain remains.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Ben StokesEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s already real in the digital hive mind | Barney RonayRead moreArsenal confirmed the news with a brief post on X that read: “This is where you need to be. Viktor Gyökeres is a Gunner.”Gyökeres will be expected to meet his new colleagues in Arsenal’s ongoing pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong. The Gunners face Newcastle in the Singapore National Stadium on Sunday before the concluding game of their tour, against Tottenham in Hong Kong on 31 July.Manager Arteta said: “Viktor has so many qualities. He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels. He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat.“We’re excited about what Viktor brings to our squad and are looking forward to start working with him.”Gyökeres moved to Brighton from Swedish side Brommapojkarna in January 2018, but spent time on loan at St Pauli and then Swansea and Coventry, before making a permanent move to the Sky Blues in July 2021.After Coventry were beaten on penalties by Luton in the 2023 Championship playoff final at Wembley, Gyökeres completed a £20.5m switch to Sporting. He scored 97 goals in 102 matches for the Portuguese side.Arsenal spent the concluding months of last season without a recognised striker following long-term injuries to Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz. Even before then, Arsenal were in need of a reliable scorer, and Arteta will hope his new signing can fire him to his first silverware since he won the FA Cup in 2020, and end the club’s two-decade wait for a Premier League title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Forest reacted furiously to the news and threatened legal action over an alleged illegal approach for the player.Forest were also preparing a complaint to thePremier League, arguing that Spurs’ conduct surrounding the proposed transfer had been inappropriate. The two-time European champions consulted lawyers because they believed Spurs did not have permission to speak with Gibbs-White and also felt there had been a breach in confidentiality regarding the release clause in the England man’s contract.Gibbs-White scored seven goals and added eight assists in 34 league games last season to help Forest finish seventh and qualify for Europe. He had been linked with Spurs and Manchester City. However, late on Saturday night, the midfielder signed a new deal with Forest which keeps him at the City Ground until 2028.The Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, said: “Morgan is a special player – not just in terms of talent, but character and mentality. He represents what we want this football club to be: he is a winner, talented, ambitious, fearless and proud.“There was significant interest from various clubs, but we were determined to build our future with Morgan at the heart of it. I promised our fans we would not only compete, but grow stronger and stronger every season. Today is another big step in that journey.”Speaking after signing his new deal, Gibbs-White told the club’s official website: “I’ve felt at home at Forest from the moment I arrived. The support from the fans, my teammates and everyone around the club has been unbelievable. I believe in what we’re building here – and with the backing of Mr Marinakis and the enormous ambition he has, I want to be part of making something special.

A player who dives off his feet and is clearly beaten to the position over the ball, makes neck contact … it was a tough one to take.“Just watch the footage. Players make errors. Match officials make errors. Our perspective is that we felt it was a decision that doesn’t really live up to the big player-safety push they [World Rugby] are talking about.“You cannot hit someone above the levels of the shoulders and there’s no bind with the left arm, his hand is on the ground. That’s what we have seen. We have watched a number of replays from different angles so it is what it is.

Joël Jutge, the head of the referees, is out here on a junket. He needs to haul those referees in and ask for a please explain.“It’s a point of law. It’s in black and white, it’s not about bias.

I thought it was a good clear-out live. I couldn’t understand what they were going back for. They seem to go back for absolutely everything these days, don’t they? I’m so pleased that the referee held his nerve. It was the right decision, in my opinion.”To win the series is what dreams are made of and no one can deny that for us nowAndy FarrellThe fly-half Finn Russell also felt Tizzano had made the most of the challenge. “They were trying to get anything at that point. I think that was a brilliant clear-out, pretty much a textbook clear-out. When he’s gone in over the ball Jac has hit him hard, and that’s how it is. He obviously holds his head and tried to get a penalty from it, but nah I think it was a brilliant clear-out.”Farrell, meanwhile, hailed his side’s composure after they overcame a 19-point deficit, the biggest in Lions Test history. “These lads have dreamed of being a British & Irish Lion all their lives. To get to the point when we come to the MCG with 90-odd thousand people with a dramatic finish like that to win the series is what dreams are made of and no one can deny that for us now.“It is a special moment for everyone, we are absolutely delighted that we showed the courage and what it takes to be a Lion. If you’re a child watching that back home, do you want to be a British and Irish lion? 100%. To win it like that is what top-level sport is all about. It’s cruel in so many ways for Australia but we stayed in the fight and we got what we deserved.”Keenan was determined to deliver the decisive blow against Australia even while his head coach implored him to pass. Farrell said: “I was screaming: ‘Pass it, pass it, pass it!’ And knowing Hugo, he was never going to pass it! He was always going to back himself!” The Irishman saw his chance and took it. “Andy mentioned it after. I think he backed me in the end. Jack was outside and he would have finished it himself, but where there’s a will there’s a way,” Keenan said.Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025Australia rugby union teamBritish & Irish LionsAndy FarrellRugby unionAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

They had to come from behind against Sweden and Italy, winning the former on penalties and the latter in extra time.Asked how her decision-making process works in the dying moments of games with England trailing, the head coach, Sarina Wiegman, said: “First, I’m having a heart attack too. I just don’t show it.“We want to be best prepared, that’s our style of play. We’re also trying to prepare for what can happen in the game and what we need. We figured out what players we might need in certain circumstances if we want to change things. That’s what we talk about all the time and that’s how we prepare for a game. We have spoken through all the scenarios, but then during the game it’s a sense of what you feel is necessary.”There have been concerns about the fitness of Lauren James,who came off against Italy with an ankle injury. But the forward played a part in training in Zurich before the team travelled to Basel.Williamson rolled her ankle against Sweden. “My ankle is great,” she said. “My mum rolled her ankle a couple of days ago, so she’s taken all the attention away from me now.“I can speak for every single member of the squad when I say as long as we get the green light we would play through absolutely anything to be involved at this stage.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamLeah WilliamsonSarina WiegmanWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

At that time, that’s how I felt. Since then, firm steps have been taken forward. That way of thinking is disappearing from society.England v Spain: where the Women’s Euro 2025 final could be won or lostRead more“We have to keep opening doors and normalising situations. At that time, after the press conference, with the victory, many walls were torn down. There is still work to be done, but we are on the right track.”In the aftermath of the final in Sydney, Spain’s triumph was soured when the Spanish Football Federation’s Luis Rubiales kissed the Jenni Hermoso on the lips without her consent.Rubiales was found guilty of sexual assault in Februaryand the conviction upheld in June.Spain’s head coach, Montse Tomé, said she was glad to now be discussing football matters rather than the Rubiales furore. “We are a team, they are players that have been fighting, working, with energy and now they are able to focus energy on football,” she said.“I can sit here and answer questions about football – this has changed. This means a lot to me. It shows the change we are getting. Right now, for all the effort I think the squad deserves [to be] winning. In the elite football world it’s not always the case [that you win] but we’ll do everything to try, tomorrow.”They beat England in a Nations League fixture in Barcelona in June, although they did lose 1-0 at Wembley in February. Tomé has drawn lessons from those matches. “I expect a balanced game against a team that is good in attack, they have a very powerful attacking line, in midfield they also have a high level and they’re very capable in defence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He leads his long-standing rival Vingegaard by almost four and a half minutes and barring any last day mishaps, the Slovenian’s fourth yellow jersey seems assured.Tour organisers ASO confirmed in Pontarlier that any decision on neutralising the final stage would not be taken until Sunday afternoon and possibly during the stage itself.“Anything can happen,” Pogacar said of the final day’s combination of climbing and sprinting, “but I’m not promising I’ll go for it. We’ll try to enjoy the yellow jersey in Paris.”Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Australian Kaden Groves won the penultimate stage, from Nantua to Pontarlier, after breaking clear of a lead group in the final 16km. “There’s so much pressure in the Tour. All I ever get asked is: ‘Am I good enough to win in the Tour?’ Well, now I’ve shown them,” Groves, a stage winner in the Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a Espana, said.View image in fullscreenThe peloton is feeling the strain after a gruelling Tour with a draining first 10 days and too many long transfers.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersThe decisive action came on the descent of the final climb, the Côte de Longeville, 24km from Pontarlier. In the aftermath of a crash on a tight left-hand bend, Groves was among a group of three who moved clear. The 26-year-old then attacked alone in the final kilometres to win by almost a minute.After well over three thousand kilometres of racing, an ingrained fatigue is now stalking the peloton with numerous riders sharing Pogacar’s obvious weariness, without enjoying the rewards of his success. Many admit to being wrung out by a Tour with a draining first 10 days and too many long transfers.Tour de France 2025: Pogacar in line to win overall after Groves goes solo to win stage 20 – live reactionRead more“I feel like a nap as soon as getting on the bus,” the Lidl-Trek rider Toms Skujins said during the Alpine stages. Pogacar said: “If you look at the power files throughout the whole Tour, it’s been really amazing and tough. Even though it was one of the hardest I ever did, I enjoyed it.”Much has also been made of the Tour’s decision to augment Sunday’s traditional processional laps of the Champs-Élysées with three laps racing over the cobbled climbs in Montmartre. “I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Vingegaard said. “Montmartre seemed very beautiful at the Paris Olympics, with a great atmosphere.”“But when the riders arrived there, there were 50 in the peloton. Now there will be 150 of us fighting for position on a very narrow climb. It’s going to add more stress than we’d like.”However, the threat of rain overshadows the plan and even the Tour’s director of racing, Thierry Gouvenou, acknowledged that the Parisian cobbles can be treacherous when wet. “We know with the slightest drop of rain, Paris is a real ice rink,” he said before the Tour. “We saw it in the Olympic Games time trial. It can turn into a catastrophe.”View image in fullscreenKaden Groves celebrates his stage success.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersIf it does rain, then the Tour is likely to “freeze” the overall standings, to ensure that the general classification is not affected by a last-day crash. “The stage will be run, but the time will be frozen,” Gouvenou said.Others have been dismayed by a Tour route that failed to crack the seemingly unflagging Pogacar, but instead shattered the reserves of many in the peloton. “The transfers have been longer and more poorly organised than any I have ever witnessed in some 20 Tours,” Jonathan Vaughters, manager of the EF Education EasyPost team said.“Instead of trying to progress into a modern professional sport, ASO is looking for ways to regress the sport backwards in time. Ultimately, taking care of the athletes leads to better recovery, better health, and better racing.”Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

It has always been a market and it is more of a market now than it has ever been before. Everybody is constantly looking for a better deal, and everybody has a price. Every club has its place in the ecosystem and those higher up the chain will always take from those below them, who in turn will take from those below them.All a club can ever hope to do is to inch their way higher and higher in the structure, to increase the number of clubs they can feed on while reducing the number of predators who can feed on them.Eddie Howe: Newcastle have not held contract talks with Alexander IsakRead moreIt may be reassuring to think of the legendary servants, the one-club men of the past, but even the term “servants” betrays an uncomfortable truth. From 1885, when professionalism was legalised and the great clubs of the industrial north and Midlands began to acquire talent from Scotland, footballers have been a product to be traded.From 1963, when the retain-and-transfer system was scrapped, and increasingly after the Bosman ruling of 1995, players have had agency –, although even before that there were cases such as that ofWilf Mannion, who went on strike to try to force a move from Middlesbrough to Oldham.Since financial fair play rules began to be introduced 15 years ago, preventing an owner splurging a fortune on elevating his side, the clubs climbing the ladder most successfully are those who have accepted their position within the hierarchy and traded accordingly. Brighton’s ascent to become a top-10 Premier League side has been based almost entirely on their ability toidentify talent early and sell itat an enormous profit to Chelsea.There remains a reluctance to be seen as a selling club, but other than Real Madrid everybody is a selling club now. Far better to be a selling club than a letting-a-player-run-down-his-contract-and-leave-on-a-free club. Clubs who will have regarded themselves as the elite, as destination clubs, have to accept that almost everybody is a stepping stone . Perhaps for those who are battling to return to the elite, who are not confident in their status, that is a difficult adjustment to make.Marcus Rashford must stave off sense of anticlimax after Barcelona switch | Jonathan WilsonRead moreWhich brings us to Alexander Isak. The dance ofbriefing and counter-briefingthat has played out over the past couple of weeks has been fascinating and, frankly, a little baffling. If Isak wanted to leave Newcastle – and he was considering his future in the final weeks of last season – why wait until afterLiverpool signed Hugo Ekitikéand Chelsea acquiredLiam DelapandJoão Pedro, as well as for Arsenal’s move forViktor Gyökeresto be at an extremely advanced stage, to make that public? Does the scarcity of centre-forwards on the market push his price up? Or does the fact that potential suitors have no burning need for a striker reduce it?Understandably, Newcastle fans are reluctant to see the Swede go. He is, after all, probably the club’s best player since Alan Shearer. He is only 25; once upon a time it would have been possible to dream of him staying for the best part of a decade, scoring 200 goals.Last season was the best Newcastle have known since the first Kevin Keegan era. Theywon the Carabao Cup, their first domestic silverware in 70 years, qualified for the Champions League and their line was led by one of the world’s most coveted strikers. It was possible to imagine a future when Isak was joined by players of similar stature.But that is not how modern football works. Isak wants more: more money (and his £120,000-a-week salary does seem below the market rate) and a more consistent chance of winning trophies. Newcastle could hang on to him, hope he does not succumb to bitterness and try to add further stars.View image in fullscreenNewcastle won their first domestic silverware, the Carabao Cup, in 70 years last season.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockOr they could take £140m and invest it in strengthening the squad as a whole, accumulating more assets who can be sold at a profit so more can be bought, driving their ascent. It is cold and mercantile, it is far from the romance many would like to see in the game, but it is also the reality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere are two problems. First, the sense of loss if Isak goes, which is particularly acute for a fanbase that still carries the collective memory of the departures of Chris Waddle, Peter Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne in the 80s and the fear that the Saudi Public Investment Fund may essentially turn out to be the habitually beleaguered Stan Seymour in disguise. Isak is not the only Newcastle player pondering his future and there is a danger his departure is the start of a mini-exodus.Second, there is a lack of faith that the club is equipped to make the most of such a windfall. Paul Mitchell left this summer after a year as sporting director and although Jack Ross has been appointed as head of football strategy andSudarshan Gopaladesikanas technical director, with Ross Wilson likely to be named as sporting director soon, it is unreasonable to expect anybody taking up a role in July to coordinate a coherent transfer strategy for a window that closes on 1 September, particularly with Darren Eales stepping down as chief executive because of illness.View image in fullscreenAnthony Elanga is Newcastle’s only senior signing this summer.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThere has already been disquiet about a lack of incoming players, withAnthony Elanga the only senior signingto date as Newcastle have missed out on a number of targets, most recently James Trafford,who preferred to rejoin Manchester City.Although plans are being drawn up for a new stadium, there were fears last season that Newcastle might be the victims of a more general Saudi retrenchment. Meeting profitability and sustainability rules remains a check on expenditure, but with Champions League football this season there were reasons to expect the budget to be a little more generous.Instead, there is a sense of drift. In part that is misfortune, given the illnesses suffered by Eales and Amanda Staveley, who sold her stake in the club last summer. But the appointment of Mitchell never seemed a comfortable fit and the result is a vacuum. Last season was supposed to be the beginning of a glorious future for Newcastle; the fear within the frustrations of the past few weeks is that it was actually a summit.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedInside footballSaudi Arabia and sportcommentShareReuse this content"

I was able to meet some of them: in a rehabilitation centre for war veterans in Cherkasy and a mental health clinic for internally displaced families in Vinnytsia.Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, I’ve drawn many political cartoons about the war; drawings that feature Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Vladimir Putin and the occasional bear. It looked very different from the ground, where war is fought and lived by ordinary people, just like us. In the hospitals I visited in May this year, I sketched the precise way in which war is mapped on individual bodies and listened to the stories behind their scars. I drew what people told me, as well as what I saw, because trauma and hope are intangible things of memory and imagination. There’s nothing left to draw of an amputated limb but memories – the same could be said for a lost home or relative. These things are beyond a camera’s reach, which I think gives you licence to reach for a pencil.I watched an MSF psychiatrist help a soldier regain feeling in his paralysed hand using tiny scraps of textured materials intended to evoke strong memories. As she brushed them against his fingertips, she explained: “This cable-knit might remind him of a grandma’s jumper; this fluff, a child’s teddy; this one, grass.” I saw echoes of this image throughout the hospital in injured people reaching back or forwards to life beyond the war. People described their memories of peace in vivid terms, but when I asked what victory meant I was met with nonplussed stares. One soldier said: “No idea … but when it happens, I’ve promised my wife I’ll shave off my beard.” His beard was long. His wife was perched on his hospital bed and asked if I’d like to see how well her husband can lift his dumbbells with his one remaining arm.Dima (29)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianAfter Dima regained consciousness in the hospital, he phoned his mother to tell her that “everything was fine – just a few scratches”. “It wasn’t true,” he tells me. “There was a big hole in my leg and in my ear and arm.” He still can’t sleep. “My nightmares are always the same. They’re taking me from the hospital back to the trenches, and then I am above – I am the drone making the projectile drop that hits me.”Dima flies first-person view (FPV) drones so he knows how this looks. His psychologist tells him he might sleep better if he wasn’t on his phone all night. But he likes watching videos on Instagram and YouTube – mostly bodycam footage of the war that, he explains, help him to understand the “subtleties” of his own memories: what he did, what he could have done. He tells me about his mentor, Matrovski, who made him stay down in the trench while he looked out to see if the Russians were still there. Matrovski was immediately shot in the neck and bled to death.The shard of shrapnel that buried itself in Dima’s body when the drone projectile detonated is now sitting on his bedside table. He tells me: “It momentarily paralysed me from the bottom of my spine to the end of my extremities. I thought it had injured my spinal cord and I wouldn’t be able to walk. I thought ‘this is the end’. But I started to touch my head to see if I had any blood. I didn’t find any and I said to myself: ‘I am alive, I am not dead.’ I could hear the enemy drones watching. FPVs have a horrible squeaky sound – like Formula One [cars]. If it’s high, then it’s quiet. When it gets louder, then you worry. I could hear them watching so I lay very still and pretended to be dead. I heard them leave. Then I was screaming from the pain. I thought I would bleed to death.”He survived, he says, because “I am my mother’s only child. When I joined the army she cried and so I’d promised her that everything would be fine.” She is a kindergarten teacher, “the kindest person in the world. She has brown hair and green eyes like mine. Always smiling – even when she’s sad.”Olena (30)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianI ask Olena where home is. She tells me about the clouds in Luhansk. “They’re really beautiful, like mountains because there aren’t any tall buildings there. Home is where the sky has no missiles, just clouds and the sun and birds and planes – but not military, safe, with passengers. The most important thing is the feeling that you can look at the sky without being scared. After 2022, I had to again learn how to look at the sky without fear.”The first time Olena was displaced by conflict was in 2014, when she was 19. She “got on a train to nowhere” and wound up in Kyiv, searching through old Facebook friends for somewhere to stay. She rebuilt her life in Luhansk. She says: “I loved my flat. The children’s bedroom had pastel wallpaper with balloons. My husband and I built a big balcony and I pasted these stickers of pink peonies all over it. We had a great life, we didn’t expect to have war … even more war. Then we started hearing explosions from the frontlines … we saw the first missiles in the sky, interceptions – the children were terrified.”When the invasion happened, Olena and her family fled to Vinnytsia. She says that now “I feel like I have two lives. Part of my soul is left there back in that life. So I’m here, but at the same time I’m there.” When I ask her what she hopes for the future, she says: “I don’t see the future, for now. I live in the present day … I just think ‘I woke up in the morning, thank God, I went to work, thank God. My children went to school, God thank you.’” She has portraits of her children tattooed on her arms. She shows me her other tattoos: a mandala, a daisy with a plaster, birds. “They’re all connected to the war,” she says. “They’re like scars.”I show her my tattoos, and some of my drawings. Olena likes drawing too. She shows me a photo of one of her paintings – a road leading to a little house on a hill covered with bright yellow wheat. The sky is dark blue, because, Olena says, “it’s stormy, like it’s about to rain”. She points to the single lit window of the house. “I added this to be like hope.” I ask if this drawing is of a real place where she lived. She says no. “It’s an abstract place – a home in the heart.”Roman (40)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianIn 2022, Roman quit his job collecting parcels and joined a medical brigade collecting wounded and dead soldiers. He says that “sometimes the body parts were blown up into the trees”.When the drone detonated, his legs didn’t get that far. They ended up in the box next to him in the medical stabilisation centre, still with their shoes on. He says: “I remember looking at my legs in the box and I was so scared when I realised that I couldn’t get this part of my past back – that now my future would be very different. I was so sad to say goodbye to what was in the box … Then I realised it was too early to die. I hadn’t said goodbye to my family, or finished the house that I’d been building for them.”When Roman started building the house many years ago, he’d gone to the bank to take out a loan from a “very beautiful woman with white blond hair. I told her all about the house and she said: ‘Maybe one day you’ll show me.’ So I took her number and invited her to coffee.” Tanya and Roman married soon after and now have two children, Alexi, 12, and Yvan, 21. Their house is finally almost finished – “white pillars and blue walls – only a few tiles on the roof still to complete … maybe also a swimming pool”. He tells me how his family loved to go swimming in the sea in Odesa. “We used go all together. But if I imagine going back, I cannot understand one thing – how will I be able to go in the sea? Can you swim in a prosthesis?” I don’t know the answer but – after a long pause – Roman does: “Yvan goes to the gym. His muscles are even bigger than mine. He can bring me on his back into the sea. And I will swim with him. Then he’ll take me back out of the water and put me on the chair, and I’ll put the prostheses back on. That’s how it will be.”Roman called his wife from the hospital to tell her that he’d lost his legs but “not to worry: everything is fine”. He said to her: “Nothing has changed. I don’t want anything to change.”Inna (42) & Tetiana (48)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianInna and Tetiana come to talk to me together, exchanging glances before every answer, sharing tissues and whispered encouragements. Tetiana’s son, Valeria, and Inna’s husband, Mykola, are prisoners of war in Russia. They were captured on the same day in May 2022. Valeria is 27 now. Inna struggles to remember her husband’s age. She says it’s because “we don’t celebrate birthdays any more. When they were captured, everything stopped.” But when I ask what Valeria and Mykola look like, Inna answers: “Now or before?”Inna and Tetiana wait at every prisoner exchange in the hope that their relatives will be among those released. When they’re not, sometimes the soldiers who have been bring back news of them. That’s how Inna and Tetiana know how different their loved ones now look – “exhausted, so thin”. For the first year of her husband’s captivity, Inna struggled to eat. She says she’s a bit better now; she’s found Tetiana. “We have the same pain, we understand it.” The women believe that they have a “spiritual connection with their loved ones”, that they “must stay strong and cry less so they may also feel our hope and prayers”. Inna describes how her husband comes to check on her in her dreams.Inna says she likes to picture sitting with her husband in their garden back in Mariupol. Mykola liked to grow flowers there, “wild forest flowers – I don’t even know where he got those seeds. At the time I didn’t even like them! But now nothing would make me happier.” Tetiana says she also likes to picture Valeria “somewhere in nature – a field of white chamomile with the sun shining really bright … birdsong, fresh air.”Neither Inna nor Tetiana have had any direct contact with their relatives for three years. If they could talk, Inna tells me she’d say “that I love him – that we’re waiting”. Tetiana adds: “We’re waiting. We’re definitely going to wait.”Tetiana (66)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianTetiana cries silently throughout our conversation. She doesn’t want to stop or skip any questions; she always looks me directly in the eye. Her son Maksym was born in 1995, the same year as me. He was killed fighting in Donetsk on 8 May 2022.“It’s not possible to describe the burden of the pain I’m bearing,” says Tetiana. “I think about him every day; when I wake up, when I go to sleep. Sometimes when I’m walking and I see a young man who resembles mine – tall, gentle, strong – I think ‘oh’, because I had once such a boy.” She says her grief is “like the evening sky, like twilight – there’s still some light there, and the light is all Maksym”.Tetiana was born in Russia and came to Ukraine in 1974. She says they’re a railway family. “I worked there for 40 years. It’s where I met my husband. We wanted Maksym to join the railway too, but even from his childhood he always dreamed of joining the military.” As a boy, Maksym playedzarnitsain the woods. It’s an old Soviet war game, and the name translates from Russian as “heat lightning”. “This is how he will remain for ever for me,” she says. “Running through the woods. There’s a photo of his dead body which his commander took. I still haven’t looked at it: I can’t. Let him remain alive for me, for the rest of my life.”He was “always a military man – he loved his country”, but she says he was gentle too. In the trenches, he’d feed the lost cats and send her photos of them. She says he’d call to say: “Mum, don’t worry. Everything’s going to be fine.”Dmytro (43) & Petrov (40)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianPetrov says he and his older brother, Dmytro, have been “making little models of soldiers together since childhood, and conducting fake wars. Then we grew up and had a different kind of war.” Dmytro says that “in the war, we were always together”. They were together when the drone detonated under their car, killing the other two soldiers with them. The brothers are now recuperating from their injuries in the same hospital, in different wards. I talk to them separately, but each brother tells me mostly about the other.Petrov says that when the drone detonated, “I felt a very strong burning sensation and I was screaming. My brother was screaming that he was injured too and I was so happy that he was screaming because it meant he was alive.” Dmytro says: “I heard my brother’s voice and I calmed down. It probably all happened very quickly, but it felt like time stopped. When I realised that Petrov was seriously injured in all four limbs – how much blood he was losing – I knew that I had to provide medical aid for him or he would die. I’ve been on the frontline for a long time. I’ve tied a lot of tourniquets. So in this situation I’m not panicking. I’m calm. I tied the tourniquets. But I was worried about him.” Petrov says Dmytro worries too much, “but it’s natural, I’m his little brother.” Dmytro says: “I’ve been protective of Petrov since picking him up from kindergarten. He’s not weak, he’s very strong. But I have to look after him. He’s my little brother.”They are now healing well, although Dmytro says he’s worried about Petrov’s hands. His doctors say he’ll never regain full movement. Dmytro says his brother has “golden hands: whatever he likes to do with them, he does so well. He’s very creative: a sculptor, he plays the guitar.” Petrov says it was Dmytro’s guitar – his brother bought it but got bored after learning one song and quit, so Petrov learned to play instead.Petrov hopes the war has left him with enough movement in his hands to go back to making sculptures, and there’s one sitting on his bedside table in the hospital. It’s a phone stand with the insignia of his village’s brigade, which he insists on giving to me. I’m concerned that without it Petrov won’t be able to hold his phone, as one hand is swathed in bandages and the other sutured to his midriff. When I ask the doctors about this they explain: “To encourage the skin grafts on his hands to take, we connect the hand to the midriff where the blood supply is better.” They say Petrov spends a lot of his time on his phone, mostly video calling Dmytro in the hospital ward downstairs.Valentyn (51)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianIt was a rainy dawn and Valentyn had been sweeping for mines; dawn so as not to be seen, rain because it makes it harder for the drones to fly. He tells me that he never touched the mine – it reacted to the electromagnetic field of his body with a flash that, weeks later, he still can’t get out of his eyes. He holds up the bandaged stumps of his arms. “For this hand there is no hope. But for the other – one finger is still alive.” He displays the prosthetic he’s been given to hold a spoon. “The next device must be to hold a fishing rod.” With his one remaining finger, Valentyn mimes reeling in a fishing line. Valentyn’s grandpa taught him to fish and he still goes to the same spot on the Dnipro River. “It’s very beautiful, very calm. Just trees by the river. I like to go there alone. If I go with my friends they get drunk and scare away the fish.”Natalii (55)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianI meet Natalii at a women’s support group in Vinnytsia for refugees from Kherson. Today, they’re making flowers out of colourful pipe cleaners. The windows of the community room are filled with flowers that Natallii grows in little recycled pots. She talks about her garden back in Kherson, where she lived before the invasion: 200 sq metres filled with apricot trees, grapevines and flowers; her favourites were the pink roses. She shows me photos that a friend who stayed behind took recently. Their house has been utterly destroyed, but the roses in the garden are still blooming. Now Natalii lives with her family in a small apartment in Vinnytsia. “There’s no garden but a good window. For my birthday I was given a huge bouquet, and there were still some roots! Now I have seven big bushes in water on the floor in front of the window.” Natalii says her family think she’s mad, apart from her nine-year-old granddaughter, Anya, who also has green fingers. Anya’s father – Natalii’s son – always buys her flowers from the supermarket when he comes back from the front.For Natalii, “the flowers are like a memory from home … peace is the memory of the life that we were living there. Here, we are just waiting. My soul is in the garden back home in Kherson.”As Natalii talks, the other women twist their pipe cleaners into flower ornaments. Svitlana, 68, also a refugee from Kherson, has hands that tremble so violently Natalii helps her with the fiddly bits. I tell her about this project, and she says: “No picture could capture what we have lived through, what it is to have everything, to be together with all your family in your home, and then be living by the side of the road.” It’s a fair point.This project, facilitated by Médecins Sans Frontières, will be exhibited at The Arcade at Bush House, King’s College London, in SeptemberAbout the authorElla BaronPhotograph: supplied for bylineElla Baronis a political cartoonist at the Guardian"

As a minimum, ministers should strip away any inducement offered by the tax system for people who want to retire in their 50s.Every western country needs their more mature workers to keep going, if not full time, then part time. And if not paid work, then unpaid voluntary work that acknowledges the luck that flows from being a 21st-century baby boomer in good health.Communities, regions and countries cannot afford for older people to pack up and head for the golf course, or worse, book a permanent cruise and spend their cash in international waters.Reeves should consider ending pension triple lock and charging for NHS treatment, says IMFRead moreLast week, the government convened a pensions commission to consider a narrow question: how to boost the incomes of lower-paid workers in retirement.It is understandable that the government is worried about the increasing numbers of low-income workers who will soon spend a long retirement struggling to make ends meet.This is a genuine concern and a subject worthy of a commission. Yet there is a need to address a far wider question, which is how society will thrive when the age pyramid is inverted, with only a smattering of young people holding up a mountain of retirees.Retirement has its origins in the Industrial Revolution and the need to prevent older people from ending their years in abject poverty, not to fulfil a bucket list of expensive desires.The commission should ask why anyone in the 21st century should think they can put their feet up seven days a week when they are fit and well, and able to participate in economic life.Yet a prosperous retirement is the aim of so many – and not only when they are approaching their 60s.‘Think big’: ex-pensions minister calls for UK contributions minimum to go upRead moreIf you look at the strike record of full-time university lecturers you would think they obsess about their pensions every day.Council staff spend precious hours scrolling through WhatsApp groups discussing the most mundane changes to their retirement plans with a degree of attentiveness that, to give them credit, is in line with the generosity of their benefits.Company boardrooms are no different. Executives will set aside huge amounts of time to manage their complex and stunningly generous pensions. Having a financial consultant ready and available on the phone to talk about their retirement plans has become a must-have demand in the corporate world.Maybe its the lure of sailing on the Adriatic or cruising the Caribbean that captivates so many, or less positively, the frustration and anxiety from working near, with or for incompetent or venal managers in a succession of modestly paid jobs.Still, whatever the reason, too many people want to cash out of the economy, trading their pension and property gains for a long period of rest, with only the stress of remembering what day it is to bump their heart rate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those workers still in the labour market will bid up their wages, pushing up prices and making high inflation a permanent feature.Governments will find it harder to borrow money, in part because pension funds, after decades of growth, will have a declining need to buy their bonds.There are also extra bills to pay. In its latest report on the UK, the International Monetary Fund says the effects of population ageing on health and pension costs will account for a further 8% of GDP by 2050 compared with an extra 5.5% of GDP, on average, in other advanced European economies.These are important issues connected with the nation’s finances. So, too, are the ways better-off baby boomers insulate themselves.First, they take most of the pension money and invest it abroad where the gains are much higher, either because their workforces are young, dynamic and more productive or because the companies are American and enjoy monopolistic strangleholds in their respective markets.Investing abroad gives the boomer a ring-fenced income no matter how clapped out the economy they call home.The second track is to import young workers from abroad, boosting the labour supply as boomers make their exit.Financial insulation is understandable when government finances are under strain. Yet one of the reasons the wheels are coming off the modern liberal state is because baby boomers, who by sheer force of numbers and their better education spurred the postwar recovery, are causing the downturn by bailing out.Worse, they are cashing out, too.Without a debate about what it means to be old and the responsibilities that come with receiving a pension, the government’s commission will be left to merely tinker.We are only a few years away from the baby boomer generation all reaching retirement age. Everyone born in the years up to 1964 will be eligible to collect the state pension in 2031. It’s a turning point that everyone should be preparing for, especially when all the Pimm’s-drinking early retirees are added to the list. The commission’s remit should be wider.Explore more on these topicsRetirement planningViewpoint columnPensionsWork & careersState pensionsRetirement ageOlder peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

Brrrr. Brrrrrrr.That’s the sound ofDonald’s Trump’sdistraction machine, which has been running at full power as the president tries his best to stop us all from talking aboutJeffrey Epstein. Or, to be more specific, from talking about just howchummy he waswith the dead paedophile.Though he’s usually a master of controlling the narrative, none of Trump’s normal distraction techniquesseem to be working now. Indeed, at this point we should probably rename theStreisand effectthe Trump-Epstein effect because the president’s repeated insistence that there is NOTHING TO SEE HERE EXCEPT A VERY NASTY WITCH-HUNT only has people scrutinizing his dealings with Epstein more carefully. FromSouth ParktoScotlandto billboards inTimes Square, Trump can’t escape his past association with Epstein.Over the past couple of weeks, a lot of new information has come out about just how close Epstein and the president were. On 17 July, for example, the Wall Street JournalreportedTrump allegedly sent Epstein a 50th birthday card in 2003 with adrawing of a naked womanand a message which said, in part, “may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump denied writing the card and filed a $10bn lawsuitagainst the rightwing paper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, a day after the outlet published the story.The Trump administration is making viruses great again | Arwa MahdawiRead moreTrump’s lawsuit clearly didn’t scare off the Journal because,on Wednesday, it published a new report stating Trump’s name appears “multiple times” in justice department files aboutEpstein. On WednesdayCNN also publishednewly uncovered photos and video footage of the two men together, including one of Epstein at Trump’s wedding to Marla Maples at the Plaza hotel in New York in 1993 and footage from a 1999 Victoria’s Secret fashion event. Then, on Thursday, the New York Timesconfirmedthat Trump’s name appeared on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein’s 50th birthday, as the Journal first reported, along with a number of other well-known Epstein associates including Leslie Wexner, then the owner of Victoria’s Secret. The Times further reported that in 1997 the president had written a note calling Epstein “the greatest!” in a copy of Trump: The Art of the Comeback.While none of these new bits of information are evidence of criminal conduct on Trump’s part, the president’s furious reaction to anything Epstein-related, along with his administration’ssudden U-turnon its promise to release damning evidence related to possible Epstein clients, certainly makes Trump look like he’s got something to hide. And it’s not just Trump, of course. The sudden flurry of reporting about Epstein means that a lot of powerful men, including Bill Clinton, who the Journal says also sent abirthday letter to the disgraced financier, have been having a bad couple of weeks.The big question now is this: will the renewed interest in Epstein blow over in a few more weeks or could this deal a serious political blow to Trump and his lackeys? Trump is nicknamed the “comeback kid” for good reason: the man has an uncanny ability to shake off scandal. Still, nobody is completely untouchable; could the ghost of Epstein be the thing that finally topples King Trump from his throne? While that’s obviously an impossible question to answer, there are a few ways this could all play out.The first, and the best-case scenario for Trump, is that interest in Epstein organically fizzles out. That seems unlikely to happen given how furious the president’s base are; more than a third of them disapprove of how he’s handled the Epstein files, according to apoll from Quinnipiac University.The New York Times calls this“perhaps the most intraparty discontent Mr Trump has experienced as president”. The Democrats havealso seized on the issueas a way to fight Trump and will probably do their best to keep it in the news. While the Democrats are normally placid, they have beenvery much been on the offensewith the Epstein files.Another way (perhaps the most likely way) this could go is that the Trump administration brokers some sort of deal with Ghislaine Maxwell, the only person involved with Epstein who is in jail right now, in which she releases enough carefully curated information about the sex-trafficking case for Trump’s base to be satisfied, allowing the president to move on from the matter. Thedeputy US attorney generalhas met with Maxwell twice this week to see if she might have “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims”. While Maxwell’s lawyer has said Trump’s Department of Justicehas not offered clemency, Maxwell is rumored to beseeking a pardon. One can certainly imagine a situation in which she “cooperates” in a way that is mutually beneficial to her and Trump.The third scenario, which may be wishful thinking, is that Trump can’t contain the fallout over the Epstein files and the scandal massively hurts the Republicans in themidterms. OneGOP senator has already warnedthat “this is going to be an issue all the way through next year’s election.”Another possibility is that Trump continues his distractions until one actually sticks. The gen Z Democratic congressman Maxwell Frosthas joked that the“White House is about to drop proof of aliens” to stop people talking about Epstein. Joke or not, there’s certainly a non-zero chance of that happening. And if it’s not aliens, maybe Trump will start a nuclear war to shut us all up.Whatever happens with Trump and Epstein, however, I think it’s worth stressing that this case is about far more than the president. It’s about scores of vulnerable girls who were exploited by powerful men and let down by the justice system and parts of the media, which didn’t pursuethe story for years. I can’t help but notice how many Democrats only seemed to develop a passionate interest in the Epstein files when it became politically expedient for them to do so. Epstein’s countless victims deserve far better than that.Apology for South Korean woman convicted of biting tongue of alleged attackerIn 1965, 18-year-old Choi Mal-ja fought back against a man who she said was trying to rape her and bit off part of his tongue.

His time would be better spent planning for a world beyond the ‘special relationship’Sat 26 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Jul 2025 03.38 EDTShareDonald Trump’s victory in last November’s US presidential election presented Keir Starmer, Britain’s Labour prime minister, with a choice – and an opportunity. Eithercosy up to a manwhose obnoxious, hard-right, ultra-nationalist policies are inimical to UK security and foreign policy interests, economic prosperity and democratic values; or risk a rupture with the US, a longstanding but overbearing ally, and seize the moment to redefine Britain’s place in the world, primarily through reintegration in Europe.Starmer made the wrong call – and Britain has paid a heavy price ever since. The cost to national dignity and the public purse will be on painful show this weekend as Trump, pursued by theEpstein scandaland angry protesters, makes an expensively policed, ostensibly privatevisit to his golf coursesin Scotland. On Monday, the prime minister will travel north to kiss the ring. More humiliations loom. In September, Trump will return for an unprecedented second state visit, at Starmer’s unctuous behest. At that point, the full, embarrassing extent of Britain’s thraldom will be there for all the world to see.Let’s be clear. Trump is no friend of Britain’s and is, in key respects, a dangerous foe. Efforts tocurry favourwith this narcissist will ultimately prove futile. Trump always reneges. His unedifying career is littered with broken promises and relationships, personal and political. His only loyalty is to himself. Right now, this wannabe dictator is busy making America not greater but weaker, poorer, less influential and more disliked. Don’t let him drag Britain down, too. It’s not too late to make the break.US leadership of the western democracies used to be taken for granted. Now it’s a problem. Politicians in both Britain’s main parties have difficulty accepting this shift. As so often, public opinion is ahead of them. Recent polling by the Pew Research Center found62% of Britonshave no confidence in Trump “to do the right thing regarding world affairs”. Most of those surveyed in 24 countries viewed him as dangerous, arrogant and dishonest. Thanks to him, the US’s international standing is in freefall.Giving Israel a free hand in Gaza is the most egregious example of how Trump’s policies conflict with UK interests. Starmer’sgovernment has condemnedthe deliberate killing and starving of civilians. Among the 55% ofBritons opposedto Israel’s actions, 82% believe they amount to genocide, a YouGov poll found last month. A majority backsadditional sanctions. Trump’s support for forced relocations, opposition to a two-state solution and close collaboration with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader charged with war crimes, all contradict stated UK policy. Trump bears significant personal responsibility for what Starmer calls the “unspeakable and indefensible” horror in Gaza.Starmer warned dramatically last month that the UK was in growingdanger of military attackfollowing Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Britain and other Nato states have steadfastly supported Kyiv. Not so Trump. Since taking office, he has toadied to Vladimir Putin, vilified Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suspended military supplies and questioned Nato’s future. Ignoring proliferation fears, Trump is simultaneously fuelling a nuclear arms race. Now the hapless Starmer has been panicked intobuying US jetscapable of carrying warheads and, it is claimed, hassecretly allowedUS-owned nukes back into the UK. This is not the Britain Labour voters want.Trump recently reversed himself on Ukraine, patched things up with Nato and criticised Putin. But he could change his mind again tomorrow. Oblivious to the glaring double standard, he congratulates himself meanwhile on “obliterating” Iran’s nuclear facilities – even though last month’s illegal US bombing was onlypartly successful. Britain rightly favours negotiations with Tehran. It wasn’t consulted.Trump’s tariff wars pose a direct threat to the UK economy, jobs and living standards. Despite Starmer’s deal mitigating their impact,10% tariffsor higher remain on most US-bound exports. Trump’s bullying of Canada, Mexico, Greenland, Panama and others over sovereignty, migration and trade feeds uncertainty. His irrational hostility to the EU may gratify the likes of Nigel Farage (and Putin). But endless rows between important allies do not serve Britain’s interests.Trump is fighting to kill off DEI – and the corporate cowardice over Gaza shows he’s winning | Jinan YounisRead moreThe advance of hard-right, nationalist-populist parties in Europe and, most recently,in Japansuggests the socially divisive, chauvinist agendas championed by Trump’s Maga movement have widening international appeal. That augurs ill for democracy in Britain and the world generally. For the same reason, Trump’s assaults on US constitutional rights, notably minority and gender rights, attacks on judges,universitiesand public institutions, and attempts to suppress independent media scrutiny are ominous. Such toxic behaviour is contagious. Trumpism is the new Covid. Britain needs inoculation.By slashing overseas aid, cutting public service broadcasters such asVoice of America, defunding and ostracising UN agencies, flouting international courts and pretending the climate emergency is illusory, Trump inflicts immense harm on the US’s reputation, global influence and soft-power armoury. He is wrecking therules-based orderthat Britain views as fundamental. It’s a gift to China, Russia and authoritarians everywhere. As Pentagon spending rockets to$1tn annually, his crude message is unmistakeable: might makes right. Brute strength rules.Trump is a disaster for the west and all in the UK who respect progressive democratic values. His second term will evidently be moreglobally perilous, destructive and destabilising than his first. In support of universal principles established centuries before anyone heard of him, Britain should steer clear of this walking, talking catastrophe. Rather than hug Trump close, Starmer should keep him at arm’s length for fear of infection.Don’t go to Scotland to see him, Prime Minister. Don’t waste your breath. Instead, start planning for the post-special-relationship era. Make the break.

Starvation is not only the biological phenomenon of the body wasting away. It’s also the death rattle of society. Famine is the sight of people scavenging for food in a garbage heap. It’s a woman cooking in secret, hiding food from her starving cousins. It’s a family selling its grandmother’s jewellery for a single meal, their faces blank and emotionless, their eyes glazed. This is the degradation, the humiliation, the shame – and, yes, the dehumanisation – that happens when human beings scrabble for food like animals.This is a reality that no statistics can capture. And the methods for measuring food emergencies and assigning them grades – “famine” being the worst – break down when society breaks down in this way.But just as an experienced physician can diagnose a fever without having to send blood samples to the laboratory, veteran humanitarian workers, who witnessed the depths of human suffering in Biafra in 1969 or in Ethiopia in 1984, recognise these symptoms when they see them.And they see it inGazatoday.Turn to the statements of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – the US and Israel-backed organisation that began operating in May – and you enter a different world. The GHF presents itself as a professional, compassionate operation designed for the 21st century. You will see images of order and efficiency, anda proud announcementthat it delivered more than 2m meals yesterday from its four “secure distribution sites”.And alongside the pictures of those starving children, of women collapsing from hunger, there are also pictures of healthy young men. In contrast to the footage, filmed by Palestinian journalists, of the desperate scramble for the little aid still provided through the UN, the GHF hasimages of orderly distributions, of its own workers holding the hands of Palestinian children.Israeli spokespeople insistthat the United Nations has hundreds of trucks of food inside the Gaza perimeter that it refuses to distribute.But that rosy picture doesn’t stand even the simplest scrutiny. There are four reasons why it’s at best an improvisation by amateurs and at worst a cover for the crime of ongoing mass starvation.First, the numbers just don’t add up. In April, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UNcalculated the food stocksremaining in Gaza, after 18 months of siege and war, and two months of total Israeli blockade. It estimated that food availability would fall to only half what’s needed to sustain life at some point between May and July. That means that the aid effort needs to cover the entirety of Gaza’s food needs. Two million meals a day is less than half of what’s needed. The GHF rations may have slowed the march of starvation, but not by much.Second, you can’t relieve famine by numbers alone. The GHF system is like standing at the edge of a big pond and feeding the fish by throwing breadcrumbs. Who gets to eat its rations?Starvation strikes the vulnerable minority. The metric used by the UN for determining when acute food insecurity isat famine levelsis when 20% of families are facing extreme food shortage. Starvation strikes the weakest, not the strongest.Over the decades, humanitarian programmes have worked out how best to target the poorest, such as women without their husbands, looking after several children and perhaps elderly parents as well. It’s the last mile of aid delivery that counts.The GHF runs four ration stations. Three are in the far south of Gaza in the ruins of Rafah, one in central Gaza. They’re all in military zones. They open for short periods and short notice. To get these rations, people must camp out in the rubble – ready to rush to the gates at a moment’s notice, and running the gauntlet of the Israel Defense Forces’ military posts. They know that the only means IDF soldiers have for crowd control is firing live ammunition – even when they’re not shooting to kill.When the GHF speaks of “secure distribution sites”, it’s referring to how it controls its packages up to the point of handing them over, not to how it safely delivers them to the neediest. Dozens of aid seekers are killed each day trying to reach these sites.The Guardian view on starvation in Gaza: it will take more than words to halt Israel’s genocide | EditorialRead moreHow will the overstressed mother of hungry children, or elderly or disabled people, join this stampede? How would they run the gauntlet not only of those military posts but also of the gangsters keen to steal the most valuable foodstuffs for themselves, or to sell in the market? The GHF has no idea who is eating the rations. Theirs isn’t a formula for feeding the poorest. It’s the law of the jungle.Third, the assistance must be designed for what people really need. Top of the list are specialised foods to care for malnourished children who cannot consume regular meals, such as Plumpy’Nut, a ready-to-use therapeutic food.The GHF ration boxtypically containsflour, pasta, tahini, cooking oil, rice and chickpeas or lentils. No baby food. No Plumpy’Nut. And it has no trained nurses or nutritionists in the community to actually provide therapeutic care to starving children.Consider the desperate mother who’s literally at the end of the food chain: how will she cook the rations she gets? How does she find clean water? Israel hasreduced water availabilityto a small fraction of need, and isbombing the remaining desalination plants. What can she use to make a fire? Without electricity or cooking gas, she may burn garbage to heat food.And last and most tellingly, a truly humanitarian operation supports the afflicted people, respecting the dignity of those in need, working with the communities. The GHF, essentially, does the opposite: it humiliates and undermines.The social breakdown that we are witnessing, the degrading of human beings, is not a byproduct of the harm that Israel is inflicting. That’s the central element of the crime: destroying Palestinian society. The government of Israel shows no indication that it cares in the slightest whether Palestinians live or die. It wants to avoid the stigma of being accused of starvation and genocide, and the GHF is its current alibi.

In this story, trotted out occasionally since 2016 to reassure those who are worried about Donald Trump’s influence, the private and public bodies of American commerce, governance, healthcare and education are possessed of uncommonly robust internal accountability mechanisms, rock-hard rectitude, and a coolly rational self-interest. Trump can only do so much damage to America’s economy, culture and way of life, it was reasoned, because these institutions would not bend to his will. They would resist him; they would check his excesses. When forced to choose, as it was always accepted that they one day would be, between Trump’s demands and their own principles and purposes, the institutions would always choose themselves.This week put another nail into the coffin of this idea, revealing its valorization of American institutions to be shortsighted and naive. The latest intrusion of reality comes in the form of adeal that Columbia University madewith the Trump administration, in which the university made a host of academic, admissions and governance concessions to the Trump regime andagreed to pay a $200m finein order to restore its federal research funding. The deal marks the formal end of Columbia’s academic independence and the dawn of a new era of regulation by deal making, repression and bribery in the field of higher education.The story goes like this. After Columbia became the centerpiece of a nationwide movement of campus encampments in protest of the Israeli genocide in Gaza, the university administration began a frantic and at times sadistic crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus speech in an effort to appease congressional Republicans, who had gleefully seized upon the protests to make cynical and unfounded accusations that the universities were engaged in antisemitism. Columbia invited police on to its campus, who rounded up protesting students in mass arrests. This showed that the university would bend to Republican pressure, but did nothing to satisfy its Republican adversaries – who demanded more and more from Columbia, making their attacks on the university the center of their broader war on education, diversity and expertise.When theTrump administrationwas restored to power in January, the White House partnered with the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Justice to exert further pressure on Columbia, looking to exert a level of control over the university’s internal operations that is unprecedented for a private institution. This time, the university’s vast federal research funding – issued in the form of grants that enable university scientists, doctors and academics to make discoveries and pursue knowledge that has enormous implications for American commerce, health and wellbeing – was held hostage. Facing the end of its functioning as a university, Columbia capitulated and went to what was euphemistically called “the negotiating table” – really, an exchange on the precise terms of its extortion.The deal that resulted gives the Trump administration everything it wants. A Trump-approved monitor will now have the right to review Columbia’s admissions records, with the express intent of enforcing a supreme court ban on affirmative action – in other words, ensuring that the university does not admit what the Trump administration deems to be too many non-white students. The Middle Eastern studies department is subject to monitoring, as well, afteran agreement in March.The agreement is not a broad-level, generally applicable regulatory endeavor that applies to other universities – although given the scope of the administration’s ambitions at Columbia, it is hard to say whether such a regulatory regime would be legal. Instead, it is an individual, backroom deal, one that disregards the institution’s first amendment rights and the congressionally mandated protections for its grants in order to proceed with a shakedown. “The agreement,” writes the Columbia Law School professorDavid Pozen, “gives legal form to an extortion scheme.” The process was something akin to a mob boss demanding protection money from a local business. “Nice research university you have here,” the Trump administration seemed to say to Columbia. “Would be a shame if something were to happen to it.”That Columbia folded, and sacrificed its integrity, reputation and the freedom of its students and faculty for the federal money, speaks to both the astounding lack of foresight and principle by the university leadership as well as the Trump movement’s successful foreclosure of institutions’ options for resistance. With the federal judiciary full of Trump appointees – and the supreme court showing itself willing to radically expand executive powers and rapidly diminish the rights of other parties in its eagerness to facilitate Trump’s agenda – there is little hope for Columbia, or the other universities that will inevitably be next, to successfully litigate their way out of the administration’s threats. But nor does capitulation seem likely to put an end to the Trump administration’s demands. The installation of an administration-approved monitor seems poised to offer a toehold from which the government will impose more and more limitations on scholarship, speech and association. There is, after all, no limiting principle to the Trump administration’s absolutist expansion of its own prerogatives, and no way for Columbia to ensure that its funding won’t becut off again. The university, in time, will become more what Trump makes it than what its students do.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is likely to use its experience at Columbia as a template to extract substantive concessions and big payouts from other institutions. And these are not just limited to universities. On Thursday, the day after Columbia’s capitulation, theFederal Communications Commission approved the mergerof Paramount and Skydance. The pending merger – and the Trump administration’s threat to squash it – had been a rumored motivation for CBS’s decision to pay Trump millions to settle a frivolous defamation suit; it was also rumored to have caused an outcry at the CBS news magazine program 60 Minutes and the end of the evening talkshow The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, when writers, journalists, and performers on those shows stood by their critical coverage of the president or mocked the deal their bosses paid him. The shakedown, after all, is a tactic that lots of institutions are vulnerable to, and Trump is already using it effectively to stifle some of the most visible forms of dissent. The institutions are not standing firm against him; they are capitulating. They are choosing their short-term interest over their long-term integrity.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsColumbia UniversityOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS universitiescommentShareReuse this content"

Far-right activists have become involved in promoting them online and have been present, in some cases clashing with police.Last summer’s riots spread across the country in response to the murder of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on 29 July. Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, were murdered by Axel Rudakubana, who has been jailed for a minimum of 52 years.Last year’s unrest in England ‘has caused lasting harm to communities’Read moreThe Guardian’s data was obtained through FoI requests sent to 21 police forces covering the 27 towns and cities across England and Northern Ireland where riots took place.The 27 towns were identified as sites of significant disorder in aHouse of Commons briefing documentin September. Between 30 July and 7 August 2024, an estimated 29 anti-immigration demonstrations and riots took place. Many of these were violent, with participants attacking mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers.In Bristol, where there were 60 arrests, more than two-thirds of those arrested had been the subject of a previous domestic abuse report.In Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, Cleveland police reported there had been 107 arrests, 44 of whom had been subject to a prior domestic abuse report.In Rotherham, where rioters set fire to an asylum hotel, 75 people were arrested, 35 of whom had been reported for domestic abuse, South Yorkshire police said.Joshua Lane, a 27-year-old former serviceman who threw missiles at police guarding the hotel, pleaded guilty to violent disorder. He had previously received a suspended sentence for stalking, battery and criminal damage.There were 91 arrests in Sunderland where rioters set fire to cars, a building and attacked a mosque. Of those, 38 were subject to a prior domestic abuse report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What can be done to prevent them reoffending?Read moreOne of the first arrests by Merseyside police for participation in the Southport riot was made after a suspect in a domestic incident was identified by officers based on footage from the previous day’s violent disorder.Merseyside police arrested 160 people after days of disturbances in Liverpool and Southport, but did not provide the Guardian with a number of prior domestic abuse reports because of prohibitive costs.Gareth Metcalfe, 44, described by a judge as “at the forefront of the disorder” in Southport, had previous convictions including sexual assault and breach of a non-molestation order.In Hull, where 47 of the 151 people arrested had been reported for prior domestic abuse, Ethan Armstrong, 26, who was jailed for violent disorder, had previously been convicted for causing actual bodily harm after repeatedly punching an ex-girlfriend.The Metropolitan police said there were 165 arrests in Whitehall last summer in connection to the riots, 48 of whom had previously been reported for domestic abuse.This information provided by police forces indicates overlaps between public violent disorder and domestic violence and abuse.Outcomes for reports held by police indicate that less than a quarter of individuals had been charged for any of the domestic abuse offences for which they were a suspect.Isabella Lowenthal-Isaacs, the policy manager at Women’s Aid, said: “A year on from the terrible Southport attacks on young girls, and as conversation about far-right protests once again starts to appear in the media, it is tempting to treat these events as isolated.“However, the reality is that these acts of violence are part of a wider pattern rooted in the same dynamics that drive domestic abuse and violence against women and girls: control, coercion, and misogyny.”The National Police Chiefs’ Council indicates that by May, a total of 1,840 arrests had been made in relation to the disorder and there were 1,103 charges related to the violence, most of which were serious public order offences.Most of those charged have come from the 20% most deprived neighbourhoods. Analysis of the Crime Survey for England and Wales data also shows that in the areas where riots took place, there is a higher prevalence of domestic abuse incidents (39 per 1,000 people) compared with the rest of the country (27 per 1,000 people).In Middlesbrough, a protest that began as two minutes’ silence for the three lives lost ended in a 1,000-strong riot as homes and cars were damaged, with ‘race checkpoints’ set up for drivers.A recent report from the home affairs committee into the police response to the rioting called on the police forces to develop greater capacity to monitor and respond to social media. It also recommended the government set out ambitious reforms to meet its commitment to halve violence against women and girls.A Home Office spokesperson said:“The scale of violence and abuse suffered by women and girls in this country is nothing less than a national emergency.“That’s why we have pledged to halve violence against women and girls in a decade, and will set out our transformative strategy to achieve that goal in the coming months.”Explore more on these topicsDomestic violencePoliceSouthport attackProtestRaceImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

The obstructionsled to mass protestsfrom which the recall movement was born. The KMT are likely to be emboldened by their resounding victory on Saturday.A flipping of just six KMT seats in Taiwan’s 113-seat legislature could have freed up president Lai Ching-te and the DPP’s agenda, but would also very likely draw increased hostility from China’s ruling Communist party, which despises Lai and his party, considering them “separatists” foropposing its plan to annex Taiwan.Seven seats are still to vote on their recall motions in coming weeks, but Saturday’s losses will put the pressure on the campaigners to get six to vote “agree”.On Saturday night, Lai urged people to accept the results of the vote, saying it was “not a victory for one party, nor a defeat for the other”, but a demonstration of democracy.“After today, we still have many challenges, but we must prove to the world that Taiwan is a country that is capable of resolving internal disputes with a constitutional system, and is also a country that can unite each other with a democratic spirit after competition,” he said.The KMT praised the result as a decisive rejection of DPP efforts to “overturn” an election. It also urged people not to see it “as a signal on cross-Strait or foreign policy, nor should it be interpreted through the lens of ‘pro-China’ or ‘pro-Taiwan’ alignment”.“We stand with the people of Taiwan in their call for stability, competence and inclusive governance,” it said.William Yang, a senior north-east Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group, said the recall campaign had deepened divisions in Taiwan.“All sides, including all political parties in Taiwan, will need to seriously reflect on the process of this recall campaign and think about how they may be able to find common ground on issues that are key to Taiwan’s security and prosperity,” he said.Total recall? Campaigners employ quirk of Taiwan’s political system to turn on ‘pro-China’ candidatesRead moreYang said it also raised questions about the DPP using the threat posed by China in election campaigning, “at least at a local level”.“China may view Saturday’s result as a sign that more Taiwanese people are not in favour of the ‘China threat’ rhetoric promoted by [Lai and the DPP], and this may make them feel like peaceful unification remains a viable option for them to resolve the ultimate ‘Taiwan question’,” Yang said.“However, this doesn’t also mean that Beijing would dial down the level of military and political pressure that they are imposing on Taiwan.”The unprecedented vote hasfired up the island’s population, just 18 months after a national election. Large rallies were held in Taipei on the eve of the vote, with tens of thousands turning out to support both sides.At an emotional DPP rally on Saturday, the campaign volunteer Julia Lin told the Guardian she was concerned the KMT would now feel “invincible”.“Their actions have been extremely reckless, and they’ve lost the democratic values and legal knowledge that legislators in Taiwan should have,” she said.“We didn’t succeed, but I believe we still need to keep trying to get our voices out there and attract more people to get involved to care about what’s happening in Taiwan right now.”View image in fullscreenA child cheers as supporters of the Kuomintang party attend a rally against the recall campaign before Saturday’s vote.Photograph: Annabelle Chih/ReutersThe pro-recall campaign was driven by civil society groups and activists, but was subsequently endorsed by the DPP. They had aimed to oust as many as 31 KMT legislators who, they say, are pro-China actors who have risked Taiwan’s national security.The KMT denies the accusations. They, like the DPP, oppose annexation by the Communist party of China (CCP), but say the best way to protect the status quo is through friendlier ties with Beijing. The party and its supporters have labelled the recall campaign an anti-democratic power-grab by people who won’t accept the results of last year’s election.Retaliatory campaigns against DPP seats by the KMT all failed, with dozens of officials arrested over allegedly faking signatures.Beijing has also denounced the recall campaign. The Taiwan affairs office previouslyaccused Lai of being a dictator and seeking to achieve “one-party dominance”.Taiwan’s mainland affairs council this week said it was “evident and clear” that the CCP was trying to interfere in Taiwan’s democratic process.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Vathrakoyannis said: “There have been reports of damages. We will take stock when the fires have been put out.”“The real difficulties are ahead of us,” he said, adding that Greece has asked for six firefighting planes from the European Union’s civil protection mechanism.On site, 145 firefighters and 44 fire engines, 10 firefighting planes and seven helicopters were attempting to put out the fire, the origin of which is unknown. Four ambulances were treating at least five residents, most of them elderly with respiratory problems.Temperatures reaching, or exceeding, 38C, dry conditions and high winds are fanning the flames.Vathrakoyannis said that under such conditions wildfires “expand very quickly and become dangerous. These conditions are expected to prevail over the coming days.”The fire service is also dealing with three other major fires in the south-west on Greece’s two largest islands – Crete in the south and Evia north of Athens – and also on the island of Kythera, north-west of Crete. At least 335 firefighters, 19 planes and 13 helicopters are involved, but can only operate in daylight. In total, 52 wildfires broke out across the country over the past 24 hours, Vathrakoyannis said.Wildfires, many of them destructive, have become a common occurrence in Greece in recent years. Several have broken out in the past month.A fire also hit the south of France late on Saturday, spreading towards a beach resort and forcing the evacuation of two campgrounds and some local housing.Driven by strong winds, the fire in the Aude region on the Mediterranean coast near the Spanish border had already burned through 600 hectares (1,500 acres) after breaking out earlier in the afternoon, local officials said.Some 630 firefighters backed by about a dozen planes were battling the fire, according to Aude’s deputy prefect Rémi Recio.Flames destroyed two houses and officials converted a gymnasium into a shelter, although the residents of about 10 evacuated houses were later allowed to return home.Three firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation.The fire comes less than a month after the Aude region was hit by a major blaze that swept through 2,100 hectares (5,200 acres) near Narbonne, mobilising 1,000 firefighters.Explore more on these topicsGreeceWildfiresEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His oft-cited remark was supposedly made in 1918 in reference to the first world war, which had by then caused millions of human casualties.More than a century later, truth is again caught in the crossfire, this time as a casualty of 21st-century culture wars.If Donald Trump is the high priest of disinformation, thenNigel Farage, the leader of Reform, is showing signs of being a willing disciple, if his behaviour in the UK this week is anything to go by.Farage has proposed sending prisoners abroad – including to El Salvador, where theTrump administration has sent hundreds of deporteesand suggested sending US citizens. He also suggested an extensive police recruitment drive and prison-building programme all while cutting health and education spending.The parroting of Trump’s policies by a UK populist has not gone unnoticed in the US. And for those who have studied the president’s modus operandi, there is one particular tactic the British public should be braced for: the blizzard of lies and false statements that frequently overwhelms his opponents.The Trump experience, they say, contains sobering lessons for Farage’s critics.US pro-democracy campaigners says Trump has become even harder to factcheck since his first term, thanks to a combination of factors including looser social media content moderation and a reluctance among some media owners to stand up to his intimidation.The Washington Post, which tracked more than 30,000 lies or misleading statements from Trump during his presidency, lost subscribers and public trust after its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, reportedly vetoed an editorial endorsing the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president.“It’s become more difficult because there’s less commitment from those who are in the best position to do the factchecking,” said Omar Noureldin, a senior vice-president for Common Cause, a non-partisan group. “Seeking the truth here comes with costs and risks.”Complicating matters is the loss of trust in institutions, with many consumers relying on social media platforms for news.“Even the best factchecking can be unpersuasive, because we’re not just facing an information crisis here, but also a trust crisis in the American information ecosystem,” Noureldin said.Media watchers say the political environment has become so deeply polarised that factchecking can even have the counter-productive effect of further entrenching misplaced beliefs.“From a lot of research, we’re reaching the conclusion that factchecking hasn’t been as effective as one would want,” said Julie Millican, the vice-president of Media Matters for America, a media watchdog.“One reason is that information and disinformation spreads faster than you can check it. It takes a lot longer to factcheck something than it does for it go viral.“But the other thing is factchecking can backfire. People so distrust institutions that factchecking can validate the misinformation in their minds and make them more inclined to believe the lie they believed in the first place.”A2022 report from Protect Democracysuggests this is the result of a deliberate strategy of authoritarian regimes.“Disinformation is spread through coordinated networks, channels and ecosystems, including politically aligned or state-owned media,” the report said. “The goal is not always to sell a lie, but instead to undermine the notion that anything in particular is true.”Further complicating the problem in the US has been Trump’s appointment of allies to key government agencies that have traditionally served as sources of accurate and reliable data for factcheckers.A case in point is Robert F Kennedy Jr, who hasengaged in anti-vaccine theories. As Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, he is in charge of the country’s vast health bureaucracy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A prime purpose would be to increase media literacy among young people, who primarily get news from platforms such asTikTokwhich can be subject to disinformation tools such as AI-manipulated videos. The aim is to teach consumers how to spot doctored footage.“Media literacy is extremely important and something that should be invested in and taught at a young age,” said Millican.Another solution is the development of “pre-buttal” strategies to inoculate the public against disinformation, in effect getting the truth out first.Media Matters for America and Common Cause used this approach during last year’s presidential election, partly by producing videos designed to counter anticipated false narratives surrounding voting procedures in certain areas.Also important, said Shalini Agarwal, special counsel at Protect Democracy, is calling out the demonisation of vulnerable groups, such as immigrants, as soon as it happens.‘People have seen through him and he’s not welcome’: Scotland tees up for Trump visitRead moreA crucial role is played by media, even as Trump intensifies his assault on journalists as “fake news” and tries to exclude certain established outlets from press briefings.“It’s really important when there are opportunities for one-on-one briefings and there are multiple reporters,” Agarwal said. “Part of it is a sense of collective action. Often, whoever is speaking at the podium won’t give a straightforward answer or gives a false answer and then tries to move on – it’s incumbent when that happens for other reporters to jump in and say: ‘Wait. What about what the other reporter asked?’”Millican has two pieces of advice for Britain and other European countries hoping to arm themselves against any coming authoritarian onslaught: fortify the media and preserve legislation designed to combat disinformation and illegal content online – represented by the online safety act in Britain and the digital safety act in the EU.“The first thing that’s going to happen in these authoritarian takeovers is they’re going to try to silence and take over the media and information landscape,” she said. “Any efforts to rein in hate speech or misinformation on platforms will be seen as tantamount to suppression of conservative thought or free speech.“I can’t stress enough trying to buffer the pollution of your information ecosystem as much as possible. One of the first things that they’re going to do is just take down any barriers they can.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsDonald TrumpNigel FarageTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many of these have been linked to harmful effects on human health and the natural environment.The fairest way to deal with this, Sir Jon Cunliffe, a former Bank ofEnglanddeputy governor, said, could be to apply the “polluter pays” principle, whereby the company behind the pollution contributes towards its removal. “The alternative is for everyone to pay for it through their bills, and the question is, should we spread that among everybody, or should we go through a polluter pays route? So I think, really, we should look at those routes,” he said.It has been a landmark week for the water sector, afterCunliffe published a major reviewcontaining recommendations on how to clean up England’s filthy rivers and seas. The regulatorOfwat is to be abolished, the government has pledged, and a new, powerful, super-regulator created to better hold water companies to account.Campaigners welcomed many of the recommendations, in particular ending the self-monitoring of water companies, which currently voluntarily publish information on how much sewage they dump. Citizen scientists have argued for years that this system is open to under-counting, and have tried to shed light on the true amount of human waste in waterways: under new proposals sewage spills will be automatically published online.But there are those who felt this was a missed opportunity. The environment secretary, Steve Reed,took nationalisation out of the scopeof the review from the outset, and also told Cunliffe not to consider more radical approaches such as turning companies into not-for-profits. This despite the fact that it is the mismanagement of water companies as much as the dumping of sewage that has enraged the public.So what of the idea that polluters – the upstream companies that generate some of the worst pollutants in our waterways such as wet wipes and Pfas – should pay? “One of the best ways to deal with stuff not going into our rivers is not to let it into the sewers in the first place,” Cunliffe said, “Why do we need wet wipes?”View image in fullscreenSewage floats on the River Thames in Datchet, Berkshire.Photograph: Maureen McLean/Alamy“I have some sympathy for the water companies,” he said, “because the drinking water system is closed and no one can touch it unless authorised to do so. The wastewater system is open. Anybody can put anything down the loo, and then at the treatment works, I’ve seen literally huge machines taking wet wipe mountains out of the sewage system.”Water companies claim that wet wipes, which shed microplastic particles and also build up into major blockages, are the main cause of sewage pollution. John Penicud, Southern Water’s managing director for wastewater, said recently that “the majority of wastewater pollutions are caused by wet wipes, fats, oils and grease being flushed down toilets and sinks”, and called for wet wipes to be banned.The EU is introducing quaternary treatment, a more advanced method than that used in the UK. This has powerful filters that remove these trace chemicals from the water supply, but is expensive, so the bloc is looking at making the producers of these chemicals pay a levy that would then be used to create these treatment plants. Producers would be required to cover at least 80% of the costs associated with the sewage treatment upgrades necessary for removing these substances from wastewater.Cunliffe thinks the UK could look at adopting a similar approach for wet wipes; as a side-effect this would make plastic wet wipes more expensive, which would discourage their use. His report has recommended looking at adopting the EU laws in the UK, and investigating the prevalence and impact of these micropollutants in the environment and on human health.This way, he says, “it’s not the water bill payer who pays to take it out, but the people who make and buy the products … Pfas and so on will require quaternary treatment, and there are currently three levels of sewage treatment. To build another would be expensive.” The question, he said, was whether the user or the polluter paid.A Water UK spokesperson said: “Removing Pfas ‘forever chemicals’ and other micropollutants from the water environment is a huge challenge because current sewage technology was never designed to deal with them. We need a national plan from government for upgrading sewage treatment that is paid for by chemical manufacturers instead of water bill payers, as well as a ban on Pfas products that will otherwise keep making the problem worse.”Explore more on these topicsPollutionRiversChemical industryWater industryEnglandWaternewsShareReuse this content"

Invented in 2008, it was intended as a competition to encourage people to clean up public spaces. It is now played in schools across the country as people gamify collecting rubbish.Sarah Parry, a 29-year-old doctor from Glasgow, is part of the reigning world champion team. The British team beat the Japanese in Tokyo in 2023, the last time the competition was held, when she and her two teammates managed to bag 61lbs (28kg) more rubbish than the host country.The teams have 45 minutes to collect as much litter as possible, then 20 minutes to sort their litter. Teams are awarded points based on the type of litter and its recycling category.Parry is competitive and has run 33 marathons, so when she stumbled across this sport by chance after her brother saw an advertisement for it, she got a team together and signed up to go to Japan.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Japan team carrying plastic bags of rubbish during the final stage of the Spogomi World Cup in 2023.Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images“We are not avid litter-picker-uppers in our free time – it was luck, competitiveness and enthusiasm more than anything else,” she said.Parry will be in Hackney picking up litter this Sunday, but is not allowed to compete officially because the winners of the previous competition are not allowed to win in consecutive years. She is just doing it to see how much litter she can bag up.Litter-picking may sound like a peaceful pursuit, but it can be strenuous.“It is very physically difficult,” Parry said. “I have run 33 marathons and the sorest my legs have ever been is after winning the Spogomi World Cup two years ago.“It’s a lot of very fast walking and you are carrying a lot of awkward-shaped items and using different muscle groups, and it’s heavy litter and it was very hot in Tokyo when we competed. We collected over 50kg so you have to carry that between you while power-walking through a busy urban area.”View image in fullscreenPlayers in costume competing at spogomi in Tokyo this year.Photograph: Takashi Aoyama/Getty ImagesParry said spogomi was unlike any other sport: “It is very fun. You don’t often get the chance to play sport in a busy urban area where the people around you don’t know or understand what you are doing and why you are so excited to spot a glass bottle.”But more seriously, she said, it drew attention to a very important issue: the blight of litter plaguing Britain’s streets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We realised we are walking around constantly blind to this litter problem. When you notice it, it’s all you can see. I see it everywhere now, I just constantly see litter. It just opens your eyes to it.”Though the sport was conceived in Japan, she says the country has far less of a litter problem than the UK: “The UK is so much dirtier than Japan because I guess in Japan there is a very altruistic community where people care about their environment.

Thats what’s really nice about the sport,” Parry said.“What spogomi does is tap into people who aren’t eco-minded, turns it into a game, makes it competitive. I pick up more litter than I did before.”Parry has some pointers for the competitors this year: “My tips would be: taking it seriously, viewing it as a sport, being competitive and pushing yourself are important. If you are dawdling around picking up litter you’re not going to win. Just because it’s litter-picking doesn’t mean you can’t push your body physically.”Explore more on these topicsWasteJapannewsShareReuse this content"

About 5,133 tonnes are expected by the end of August, up significantly from almost 4,187 tonnes by the same point last year.Sales of the spherical fruit are already 9% ahead year on year as growing awareness of the health properties and a healthy crop bolster demand.Daniel Martin, the group commercial director at S&A Produce, says: “This blueberry season has seen a really positive early start, about two weeks ahead of schedule, thanks to strong light levels and an absence of rain.“As a result, we’re seeing excellent fruit size and nice, even ripening across the crop. In summary, we are optimistic about the season and expect to see excellent flavour and shelf life from this year’s crop.”The harvest is also being aided by new technology as growers invest in automated picking and other methods to reduce labour costs and improve efficiency.Jim Floor, the managing director of Hall Hunter, one of the UK’s leading blueberry growers, said the company now used machines to harvest 10% of its crop, and this was expected to rise to 30% next year – with the rest picked by hand.Blueberries are leading the technology push, with the more delicate strawberries, raspberries and blackberries now all picked by hand at Hall Hunter.“When it comes to robotic fruit picking, we’re seeing steady and encouraging progress from robotics and automation companies. However, the technology isn’t quite ready for widespread commercial adoption just yet,” Floor said.The blockbuster blueberry summer comes hot on the heels of aperfect spring for strawberries.The sunny, very dry spring, with thewarmest start to May on record, led to a glut of early strawberries, aubergines and tomatoes at the start of May.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the average was a more modest 30g.Nick Marston, the chair of the industry body British Berry Growers, said that all UK berry crops, including strawberries, raspberries and blackberries, were up by about 25% so far thanks to “cracking weather” in June that had helped ripen crops that had developed well during the cooler start to the spring. “The weather has been very beneficial for all berry crops,” he said.However, Marston said it was not clear if the overall berry harvest for the year would be up by that amount as some fruit would have just have been harvested earlier than usual and picking might tail off depending on conditions.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryFruitFarmingFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

What format it takes, whether a sequel to the feature film, series or alternative, will be decided in due course.“I am so happy to be here in Basel for the Euros, the atmosphere is amazing,” said Chadha. “What I can share with you today is my very clear wish to bring the beloved characters from Bend It Like Beckham back to you and audiences globally very, very soon. Women’s football is more competitive, more exciting, and more global than ever. It is an honor for me to be a small part of it.”Chadha, who has fielded requests for a return of the story for years but has waited for the right plot to come to her so as to not tarnish the legacy of the original, added: “After 23 years and being unable to come up with a storyline that was as good as the original, I have finally found a fantastic story for aBend It Like Beckham follow up.”Released in 2002,Bend It Like Beckhamshowed football obsessed Jesminder “Jess” Bhamra balance joining the Hounslow Harriers and finding herself on the pitch while grappling with family, cultural and societal expectations of what a Punjabi British girl should be. It was a huge box office hit and is the only film distributed in every country in the world, including North Korea.“The original film, for me, was about lifting up girls and saying you can do and be anything you want, even though society dictates what you can and can’t do,” said Chadha, who has also confirmed US women’s national team manager,Emma Hayes, is collaborating on the new project. “That message is still relevant today. Even though women’s football rides so high around the world, and that’s amazing and it’s wonderful that the original film has been part of that legacy, I feel there is more that I can do and so that’s what I’m writing. It will be hard hitting, of course, but it will also be incredibly joyous, how can it not be as a follow up to Bend It Like Beckham?”View image in fullscreenEmma Hayes will act as a collaborator on the new film.Photograph: Daniel Cole/AP“I’m super excited to have connected with Emma who, when I first met her, said: ‘On my god, I was Keira Knightley, that was me!’ I know all the amazing work that she is doing both in front and behind the scenes for women’s football, so have brought her on board as a collaborator as I write the script which I’m working on right now.”Hayes, who won seven league titles, two League Cups and five FA Cups with Chelsea beforemoving into international football, winning Olympic gold two months after taking up her post, said: “I met Gurinder at a chance meeting in Cannes in June. It felt like the stars aligned for us to meet. I told her the massive impact the film had had on me when I was younger and that I was Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. I cried in the cinema watching the film because I felt just like Jess and Jules.”Hayes moved to the US early on in her career in search of greater opportunities and professionalism in the women’s game and it played a pivotal role in her development. “There was no hope for women’s football in Britain then, so I was going to the US to try my luck there,” said Hayes. “I could never have dreamed of how much that film helped change the women’s game. Now, I have the best job in world football as head coach of the US women’s national team. Like I said, the stars aligned and now I’m helping Gurinder with all my experience and insight in the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, at just 19 years old, she no longer finds herself retrieving balls that have veered out of play, but is an integral part of the team she once admired from the sidelines.The forward, who football fans hope will be showing off her on-pitch magic on Sunday as the Lionesses’ face off against Spain in theEuros 2025final, began her journey to the top of the sport in her Essex home town of South Ockendon.It all started at Brandon Groves AFC in 2011, where a five-year-old Agyemang took her first steps into the sport. She was talented, determined and, at the time, the only girl at the club, which has run in the area for 29 years. She played there for two seasons before being picked up by the Arsenal Academy.England v Spain: where the Women’s Euro 2025 final could be won or lostRead moreColin Burnham, a coach at the club, called her success “fantastic”.He told ITV News: “She’s an inspiration to some of the youngsters we’ve got here at the moment. It’s nice to say that from grassroots level you can still go somewhere with football.”He said “the players and the kids” will be watching the final where, they hope, celebration will be abound. “Hopefully she’ll come and visit us so we can celebrate personally with her,” he said.Another club representativesaidit felt “amazing knowing we have a Lioness playing in the Euros”, adding they were “proud to say Michelle started at our club”.In April, she was called upon to join the Lionesses’ after Alessia Russo suffered an injury. This is when her journey to the top of the sport really took off. She scored three goals in her first four England caps, including equalisers in the last two Euros matches.Her talents are not only athletic. She is also studying business management at King’s College London, as part of its sport and wellness programme. She was “brought up on gospel music” and is a keen piano-player. So keen, in fact, that after England’s win against Sweden,she had it brought over.“The kitman brought it over in a van. It’s calm and relaxing,” she said. “Lotte [Wubben-Moy, her Arsenal and England teammate] asked me to play for her – she came to my room and I played a few things for her, which was nice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jason Carey, headteacher at Southend High School for Girls, where the footballer was a student, said: “We are incredibly proud of Michelle.

Her dedication, resilience and pursuit of excellence were evident even during her time with us.“Those qualities have clearly carried through in her sporting career. She remains an inspiration to current and future students, especially young women in sport. We can’t wait now for the final.”As Sunday approaches, home town glory is heating up in South Ockendon. In the Knight of Aveley pub, posters are plastered on the wall calling on locals to “get down and cheer on Michelle”, who they called their “very own South Ockendon girl”.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

They then launched a second attack with mortars and grenade launchers on the courthouse, where a clash began with security forces that lasted three hours, according to the Baluch human rights group Haalvsh.Three gunmen were killed in the clash, Iran’s state news agency said.State media said several people injured in the attack were in critical condition and had been transferred to local hospitals.Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on Telegram and told civilians to evacuate the area “for their safety”. Residents reported hearing several explosions and gunfire, while some roads that led to the courthouse were closed, Haalvsh reported.Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, has had an ongoing insurgency for the past two decades. It is home to Iran’s Sunni Baluch minority, who have advocated for autonomy and have long maintained that they experience marginalisation and exclusion under the Iranian government.The insurgency is part of a greater insurgency in Balochistan, which includes the Pakistani province of Balochistan. It is waged by Islamic militant groups and separatists and has included attacks which have wounded civilians as well as state security personnel in both countries.Jaish al-Adl is one of the Islamist militant groups in the province, and has been fighting Iranian security forces since 2014. Iranian authorities have designated the organisation a terrorist group and have accused Pakistan and Israel of backing the group.The group carried out an attack on a police station in Sistan-Baluchestan province in December 2023, killing 11 people. An attack by the group on Iranian border guards in January 2024 led to Iran striking Pakistan, saying it was targeting a Jaish al-Adl cell in the country.The Iranian government has accused the insurgency movement of being funded by foreign actors and of engaging in illegal smuggling operations.The deputy police chief of Sistan-Baluchestan province, Sardar Alireza Deliri, described Jaish al-Adl on Saturday as being affiliated with “Zionists”, referring to Israel. He said the three militants killed were the only ones involved in the attack and claimed they were wearing undetonated suicide belts.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The blast was said to have caused a “deafening noise” heard over a radius of more than 1km.“I woke up because of the very loud bang of the explosion,” Tzetno Kelo, who lives in an adjacent building, said. “Shattered glass from a window fell on my bed and I was covered in blood.” He was treated at a hospital before being discharged.Sofia Hatzigeorgiou, 88, who lives alone, told the Greek media outlet DNews that she had got up and discovered her house had become a “summer house”: a huge hole had opened up in the wall between her mezzanine flat and the building where the bomb had been placed.View image in fullscreenLocal people woke up in the middle of the night after hearing the blast.Photograph: Alexandros Avramidis/ReutersThe windows of neighbouring buildings were also damaged in the blast. Local media reports suggest the bomb was a “fairly simple device” triggered by a standard detonator.Police told Associated Press reporters that a witness saw a man walking in the street shortly before the explosion and they were focusing their efforts on criminal gangs rather than terror groups.Varsamis has worked for many years at Diavata prison, west of Thessaloniki, known for housing many criminal gang members as well as convicted terrorists.A spokesperson for the Hellenic police force confirmed that its organised crime unit was leading the preliminary investigation into the incident.Firefighters, an ambulance and dozens of police officers, including anti-terrorism specialists, attended the scene. Footage of the incident showed crowds of people standing outside the building in the middle of the night, some in their nightwear and slippers. One woman carefully made her way across shards of glass, carrying a cat.The Thessaloniki MP, Stratos Simopoulos, told DNews he had rushed to the scene of the explosion to support Varsamis, who is a friend of his: “He has my full support, because a few weeks ago, I too received the same cowardly attack. His was much more violent.“Public officials, who perform their duty without compromise, may be on the frontlines of the threat from such terrorist and criminal actions. I absolutely believe that they do not flinch,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But American manufacturers will find it no easy task convincing Japanese drivers to choose what they see as oversized, unreliable gas-guzzlers.Announcing the agreement – which includes 15% tariffs on imports fromJapan, including cars – Trump posted: “Perhaps most importantly, Japan will open their country to trade including cars and trucks, rice and certain other agricultural products.”Earlier this month, the US president had complained: “We didn’t give them one car in 10 years – they send out millions but they won’t take any of ours.”The US claims Japan uses non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to keep out American cars. Japan imported 16,707 American vehicles in 2024, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association (JAIA).Trump announces Japan trade deal as doubt cast over future of PM IshibaRead moreEuropean brands, led by Mercedes-Benz and other German automakers, sold more than 250,000 into the same market, which overall is dominated by Japan’s huge domestic auto industry.“We don’t receive any requests from our member companies to address non-tariff barrier issues,” said the JAIA’s Sho Matsumoto. Takeshi Miyao, head of the Carnorama auto consultancy’s Tokyo office, also says no such hurdles exist for US imports.“There are non-tariff barriers on rice [another sticking point in the trade negotiations], because the government feels it has to protect Japanese farmers, but not on vehicles,” he says.View image in fullscreenFord F-150 pickup trucks on the assembly line at the Dearborn truck plant in Michigan.Photograph: Rebecca Cook/ReutersUS manufacturers like GM and Ford simply don’t focus on the Japanese market, according to Miyao.“They don’t really do any marketing, and often don’t even offer right-hand drive models. So the cars don’t sell.”Size is also a problem, Miyao notes. The Ford F-150 pickup is around six metres long and 2 metres high. That kind of vehicular behemoth is particularly ill suited to Japan’s narrow roads and tight parking spaces.US cars also have longstanding image problems, says Takahisa Matsuyama, an instructor for chauffeurs and private hire drivers in Tokyo.“Going back to the days when we first came across US cars like Cadillacs, they’re seen as having terrible fuel efficiency and breaking down easily; that impression hasn’t changed much,” says Matsuyama.The 2025 car reliability rankings from Consumer Reports, a US non-profit organisation, bear this sentiment out.The top four marques were Subaru, Lexus, Toyota and Honda – all Japanese.The bottom four – Jeep, GMC, Cadillac and Rivian – were all American.Matsuyama points out that the biggest sellers in Japan have long beenkeicars. Short forkei-jidosha(light vehicle), these compact cars and trucks are only allowed a tiny 660cc engine, and have topped sales rankings for decades – even as the government has gradually eroded the tax and insurance advantages they receive over regular vehicles.View image in fullscreenSmall, economicalkeicars predominate in Japan, topping sales rankings for decades.Photograph: Toru Yamanaka/EPAThe automotive antithesis of the giant pickup, the keitruck has actually gained a cult fanbase in the US, mostly through private imports.Japan’s automakers will now face 15% tariffs on their exports to the US, up from 2.5% and the highest levy in decades. But investors have welcomed the figure as much less than the originally threatened 25% hike, to a total of 27.5%. The news sent the Nikkei 225 index up more than 4% this week, and shares in Japan’s biggest carmakers surged even higher – Toyota, Honda and Nissan all gaining more than 10%.One of Trump’s perennial complaints in his trade and tariff war has been that other companies “rip off” the US by selling it more than they buy from it.In that vein, as part of the bilateral negotiations, Tokyo has agreed to encourage Japanese auto brands that also build cars in US factories to import some of them into Japan.That may at least put some US-built vehicles into the showrooms of Japan that motorists might actually buy.Explore more on these topicsJapanTrump tariffsAsia PacificDonald TrumpTariffsUS foreign policyAutomotive industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Four of them are subject to previous arrest warrants, each carrying a reward of 1m Hong Kong dollars (£95,000).View image in fullscreenElmer Yuen shows his Hong Kong passport during an interview in Vancouver in 2023.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockAmong the remaining 15, for each of whom police are offering a reward of 200,000 Hong Kong dollars, are those said to have organised or run in the election and been sworn in as its councillors.Feng Chongyi, a China studies professor at the University of Technology Sydney who was also listed, decried the bounty against him as “ridiculous”.“They’ve got the power, they’ve got the influence overseas, they want to control everything even overseas,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald.The UK’s foreign and home secretaries condemned the move in a joint statement, calling the arrests “another example of transnational repression” and saying it damages Hong Kong’s international reputation.“[The UK] will not tolerate attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas,” they said in a statement on Friday.In response, the Chinese embassy in the UK said the British government’s remarks “constitute a gross interference” in China’s internal affairs and the rule of law in Hong Kong.“China urges the UK to abandon its colonial mentality, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs … stop shielding criminals,” it said.Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, also strongly objected to the arrest warrants. “Freedom of expression and assembly are essential to our democracy,” she said on X.“We have consistently expressed our strong objections to China and Hong Kong on the broad and extraterritorial application of Hong Kong’s national security legislation, and we will continue to do so.”The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy, including freedom of speech, under a “one country, two systems” formula.Critics of the national security law say government are using it to stifle dissent. Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly said the law was vital to restore stability after the city was rocked for months by sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.Police reiterated that national security offences were serious crimes with extraterritorial reach and urged the wanted individuals to return to Hong Kong and surrender.“If offenders voluntarily give up continuing to violate the crime, turn themselves in, truthfully confess their crimes, or provide key information that helps solve other cases, they may be eligible for reduced punishment,” they said in a statement.Police also said that aiding, abetting, or funding others to participate in the Hong Kong Parliament group could be a criminal offence.Explore more on these topicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Some may know them from their comedicTikTokvideos, which regularly amass hundreds of thousands of views. Others may recognize them as host of Gaydar, a viral entertainment-education show about queer culture, history and current events; an interview Williams did with the New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani did go viral, after all. There’s also Williams’s drag performances, including those where they opened for icons such as Chappell Roan and Bob the Drag Queen. Or their bevy of musical theater roles – Lola in Kinky Boots, Dominique in Lucky Stiffs, to name a few.For years, Williams has been launching their own creative universe. As a 25-year-old genderqueer, Black artist, Williams, who uses they/she pronouns, has used their ever-growing social media presence (more than 2.8 million followers across their social media platforms) to fashion the career of their dreams outside anyone’s binaries. For their next project, Williams is set to perform in Saturday Church, a new musical at New York Theatre Workshop which opens 27 August. The play dives into the world of a sanctuary for LGBTQ+ youth. “It’s a feelgood musical,” said Williams of the production. “It’s just queer, Black joy, and there’s a beautiful message about it.”Williams will play a trans woman, another bonus in their ever-growing theatrical career. “The further I get in my transition, it’s been nice to feel affirmed,” they said. “It’s just been awesome to be in those spaces and to make a way for myself.” With talent and charisma, Williams’s rise is practically ordained; as they look forward to balancing their various projects, now comes the task of navigating their expansive future and chronic frustrations of being online.Growing upFor Williams, growing up in Davenport, Iowa – an industrial, midwestern town of about 100,000 people, was an exercise in strength. At school, Williams was bullied for “having a girl name”, they said. Their home life was equally tumultuous, Williams recalled, rife with abuse and neglect. But life in the midwest sowed the seeds for their future artistic passions. As a child, they sang in the church choir, later joining show choir, following in the footsteps of an older sister.For college, Williams attended Emerson College’s in the musical theatre program in Boston. University was one of the first times that Williams got to reflect on who they were, what they wanted. But musical theater came with its own binaries and limitations, especially as Williams is both genderqueer, meaning outside the typical binaries of gender, and Black. “It felt like: ‘Lord forbid you be somewhere else on the gender binary,’ and then, ‘Lord forbid you’re also Black at the same time’,” Williams said.Breaking the Binary: meet the founder behind a US theater company for trans and non-binary artistsRead moreEven when Williams attempted to create their own lane, they said they faced resistance from their professors. “There was a teacher that was like: ‘You keep bringing in girl songs. Why is that?’ And I tried to explain it to them, and it didn’t go well,” Williams said.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Williams returned to their home town to wait out the return to normalcy like most people. The isolation allowed for reflection and served as a moment that allowed them to fully realize their gender identity. “I had to admit a couple things to myself, like, ‘Yeah, I’m queer. Yeah, I’m probably genderqueer.’ And from there, it kind of spiraled,” they said of that time period, jokingly adding: “I call it the pronoun pipeline.”Around the same time, Williams started to create content on TikTok, quickly becoming known for short, comedic rants captured during their late-night walks. Most of their content was spur-of-the-moment musings on anything from Christianity and relationships toa new iPhone. In 2022, they started to speak more openly about being genderqueer, posting videos of their drag and makeup routine.Reflecting back on that time period brings a mix of feelings, Williams said. On one hand, it has been extremely gratifying to grow alongside longtime viewers. “The audience that’s been with me the longest has signed on to watch me evolve,” they said. “[They] watched me do makeup for the first time or try to glue down a wig. Those people are why I feel like I can keep going.” On the other hand, Williams sometimes wishes “the first version people knew me of was who I am today”.The rise of GaydarThe nature of their content has continued to grow. In 2024, Williams became the host of Gaydar, created by Amelia Montooth at the company Mutuals Media. The show quizzes an array of guests on queer culture in an attempt to find out if they are “straight, gay or homophobic”. Questions include anything from what a “lipstick lesbian” is to assessing a guest’s knowledge of a gay icon. Willliams herself is also learning alongside contestants, often in real time. “I didn’t know who Sue Bird was and the lesbians whacked me up and down the streets, oh my God,” they quipped.The show’s a comedic premise with the goal of inviting viewers to become educated, said Williams. “We are inundating queer history and queer culture into digestible questions and clips that lets people relax into the learning,” said Williams of the show. “They can take something in a funny way that’s more engaging than saying: “Here are the facts. Here’s a screenshot of this article I read, and you should care about it.”Early versions of the show featured mostly strangers Williams found on the street. The segment has since hosted a number of celebrities and public figures: singers Lucy Dacus, Reneé Rapp and Vivian Jenna Wilson, the daughter of billionaire Elon Musk. The New York City mayoral candidate Mamdani, an avid progressive, attracted social media buzz as one of the first politicians to grace the show. Mamdani shocked Williams when he was successfully able to name a lesbian bar in the city: the Manhattan-staple Cubbyhole.“He was just such a team player about it,” said Williams of the interview experience. “We let our audience, which is younger, know who he is and he got to speak for himself.” Williams added: “It’s cool to be a professional zeitgeist in that way, to know that throughout it all, we’re making a difference.”Williams’s ascent hasn’t come without difficulties. They have faced cruel harassment as they have been more public about their transition. “What they really like to do, especially with dolls, is pick apart fashion and makeup and hair,” said Williams, referring to online trolls. Williams added: “I want to believe that people are becoming more comfortable with transness, but I think they’re coming around to a very specific, stereotypical, western, white, skinny type of trans person. When someone doesn’t fit that standard, they get berated.”But Williams has found ways to consistently ground in the real world, alongside the growing pains. There’s their found family, a best friend from sixth grade. High school friends and their boyfriend as well as online friends they met through TikTok. And, of course, baking and video games are hobbies, living outside the pressure to monetize or make content of their life. A cake for a friend’s birthday was already in the works for later that evening. “It’s either red velvet or strawberry,” Williams said, with a large laugh. “I remember the color, not the flavor.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderBlack US cultureLGBTQ+ rightsTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hugely revealingRhik SamadderSat 26 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTSharePolice work rarely resembles The Shield or Line of Duty. It’s mostly paperwork, online training and referring people to driver offender courses. But sometimes life imitates art. In 2020, international police hacked the encrypted phone network EncroChat, used by organised crime gangs across the globe. For 74 days, they had access to every message and picture used to coordinate drug trafficking, money laundering, kidnap and murder. “It was the LinkedIn of organised crime,” explains Matt Horne, a former gold commander at the UK’s National Crime Agency (not the actor from Gavin & Stacey).Operation Dark Phone: Murder By Text (Sunday, 9pm, Channel 4) is a documentary-drama cleverly built around these messages, which appear like screenplay dialogue across scenes. It’s an arresting insight into how criminal gangs work – and just as revealing, how they talk. “Sweets” are bullets, while a “pineapple” is a grenade. A violent British criminal known as Live-long, lying low in Spain, organises an acid attack on a rival, in between sending pictures of his breakfast. Cucumber slices on labneh with paprika – nice. The trick, he instructs, is to stop the victim getting to a sink. Hold them down a few minutes, so the acid can do its job. Less nice.Incredibly, there is dark humour amid the grim. Mostly courtesy of the crims, who go by ridiculous two-word usernames on the anonymous network. There’s a Chris Morris absurdity to Mystical-steak, Valued-bridge, Top-shag. At one point, an agent explains how Live-long interacted with Ball-sniffer (who one assumes is lower down). For their part, the agents and white hats are living out the most exciting series of The Wire. In a year, they would usually encounter fewer than a hundred explicit threats to life. Once the curtain was lifted, they intercepted more than 150 in six weeks. Logistically, that’s a problem.View image in fullscreenDetectives had access to the criminals’ messages for 74 days.Photograph: Channel 4The show knows how to grab a viewer. Storylines develop, introduce formidable characters, and bring the action to a climax. Ace-prospect imports AKs and Glocks to the UK, one of which is bought by Live-long, who is looking to take on Ace-prospect in a personal revenge attack. Organised through go-betweens, neither side knows who they are dealing with. The NCA has a 24-hour delay when receiving message data, and must work round the clock to close the gap. When Ace-prospect’s hitman throws a pineapple into the garden of a rival, which fails to explode, the feds are faced with a dilemma: how to protect the lives of children nearby while keeping their intelligence and mission a secret?This is all far sexier than Crimewatch. Instead of losers sticking up BP garages, here are wealthy playas orchestrating crimes from overseas. Is it ethical? Is there a risk of making the criminals look cooler than their cucumbers? The glossy recreations showcase swimming pools, gym-fit bodies, weapons familiar from movies. The actor playing Live-long looks like Claes Bang, and spends the episode with his top off. Yet this is a morality tale. “I’m gonna take his eyes out and chase him around every jail,” writes Live-long from a darkened room, his teeth-whitening gumshield glowing ultra-violet like a nightmare acid trip.View image in fullscreenGang members contributed to their downfall with their constant oversharing, boasting and vanity.Photograph: Channel 4The empty glamour is not just the medium, it’s the message. These criminals’ downfall is their superficiality, their constant messaging and oversharing, their boasting and social media-amplified physical vanity. Live-long’s true identity is eventually uncovered because he sends a triumphant selfie. Can you imagine an old-school career criminal hearing that? I picture them slapping their forehead; except they’ve forgotten to unclench their fist and knock themselves out.The show’s charge comes from knowing this is real, not merely dramatic writing. Part of that charge is fear – a reminder that there are sociopaths among us who hold life cheap and take joy in violence. Operation Dark Phone is a four-part series, from the makers of 24 Hours in Police Custody, and promises far more jaw-dropping revelations as well as some overdue justice. Don’t watch it if your faith in humanity is wavering. I’ll probably be giving pineapples in the supermarket a wide berth too, just in case.Explore more on these topicsOrganised crimeThe watcherTelevisionNCA (National Crime Agency)EncryptionPoliceGun crimeCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday it wasannouncedthat parent company Paramount had just struck a five-year, 10-episode-per-season deal with series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the whopping price of $1.5bn.This comes amid public uproar against Paramount for theircancellationof The Late Show after host Stephen Colbert’s criticism of the studiosettling a $16m lawsuitwithDonald Trumpagainst CBS (which belongs to Paramount) in alleged exchange for FCC approval for their proposed $8bnmergerwith Skydance. (Said approval was announced on Thursday, with the extra caveat that Paramount would refrain from producing programs based on supposed diversity, equity and inclusion standards.)On Wednesday, the season premiere of South Park’s 27th season debuted, and lest you think that Parker and Stone’s billion-dollar deal would keep them from biting the hand that feeds,they came out chomping, delivering sharp digs at Paramount and CBS for their kowtowing to the president’s demands.‘South Park’s most furious episode ever’: the jaw-dropping Satanic takedown of Donald TrumpRead moreBut their most brutal stuff was reserved for Trump himself, depicting him as a petty, predatory tyrant (à la their past caricature of Saddam Hussein) overcompensating for a tiny penis – which, in the episode’s jaw-dropping closing moments, they show in graphic detail via a fake ad using the most realistic AI animation seen to-date.The episode has, in the short time since it aired, proven to be the most show’s most controversial in years. But of course, it’s nothing new forSouth Park, which is certainly the most controversial American sitcom – animated or otherwise – of all time.South Park proved controversial even before it went into production. Fox was originally meant to pick up the series – an expansion of Parker and Stone’s 1992 short student film The Spirit of Christmas (Jesus vs Frosty) and its viral follow-up The Spirit of Christmas (Jesus vs Santa). But when members of the network objected to the character of Mr Hanky – a talking piece of poop – Parker and Stone nixed the deal, eventually landing at the Paramount unit Cartoon Network.While other adult-oriented cartoons had paved the way in terms of both popularity and controversy (The Simpsons debuted in 1989 and Beavis and Butt-Head in 1993), it was clear from the start that South Park meant to push the envelope further than anything that came before it, so much so that a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer was inserted at the start of each episode:“All characters and events in this show – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated … poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.”This did little to curb its popularity with young audiences. Within a few episodes of the first season, South Park was a cultural force to be reckoned with. And reckoned with it was, particularly by educational and parental groups who, outraged at its unrelenting dedication to toilet humor, violence and especially profanity, tried their best to get it taken off the air (and, failing that, to ban its merch from schools).The series embraced this outrage, using it as fodder for meta-commentary by way of a fictional show-within-a-show, Terrance and Phillip, a constant source of outrage for the idiotic and easily led parents of the show’s main foursome. This would culminate in the 1999 feature film, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, which would – to the surprise of any number of cultural commentators – go on to earn as many accolades (including an Oscar nomination for best original song) as it did objections.As the series continued, its focus started to shift. It dropped popular but stale gags (such as the recurring “You killed Kenny!” bit), while evolving its characters in fascinating ways. Nowhere is this more evident than Eric Cartman, the spoiled, obese, bigoted breakout character. While always something of an antagonist, by the fifth season he was murdering the parents of a school rival and feeding them to him à la Titus Andronicus. Things only got darker from there, with Cartman coming to embody seemingly every hateful and degenerate vice humans are capable of. The fact that he would simultaneously remain the show’s most popular and beloved character brooked no shortage of handwringing from the show’s detractors (and often even their fans), who worried that viewers, particularly impressionable youngsters, were taking all the wrong messages from it.At the same time, messaging became a central part of South Park. While it always contained some level of social commentary and political satire, that aspect moved to the forefront. The singular schedule that Parker and Stone kept – episodes are developed and produced within a week of airing – allowed for them to take on hot button news items while they were still in the headlines. This was, and for the most part remains, unheard of when it comes to sitcoms (especially animated ones, which usually require a longer production schedule). Viewers were shocked when South Park ended up airing episodes about the Elián González custody and Terry Schiavo medical battles in real time (the latter airing mere hours before Schiavo died).Parker and Stone have described themselves as libertarians (although they’re Gen X libertarians and thus less simpatico with today’s breed) which meant that they were often pissing off both liberals and conservatives. For the most part, they were less interested in preaching their personal ideology than they were calling out others’ hypocrisy. As a result, no sacred cows were left untipped.Given the show’s sacrilegious origins, it’s no surprise that it’s biggest controversies came from their skewering of religion. Perhaps their most infamous episode to date is season nine’s Trapped in the Closet, which used the ridiculous R Kelly song to poke fun at famous Scientologists Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Even though the crux of the episodes revolves around those stars’ rumored sexuality, the real target was the Church of Scientology itself, which Stone and Parker depicted as a cult and scam, going so far as to animate, in detail, the bonkers mythology at the heart of the religion, which the church had strived to keep secret from the larger public.(Knowing how litigious the Church of Scientology is, everyone who worked on Trapped in the Closet was credited as John/Jayne Smith.)Comedy Central moved the episode from its original air date, purportedly at the demand of Cruise, who was starring in Paramount’s upcoming blockbuster Mission: Impossible 3, although all parties have denied this. What’s not disputed is that Parker and Stone threatened to quit the show if the episode wasn’t released. It eventually did air (after the action sequel came out), and although the cultural impact is impossible to quantify, it’s not coincidental that it marked the start of a hard public scrutiny of the Church of Scientology.One proven result of the episode was the high-profile departure of one of the show’s original voice actors, Isaac Hayes, who was a Scientologist. This, in turn, would lead to the show killing off his character, Chef, just a couple of years before Hayes himself passed away.Similar episodes targeting Mormonism and Catholicism followed, and while they brooked their share of objections from the Church of Latter-day Saints and various Catholic leagues, they were teacup tempests compared with what came in season 10.Amid an increasingly violent reaction from Islamic extremists over European cartoonists’ satirical depictions of the prophet Muhammad (something forbidden by certain sects within the broader religion), Parker and Stone inserted themselves into the issue by attempting to do just that (albeit by using rival animated show Family Guy as their in-universe proxy). Despite the unassailable moral point they were attempting to make – if they were allowed to make fun of every other religion’s sacred figures, they should be able to do so with Islam without fear of violent reprisal – the network once again balked, airing the episode but placing a black “censored box over the character of Muhammad.Thankfully, this did not lead to any violence, although when Stone and Parker touched on the issue again during the 14th season (in episodes 200 and 201, where the mere name Muhammad was censored by Comedy Central) it did lead to public death threats against them, as well as a demanded apology from Malaysia’s main conservative party.What’s most ironic about all of this is that South Park had already shown Muhammad in an early season, and even included the character in its original title sequence. No one objected to this at time, although this was before 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the global sea change those atrocities ushered in. Today, all these episodes have been scrubbed from streaming, although some are available on their respective seasons’ original DVD releases.Attempts to get South Park banned in various parts of the globe have been hit and miss, but China eventually succeeded. Already angry with the show for dealing with banned subject matter (including the Dalai Lama) and its intentionally over-the-top ethnic humor, the final straw came via the season 23 episode Band in China, which directly targeted American corporations’ expansion into the Chinese market in spite of the Chinese Communist party’s broad censorship and brutal repression of political dissidents.As much as they have managed to piss off social/religious conservatives and authoritarian regimes, Parker and Stone have also proven a constant thorn in the side of outraged liberals and leftists, less so because of any single issue they have dealt with – although their mocking of Al Gore’s warnings over climate change (represented in the show as a made up cryptid called ManBearPig) certainly earned them lots of criticism, which they eventually acknowledged, going so far as to issue a begrudging on-air mea culpa – than a larger feeling of irony-poisoned political nihilism.Certainly, much of modern conservative ideology is indistinguishable from the intentionally offensive antics of Cartman. One need only look at the volume of social media accounts belonging to rightwing shitposters that use South Park-style illustrations for their avatars and profile pics (although this trend isn’t nearly as prevalent as it was between 2010 and 2020).Over the past several seasons, as well as the handful of direct-to-streaming “movies”, South Park has taken on the right’s favorite issue, wokeness (in 2015, they introduced a new character, PC Principal, who embodies all of the worst qualities of overly sensitive millennials).At the same time, they were lampooning Trump, although in a less direct way than past public figures, choosing to use the character of Mr Garrison – the show’s resident hedonist reactionary – as an analog. But in 2017, Parker publicly announced that they would stop making Trump jokes, as he’d grown bored of them and didn’t want South Park to resemble supposedly liberal institutions like CNN. This response earned praise from the conservative figures, includingDonald Trump Jr(who would also go on to praise a recent South Park special for its woke pop culture reboots).Which brings us to the surprise of this most recent season premiere. While it’s hardly surprising that Parker and Stone would reverse course, given the extremity of Trump’s corruption and attacks on the first amendment, the directness of their attack still came as a surprise to both fans and detractors alike. Hours after episode aired, the White Housereleased an enraged response, in which they accused South Park and its creators of being hypocritical and inauthentic, while also claiming it hadn’t been relevant in 20 years.Obviously, any show that just inked a $1.5bn deal can’t be realistically called irrelevant, but it has been a minute since South Park has made headlines. While this isn’t new territory for the series, something feels different this time. There is a real sense of shock and betrayal coming from the right. Undoubtedly, this is because they recognize that much of the show’s fanbase is composed of their supporters. Unlike the weak tea being slung by Colbert and his ilk, this isn’t a case of preaching to the choir. While it’s ridiculous to think that South Park will be the catalyst for any real political change, it’s telling how hysterical the right’s ferocity against it has been over the course of just a few hours. That this is coming on the heels of broader backlash against the president from supposedly sympathetic sources over his refusal to release the Epstein files shows that, for the first time since the election, their back is truly against the wall.Trump is the most easily offended man alive, while Parker and Stone have never backed down from a fight. If the history of South Park is any indication, this latest controversy is just the tip of the iceberg (or, rather, the tip of a minuscule talking phallus).Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTV comedyAnimation on TVComedyTelevisionUS televisionDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A rollicking, deliberately dumb action movie about the US president and the British prime minister, Heads of State looked as if it was going to be the weirdest political film of the year. Turns out it wasn’t even the weirdest of the summer, because here is Rumours. With three writer-directors, including Guy Maddin, it’s a film about a G7 summit that finds itself being terrorised by marauding bog-zombies and, odder still, a giant brain. The fact that Cate Blanchett plays the German chancellor and Charles Dance the US president makes it stranger still. Highly silly and very funny, it’s not something you are likely to forget in a hurry.Stuart HeritageLyle, Lyle, Crocodile, 2pm, BBC OneView image in fullscreenThe performance of his life? … Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile on BBC One.Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/REX/ShutterstockLast year’s vaguely nightmarish Harold and the Purple Crayon is an example of the pitfalls of attempting to stretch a children’s picture book to feature length. With that in mind, 2022’s Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is a miracle. Based on a slight 1965 kids’ book, Will Speck and Josh Gordon’s film is an unexpected delight. There is a crocodile, he can sing, and all hell breaks loose. Not only are the songs (by The Greatest Showman’s Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) genuinely good, but Javier Bardem gives one of the performances of his life as Lyle’s unreliable owner.SHFallen Leaves, 9.45pm, BBC FourAs is to be expected – nay required – from the master of dour, deadpan humour, in Aki Kaurismäki’s latest romantic comedy his two lonely, Helsinki-based central characters struggle to express their feelings.

They were responding to a work that engages with the current levels of literary excitement around sex and marries this with sweeping historical vistas and a distinctive sensibility. It was joined on the shortlist by Miranda July’s exuberant odyssey of midlife desire,All Fours,andFundamentallyby Nussaibah Younis, a smart, quickfire account of a young academic’s work for a UN deradicalisation programme, which juxtaposes the world of Middle Eastern religious politics with a closeup relish for female sexuality.While younger generations, at least, have said in recent years that they want tosee more platonic friendship and less sex on screen, reading appetites appear to be going in the other direction, with a huge boom inromance and “romantasy”– the romance-fantasy hybrid driven by TikTok and the success of authors such as Rebecca Yarros and Sarah J Maas. We all have strong, mixed feelings about sex, and the cultural landscape reflects the whole spectrum of kinks and hangups. But that means that we have all the more need for writers like Van der Wouden, July and Sally Rooney, who push the boundaries of how explicit the literary novel can be while also giving us new ways of imagining how desire works within lives today.Ours is a dual age of identity politics and porn. We get our identities from sex – queer or straight, pansexual or “incel” – but it’s also the white-hot arena in which identity melts down. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, when pornography is everywhere andGillian Andersonis collecting thousands of sexual fantasies with anthropological zeal, it seems we still need literature to tell us new things about sex. What I found, reading recent work by authors including Rooney, Van der Wouden, Jen Beagin, K Patrick and Eimear McBride, were unpredictable fusions of the two impulses. Lovers, dutifully preoccupied with questions of identity by day, find that in bed they can transcend selfhood, outstripping their identities.Women’s prize winner Yael van der Wouden: ‘It’s heartbreaking to see so much hatred towards queer people’Read moreTo surrender individuality and accept the dissolution of the self, to lose sight of who is in control – these possibilities have preoccupied erotic writers since the early 20th century, when sex first became representable in literary fiction. Back then there was DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, staking the redemption of humanity on sexual transformation. In Lawrence’s wake came Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin and Georges Bataille – all about abjection and breaking taboos. Then the outrageously argumentative Norman Mailer and John Updike, whose frank delight in the female form called out for a feminist backlash. It came in the shape of Kate Millett’s wittily polemical 1970 Sexual Politics and a new wave of sexually explicit novels by women concerned less with celebrating than with demythologising sex. Erica Jong’s epochal 1973 Fear of Flying ushered in the “zipless fuck” – sex without strings – and allowed a generation of feminists to experiment with promiscuity, but for all its brilliance on psychoanalysis and marriage, the book is pretty terrible on sex.It took another backlash – within feminism itself – to make sex great again. In 1967 Susan Sontag had written The Pornographic Imagination, an essay defending writers such as Bataille from prudery and fighting to classify pornographic writing as literature, even or especially when it exceeded realism. “Tamed as it may be, sexuality remains one of the demonic forces in human consciousness,” she wrote – so why not make it a resource for “breaking through the limits of consciousness”? Angela Carter took on Sontag’s ideas in her 1978 study, The Sadeian Woman, arguing against feminists concerned to outlaw porn, and making the case for the “moral pornographer” – an artist who “uses pornographic material as part of the acceptance of the logic of a world of absolute sexual licence for all the genders”.Sontag and Carter saw that the power of sex lay in opening selfhood to otherness with extravagant force. Otherness and innovation go together, so great writing about great sex always has radical potential. The parameters they set out still define the best possibilities of what sex writing can be, though plenty of men – from Philip Roth to Michel Houellebecq – came along in the meantime to try to prove that male desire was still fascinating.Reading in our contemporary era, I find myself most riveted by writers who continue Carter’s tradition. Published earlier this year, Sophie Kemp’sParadise Logictells the satirical story of a young woman’s attempt to make herself into the ideal girlfriend and, in doing so, exposes the patriarchal nature of porn culture. But precisely because it’s so clever and sassy it reveals the limits of satire, whereas other contemporary novelists are bringing together the pornographic and the transcendent in a more transporting way.It’s telling that these writers are more often writing gay than heterosexual sex. Garth Greenwell, who has described himself as wanting to write scenes that are “100% pornographic and 100% high art”, is more trammelled by questions of identity than Alan Hollinghurst was when he wrote The Swimming-Pool Library – a book Greenwell credits as an inspiration. Greenwell is writing sex in the age of consent and dutiful identity politics, but arguably it’s these constraints that power his existential quest.There’s a scene in Greenwell’s 2020Cleannesswhere the pornographic and the transcendent explicitly entwine. The narrator has a BDSM encounter with a Bulgarian man he calls Svetcheto, “the little saint”. The usually submissive narrator has agreed to dominate. It’s a brutal scene, all the more frightening because it mirrors an earlier encounter when the narrator was dangerously violated. We’re worried both that he’ll reenact that violence and that he won’t carry off this new role. But then it becomes clear he’s enjoying himself. Suffused by mutual, unexpected transcendence, the couple’s porn-inspired identities simultaneously break down and burst into flower. Laughing, Svetcheto licks away the narrator’s tears. “Do you see? You don’t have to be like that,” he says. “You can be like this.”Sally Rooney writes sex scenes that are at once radiant and minutely observed by her overthinking charactersJen Beagin, K Patrick and Yael van der Wouden write moving, powerful portraits of lesbian desire, full of anatomical detail. Beagin’sBig Swissis a large-hearted tale of a love affair between Flavia, an absurdly beautiful gynaecologist, and Greta, the more klutzy, down-at-heel writer who’s paid by Flavia’s sex therapist to transcribe her sessions. “Her pussy looked like advanced origami. A crisp pink lotus flower folded by a master. Greta briefly rearranged it with her mouth.” The sex scenes in Patrick’sMrs Sare less metaphorical and more breathlessly desiring, though the prose is taut in its lyricism. It can feel like the plot – a love affair between the 22-year-old new teaching recruit and the headmaster’s wife in a girls’ boarding school – is an excuse for the sex scenes, but in a way that’s the point.In both books, it is striking how quickly sex reveals the existential need for transformation. Even in that first sex scene, Greta feels as if she’s reached a place “she’s been visiting in her dreams for years and forgetting”. Mrs S is casually historical – set in the 1980s or 90s – which means its identity politics can be implicit: the narrator wears a chest binder but the book doesn’t raise questions of trans identity. Instead it is preoccupied with the loss of identity, as the narrator feels herself remade as the “You” she becomes in her lover’s mouth. “It is as if she has always been waiting for this arrival, of me into my body. You. I don’t have a name. Isn’t it so much better, to not have a name, to be dropped straight from the clouds?”The sex scenes are more shocking in Van der Wouden’s The Safekeep because the subject matter is so serious. This is the story of a violently sudden passion that becomes a love affair between Eva, a displaced Jew, and Isabel, a gentile woman who has unwitting power over her. The book is set in the aftermath of the second world war and, given the gravity of the material, some reviewers have wondered if the sex scenes are necessary. But this is to miss the point, which is that the book only works if the relationship throws both women entirely off-kilter – using the edges of porn to show sex derailing not only their lives but their selves, and indeed the conventional novel form itself. Isabel finds herself vulnerably, joyously powerless in an unfamiliar body: “At Eva’s mercy, trapped between the cage of her teeth, she had grown a new shape.” Van der Wouden insists that her complex sense of character development justifies sexual explicitness. But she has also been clear in interviews that no justification is needed: “The girls deserve to have some fun. This was my mantra while writing: Let them have some fun!”So what about those writers daring to write explicit, ecstatic heterosexual sex? The most compelling are Eimear McBride, whose The Lesser Bohemians makes the reader feel as though they are almost inside the bodies of the protagonists, andSally Rooney, who is casually magisterial at writing sex scenes that are at once radiant and minutely observed by her overthinking characters. Like Greenwell, Rooney balances a commitment to a contemporary vision of identity and consent with a willingness to explore the pull of dissolution and abjection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But beneath these exterior sexual identities are their private bodily lives, and sex is the best means of growth they have. Rooney follows McBride in dizzyingly contorting her sentences: “Deep pressing almost hurting and she felt him throbbing, wanting to, and she wanted that also, wet inside, image of silver behind her closed eyelids, jetting, emptying into her …” Rooney is surprised that people don’t ask her more often about the place of sex in her novels; “the erotic is a huge engine in the stories of all my books,” she has said.But it is in All Fours that the full possibilities of Carter’s “moral pornography” are realised. July’s novel manages to be at once an ethnographic account of women’s perimenopausal sexuality and a more darkly anti-realist tale of a woman living out her sexual fantasies. The narrator spends vast sums transforming a small-town hotel room into a sumptuous dreamscape, where she tests her capacities for love and lust with Davey, a beautiful, potent but determinedly chaste young dancer she meets at the gas station. The encounters with Davey are brilliantly, exuberantly realised – all the more so because July never loses sight of their comedy. In the absence of sex, they seek consummation elsewhere, and at one point Davey changes her tampon. The scene is both bathetically comic, intensely erotic, and unexpectedly moving.‘This book is my bible!’ The women who read Miranda July’s All Fours, then blew up their livesRead moreBut it is once she and Davey part and the narrator has sex with sexagenarian Audra that the novel becomes incandescent. The narrator is home now, adjusting to her former life, but has negotiated a weekly night in the hotel. She seeks out Audra, who had a relationship with Davey years earlier, desperate to compare notes. “Fantasies are all good and well up to a certain age,” Audra says, “Then you have to have lived experiences or you’ll go batty.” And so Audra describes her sexual past with Davey, while both women masturbate, an experience that, for the narrator, “lit up new neural pathways, as if sex, the whole concept of it, was being freshly mapped”.As a sexual encounter, this is moving and original. As a vision of womanhood undergoing feats of change and confronting mortality, it’s extraordinary. This scene takes us beyond realism. In her life at home, July’s narrator is casually, matter-of-factly bound up in the sexual questions of her contemporary world: she has a nonbinary child and is anxiously aware how limited her sex life is by motherhood. But July uses the narrator’s experiences in the hotel room to bend and test our sense of novelistic, psychological plausibility. It is a place where identity can be discarded and remade.Sex remains at the centre of much of the best fiction, and we need powerful fictions to show us what sex is or can become. This is where realism comes up against something stranger, and body and consciousness undo and affirm each other, because it can be at once so ordinary, and so transcendent.Lara Feigel is the author of Look!

I was 15, and a weird mixture of studious and smart but also disruptive in class. I was also extremely virginal – both fascinated and terrified by the idea of having sex and in no danger of doing so for another half a decade. I was basically Rick.My parents were strict – my dad was the school headteacher – so I can’t think why they let me stay up late to watch it. Maybe they just wanted me out of the way so they could get on with other things.What drew me in right away washow silly it was. A lot of the comedy I’d liked had been clever stuff that was almost snooty, like Monty Python or Derek and Clive. The Young Ones was rude. It was the first time I’d seen slapstick and fart jokes that were actually funny.My cultural awakening: I joined Danny Wallace’s accidental positivity cult – and found the love of my lifeRead moreMy generation missed punk, but The Young Ones had a similarsense of anarchy – a “do it yourself” spirit, with a cavalcade of ideas being thrown at the screen. The alternative comedy scene – as well as the Comic Strip and French and Saunders – felt new and very galvanising. In the same way the Sex Pistols made anyone feel as if they could pick up a guitar, The Young Ones made me feel like I could make a living out of making people laugh: it didn’t matter if I was a regular kid at a comprehensive school in Somerset. This was a particularly important revelation, as my careers adviser had told me that I should give up on being a writer and work in a bank.Watching The Young Ones episodes on repeat to learn the lines by heart, I learned about the rhythm and language of comedy. Plus, I discovered that if you could do a good impression of one of the characters, you’d get a laugh at school the next day.I loved Rik Mayall. He was a handsome and sexy figure, but not afraid to make himself look ridiculous. He continued to inspire me throughout my life. Years later, as a comedy writer, I wrote some scenes for him in the sitcom Man Down, but he died before they were filmed. I was on the toilet when I heard the news. I cried, both upset that someone I loved had gone, and sad that I’d no longer be able to work with one of my heroes.The Young Ones was a show that parodied idiotic students, a bunch of men who didn’t want to grow up. Neither did I – and, thanks to The Young Ones, I didn’t have to.As told to Harriet GibsoneRichard Herring’s RHLSTPisatThe StandComedy Club,30 July to 10 August.Desiree Burch: Davina McCall’s MenopausingView image in fullscreenIllustration: Martin O’Neill/The GuardianA year ago, I was in the pit of a perimenopause crisis but I didn’t fully know it. I didn’t know there was an explanation for feeling depressed, suicidal, confused, exhausted and generally ill. Then I read Davina McCall’s bookMenopausing.The idea behind the book is simple: Davina went on to social media and got people to send their menopause stories. I listened tothe audiobookwhile I was travelling around gigging, and heard lots of different readers voicing their stories, interspersed with Davina’s chats with a doctor, who gave useful information about what was going on in these women’s bodies and minds.There are people in the book who left their careers because they couldn’t cope intellectually or emotionally. It just seemed crazy to me. A woman who has spent 25 years of her life building up her career shouldn’t just have to walk away because she’s too scared to say: “I don’t know what is going on. I’m losing words. I’m losing the ability to be in the present moment because of brain fog.”My cultural awakening: a Marina Abramović show helped me to stop hating my abusive fatherRead moreDavina’s book helped me to understand that I had reached a stage that was actually quite serious. So I went ahead and pushed my case with my doctor. After reading the book, I was able to say: actually I’m not depressed – I’m losing parts of my cognition due to fluctuating hormone levels.Most of the time, the doctor just asks: how’s your sex drive? But most of us experiencing perimenopause don’t care about sex at that point. I was more worried about staying alive, how I’d perform in my job and how words weren’t coming out of my mouth correctly. Being able to tell my doctor what was wrong was really important. I was given testosterone as well as oestrogen, and that was extraordinarily helpful.All of it has made me committed to trying to show up in my performances a bit more. I need to keep practising, keep exercising my brain. There has always been something so special in the art of live performance and being able to stay present – even if it means saying I forgot what I was about to say.Having Davina say that she’d gone through this was a big thing for me. So I’m always pushing her book to friends, to spread more awareness and bring the issue to the light.As told to Miriam GillinsonDesiree Burch: The Golden Wrathis at Monkey Barrel Comedy, 28 July to 10 August.Kiell Smith-Bynoe: Pantomime damesView image in fullscreenIllustration: Martin O’Neill/The GuardianGrowing up as an only child and a drama kid, I was probably quite annoying. I was always coming up with ideas and characters, but I wasn’t the type of kid to say: “Come and look at what I’ve done!” Instead I would do parodies of teachers or characters from the television in the privacy of my bedroom. One Christmas, at primary school, I finally got the chance to stand on a stage and show everyone what I could do. It was the nativity play, and I was playing the part of the innkeeper. I only had one line, which I’ve since forgotten, but I remember that when I said it, people laughed. I liked that feeling so much that I said it 10 more times. It flicked a trigger in my brain: I wanted to do this all the time. I just didn’tquitehave the skills to do it yet …I remember watching Dick Whittington and thinking, ‘I am so incredibly jealous of everyone who is doing this for a job’Then when my mum took me to see panto at Theatre Royal Stratford East, I was amazed and began to understand, at six years old, what it meant to properly put on a show. Not only was I impressed that there were children on stage – that this was something a young person might be able to do – but there was so much more to it than funny lines. There were theatrics, lighting and comedy characters, such as the famous pantomime dames.Michael Bertenshaw,one of our most famous dames, was very inspiring. I loved his massive hair, the bloomers and the songs – but mostly that he knew exactly how to get an audience on board.My cultural awakening: Buffy gave me the courage to escape my conservative Pakistani upbringingRead moreAfter that, I’d go to the panto every single year. Even though I knew what was coming next, the predictability made the chase scenes, the misunderstandings, the “He’s behind you!” jokes even funnier. I loved there was a baddie, and that you could boo and hiss at them. I remember going to see Dick Whittington and thinking: “I am so incredibly jealous of everyone who is doing this for a job.” Now I do get to do it as a character and sketch comic.To go to panto aged six, and see a show on such a big scale, with props and costumes, I realised thatthisis what you need to do to be properly engaging. Instead of, say, repeating the same line 10 times at the school nativity play.As told to Harriet GibsoneKiell Smith-Bynoe and Friends: Kool Story Brois atPleasance Courtyard,15 to 22 August;String v Spitta, with Ed MacArthur, is atAssembly George Square Studios,15 to 17 August.Explore more on these topicsCultureMy cultural awakeningComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My knee-jerk reaction is anomelette, egg fried rice, the occasionalokonomiyakibut not usually fried eggs, which are still working on their acceptance into my dinner canon. Recently, they made a bid for my affection via these Malaysian eggs, ortelur masak kicap, in which they are doused in an onion, sweet soy, garlic and chilli sauce that works splendidly over rice. Welcome to the party, fried eggs.Malaysian eggsKecap manis is a dark and rich, thick and sweet Indonesian soy sauce that can easily be found online and in most south-east Asian supermarkets.Prep10 minCook20 minServes24 tbsp neutral oil, such as rapeseed4 large eggs1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced3 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1-2 bird’s eye chillies, stalks discarded, flesh finely sliced2 tbsp kecap manis¼ tsp ground white pepper1 tbsp light soy sauceCooked short-grain or jasmine rice, to serveMeasure 120ml water into a jug and put to one side. Put two tablespoons of the oil in a nonstick pan on a medium-high heat – test it’s hot enough by putting a wooden spoon in the pan: if bubbles form around it, the oil is ready. Crack in the eggs one at a time and fry for four or five minutes, until the whites are set and the edges are golden and crisp. Transfer the eggs to a plate.Pour the remaining two tablespoons of oil into the same pan and turn down the heat to medium. Add the onion, fry, stirring, for seven minutes, then add the garlic and chilli, and fry for another three minutes.Stir in the kecap manis, white pepper, soy sauce and the measured-out water, then leave to cook for a minute, just until the sauce bubbles. Slide the eggs back into the pan, cook for another minute or two, then turn off the heat.Serve the eggs hot over steamed rice with plenty of the sauce spooned over the top.Explore more on these topicsMalaysian food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodEggsRiceVegetarian food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

After having no reception all day, her mobile started pinging with message after message containing verifications for her LinkedIn, Vinted andFacebookaccounts. Someone was trying to get in and change the contact details.At home she realised the hackers were also trying to take over herInstagramaccount. She tried to sort it out but it was late, she had work the next day and, she says: “I thought: ‘What damage could they do?’”What to do if you can’t get into your Facebook or Instagram accountRead moreWithin 24 hours she knew the answer: using her account, the hackers advertised tickets to Oasis’s Wembley Stadium gig on Saturday 26 July and stole £1,400 from her unsuspecting friends. They then sent a text demanding $100 (£75) to return the Instagram account. All day she was fielding messages from contacts. “I had about 20 different people text, saying they were about to send over the money and can I hold the tickets for them,” she says. “The hackers had impersonated me so well that my friends and family genuinely thought they were speaking to me.”Three weeks later, she is still locked out of her account, and Instagram has refused to recognise it as being fraudulent. It has ignored her requests for help. It did not respond to Guardian Money’s requests for comment.View image in fullscreenThe scammers’ post offered four tickets for the Oasis show at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 26 July.Photograph: SuppliedJones is a music fan and so the Instagram story offering four tickets to a concert did not seem out of place to her 600 followers – even her sister believed she had tickets to sell. “I’ve just returned from Glastonbury and I was away for Bruce Springsteen,” she says. “It’s not as if they’d taken it over and started advertising bitcoin.”The people who responded via Instagram were taken in by the scammers’ replies – one friend told her he thought they had been having a good catchup. It was only those who moved the conversation to WhatsApp or texts who found out pretty swiftly that the tickets did not exist. “They’re really impersonating me and it’s so invasive,” she says. “It’s distressing not knowing what is being said in my name.”View image in fullscreenA former colleague shared the post after a request from the scammers.Photograph: SuppliedThe fraudsters did not just leave the post for Jones’s followers to see – they messaged one of her former colleagues and asked them if they would share the posts. They agreed and inadvertently spread the scam more widely.The tickets were realistically priced and the post had good spelling and grammar. Victims were asked to pay into an account held with the online bank Revolut, with the fraudsters explaining that it was in the name of the friend who had originally bought the tickets.Official data shows £1.6m was lost tofraud involving gig ticketslast year – more than double the previous year’s figure – and Oasis’s high-profile reunion tour has been widely used to lure victims. Earlier this year, Lloyds Banking Group (which includes Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland) said more than 1,000 customers had fallen for scams linked to the Manchester band’s eagerly anticipated UK concerts.Lloyds said its data suggested that UK Oasis fans had lost more than £2m to fraudsters by March this year – the total is likely to have risen since. It found that fans lost an average of £436 each – about £200 more than the average amount stolen in a concert ticket scam – and said some had handed over more than £1,700.Chris Ainsley, the head of fraud risk management at the bank Santander, recently saw a Facebook account used for the scam – the post advertised four tickets, again for the 26 July concert, and included details of seat numbers and a WhatsApp number to contact. The scammers used the highlight tool to put it in front of the real account holder’s followers – this, Ainsley says, is a way to make a fraud “grow very quickly”.His team searched Facebook and found multiple other accounts had posted the same message, suggesting the same people had hacked them all.View image in fullscreenMessages from the scammers.Photograph: SuppliedJake Moore, a cybersecurity expert at ESET, says that by using Instagram and Facebook accounts linked to individuals, scammers give victims a false sense of security. “It’s not an Oasis Facebook group which is completely random – buying tickets there would be a complete gamble. Instead, they’re buying from people they know, or friends of friends – they’re verified. It’s doing exactly what we tell people to do,” he says.“The scammers can check the messages before and see how you sign off – if it’s a kiss or emoji maybe – and replicate that.” Moore says criminals who may be worried about their spelling or grammar giving them away can use AI to craft their messages. “Even if you take an extra minute to reply, the other person is not going to notice – you can even tell it to sign off each one with a smiley face, for instance.”You might think the criminals would carefully select accounts that give them the best chance of finding victims – Jones’s would have appealed because she loves live music – but the experts say that the fraud is not that sophisticated.Ainsley says the account he originally saw compromised had not been used since 2011, so anyone doing some due diligence might have taken that as a red flag. Moore says it is simply a numbers game, with criminals breaking into as many accounts as they can.Jones is not sure how the hackers got into her account but suspects she may have fallen victim to a phishing attack or used an insecure public wifi network.Moore says that often accounts are compromised because people use the same password in more than one place. Criminals will try the details across a range of sites – a practice known as “credentials stuffing”.In-app attacks are another way for fraudsters to get the details they need, Ainsley says. “Sometimes you will get a message that makes it look like you have been kicked off Facebook – it will ask for your details to log you back in,” he says.The best way to protect your account is to use the social media website’s two-factor authentication or two-step verification settings. “That extra layer will push the criminals to the next account – you are not the lowest hanging fruit,” Moore says.* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsScamsConsumer affairsOasisTicket pricesMusic industryFacebookInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The motor is silent, the playlist is birdsong and occasional bleating sheep; all is serene. “This is easier,” I say to myself with a smile, recalling my previous attempt to visit theAldeias Históricas– a dozen historic hamlets bound by a 1995 conservation project – using woeful public transport. Revisiting this unspoilt pocket of Portugal, 155 miles (250km) north-east of Lisbon, near the border with Spain, is going to be effortless in an EV. And, best of all, the transport doesn’t cost me a penny.An hour before, I arrived in Castelo Novo, a four-hour train ride from the capital, and currently the sole hub of the Aldeias Históricas’sSustainable Urban Mobility Scheme. It was launched in 2022 to address local transport issues by providing five free-to-hire electric vehicles, alongside other community-supporting projects. It sounded too good to be true, but I booked the maximum three-day rental – enough time to see at least nine of the villages. I was informed that if I arrived by train, someone would meet me at the station.View image in fullscreenSure enough, Duarte Rodrigues welcomes me like an old friend. “The project’s main focus is tourism to the historic villages, but some of the cars are used for the community, to take elderly people to the market or distribute meals,” he says on the gorgeous drive to the medieval hamlet of Castelo Novo, 650 metres up the slopes of the Serra da Gardunha. Take-up was nearly equal between tourists and residents, he adds.A few minutes later, outside the romanesque town hall, Duarte hands me the keys to my Megane E-Tech with a wave. It’s worth staying for a night atPedra Nova, a gorgeously renovated boutique B&B, but it needs to be booked well in advance and I am keen to make the most of my time in the EV. Having decided to skip popular Piódão and Monsanto – now a House of the Dragon jet-setting destination – my first stop is Belmonte. Like all 12aldeias, this hazy hilltop town played a pivotal role in Portugal’s identity. A Brazilian flag flutters behind a statue of local legend Pedro Álvares Cabral, the first European to “discover” Brazil. I stroll through the old Jewish Quarter’s single-storey granite houses to Bet Eliahu synagogue, built 500 years after King Manuel I’s 1496 decree expelling Jews from the kingdom.View image in fullscreenCentum Cellas, a Roman villa near Belmonte.Photograph: Luis Fonseca/Getty Images/iStockphotoContinuing to 12th-century Linhares da Beira, I wander the leafy slopes of the Serra da Estrela – mainland Portugal’s highest range. Similar to much-loved Monsanto, the hamlet lies between and atop giant granite boulders. From the largest rocky outcrop, where the castle’s crenellated walls rise, the Mondego valley’s panorama is endless. Other than an airborne paraglider and a man hawking hand-carved magnets in the car park, there’s not a soul in sight.I walk a stretch of slabbed Roman road that once linked Mérida in Spain to Braga, north of Porto, and remember why I adore these villages. History is bite-size, hushed and unhurried, the antithesis of my home in the Algarve. After a brief drive, I park up and plug in outside the medieval defences of the most populatedaldeia.These small villages benefit a lot from tourism because there aren’t many people living here or many opportunities, so people are moving to the big citiesFounded in the ninth century, handsome Trancoso hides behind hefty, turret-topped walls that have witnessed royal nuptials and numerous skirmishes. Today, walking beneath weathered porticos and streets lined with hydrangeas, it feels like the calmest place in the world. As doesSolar Sampaio e Melo, a palatial 17th-century guesthouse – repurchased by a descendant of the original owners in 2011 – with an honesty bar and a pool shaded by turrets.Following a late breakfast ofsardinhasdoces, Troncoso’s sardine-shaped, almond-stuffed sweets, I make for Marialva. The satnav states 30 minutes, but with back-road detours to gawp at giant granite mounds around Moreira de Rei, I reach the massif-mounted castle well after lunch. Occupied by the Aravos, a Lusitanian tribe, then the Romans and Moors, this was a crucial site for the advance of the Christian Reconquista.An old chap in a checkered shirt sits hammering almonds from their shells outside his home. I buy a bulging bag for €7 and gobble a handful inside the semi-ruined citadel, where Bonelli’s eagles soar and cacti reclaim the stone. The flavour transports me to my Algarvian childhood holidays, when I’d hide from the sun (and my parents) under almond trees. For a second, it feels like Portugal hasn’t changed in 30 years. Perhaps here, far from the coast, little has.View image in fullscreenThe castle at Marialva.Photograph: Vitor Ribeiro/AlamyThe journey to Castelo Rodrigo is filled with awe, particularly around the craggy valley sliced by the Côa river. Just upstream is a unique collection ofrock art etchingsfrom three eras – prehistory, protohistory and history – andFaia Brava, Portugal’s first private nature reserve, co-founded by biologist Ana Berliner, her husband and others. In 2004, the couple renovatedCasa da Cisternainto a boutique guesthouse, and on its wisteria-draped terrace, Ana welcomes me with sugared almonds and fresh juice. I enquire about Faia Brava (Ana guides guests on excursions to the reserve and the prehistoric rock art) and whether they’re concerned about tourism growing.“These small villages benefit a lot [from tourism] because there aren’t many people living here or many opportunities, so people are moving to the big cities,” she tells me. “If you retain your people, and your young people spend those days living here, it’s very good.”As I poke around the castle ruins, I mull over how the Portuguese writerJosé Saramagodescribed Castelo Rodrigo in Journey to Portugal (1981): “desolation, infinite sadness” and “abandoned by those who once lived here”. I’m reassured that Ana is right. Lisbon’s tourism boom has createdEurope’s least affordable cityfor locals. Yet, in these hinterlands, the right tourism approach could help preserve local customs.I tiptoe across the ruined castle keep, transfixed by the endless panorama of olive groves, cherry trees and shepherd hutsUnlike most of thealdeias, Castelo Rodrigo was founded by the Kingdom of León. It became Portuguese when the 1297 treaty of Alcanizes defined one of Europe’s oldest frontiers. Reminders of Spain linger, such as the Ávila-style semicircular turrets and ruined Cristóvão de Moura palace, constructed under the Habsburg Spanish kings. Portuguese locals later torched it.With no charging station in Castelo Rodrigo (work is under way to expand the project to other villages, including the installation of chargers and the opening of new bases with additional cars in 2026), I drive to Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, the modern town below. AtTaverna da Matildeflamingchouriçoscents the dining room, and the pork loin –bisaro, an indigenous part-pig, part‑boar – is perfect. I sleep like a prince at Casa da Cisterna.Breakfast is a casual, communal affair of buttery Seia mountain cheese andpão com chouriço, followed by a quick stop atCastelo Rodrigo’s wine cooperativeto collect a case of robust Touriga Nacional (tours and tastings €18pp). In Almeida, a star-shaped military town, I roam the grassy ramparts before continuing south. Swallows soon replace eagles, and granite fades into gentle farmland.View image in fullscreenApproaching Castelo Mendo.Photograph: Daniel James ClarkeI breathe in the silence, standing by Castelo Mendo’s twin-turreted gate. It feels like the world has stopped. I tiptoe across the ruined castle keep and am transfixed by the endless panorama of olive groves, cherry trees and occasional shepherd’s huts.In search of coffee, I step into a dimly lit stone room below a sign that reads D Sancho. Inside is an old-world retail marvel. Photos of popes, boxes of wine, retired horseshoes, mounds of old coins and “mystery boxes” that I’m tempted to spend a tenner on. A hunched woman with a smile gifts me a shot ofginjinha, the local cherry liquor, and signals me to sit with her on the bench outside. We don’t speak, yet I somehow feel a connection to her land. I buy a bottle in the hope of taking that feeling home.Discovering Spain’s Sierra de la Demanda: the land that social media forgotRead moreMy final stop, Sortelha, comes with high expectations – Saramago promised a perfectly preserved medieval town. Hulking walls cradle a 16th-century cluster of stone houses dominated by a castle that crowns an outcrop. Almost on cue, fog and showers shroud it all in mystery. I retreat toO Foral, where plates ofbacalhau(salted cod) are bathed in pistachio-hued local olive oil.Parking back in Castelo Novo with a panic-inducing 7% charge showing on the dash, I am grateful to return the keys, and use the time before my lift to the station to survey the Knights Templar’s former domain from the 12th-century castle.Stopping outside the red door where Saramago reportedly once stayed, I ponder how he would describe these villages 44 years later. Hopefully, he’d recount that, for the traveller,timeless magic remains, but those returning and reviving have vanquished any melancholy.Complimentary EVrentals of one to three days can be booked online atplataformaaldeiashistoricas.com; reservations open about 75 days in advance.For details of the 12 Aldeias Históricas, visitaldeiashistoricasdeportugal.comExplore more on these topicsPortugal holidaysEurope holidaysCultural tripsFood and drinkRoad tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then she laughed for a bit, then she hung up.“She says you have to go and see my father to request my hand in marriage,” my future wife said.“What?” I said. “Are you kidding?”“Apparently not,” she said. Her parents had been divorced since she was nine, but they were on good terms.“Fine,” I said, even though I’d already basically changed my mind about the whole business. I had to put off calling my own mother, in case my future father-in-law said no.We drove up the road to my girlfriend’s father’s house, where he lived with his second wife. They had only just got married themselves, or maybe they hadn’t yet. It was that same summer, in any case.We drank tea in the garden and made small talk for long enough that I began to hope the time for requesting hands had safely passed. Then my wife turned to her father and said, “Why don’t you show him your extension?”My wife’s father and I went upstairs to examine his half-finished loft conversion. If I recall correctly, the last leg of the journey was by ladder. He showed me where his spare bedroom and office and second bathroom would eventually go. And then a terrible silence fell, into which I cleared my throat awkwardly. I imagined there was a form of words for this sort of thing, but I didn’t know what it was.“So, I guess the reason I’ve come here today,” I said, “is really to ask your permission to marry your daughter.” A considerable pause followed.“I see,” he said finally, raising an eyebrow. “And how do you plan to keep her in the style to which she has become accustomed?” I didn’t expect questions.“Well,” I said. “I sort of figured she might eventually get used to worse.”He gave me a long and grave look, so grave that I cast my own eyes downward. That’s when I noticed there was no floor; we were standing on joists, and I was looking down into the room below us. I thought: it would be the work of a moment for him to push me through.He once babysat our dog, and insisted it had been no trouble. Had he taken the wrong dog?My father-in-law died a few weeks ago, at the age of 95. My wife was with him in hospital, and when she rang to tell me the news, I did not immediately think of this 33-year-old episode – the episode of the requesting of the hand. But it came to mind soon after I put the phone down.At the time I did not know my future father-in-law very well. I did not think of him as a man who was fond of mischief, or even capable of it. I had every reason to believe he was serious when he asked me that question, and that he strongly disapproved of my answer. It did not occur to me that he might just be messing with me, that he might have been tipped off about my intentions by his ex-wife. Or that he might have already put a celebratory bottle of champagne in the refrigerator in preparation. But he had.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Wait, yes, I did.”My father-in-law could also be a man of surprising and unprompted generosity, once volunteering to have our dog for the whole of Christmas and New Year, while we went away. When my wife rang him on Christmas Day – with justifiable apprehension – to see how things were working out, he insisted the dog had been no trouble.“Has he taken the right dog?” I said.Only later did we find out that just before lunch she’d pulled the Christmas ham off the table and run out the door with it. He had the right dog after all.The day after my father-in-law died I found myself back in his attic extension, with my wife and his wife and my three sons, going through old papers and photographs and stuff, the accumulation of a long life. I had been up in this room so few times over three decades that it was astonishing to see 30 years of wear on the walls and window frames.I reflected on how a true sense of mischief requires one to cultivate a certain reputation for sternness, so as not to give the game away. Of course people who know you will eventually catch on. You can’t fool them for ever.I looked down at my feet, and I thought: somewhere under there, under the carpet, under the floorboards, are the very joists we stood on.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Peter, 80, has been chained and shackled, and recently had convulsions on the floor, much to the alarm of Barbie, 75, who herself has suffered from malnourishment and reports her hands and feet have turned blue.“There’s a chance they die in there, and it’s escalating pretty fast,” their youngest son, Jonathan, 45, said. “They need to get to the hospital immediately.”Since the British couple’s arrest on 1 February, the Reynolds family have been thrown into a nightmare, watching from afar as their elderly parents havestruggled in a brutal prison systemwhere they are being been held without charge.At first, Peter and Barbie would call their family regularly from prison but there has been no contact from them for more than a month, and the UN hasintervened to warn they may die in “degrading conditions”if they do not receive hospital treatment soon.Officials from the British Foreign Office met the couple in prison last week, but there has still been no official confirmation of plans for their release.The couple have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, running training and education programmes.Since the Taliban regained control in 2021 they have banned education for girls over 12, and women are not allowed to work. But Barbie became the first woman to receive a certificate of appreciation from the Taliban, which the family said showed how their work was accepted in the local context.View image in fullscreenPeter and Barbie Reynolds in Afghanistan before their imprisonment.Photograph: APAfter meeting at the University of Bath in the 1960s, Peter and Barbie married in Afghanistan 55 years ago, and vowed to dedicate their lives to the country. Barbie spent many of her childhood summers there helping at an institution for blind people.Jonathan said he had a vivid memory of sitting on his parents’ bed, aged 15, asking them what he should do with his life. “They said, one of the best things you can do is live in the service of others. Live to help other people, and you’ll find the greatest joy and the greatest reward,” he said from his home in Chicago.“The reason I tell that story is I think it sheds light on who they are as people.”After the Taliban takeover, the couple decided to stay despite the security risks. “They said: ’How could we possibly leave these people we love in their darkest hour?’ But the warning was, if you stay, you’re on your own,” Jonathan said. “They knew full well that something like this could happen.“We’ve counted the cost as a family for that. They have always said: ‘If this does happen, don’t trade us for some terrorist who’s in prison, and don’t pay a penny in ransom money.’ But they never told us what theydidwant us to do, which has been really, really difficult.”At first, Peter said he would not leave prison without Joya, an Afghan interpreter who was arrested alongside the couple and has since been released. “Dad was like: ‘You’ll have to kill me. Do not let him stay in here. He has done nothing wrong,’” Jonathan recalled. “I think they could have maybe got out a lot earlier but those kind of demands, although selfless, made it more difficult.”Jonathan said his father had remained unflinchingly polite and upbeat, and has downplayed his health problems.“He’ll say something like: ‘Oh, we’re being treated very well. I have a lovely mattress on the floor and there’s a bathroom nearby.’ I’m like: ‘OK, but you’re still in prison, unjustly,’” he said.His mother, he said, had given a more honest account of their time in prison, reporting that there were women who had been there for months because they were not allowed to leave without a male to escort them.Barbie and Peter have five children, 17 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, who live across the UK and US. They last all convened with Peter and Barbie about 18 months ago in Dubai, and are a close family despite the geographical distance between them.View image in fullscreenPeter and Barbie Reynolds.Photograph: Family handout“It has been painful, stressful and emotionally taxing. The nature of my parents, they raised kids who are very much: ‘Hold my beer and I’ll fix this thing’,” he said. “We’re all fixers and we’re all make-it-happen people. And we are completely stuck.”Despite the situation, the family have found moments of humour.“Every time my dad calls, even from prison in Afghanistan, he says: ‘Hello son, is now a good time?’ What do you mean is now a good time?” Jonathan said. “My brother would actually joke around and say: ‘Actually I’m in a pedicure right now, can you call back in 20 minutes?’”Jonathan said he had seen negative comments about his parents on social media, and was aware of how some people perceived the case.“I have seen people saying: ‘Let them die there, we’re not using British taxpayer money on this,’” he said.“But this is not just an emotional plea from some adult kids saying: ‘Somebody help my parents because they were on vacation in a place they shouldn’t have been.’ That’s not what this is …. They know full well the risks, but they are being held in an unjust manner, and they are innocent.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lawsuit said evidence clearly disproved this “grotesque narrative”, which had become “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”.The case prompted broader questions this week about how conspiracy theories spread worldwide, whether they can be stopped in the courts and what this false narrative, which began inFranceafter the Covid pandemic, says about French society’s distrust in politicians.“This is now one of the biggest fake news stories worldwide in terms of popularity–a billion people have seen it,” said Emmanuelle Anizon, a senior journalist for the French weeklyNouvel Obs, who last year published a book,L’Affaire Madame, investigating the origins of the rumour in France. “What’s new is that for the first time, Emmanuel Macron has joined his wife in taking legal action.”The Macrons’ US lawsuit states the accusation that Brigitte Macron was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux is completely false and Trogneux is in fact is her older brother. Trogneux, 80, lives in the northern French town of Amiens, where he grew up with Brigitte and four other siblings in a family famous for its local chocolate business. He was present in public alongside his Brigitte at Emmanuel Macron’s two presidential inaugurations in 2017 and 2022.Owens, whose podcast and social media channels have an audience of millions, said this week she stood by her narrative.The false claim that Brigitte was a man first went viral in France in 2021, at a moment when distrust of politicians in was at a high, after thegilets jaunes(yellow vests) anti-government protest movement and the Covid pandemic that killed more than 130,000 people in France.View image in fullscreenAn anti-health pass protest in Paris in 2021, which was called by thegilets jaunesmovement against France’s pandemic-era restrictions.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersIn December 2021, a woman who used the name Amandine Roy and called herself a “spiritual medium”, broadcast a four-hour YouTube interview with Natacha Rey, 51, who had worked previously for a small essential oils business and described herself as “an independent investigative journalist, self-taught, and not from the inner circle of mainstream media”.Rey said she had spent three years investigatingBrigitte Macron, after questioning the first lady’s body-shape in photos. Rey said she believed Brigitte Macron was actually a man called Jean-Michel Trogneux. Within hours, the interview had 500,000 views and the hashtag #Jean-MichelTrogneux was trending on social media in France, promoted by, among others, some far-right and anti-vaccine accounts. A small far-right newsletter had already published Rey’s theories but it was the video interview that sent the claim viral.“There was a deeper societal problem at that time in France: the mistrust of political, media and economic institutions,” Anizon said. “There had been years of political health scandals worldwide and in France – from a contaminated blood scandal to theMediator weight-loss drug. Many people had gradually reached a point of distrust, switching off traditional mainstream media and turning instead to online accounts – Covid and vaccine mistrust increased that.”The rumour spread in part because theMacrons’ relationship had long been a topic of comment online. Brigitte Macron, who is 24 years older, first met Emmanuel Macron when she was a French teacher at his Jesuit secondary school in Amiens, directing him in a school play.View image in fullscreenCandace Owens has stood by her comments and assertions made in an eight-part podcast series.Photograph: Octavio Jones/ReutersThe Macrons’ US lawsuit this week stated: “Through the school’s theatre programme, president Macron and Mrs Macron formed a deeper intellectual connection.” It added: “At all times the teacher-student relationship between Mrs Macron and President Macron remained within the bounds of the law.” Brigitte Macron, who has three children from her first marriage, divorced in 2006 and she and Emmanuel Macron married the following year when he was 30.In early 2022, after the first viral video allegations, Brigitte Macron and her brother, Jean-Michel Trogneux, filed a defamation case in France against Roy and Rey, who both denied wrongdoing.In September 2024, a Paris court found the two women guilty and ordered them to pay €8,000 in damages to Brigitte Macron and €5,000 in damages to Jean-Michel Trogneux.The women appealed against the verdict and, this month, they were acquitted by a Paris appeals court. The appeal court verdict did not imply that the claims that Brigitte Macron was a man were true, but instead judges ruled that the case against the women did not fit the definition of defamation.Brigitte Macron and Jean-Michel Trogneux have taken the case to France’s highest appeals court, the cour de cassation. Brigitte Macron has filed a separate case for online harassment and 10 people will go on trial in Paris in October.Each time the Macrons’ relationship is in the spotlight, the false allegations about gender spread again online. This was the case in May, when video imagesappeared to show Brigitte pushing her husband away with both hands on his facebefore they disembarked from a plane on a tour of Southeast Asia. Macron dismissed the incident as play-fighting, telling reporters that “we are squabbling and, rather, joking with my wife”, and that it had been overblown into “a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe”.Brigitte Macron has not spoken publicly on the false gender claims since 2022 when she told French radio, RTL, that allegations that “I am my brother” were an “impossible” attack on her parents’ family tree. She told TF1 TV at the time she wanted to set an example so other people would not suffer in the same way. She said fighting online bullying “is my battle”.Explore more on these topicsBrigitte MacronEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the first time they had hugged him since he left Venezuela last year. And it was the first time they could be sure – truly sure – that he was alive and well since he disappeared into the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot) in March.“We have been waiting for this moment for months, and I feel like I can finally breathe,” said Roynerliz Rodríguez, Ramos Bastidas’s partner. “These last months have been a living nightmare, not knowing anything about José Manuel and only imagining what he must be suffering. I am happy he is free from Cecot, but I also know that we will never be free of the shadow of this experience. There must be justice for all those who suffered this torture.”The Venezuelan deportees were repatriated last week following a deal between the US and Venezuelan governments. Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, negotiated a prisoner swap that released 10 American citizens in his custody and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners in exchange for the release of his citizens from Cecot.This week, after undergoing medical and background checks, they are finally reuniting with their families. Theirtestimoniesof what they experienced inside Cecot are providing the first, most detailed pictures of the conditions inside Cecot, a mega-prison that human rights groups say is designed to disappear people.Ramos Bastidas and other US deportees were told that they were condemned to spend 30 to 90 years in Cecot unless the US president ordered otherwise, he told his lawyers. They were shot with rubber bullets on repeated occasions – including on Friday, during their last day of detention.In interviews with the media and in testimony provided to their lawyers, other detainees described lengthy beatings and humiliation by guards. After some detainees tried to break the locks on their cell, prisoners were beaten for six consecutive days, theAtlantic reports.Male guards reportedly brought in female colleagues, who beat the naked prisoners and recorded videos.Edicson David Quintero Chacón, a US deportee, said that he was placed in isolation for stretches of time, during which he thought he would die, his lawyer told the Guardian. Quintero Chacón, who has scars from daily beatings, also said that he and other inmates were only provided soap and an opportunity to bathe on days when visitors were touring the prison – forcing them to choose between hygiene and public humiliation.Food was limited, and the drinking water was dirty, Quintero Chacón and other detainees have said. Lights were on all night, so detainees could never fully rest. “And the guards would also come in at night and beat them at night,” said his lawyer Stephanie M Alvarez-Jones, the south-east regional attorney at the National Immigration Project.In a filing asking for a dismissal of her months-long petition on behalf of her clients’ release, Alvarez-Jones wrote: “He will likely carry the psychological impact of this torture his whole life. The courts must never look away when those who wield the power of the US government, at the highest levels, engage in such state-sanctioned violence.”Ramos Bastidas has never been convicted of any crimes in the US (or in any country). In fact, he had never really set foot in the US as a free man.In El Tocuyo, in the Venezuelan state of Lara, and had been working since he was a teenager to support his family. Last year, he decided to leave his country – which has yet to recover from an economic collapse – to seek better income, so he could pay for medical care for his infant with severe asthma.In March 2024, he arrived at the US-Mexico border and presented himself at a port of entry. He made an appointment using the now-defunct CBP One phone application to apply for asylum – but immigration officials and a judge determined that he did not qualify.But Customs and Border Protection agents had flagged Ramos Bastidas as a possible member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, based on an unsubstantiated report from Panamanian officials and his tattoos. So they transferred him to a detention facility, where he was to remain until he could be deported.Despite agreeing to return to Venezuela, he remained for months in detention. “I think what is particularly enraging for José is that he had accepted his deportation,” said Alvarez-Jones. “He was asking for his deportation for a long time, and he just wanted to go back home.”In December, Venezuela wasn’t accepting deportees – so Ramos Bastidas asked if he could be released and make his own way home. A month later, Donald Trump was sworn in as president. Everything changed.Ramos Bastidas began to see other Venezuelans were being sent to the military base in Guantánamo Bay in Cuba – and he feared the same would happen to him. On 14 March, he shared with his family that maybe he would be able to come back to Venezuela after all, after officials began prepping him for deportation.The next day, he was flown to Cecot.“They could have deported him to Venezuela,” Alvarez-Jones. “Instead, the US government made a determination to send him to be tortured in Cecot.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationVenezuelaEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

I am trying to simplify a complex situation!”Minutes later, he posted: “I have just spoken to the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand, and it was a very good conversation. Thailand, like Cambodia, wants to have an immediate Ceasefire, and PEACE. I am now going to relay that message back to the Prime Minister of Cambodia.”Trump added in a subsequent post that both sides had agreed to “immediately meet” to work out a ceasefire.“They are also looking to get back to the ‘Trading Table’ with the United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the fighting STOPS,” he said. Both Cambodia and Thailand are facing the prospect of a 36% US tariff from 1 August.Why are Thailand and Cambodia engaged in a border conflict?Read moreInternational calls for a ceasefire have been growing sincea long-running border dispute between the two countries erupted into intense fightingon Thursday, with heavy artillery and airstrikes. The UN secretary general called for the “utmost restraint”, while Malaysia, which chairs the regional bloc that includes both countries, urged both sides to stand down and offered to mediate. China has also expressed concern over the developments.Cambodia’s UN ambassador Chhea Keo said on Friday that Cambodia asked for an “immediate ceasefire – unconditionally”, following an emergency meeting held behind closed doors late on Friday in New York. Cherdchai Chaivaivid, Thailand’s envoy to the UN urged Cambodia to “immediately cease all hostilities and acts of aggression, and resume dialogue in good faith”.mapOn Saturday morning, the Cambodian ministry of national defence accused Thailand of firing five heavy artillery shells into multiple locations in Pursat province, on the southern side of their shared border, saying it condemned such “unprovoked and premeditated act of aggression”.Thailand accused Cambodia of initiating an attack in neighbouring Trat province, and said that Thai naval forces had successfully pushed back “the incursion” by 5.40am.Cambodia and Thailand’s border dispute dates back more than a century to disagreements over colonial-era maps. Tensions have been running high since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a brief exchange of fire, but escalated further this week when Thai solders were injured by landmines, which Thai officials claimed had been freshly planted – an allegation Cambodia has denied.Thailand responded by recalling its ambassador to Cambodia, and saying it would expel Cambodia’s envoy in Bangkok, and, on Thursday morning fighting erupted at multiple points along the border. Both sides blamed each other for opening fire first, and have accused the other side of violating international norms.In Thailand 20 people have been killed, including 13 civilians and seven soldiers, while 29 soldiers and 30 civilians were wounded. In Cambodia, officials reported 12 further deaths, five soldiers and eight civilians, bringing its death toll to 13.More than138,000 people have been evacuatedfrom Thailand’s border regions, its health ministry said, with families sheltering at temples, schools and municipality centres. Cambodian authorities said more than 23,000 people have evacuated from areas near the border.View image in fullscreenPeople evacuated from border areas gather at Surindra Rajabhat University evacuation centre in Thailand.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEarlier, acting Thai prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai had warned that if the situation escalated, “it could develop into war”.“For now, it remains limited to clashes,” he told reporters in Bangkok, adding that Thailand was taking action to “protect our land and the sovereignty of our nation.”Both countries have traded blame over the clashes. Thailand accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including a hospital hit by shells and a petrol station hit by at least one rocket. Cambodia has accused Thailand of using cluster munitions.‘At least here I can’t hear the blasts’: Thai evacuees flee Cambodian border clashesRead moreDozens of kilometres in several areas of the 800km border are contested. Fighting previously broke out between 2008 and 2011, leaving at least 28 people dead and tens of thousands displaced.The latest dispute has been exacerbated by a feud that has broken out between the fathers of the prime ministers of Cambodia and Thailand. Hun Sen, an authoritarian ruler who handed power to his son, Hun Manet, in 2023, and Thailand’s former populist leader Thaksin Shinawatra, whose daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister in 2024, both remain highly influential in their countries. They were once considered close friends but are now embroiled in a bitter dispute, trading insults, threats and counter-claims on social media.Thaksin visited Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, on Saturday morning, and denied the families’ feud was the cause of the clashes, according to local media reports. He condemned Cambodia’s actions as “appalling” and said attacks from the Thai side followed strict protocols and were targeted at military sites.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificCambodiaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the most recent clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have been fuelled by another factor: a bitter feud between two powerful political patriarchs.Hun Sen, 72, and Thaksin Shinawatra, 76, former leaders of Cambodia and Thailand, were once such close friends they reportedly called one another brothers. Hun Sen has, over the years, supported Thaksin’s family during their long-running power struggle with Thailand’s military. Thaksin and his sister Yingluck stayed at Hun Sen’s home after they were ousted from power, while Hun Sen appointed Thaksin an economic adviser to the Cambodian government. Thaksin frequently visited Cambodia, and Hun Sen was the first foreign guest to see the former Thai leader after hereturned home after more than 15 years in self-imposed exile.Why are Thailand and Cambodia engaged in a border conflict?Read moreBut relations have broken down spectacularly over recent months. The exact reasons for their feud are unclear, but analysts say it has created an additional layer of volatility that is exacerbating deadly clashes on the neighbouring countries’ border.Hun Sen and Thaksin are no longer in office in their respective countries, but both remain powerful. Hun Sen ruled for almost 40 years until 2003, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister after runningvirtually uncontested in a sham election. Thaksin’s daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister last year.View image in fullscreenHun Sen ruled Cambodia for almost 40 years until 2003, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister.Photograph: Heng Sinith/APThe extent of their falling out became clear last month, when Hun Senleaked a recording of a phone conversationbetween himself and Paetongtarn.In the call, which was about the border dispute, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen “uncle” and told him if there was anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made disparaging comments about a senior Thai military commander.The leaked recording caused uproar in Thailand. Critics accused her of kowtowing to Cambodia, putting her family connections before the country’s national interests. She wassuspended from officeby the constitutional court in July pending an investigation into ethical violations.It’s not clear why Hun Sen chose to turn on his former friends. He has accused Thaksin of betrayal and threatened to reveal further sensitive information about the Shinawatras. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way,” Thaksin said later, declaring their friendship over.The leaked phone call that could ring the changes for one of Thailand’s most powerful dynastiesRead moreSome analysts say Hun Sen may be trying to whip up nationalism domestically to increase support for his son, Hun Manet.Others suggest Hun Sen has been angered by Thailand’s efforts to crack down on so-called “scam compounds” where trafficked workers are held and forced to target people around the world with online scams. This form of lucrative criminal activity has proliferated in the region over recent years, especially inCambodia.“The popular narrative in Thailand is that the two men may have had some kind of personal dealings behind the scenes that did not go according to plan and the fallout has spilled over into the realm of national interest,” said Tita Sanglee, associate fellow with ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.Whatever his motivations, Hun Sen has succeeded in damaging Thaksin’s position, exploiting divisions between his family and the military, and creating a power vacuum in Thailand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has stamped out virtually all opposition voices and independent media. “When he chooses to take a strong stance, militarily or politically, it has immediate and direct consequences.”On Thursday night, Thaksin said he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate the border dispute, but would like to wait, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and first teach this cunning Hun Sen a lesson.”Given Thaksin’s weakened position, he may not have a choice but to let the military take the lead.Last week Thailand downgraded it diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador, and saying it would expel the country’s envoy in Bangkok.Thaksin has denied the families’ feud was the cause of the clashes. However awkward questions about his friend turned foe are likely to continue.As he visited communities sheltering from the conflict in Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, a woman confronted him: “You’re Hun Sen’s friend, aren’t you? Is he your friend? Why do you allow Cambodia to shoot Thai people?”Solving territorial disagreements is difficult in any context, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. “No country would like to sacrifice any inch of sovereignty,” he said. But the personal conflict between Hun Sen and Thaksin has, he added, made their countries’ dispute even more unpredictable.Explore more on these topicsCambodiaThailandAsia PacificThaksin ShinawatraanalysisShareReuse this content"

The obstructionsled to mass protestsfrom which the recall movement was born. The KMT are likely to be emboldened by their resounding victory on Saturday.A flipping of just six KMT seats in Taiwan’s 113-seat legislature could have freed up president Lai Ching-te and the DPP’s agenda, but would also very likely draw increased hostility from China’s ruling Communist party, which despises Lai and his party, considering them “separatists” foropposing its plan to annex Taiwan.Seven seats are still to vote on their recall motions in coming weeks, but Saturday’s losses will put the pressure on the campaigners to get six to vote “agree”.On Saturday night, Lai urged people to accept the results of the vote, saying it was “not a victory for one party, nor a defeat for the other”, but a demonstration of democracy.“After today, we still have many challenges, but we must prove to the world that Taiwan is a country that is capable of resolving internal disputes with a constitutional system, and is also a country that can unite each other with a democratic spirit after competition,” he said.The KMT praised the result as a decisive rejection of DPP efforts to “overturn” an election. It also urged people not to see it “as a signal on cross-Strait or foreign policy, nor should it be interpreted through the lens of ‘pro-China’ or ‘pro-Taiwan’ alignment”.“We stand with the people of Taiwan in their call for stability, competence and inclusive governance,” it said.William Yang, a senior north-east Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group, said the recall campaign had deepened divisions in Taiwan.“All sides, including all political parties in Taiwan, will need to seriously reflect on the process of this recall campaign and think about how they may be able to find common ground on issues that are key to Taiwan’s security and prosperity,” he said.Total recall? Campaigners employ quirk of Taiwan’s political system to turn on ‘pro-China’ candidatesRead moreYang said it also raised questions about the DPP using the threat posed by China in election campaigning, “at least at a local level”.“China may view Saturday’s result as a sign that more Taiwanese people are not in favour of the ‘China threat’ rhetoric promoted by [Lai and the DPP], and this may make them feel like peaceful unification remains a viable option for them to resolve the ultimate ‘Taiwan question’,” Yang said.“However, this doesn’t also mean that Beijing would dial down the level of military and political pressure that they are imposing on Taiwan.”The unprecedented vote hasfired up the island’s population, just 18 months after a national election. Large rallies were held in Taipei on the eve of the vote, with tens of thousands turning out to support both sides.At an emotional DPP rally on Saturday, the campaign volunteer Julia Lin told the Guardian she was concerned the KMT would now feel “invincible”.“Their actions have been extremely reckless, and they’ve lost the democratic values and legal knowledge that legislators in Taiwan should have,” she said.“We didn’t succeed, but I believe we still need to keep trying to get our voices out there and attract more people to get involved to care about what’s happening in Taiwan right now.”View image in fullscreenA child cheers as supporters of the Kuomintang party attend a rally against the recall campaign before Saturday’s vote.Photograph: Annabelle Chih/ReutersThe pro-recall campaign was driven by civil society groups and activists, but was subsequently endorsed by the DPP. They had aimed to oust as many as 31 KMT legislators who, they say, are pro-China actors who have risked Taiwan’s national security.The KMT denies the accusations. They, like the DPP, oppose annexation by the Communist party of China (CCP), but say the best way to protect the status quo is through friendlier ties with Beijing. The party and its supporters have labelled the recall campaign an anti-democratic power-grab by people who won’t accept the results of last year’s election.Retaliatory campaigns against DPP seats by the KMT all failed, with dozens of officials arrested over allegedly faking signatures.Beijing has also denounced the recall campaign. The Taiwan affairs office previouslyaccused Lai of being a dictator and seeking to achieve “one-party dominance”.Taiwan’s mainland affairs council this week said it was “evident and clear” that the CCP was trying to interfere in Taiwan’s democratic process.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Four of them are subject to previous arrest warrants, each carrying a reward of 1m Hong Kong dollars (£95,000).View image in fullscreenElmer Yuen shows his Hong Kong passport during an interview in Vancouver in 2023.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockAmong the remaining 15, for each of whom police are offering a reward of 200,000 Hong Kong dollars, are those said to have organised or run in the election and been sworn in as its councillors.Feng Chongyi, a China studies professor at the University of Technology Sydney who was also listed, decried the bounty against him as “ridiculous”.“They’ve got the power, they’ve got the influence overseas, they want to control everything even overseas,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald.The UK’s foreign and home secretaries condemned the move in a joint statement, calling the arrests “another example of transnational repression” and saying it damages Hong Kong’s international reputation.“[The UK] will not tolerate attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas,” they said in a statement on Friday.In response, the Chinese embassy in the UK said the British government’s remarks “constitute a gross interference” in China’s internal affairs and the rule of law in Hong Kong.“China urges the UK to abandon its colonial mentality, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs … stop shielding criminals,” it said.Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, also strongly objected to the arrest warrants. “Freedom of expression and assembly are essential to our democracy,” she said on X.“We have consistently expressed our strong objections to China and Hong Kong on the broad and extraterritorial application of Hong Kong’s national security legislation, and we will continue to do so.”The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy, including freedom of speech, under a “one country, two systems” formula.Critics of the national security law say government are using it to stifle dissent. Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly said the law was vital to restore stability after the city was rocked for months by sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.Police reiterated that national security offences were serious crimes with extraterritorial reach and urged the wanted individuals to return to Hong Kong and surrender.“If offenders voluntarily give up continuing to violate the crime, turn themselves in, truthfully confess their crimes, or provide key information that helps solve other cases, they may be eligible for reduced punishment,” they said in a statement.Police also said that aiding, abetting, or funding others to participate in the Hong Kong Parliament group could be a criminal offence.Explore more on these topicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It only became public information because the party decided to report it. The attack also affected the United Australia party.Supporters were told that data obtained in the attack could include email addresses, phone numbers, identity records, banking records, employment history, and other documents, but that the party was unsure of the amount of information compromised.Clive Palmer’s Trumpet of Patriots and United Australia parties hit with data breachRead moreIt is unclear whether Palmer’s political parties were required to publicly report the breaches at all.Under the AustralianPrivacyAct, political parties are exempt from reporting on data breaches and many of the obligations under the act that govern how personal information must be handled.TheUnited Australia partywas deregistered at the time of the attack, meaning the exemption it previously held may no longer apply, but the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner could not comment on whether that was the case.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA 2022 attorney general’s department report on privacy law reform highlighted that the broad political party exemption was a growing risk, as political parties could hold vast amounts of sensitive data including profiling on people to target in the electorate.The report found “almost all” of the submissions to its inquiry said the exemption was not justifiable and should be narrowed or removed, and the inquiry heard there was “no clear reason why parties should not be accountable for keeping personal information secure”.The policy thinktank Reset Australia warned in its submission that malicious actors could exploit the weaknesses in party security to interfere in democratic processes.The attorney general’s department recommended a narrowing of the exemption for political parties, including requiring parties to protect personal information, take reasonable steps to destroy personal information when no longer needed and comply with the notifiable data breach scheme to report a breach when it happens.Tom Sulston, head of policy at Digital Rights Watch, said the Trumpet of Patriots breach was a “clear demonstration that it is no longer acceptable for political parties to enjoy an exemption from Australia’s Privacy Act”.“Political parties not only have privileged access to the electoral roll and thereby the personal information of all voters, but also, through their memberships and organising systems, data about our political beliefs and demographics,” he said.The information obtained by parties was very valuable, he said, and could be dangerous for those who were profiled by the parties.“Most political parties … do take seriously their responsibilities to look after our data: the federal government regularly distributes grants to parties to help them secure their systems,” he said.“So the good news is that removing their exemption from the Privacy Act won’t actually cause them a huge amount of effort or trouble.”Sulston said removing the exemption would ensure people were informed if their data was lost, and those people could then seek legal or financial remedies.“That’s much more robust than relying on parties’ goodwill or desire to avoid bad publicity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the worry about fairness is realFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastSat 26 Jul 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Jul 2025 20.30 EDTShareWhenJim Chalmerssaidwe needed a national debate on reforming the economy to drive the next generation of prosperity, he scolded the media for its penchant for playing therule-in-rule-out game.The irony is that from his high horse, the treasurer had almost certainly ruled out one big change: lifting or broadening theGST.If Chalmersis being disingenuouswhen he suggests nothing is off the table at next month’s talkfest – and he absolutely is – then he should have ruled out changes to the consumption tax from the very start.Many economists argue that lifting or broadening the GST is an essential ingredient in any reform package that fundamentally improves the efficiency of the tax system.More GST revenue can pay for cuts to income and company tax rates, for example. This shift provides a structurally more stable tax revenue base, and sharpens incentives to work and invest.The biggest voices need to admit Australia is a low-taxing nation before joining the economic reform conversation | Greg JerichoRead moreLabor as a party, however, is fundamentally opposed to changing the tax on consumption on the basis that it hurts poorer Australians.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAnd theworry about fairnessis real.New analysis by the ANU’s Ben Phillips shows that the GST is “highly regressive”.Phillips’ modelling shows the bottom fifth of income earners pay 5.4% of their income on consumption taxes. That’s more than twice as much as the top 20% of households, where GST accounts for 2.6% of disposable income.Broadening the GST to include the things currently excluded – such as fresh food and education – makes the tax even more regressive.Phillips finds consumption taxes as a share of household budgets climbs to 7.9% for the lowest incomes, and 3.5% for those at the top.“I think equity concerns are spot on,” Phillips says.“There would have to be a complicated new approach to compensation for lower and middle income workers to make it politically feasible.“We would be relying on there being some substantial economic gains from increasing the GST, and they are probably relatively modest.”If the economics of broadening or lifting the GST are challenging, the politics are horrendous.The first hurdle is the most obvious: the states get the revenue, while the commonwealth cops the heat.Even if the Albanese government could agree with its state and territory counterparts to share the proceeds, there is also the problem that the GST distribution system has been fundamentally undermined by the obscenely generous deal with Western Australia, the country’s richest state.As such, a bigger GST pile without getting rid of this distortion would simply exacerbate what Saul Eslake has called “possibly the worst public policy decision of the 21st century”.Labor eyes ambitious tax reform but it must be ready for vicious backlash from vested interests | Tom McIlroyRead moreWhich begs the question: can we get meaningful tax reform without lifting the GST?Ken Henry, who authored a major tax paper in 2010 and is considered the country’s high priest of reform, argues that “tax reform cannot be done piecemeal; a big package will be required”.He recently told The Conversation’s Michelle Grattan “it would be better not to constrain the reform process by ruling out the GST”.“Having said that, I do think it’s possible to achieve major reform of the Australian taxation system without necessarily increasing the rate or extending the base of the GST.”Such reforms could be paid for via higher taxes on natural resources, and on wealth and savings – both on capital gains and income from that capital (thinkproperty investmentsandsuperannuation).Chalmers’ narrative for the reform roundtable apparently leans into Henry’s view around some kind of tax “grand bargain”.But again, the treasurer’s ambition is much more narrow.He has famously described his approach to reform as “bite-size chunks”, and defended his policy initiatives since coming to power as “modest but meaningful”.In fact, the most obvious next steps for Labor when it comes to tax is reforming the treatment of family trusts, and introducing a road user charge to replace dwindling fuel excise revenue.Whether we need another roundtable to get there is an open question.Viva Hammer, who played a key role in designing America’s immenseTaxCuts and Jobs Act of 2017, had some advice for policymakers.Speaking at a tax round table organised by the independent MP Allegra Spender, Hammer said the ambition should be “to think about doing something better, and not something perfect, because perfection is for the angels”.Breaking it down to the lowest common denominator, the independent economist Chris Richardson’s advice is “let’s just stop doing dumb things”.Speaking at the same event in Parliament House on Friday, Richardson said his number one “dumb thing” is how we tax gas through the petroleum rent resources tax (PRRT).Australia over recent years has become a gas superpower. And yet, incredibly, the tax take has not changed at all, Richardson says.Labor’s tweaks to the PRRT have not changed this reality – as Richardson says, the forecasts for revenue from this tax are a “big fat nothing” in future years.“Some people say you can’t change because there would be some ‘sovereign risk’,” he said, referring to the claims that altering these rules puts off foreign investors and can choke off funding for the industry.“Sovereign risk is where one side gets next to nothing across a long period of time, and our own stupidity has got us there, and we should do better.”Richardson believes we are also not charging banks enough for the implicit “too big to fail” insurance provided by taxpayers.The two suggestions, he said, could raise $5-6bn a year.Explore more on these topicsGSTJim ChalmersTaxAustralian politicsAustralian economyBusinessanalysisShareReuse this content"

The poll, which aired on Saturday, was open to Australian releases from any time in history.Never Tear Us Apart was a global hit forINXS, charting in the US, UK and Europe as well as at home in Australia. The ballad, written by the band’s frontman, Michael Hutchence, for his then-girlfriend, reigns in a crowded discography as the group’s most unforgettable anthem, made wondrous by Hutchence’s desperate, stirring vocals. INXS also had their track Need You Tonight feature in Saturday’s poll, at No 59.Meg Washington: ‘Why make art at all? What’s the point? Sometimes I feel like the violinist on the Titanic’Read moreThe Hilltop Hoods came second in the poll with their 2013 single The Nosebleed Section. The hip-hop track was a 10 times platinum-selling hit in Australia and is still one of the highest-selling homegrown singles of all time.The top five was rounded out by the Veronicas’ Untouched in third, Missy Higgins’s breakthrough hit Scar in fourth and Crowded House’s Don’t Dream It’s Over in fifth. The latter was one of three appearances in the poll from the band, which formed in Melbourne but whose frontman, Neil Finn, was born and raised in New Zealand, a heritage that has sparked a decades-long debate about which country gets to claim the rock group.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhile the top 10 spanned tracks from the 1970s, 80s and 90s, the 2000s had more songs overall in the poll than any other decade. The top 10 also included two tracks from Cold Chisel – Flame Trees and Khe Sanh – as well as Powderfinger’s My Happiness, Paul Kelly’s Christmas classic, How To Make Gravy, and Gotye and Kimbra’s chart-topping collaboration Somebody That I Used to Know.Double J announced The Hottest 100 of Australian songs in the wake of January’s Hottest 100,which featured just 29 songs from Australian acts. That’s a poor showing compared with previous years, when homegrown acts have typically made up more than 50% of the songs in the countdown – and an uncomfortable result for a station that is government-mandated to support Australian music.Lachlan Macara, the head of Triple J, promised at the time that the station had “some big things cooking on how we can remind people about the unique cultural worth of Australian music”. He attributed the 2025 poll’s lack of local acts in part to a changing music industry, in which social media and streaming platforms are increasingly important for music discovery, but can be tough to crack.“What I hear from Australian artists is that it can be a real challenge to cut through the algorithm,” he said. “But we’ll keep playing our part in supporting Australian artists and try to give them a chance to reach the wide audiences they deserve … I think there’s a chance to have a wider conversation about how we can all support Australian music.”The Hottest 100 of Australian Songs has proven a big success for the station. Triple J counted more than 2.65 million votes for the poll, more than any of the last four years of the annual song poll received. According to Triple J, it is the fourth-biggest Hottest 100 they have run. While it was a social media hit with millennial and Gen X Australians – with many posting their votes on Instagram – Double J revealed that 18 to 29-year-olds were still the most popular voters.One Australian artist not placated by the special edition poll was Ben Lee, whoposted on Instagramthat every year of the Hottest 100 should be local-only.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s enough platforms around the world for international music.”Lee’s 1999 track Cigarettes Will Kill You placed at No 83 in Saturday’s poll.One of the many Australians to publicly reveal their votes was the country’sprime minister, Anthony Albanese, whose list included Midnight Oil’s Beds Are Burning, a 1986 protest track about Aboriginal land rights, and songs from Spiderbait, You Am I and The Go-Betweens.Albanese should be pleased to hear that Beds Are Burning landed at No 18. How To Make Gravy was also among his picks, while another of his favourite tracks, The Angels’ Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again, placed at No 12.Explore more on these topicsAustralian musicTriple JTriple J Hottest 100RadioAustralian Broadcasting CorporationINXSPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

She was treated by New South Wales Ambulance paramedics and taken to St Vincent’s hospital where she was due to undergo surgery today, chief inspector Gary Coffey said.A 27-year-old woman was also injured after attempting to intervene and was also taken to St Vincent’s Hospital.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA 31-year-old woman was arrested at the hotel and taken to Day Street police station where she was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder and assault, police said in a statement.All three women worked together at the hotel, Coffey said.He said the attack weapon was a pair of scissors and that the incident unfolded in a back office area out of public view.“At this stage, we’re unable to confirm the exact motive for this crime, other than all three persons involved in this incident are co-workers,” he told reporters on Saturday morning.“I’m not exactly sure of the circumstances which led up to the attack, but you would have to think that there was some sort of … dispute, this morning in the work environment.”When asked whether the attack was “frenzied”, Coffey said it was – and that it was “lucky that things didn’t escalate worse than that”.A spokesperson from InterContinental said no comment would be made.The 31-year-old was refused bail to appear before Parramatta local court on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

Vathrakoyannis said: “There have been reports of damages. We will take stock when the fires have been put out.”“The real difficulties are ahead of us,” he said, adding that Greece has asked for six firefighting planes from the European Union’s civil protection mechanism.On site, 145 firefighters and 44 fire engines, 10 firefighting planes and seven helicopters were attempting to put out the fire, the origin of which is unknown. Four ambulances were treating at least five residents, most of them elderly with respiratory problems.Temperatures reaching, or exceeding, 38C, dry conditions and high winds are fanning the flames.Vathrakoyannis said that under such conditions wildfires “expand very quickly and become dangerous. These conditions are expected to prevail over the coming days.”The fire service is also dealing with three other major fires in the south-west on Greece’s two largest islands – Crete in the south and Evia north of Athens – and also on the island of Kythera, north-west of Crete. At least 335 firefighters, 19 planes and 13 helicopters are involved, but can only operate in daylight. In total, 52 wildfires broke out across the country over the past 24 hours, Vathrakoyannis said.Wildfires, many of them destructive, have become a common occurrence in Greece in recent years. Several have broken out in the past month.A fire also hit the south of France late on Saturday, spreading towards a beach resort and forcing the evacuation of two campgrounds and some local housing.Driven by strong winds, the fire in the Aude region on the Mediterranean coast near the Spanish border had already burned through 600 hectares (1,500 acres) after breaking out earlier in the afternoon, local officials said.Some 630 firefighters backed by about a dozen planes were battling the fire, according to Aude’s deputy prefect Rémi Recio.Flames destroyed two houses and officials converted a gymnasium into a shelter, although the residents of about 10 evacuated houses were later allowed to return home.Three firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation.The fire comes less than a month after the Aude region was hit by a major blaze that swept through 2,100 hectares (5,200 acres) near Narbonne, mobilising 1,000 firefighters.Explore more on these topicsGreeceWildfiresEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The blast was said to have caused a “deafening noise” heard over a radius of more than 1km.“I woke up because of the very loud bang of the explosion,” Tzetno Kelo, who lives in an adjacent building, said. “Shattered glass from a window fell on my bed and I was covered in blood.” He was treated at a hospital before being discharged.Sofia Hatzigeorgiou, 88, who lives alone, told the Greek media outlet DNews that she had got up and discovered her house had become a “summer house”: a huge hole had opened up in the wall between her mezzanine flat and the building where the bomb had been placed.View image in fullscreenLocal people woke up in the middle of the night after hearing the blast.Photograph: Alexandros Avramidis/ReutersThe windows of neighbouring buildings were also damaged in the blast. Local media reports suggest the bomb was a “fairly simple device” triggered by a standard detonator.Police told Associated Press reporters that a witness saw a man walking in the street shortly before the explosion and they were focusing their efforts on criminal gangs rather than terror groups.Varsamis has worked for many years at Diavata prison, west of Thessaloniki, known for housing many criminal gang members as well as convicted terrorists.A spokesperson for the Hellenic police force confirmed that its organised crime unit was leading the preliminary investigation into the incident.Firefighters, an ambulance and dozens of police officers, including anti-terrorism specialists, attended the scene. Footage of the incident showed crowds of people standing outside the building in the middle of the night, some in their nightwear and slippers. One woman carefully made her way across shards of glass, carrying a cat.The Thessaloniki MP, Stratos Simopoulos, told DNews he had rushed to the scene of the explosion to support Varsamis, who is a friend of his: “He has my full support, because a few weeks ago, I too received the same cowardly attack. His was much more violent.“Public officials, who perform their duty without compromise, may be on the frontlines of the threat from such terrorist and criminal actions. I absolutely believe that they do not flinch,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Health officials in the strip recorded 43 deaths from hunger over three days this week. There had previously been 68 in total.Médecins Sans Frontières said on Friday that the severe malnutrition rate among children aged under five at its Gaza City clinichad tripled in the last two weeks. The Guardian reported this week that skeletal children were filling hospital wards, and the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) said his frontline staffwere fainting from hunger.‘We faced hunger before, but never like this’: skeletal children fill hospital wards as starvation grips GazaRead moreThe UK joined 27 other countries in issuing a joint statement earlier this weekcondemning Israel for depriving Palestinians of “human dignity”as they issued a call for the immediate lifting of restrictions on the flow of aid and an end to the war in Gaza.They also described proposals by the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, to move 600,000 Palestinians to a so-called “humanitarian city” in Rafah, an area that has been heavily damaged by Israeli bombing, as “completely unacceptable”.The Israeli foreign ministry rejected the joint statement hours later, saying it was “disconnected from reality”.David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesperson, told Sky News on Wednesday: “There is no famine in Gaza. There is a famine of the truth.”The Israeli military announced on Saturday it would start airdrops with humanitarian aid in Gaza, and humanitarian corridors would also be established for UN convoys. The military also said it was prepared to implement “humanitarian pauses” in densely populated areas.It had said on Friday that it had agreed to let Jordan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) airdrop aid into Gaza. Each flight carrying aid is far more expensive and holds fewer supplies than lorries do.The UAE’s foreign minister on Saturday said the country would resume aid drops over Gaza “immediately” citing the “critical” humanitarian situation.“The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached a critical and unprecedented level,” sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said in a post on X. “We will ensure essential aid reaches those most in need, whether through land, air or sea. Air drops are resuming once more, immediately.”Starmer is facing intense pressure from his most senior cabinet ministers and more than a third of MPs to move faster on recognising a Palestinian state.The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, are among those understood to believe the government should take the lead on Palestinian statehood alongsideFrance.The foreign secretary, David Lammy, faced questions on Monday from dozens of furious MPs across the house who called on the UK government to do more, including recognition of a Palestinian state.Kit Malthouse, a Conservative MP, said he was “frankly astonished” by Lammy’s statement “at a time when we’ve got daily lynchings and expulsions on the West Bank [and] dozens being murdered as they beg for aid”.He said he was “just beyond words really at [Lammy’s] inaction, and frankly, complicity by inaction at what is going on”, which he said carried the “personal risk” of ending up at The Hague.Lammy said he understood “the fury that [Malthouse] feels”, to which Malthouse shouted back: “Why don’t you feel it?”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaKeir StarmerFranceGermanyIrannewsShareReuse this content"

Stop the windmills. You’re ruining your countries. I really mean it, it’s so sad. You fly over and you see these windmills all over the place, ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and killing your birds,” he said. “On immigration, you better get your act together,” he said. “You’re not going to have Europe any more.”On Saturday morning, he abandoned a scheduled meeting with the press, who travelled with him on Air Force One, for a round of golf at his seaside course with music blaring from the buggy he drove.Sky News, stationed next to the course, reported the songs included Billy Joel’s Uptown Girl, Elaine Paige’s Memory and Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge over Troubled Water.Billed as afour-day family visit to Scotland, Trump is meeting European leaders and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, raising hopes of new and refined trade deals with the EU and the UK.On the prospects of an EU trade deal, the US president has said there were “20 sticking points”. When asked what they were, he said: “Well, I don’t want to tell you what the sticking points are.”He described von der Leyen as a “highly respected woman” and said the meeting on Sunday with the EU chief would be “good”, rating the chances of a deal as “a good 50-50”.It is understood von der Leyen and her aides will fly in on Saturday, with the European trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, arriving on Sunday morning.It is expected the deal will centre on an outline agreement in principle over 15% tariff rates for exports including cars, but with a 50% tariff continuing on steel. There may also be a breakthrough deal on pharmaceuticals, setting a rate of 15% for exports.Although this would breach a longstanding World Trade Organization agreement that medicines are rated at a zero tariff, it would be a far cry from the 200% tariff Trump threatened to impose on pharmaceuticals earlier this month.This would have triggered a highly damaging trade war not just with Ireland, where many US multinationals are based, but Germany, Denmark, Belgium, France and Spain.As an American in Scotland, I know we need many things – but Donald Trump isn’t one of them | Krystal EvansRead moreVon der Leyen’s spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said: “Intensive negotiations at technical and political [level] have been ongoing between the EU and US. Leaders will now take stock and consider the scope for a balanced outcome that provides stability and predictability for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.”It is believed the meeting will be held in Turnberry late afternoon and will be followed by a series of meetings with Starmer on Monday, with hopes he will widen thebare bones trade deal he struck in May.Trump’s arrival in Scotland has required the biggest security operation since Elizabeth II died in 2022. More than 5,000 police and security personnel are involved in the four-day visit with no risks taken after theassassination attempt on the president a year ago.High perimeter fences have been erected around the coastal golf course with naval vessels patrolling the shore while security drones overhead and dozens of security detail staked out the resort early on Saturday.The heavy security presence may be a foretaste of events to come later in August when the US vice-president, JD Vance, and his family arrive for a holiday in the Cotswolds, reportedly in the village ofCharlbury.Locals who resisted the expansion of Trump’s golf course in the past haveasked who would be footing the billfor the security arrangements.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropeKeir StarmerTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

This was despite the UK only making up 10% of the company’s European customers.The data revealed that phone theft claims in the UK had increased by 425% since June 2021 and 42% of phone thefts in the UK occurred inLondon. This equated to 16% of all phone thefts in Europe.The data, reported by the Times, comes amid growing concern about phone snatching, with police saying gangs are now stealing handsets as an easier way to make money than drug dealing.MPs accuse Apple and Google of profiting from rise in phone theftsRead moreTheMetropolitan policesaid about 80,000 phones were stolen in London last year, describing the phenomenon as an “organised criminal enterprise”. The stolen devices had a street value of about £20m, with iPhones being targeted most frequently.James Conway, a Met police commander specialising in phone thefts, said phone theft had become more prevalent among gangs partly due to a growing demand for such gadgets in overseas markets, creating opportunities for “huge profitability”.Conway said: “These are the same sort of gangs that are also running county lines operations and dealing [drugs] but are getting increasingly involved in robbery and theft … They can make a far greater profit than from dealing drugs in the same period of time with a lower risk from a criminal justice perspective.”He added: “The sort of sentences you see for drug trafficking or drug dealing offences, and those you might receive for a series of thefts as a young person are very different.”The police have called for phone companies to cut off cloud services on stolen phones in an effort to reduce their resale value. Representatives ofGoogleand Apple told the House of Commons science and technology committee last month that security features were already in place to protect customer data.Simon Wingrove, a software engineering manager at Google, said its system for such situations was “robust and works very well”.Gary Davis, a senior director in regulatory and legal atApple, said the company was concerned about the potential for fraud. He said there was a risk of bad actors attempting to obtain data and the power to delete accounts for blackmailing victims.The Apple representative added the company had invested “many hundreds of millions” in designing protections for its customers against phone theft.Explore more on these topicsMobile phonesTelecomsTelecommunications industryMetropolitan policePoliceEuropeLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

It has become common for hungry crowds to gather and wait for aid trucks to enterGazaas mass starvation spreads, which humanitarians widely blame on Israel’s blockade on the territory.At least 124 people have died from starvation in Gaza, 84 of them children, the Palestinian news agency reported. On Saturday morning, an infant died from malnutrition, the third baby to die in 24 hours from hunger.Israeli strikes killed more people across the Gaza Strip, including four people in an apartment building in Gaza City on Saturday.The killings come as ceasefire talks have appeared to stall, with the US and Israel withdrawing their negotiating teams from Doha on Thursday. The US president,Donald Trump, blamed Hamas for the collapse in talks, saying that he did not think the group wanted a deal.0:46Trump says Hamas doesn't want to make a deal – videoThe Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Friday that he was considering “alternative options” to ceasefire discussions, without elaborating what those options could be.Hamas officials have rebuffed claims that they are to blame for the haltering ceasefire talks, and instead have dismissed the Israeli and US withdrawal as a negotiating tactic. Egypt and Qatar, which are mediating the talks, suggested talks could resume soon.“Trump’s remarks are particularly surprising, especially as they come at a time when progress had been made on some of the negotiation files,” the senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told AFP.The break in talks came after Hamas gave its response to an earlier ceasefire proposal. The two parties are at odds over where Israeli troops would be stationed during the ceasefire, as well as aid access in Gaza and the number of Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli hostages.As ceasefire talks have dragged on, Gaza’s population hassuffered from mass starvation. More than 90,000 women and children were in “urgent need” of treatment for malnutrition, with one in three people in Gaza going for days without eating, the World Food Programme warned.Rania al-Sharahi, a 44-year-old mother of six who is pregnant, said she has lost 22 kg, despite her pregnancy. She struggles to find food for her children, who are often forced to scrounge for water and beg for scraps of food from neighbours.“As for bread, we don’t even talk about it any more. It has become a luxury. We haven’t had any in over 10 days. I dream of eating something sweet, anything sugary that might give me some energy,” Sharahi said.Her husband and children do not go to aid distribution points run by the private US Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), where more than 1,000 people have been killed while trying to get aid in the past two months. Sharahi and her children are at the mercy of the kindness of strangers and do not know when or from where their next meal will come.“I see my children every day suffering from hunger and searching for water. How am I supposed to feel? Our tears have dried from crying so much,” Sharahi said.Israel has downplayed the starvation crisis, suggesting a coordinated media campaign is tarnishing its image. It has said aid is waiting to be distributed but blames the UN for failing to do so.The UN has said that distributing aid in Gaza has become impossible owing to the litany of restrictions Israel puts on the organisation. It also said the majority of their requests to distribute aid are rejected by Israel and complain of regular delays by Israel to respond to their requests.Israel has boasted that it has let in 4,500 aid lorries into Gaza since ending its total blockade on the strip in May. But this amounts to about 70 truckloads each day, a number the UN says is inadequate and a far cry from the prewar total of 500 each day.Israel has come under immense global pressure as images of starving babies are circulated around the world. It has said it will allow airdropped aid to resume for the first time in months. Jordan, which will conduct airdrops, said it will be dropping mostly food and milk formula.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was“working urgently” with Jordan to get British aid into Gaza, as he comes under increasing pressure to recognise a Palestinian state.The head of Unrwa, the main UN agency serving Palestinians, Philippe Lazzarini criticised the airdrops, calling them a “distraction”.“Airdrops will not reverse the deepening starvation. They are expensive, inefficient and can even kill starving civilians. It is a distraction and screensmoke,” Lazzarini said in a post on X.Israel’s food points are not just death traps – they’re an alibi for the starvation of Gaza | Alex de WaalRead moreFrance announced on Thursday that it wouldrecognise a Palestinian stateat the UN general assembly in September, a move meant as a show of public disapproval towards Israeli actions in Gaza. France is expected to try to rally other European nations to also recognise the Palestinian state before the assembly.On Saturday, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said Italy would not recognise the Palestinian state, suggesting it would be “counterproductive”.“I am very much in favour of the state of Palestine but I am not in favour of recognising it prior to establishing it,” Meloni told Italian newspaper La Republica.Nearly 60,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military operation there in response to theHamas-led attack on 7 October 2023which killed about 1,200 people.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaKeir StarmerHamasUnited NationsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

They then launched a second attack with mortars and grenade launchers on the courthouse, where a clash began with security forces that lasted three hours, according to the Baluch human rights group Haalvsh.Three gunmen were killed in the clash, Iran’s state news agency said.State media said several people injured in the attack were in critical condition and had been transferred to local hospitals.Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on Telegram and told civilians to evacuate the area “for their safety”. Residents reported hearing several explosions and gunfire, while some roads that led to the courthouse were closed, Haalvsh reported.Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, has had an ongoing insurgency for the past two decades. It is home to Iran’s Sunni Baluch minority, who have advocated for autonomy and have long maintained that they experience marginalisation and exclusion under the Iranian government.The insurgency is part of a greater insurgency in Balochistan, which includes the Pakistani province of Balochistan. It is waged by Islamic militant groups and separatists and has included attacks which have wounded civilians as well as state security personnel in both countries.Jaish al-Adl is one of the Islamist militant groups in the province, and has been fighting Iranian security forces since 2014. Iranian authorities have designated the organisation a terrorist group and have accused Pakistan and Israel of backing the group.The group carried out an attack on a police station in Sistan-Baluchestan province in December 2023, killing 11 people. An attack by the group on Iranian border guards in January 2024 led to Iran striking Pakistan, saying it was targeting a Jaish al-Adl cell in the country.The Iranian government has accused the insurgency movement of being funded by foreign actors and of engaging in illegal smuggling operations.The deputy police chief of Sistan-Baluchestan province, Sardar Alireza Deliri, described Jaish al-Adl on Saturday as being affiliated with “Zionists”, referring to Israel. He said the three militants killed were the only ones involved in the attack and claimed they were wearing undetonated suicide belts.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

HWW said none had been charged with any crimes by the Israeli authorities. Three healthcare workers have been detained since the start of July.On Monday, the Gaza Health Ministrysaid an Israeli undercover force detainedDr Marwan al-Hams, head of Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital in Rafah, outside the field hospital of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the southern Gaza Strip. His whereabouts are unknown, and the Israeli authorities have yet to publish a statement on his detention. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that two of its workers were taken into detention from a facility sheltering staff and their families in Dier al-Balah; one remains in Israeli custody.View image in fullscreenDr Marwan Al-Hams, who was detained earlier this week and whose whereabouts are unknown.Photograph: ReutersAccording to the WHO, Israel has arrested and detainedmore than 300 healthcare workerssince the the war between Hamas and Israel began in October 2023. HWW puts this figure higher, at over 400.Muath Alser, director of HWW, said: “Many of the health workers were arrested at their work sites, and they remain held for months – often without communication, being denied medical care when needed, and suffering from terrible detention conditions. We urge people in power to pressure Israel to release those health workers still under unlawful detention.”Overwhelmed hospitals are already struggling to function, whileincreasing hunger among medical staffinGazahas left many too weak to provide urgent medical care to malnourished and injured civilians, doctors have told the Guardian and the Arabic Reporters for Investigative Journalism.In February, theGuardian published detailed accountsfrom senior Palestinian doctors held and then released from Israeli detention who reported being tortured, beaten and humiliated during their time in prison.Those still being held by the Israeli authorities includeDr Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, who has been detained at Israel’s Ofer prison since December 2024. Earlier this week his lawyertold Sky News his health was deterioratingand that he was being beaten and tortured.In a statement to the Guardian, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) accused medical staff in Gaza, including doctors, of involvement in Hamas terror activity. It did not provide any evidence to substantiate the claim.“In the context of IDF activity in combat zones, individuals suspected of involvement in terror activity are arrested and investigated. Those found not to be involved in terror activity are released.“A regrettable outcome of Hamas’ exploitation of hospitals is the involvement of medical staff, including doctors, directly in Hamas’ terror activity. Put plainly, the IDF is not interested in medical staff vis a vis their roles as medical professionals, but due to their potential involvement in Hamas terror,” said the statement.Two senior doctorsare known to have died in Israeli detention: Dr Iyad al-Rantisi, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Kamal Adwan hospital, died at Shikma prison; Dr Adnan al-Bursh, head of the orthopaedic department at al-Shifa hospital, died shortly after being transferred to Ofer prison in April 2024. Former detainees claim he died from torture and had suffered severe sexual violence in the hours before his death.Their bodies have not yet been returned to their families.The detention of medical staff from Gaza in Israeli prisons has been condemned by the WHO and the UN who have calledfor their immediate release.Reports of torture, violence and psychological abuse of healthcare workers while in detention have been verified by the UN and published in reports by organisations such asHWW,Human Rights WatchandPhysicians for Human Rights Israel.Explore more on these topicsGazaDoctors in detentionIsrael-Gaza warHuman rightsGlobal healthMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

At a time when the supreme court is making sweeping decisions about trans people without consulting a single trans person or organisation, and when a small, well-funded lobby of anti-trans campaigners continues to dominate headlines and waste public resources, our community came together to show what real strength, solidarity and care looks like.“I feel honoured to have platformed some of the most inspiring activists, organisers and trans people from across the globe. London Trans+ Pride was a vital act of resistance and joy – a reminder to trans+ people that they are not alone, that they are celebrated, and that they belong.View image in fullscreenThe London Trans+ Pride 2025 parade.Photograph: Levi Ocean/Trans pride“The message was clear: we will not be erased. Our existence is natural, historic and enduring. You can try to take away our rights, but you will never remove us from society. We are a part of humanity – and the public will not stand by while harm is done to our community.”Alex Parmar-Yee, from Trans+ Solidarity Alliance, said: “It’s important to turn up en masse to make sure that it’s very clear what the feelings are in terms of the rights which we’re fighting for, but also in protest of some of the harmful proposals that are currently being considered.”Referring to the Equality and Human Rights Commission interim guidance, she added: “This guidance has not provided any additional clarity, and actually is going to devastate the lives of trans people (who) will lose access to essential services and spaces.“The main concern really here is that it feels like there’s not been a consideration of trans members of the community, and that this guidance will pass behind closed doors, without the scrutiny, and without visibility, and without democracy.”Parmar-Yee also raised concerns about the rhetoric used in public and online discussions of trans rights, saying: “The rhetoric is not helping. There is a lot of hate which is amplified.“And I think you sort of see this happening around the world, and then you see it mirrored in the policy.“You look at the bathroom ban that’s being proposed, and you sort of realise that, although we may consider the UK quite different from a country like America, it’s a bathroom ban that would make someone like Donald Trump proud.”She said the next step for Trans+ Solidarity Alliance, a not-for-profit organisation supporting trans rights organisations and activists, was a call for transparency over the guidance in the wake of the supreme court ruling.“There is a lack of transparency and I think we cannot be a nation that accepts a bathroom ban becoming law behind closed doors,” she said.Meanwhile, in Berlin, tens of thousands danced to techno beats to celebrate the German capital’s Pride parade, one of the largest LGBTQ+ celebrations in Europe.View image in fullscreenThe route wound through Regent’s Street, Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square before ending at Parliament Square.Photograph: Chloe’ Dall’Olio/ Trans prideThe parade took revellers past the Brandenburg Gate and through the Nollendorfplatz neighbourhood, home to the city’s gay culture.German news agency dpa reported that a rightwing counter-demonstration featured 30 to 50 protesters.Six people, including the protest’s organiser, were arrested on their way to the demonstration for alleged weapons and explosives violations as well as for displaying anti-constitutional symbols, dpa reported, according to the Associated Press.Amsterdam Pride saw thousands of people march in a festive and political mood, as they emphasised the need to defend LGBTQI+ rights, which are increasingly under threat around the world.Organised by the Pride Amsterdam foundation, the march, which had the theme “love”, kicked off a week of festivities in the Dutch capital, culminating next weekend in a huge parade on the city’s famous canals, AFP reported.“People are not so aware about the march, because it has turned into too much of a party and does not so much focus on why we do it,” said Ben Thomas, 44, from Amsterdam, who teaches young refugees. “We’re not just here to party, but we’re here to be equal citizens. We’re here for our rights.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderProtestLondonLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

If it’s the company that built the building that hires the person to do it, they could be biased as they are on their payroll.”He added: “Our point is that once the building goes up and if they haven’t done the soundproofing, the council won’t make them rip the walls down and put it in.”London-based gig venueMoth Clubhas also seen support from a 20,000-strong petition against two separate planning applications for new blocks of flats beside it.The venue said the blocks, which are due to be considered by Hackney council in the coming months, would have “devastating consequences” for the future of the club.The new protection will be ushered in under the “agent of change principle”, with the Department for Business and Trade saying it will consider further options to support established venues under the new framework.Other measures in the overhaul include simplifying the process of opening and operating hospitality venues, scrapping local rules that delay small businesses from opening.The business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Red tape has stood in the way of people’s business ideas for too long. Today we’re slashing those barriers to giving small business owners the freedom to flourish.”New “hospitality zones” are also envisioned, with more leniency on permissions for street parties and extended opening hours to usher people back on to high streets.Speaking on the new changes, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said pubs and bars were “at the heart of British life”.Reeves said: “For too long, they’ve been stifled by clunky, outdated rules. We’re binning them – to protect pavement pints, alfresco dining and street parties – not just for the summer, but all year round.”Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryBars, pubs and clubsPlanning policyManchesterBrightonGreater ManchesterClubbingnewsShareReuse this content"

He took the mic, described their singing as a “terrible racket” and told them to get out, leaving the 360-odd people in the room shocked and dumfounded.“You are in my house, can you leave it now please,” he said. The man, it appears, was Jonathan Baker, the bishop of Fulham. In avideoposted on social media, the bishop can be seen telling the choir it’s past 10pm and calls for the night to be “over”.“It was so bizarre,” said Leigh Stanford Thompson, the choir director, describing the incident that took place on Friday night. “I’ve never experienced anything like it.”By chance, it was also his final concert directing the choir, and the night was “designed as a celebration”.“A lot of people thought it was some weird thing that I had organised, like a parting thing, but I knew exactly what was happening,” he said.This was the initial thinking of a choir member. She said: “At first, I thought it was a comedy act or some actor doing a scene. But when we realised, oh no, this isn’t an act, this is real, it was just a bit surreal.”The choir was nearing the end of their special summer concert on Friday, which this time took place in St Andrew church in Holborn,London. The choir had booked the venue, which is available to hire, and used it previously with no issue.Describing the sequence of events, the choir member said: “We were singing away. This was our penultimate song. Then, we were going to do one final number and get everybody out of the aisles and dance.“Then, all of a sudden, the lights went out. At first I thought there may have been a power cut. But then the instruments were still playing.“We were picking back up to sing when all of a sudden everything went quiet. I could see this guy in what looked like a dressing gown talking to the audience on the mic.”After Baker’s on-stage interruption, a church employee took the mic and apologised but told everyone they needed to leave because “this is a residential home”.“I must ask you to leave quietly, thank you for your attendance,” said the church worker, before addressing the choir. “Would you leave the stage,” she said.The choir member said: “There were boos and everything, it’s just really disappointing. At the end of these concerts, we always end on a real high and everyone goes home full of joy, but this dampened things.”Baker’s comments about the “racket” being produced did not sit well. “I think we produce a beautiful sound,” said the choir member.“If he just waited for five minutes, we would have been done and out, but because of what happened there was lots of booing, shouting. Then people were applauding the choir.”The final song was going to be a fully staged rendition of Abba’s Dancing Queen. As outrage bubbled up, the choir began performing an a cappella version on stage and finished it on their way out to a loud, rapturous reception. “Everybody was clapping as we were making our way out,” she said.“All of that took far longer than if he allowed the concert just to end at the right time.”Thompson said the impromptu ending “was really lovely and quite moving”.“We all went out to the pub afterwards and took it all in. Everyone was in astonishment really.“I do find it funny. I’m not particularly upset. We had a really good concert but I think it’s a real shame that we didn’t get a chance to finish. But now looking back, what a way to go out,” he said.A diocese of London spokesperson said: “Bishop Jonathan reached out to the organisers on Saturday to apologise for his late-night appearance at the concert, which he now understands had overrun due to earlier technical difficulties.”Explore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Politicians and campaigners have also reacted angrily to bill increases allowed in April by the regulator, Ofwat.The pay figures raise questions about the effectiveness of the government’sefforts to limit water executives’ pay. Ofwat gained powers last year to insist that bonuses were paid by shareholders rather than through customers’ bills, before new rules in June that allowed a ban on bonuses for bosses of companies guilty of the most serious environmental damage.The biggest pay increase was enjoyed by Keith Haslett, the chief executive of Affinity Water. He was awarded an extra £844,000,doubling his total pay to £1.6m. Portsmouth Water’s boss, Bob Taylor, also doubled his pay, to £754,000.‘Outwitted’: have water companies managed to sidestep Labour’s bonus ban?Read moreSix companies – Thames Water, Anglian Water, Southern Water,United Utilities, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water – werebanned from paying bonusesfor the 2024-25 financial year to their chief executives and chief financial officers. The bonus ban did appear to have an effect, with pay falling 8% to £5.5m across those six suppliers. Most of that drop was driven by Thames Water, whose boss, Chris Weston, received £1m, after he and three predecessor chief executives received a total of £1.7m the year before.View image in fullscreenSewage floats on the River Thames in Datchet, Berkshire.Photograph: Maureen McLean/AlamyDespite the bonus ban, Southern Water awarded its chief executive, Lawrence Gosden, an 80% pay increase to £1.4m.After theGuardian revealed the increase, the environment secretary, Steve Reed, said Gosden should turn down the extra money. Southern Water said the pay increase complied with the rules. A spokesperson said it was not a bonus but part of a “two-year long-term incentive plan”. Not all the money was paid during the financial year, and he may not receive all of it if Southern fails to achieve an adequate environmental rating.Sophie Conquest, lead campaigner at We Own It, a group campaigning for public ownership of water, said: “The public is rightly angry about the obscene levels of cash being handed over to the private water bosses.“What has their highly valued commercial brilliance delivered for us? Water bills hiked by 30% and the ongoing vandalisation of our rivers and lakes. No new reservoirs built in 30 years, and 3bn litres of water lost daily to crumbling pipes.“Never in the field of essential public services has so much been earned by so few for doing so little.”Pay for chief financial officers pay fell 3% to £7.6m for the 12 water companies who disclosed it, although that decline was driven by a steep drop from £1.3m to £636,000 for the since-departedAlastair Cochran at Thames Wateras the company neared collapse. Aside from Thames, CFO pay rose by 7% on average during the year.The highest-paid water boss was Liv Garfield, of Severn Trent, a FTSE 100 company that supplies 4.6m households across the Midlands and northWales. She was granted £3.3m during the financial year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We also have ringfenced customers’ bills to ensure investment must be spent on new sewage pipes and treatment works, not bonuses.“Any instances of companies trying to circumvent the new rules are completely unacceptable. The government will leave no stone unturned against any bosses being made these payments.”A spokesperson for Water UK, a lobby group, said:“Executive pay in the water industry is independently determined by remuneration committees, which abide by the laws and regulations set by government.“Water companies are focused on investing a record £104bn over the next five years to secure our water supplies, end sewage entering our rivers and seas and support economic growth.”Explore more on these topicsExecutive pay and bonusesWater industryThames WaterPayEnglandWalesPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

Far-right activists have become involved in promoting them online and have been present, in some cases clashing with police.Last summer’s riots spread across the country in response to the murder of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on 29 July. Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, were murdered by Axel Rudakubana, who has been jailed for a minimum of 52 years.Last year’s unrest in England ‘has caused lasting harm to communities’Read moreThe Guardian’s data was obtained through FoI requests sent to 21 police forces covering the 27 towns and cities across England and Northern Ireland where riots took place.The 27 towns were identified as sites of significant disorder in aHouse of Commons briefing documentin September. Between 30 July and 7 August 2024, an estimated 29 anti-immigration demonstrations and riots took place. Many of these were violent, with participants attacking mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers.In Bristol, where there were 60 arrests, more than two-thirds of those arrested had been the subject of a previous domestic abuse report.In Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, Cleveland police reported there had been 107 arrests, 44 of whom had been subject to a prior domestic abuse report.In Rotherham, where rioters set fire to an asylum hotel, 75 people were arrested, 35 of whom had been reported for domestic abuse, South Yorkshire police said.Joshua Lane, a 27-year-old former serviceman who threw missiles at police guarding the hotel, pleaded guilty to violent disorder. He had previously received a suspended sentence for stalking, battery and criminal damage.There were 91 arrests in Sunderland where rioters set fire to cars, a building and attacked a mosque. Of those, 38 were subject to a prior domestic abuse report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What can be done to prevent them reoffending?Read moreOne of the first arrests by Merseyside police for participation in the Southport riot was made after a suspect in a domestic incident was identified by officers based on footage from the previous day’s violent disorder.Merseyside police arrested 160 people after days of disturbances in Liverpool and Southport, but did not provide the Guardian with a number of prior domestic abuse reports because of prohibitive costs.Gareth Metcalfe, 44, described by a judge as “at the forefront of the disorder” in Southport, had previous convictions including sexual assault and breach of a non-molestation order.In Hull, where 47 of the 151 people arrested had been reported for prior domestic abuse, Ethan Armstrong, 26, who was jailed for violent disorder, had previously been convicted for causing actual bodily harm after repeatedly punching an ex-girlfriend.The Metropolitan police said there were 165 arrests in Whitehall last summer in connection to the riots, 48 of whom had previously been reported for domestic abuse.This information provided by police forces indicates overlaps between public violent disorder and domestic violence and abuse.Outcomes for reports held by police indicate that less than a quarter of individuals had been charged for any of the domestic abuse offences for which they were a suspect.Isabella Lowenthal-Isaacs, the policy manager at Women’s Aid, said: “A year on from the terrible Southport attacks on young girls, and as conversation about far-right protests once again starts to appear in the media, it is tempting to treat these events as isolated.“However, the reality is that these acts of violence are part of a wider pattern rooted in the same dynamics that drive domestic abuse and violence against women and girls: control, coercion, and misogyny.”The National Police Chiefs’ Council indicates that by May, a total of 1,840 arrests had been made in relation to the disorder and there were 1,103 charges related to the violence, most of which were serious public order offences.Most of those charged have come from the 20% most deprived neighbourhoods. Analysis of the Crime Survey for England and Wales data also shows that in the areas where riots took place, there is a higher prevalence of domestic abuse incidents (39 per 1,000 people) compared with the rest of the country (27 per 1,000 people).In Middlesbrough, a protest that began as two minutes’ silence for the three lives lost ended in a 1,000-strong riot as homes and cars were damaged, with ‘race checkpoints’ set up for drivers.A recent report from the home affairs committee into the police response to the rioting called on the police forces to develop greater capacity to monitor and respond to social media. It also recommended the government set out ambitious reforms to meet its commitment to halve violence against women and girls.A Home Office spokesperson said:“The scale of violence and abuse suffered by women and girls in this country is nothing less than a national emergency.“That’s why we have pledged to halve violence against women and girls in a decade, and will set out our transformative strategy to achieve that goal in the coming months.”Explore more on these topicsDomestic violencePoliceSouthport attackProtestRaceImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

He wasfound guiltyin February of murder, attempted murder and hate-crime charges in the death of Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of the boy’s mother, Hanan Shaheen.The 73-year-old Czuba targeted them in October 2023 because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas, which started days earlier.Czuba died Thursday in the custody of theIllinoiscorrections department, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, citing the Will county sheriff’s office. The law enforcement agency did not return a call seeking comment on the death.Ahmed Rehab, the executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations’Chicagooffice, said in a statement on Saturday that “this depraved killer has died, but the hate is still alive and well”.Evidence at trial included harrowing testimony from Shaheen and her frantic 911 call, along with bloody crime scene photos and police video. Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes before handing in a verdict.The family had been renting rooms in Czuba’s home in Plainfield, about 40 miles (64km) from Chicago when the attack happened.Shaheen told jurors Czuba attacked her before moving on to her son, insisting they had to leave because they were Muslim. Prosecutors also played the 911 call and showed police footage. Czuba’s wife, Mary, whom he has since divorced, also testified for the prosecution, saying he had become agitated about the Israel-Hamas war, which had erupted days earlier.After the start of the war, Czuba told Shaheen that they had to move out because Muslims were not welcome. Later, he attacked her and her son.“He told me: ‘You, as a Muslim, must die,’” said Shaheen.Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds.Czuba attacked her with a knife before going after her son in a different room. Police said Czuba stabbed the boy 26 times, leaving the knife in the child’s body. Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee’s relatives.The case, which generated headlines around the world, comes amid rising hostility against Muslims and Palestinians in the US since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing roughly 1,200 Israelis, and Israel’s attack on Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians.The attack hit particularly hard in Plainfield and surrounding suburbs, which have a large and established Palestinian community. Wadee’s funeral drew large crowds, and Plainfield officials have dedicated a park playground in his honor.Marina Dunbar contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsIllinoisUS politicsIslamophobiaChicagonewsShareReuse this content"

The other is unaccounted for, Luna said, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which is investigating the blast.Luna said authorities have X-rayed special enforcement bureau vehicles, searched the blast area, and examined office spaces and the gym, but have not found the second grenade.“You get the drift. We have looked at everything out there that we possibly could,” he said, adding that no one from the public has had access to the area.The grenades were seized at an apartment complex in Santa Monica a day before the explosion, Luna said. He said detectives X-rayed the devices and believed they were inert. The devices were then taken to be “destroyed and rendered safe” at the Biscailuz training facility, where one exploded.Luna said he has called for an independent review of the policies and practices of the arson and explosives team, and has already changed how it handles these types of situations.“All future explosive devices, inert or not, will be treated as if they are all live and will be disposed of accordingly,” he said.It was not known whether the grenades had any connection to the military. The men killed were detectives Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus and William Osborn. They served 19, 22 and 33 years in the department, respectively.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is expected to publish a final report on their deaths in September.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesUS policingCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

DeSantis, who has built a political career on his anti-immigration views, said 100 people had been deported from the US.“I’m pleased to report that those flights out of Alligator Alcatraz by [the Department of Homeland Security] have begun.

It’s like 2021 all over again.But the latest meme-stock rally could be even bigger than its predecessor four years ago, when investors piled into recognizable but unloved stocks, such as the video games retailer GameStop and the movie theatre chain AMC, according to the founder of theRedditforum that helped whip up the frenzy.Retailer Kohl’s, camera firm GoPro, fast-food chain Wendy’s and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme each staged rapid rallies this week, driven by abrupt surges in trading volume reminiscent of the the meme-stock craze of 2021, when social media memes boosted a collection of struggling stocks, triggering extraordinary and volatile leaps in value.Actress Sydney Sweeney helped bring clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters into the mania after it was announced the Euphoria and White Lotus star would front the brand’s latest marketing campaign. The company’s shares surged about 10% in trading on Thursday.Meme stocks are “about to leap-frog in size and scope and scale, so that retail traders are going to redefine what matters”, according to Jaime Rogozinski, founder of thewallstreetbetsReddit forum behind many of the volatile rallies.“The world of finance is clearly changing, with blockchain technologies encroaching, and AI agents that trade on their own,” he said. “And the collective of retail traders is adapting along with it.”Rogozinski founded wallstreetbets in 2012, but said Reddit ousted him as a moderator in 2020. His bid to sue the social media company for trademark infringement was dismissed by the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit last month.The forum’s users home in on stocks and share their own research. “It’s a decentralization of power of who can be financial analyst,” said Noor Al, a moderator on wallstreetbets. “Great ideas can now come from anyone, anywhere.“We’re seeing the power of retail push stocks, sometimes to the tune of billions of dollars, through the power of ideas, the power of community and the power of the people,” he added.The meme-stock craze of 2021, whichproduced stars such as Roaring Kitty, was a product of the Covid era, when many amateur traders were stuck at home and flush with pandemic stimulus cash.Whether this latest frenzy produces similar winners is not yet clear. Kohl’s finished the week up 32%, GoPro was up 66% and Krispy Kreme was up 41%. The rallies show some investors are willing to take on more risk, as stocks scale record highs and the market, dominated by big tech, becomes harder to beat.Often, meme-stock bets are unbound from economic fundamentals, as investors move to support a brand for romantic or ideological reasons. Donald Trump’s Trump Media & Technology Group, home to Truth Social, is valued at more than $5bn on quarterly revenue of about $1m.The wallstreetbets ethos “has always to some extent been about flaunting and exploiting the ironies, relevance or irrelevance” of the stock market, said Rogozinski, who pointed to Wendy’s, the hamburger chain, as a good example. “Wendy’s has always been a meme that goes back a decade. It brings a smile to my face, because on Reddit there’s always been this thing where they say: ‘Sir, this is a Wendy’s.’“It’s an inside joke, and I don’t even get where it started. It’s just a meme,” he added. The stock’s fleeting rise – it rallied 10% in two days, but finished the week broadly flat – shows some retail investors do not necessarily care about the typical factors that drive the market, such as tariffs and war in the Middle East. “It’s this ability for us to almost make fun of the financial system.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLong-term institutional players will always get the last laugh, Rogozinski conceded, because prices will return to normal valuations. “But in the short term there’s lot of money to be had with this volatility, and the fact that stocks are able to move up and down with such ease is but a mere showcase for how the financial system needs a facelift in relevancy.”Bed Bath & Beyond sees ‘meme-stock’ surge – but is it too little, too late?Read moreWhile current market conditions do not replicate the low interest rates and retail investor buoyancy of the Covid era, market records and a robust economy have made meme stocks attractive once again for some. “You see all these indications where this is full-blown meme mania,” Brent Kochuba, founder of derivatives-data firm SpotGamma,told Bloomberg.“The macro economic environment really favors the retail and speculative plays,” agreed Al. “I think were only going to see more speculation and excitement. It’s a good time to tune in, because retail players can react and provide insight faster.”Days traders are not necessarily bothered by a company’s financial performance, said Rogozinski. “You have this activist, elective investor who is saying, ‘I don’t care what the financial statements look like, I don’t care what the discounted cashflow is, I like the food, I like the video-game store, I like the meme. So dude, you can go back to Excel spreadsheets if you want, but I really like the chicken tenders,’” he said.There is now a “third component” to investment, beyond supply and demand, he claimed, “which is, ‘dude, I don’t care if you think it’s going to go up or not, or if they have assets or liabilities. I care about this company and I’m going to help it out. I’m going to go buy my jeans from American Eagle.’”Explore more on these topicsStock marketsRedditEconomicsUS economyRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That honor now belongs toSummer McIntosh, the Canadian teenager looking to do what only Michael Phelps has done before her: win five individual gold medals at a single world swimming championships.Hard work for Australian swimmers on road to LA 2028 begins in Singapore | Kieran PenderRead moreTheir clash in the 800m freestyle on 2 August is set to be the defining moment of the weeklong meet in Singapore. Ledecky, themost decorated female swimmer in history, is bidding for an unprecedented seventh world title at the distance she has dominated since 2013. McIntosh, just 18, is theonly swimmer to have beaten herat 800m in the past 15 years.They now share more than a lane. McIntosh grew up with a Ledecky quote on her bedroom wall. Now she stands ready to challenge her idol, and perhaps even eclipse her. “Katie always brings the best out of me,” McIntosh said. “Which is why I’m never nervous to race her.”McIntosh arrives in Singapore in historic form, having broken world records in the 400m individual medley, 200m IM and 400m freestyleover a dizzying five-day spanat Canada’s national trials in June. Her 3:54.18 in the 400m free obliterated Ariarne Titmus’s previous world standard and set the marker for a meet that could be her coronation. While she holds the world’s fastest time this year in four events, she is only the second seed in the 800m freestyle, where Ledecky leads the entry list. Her 8:05.07 in that event is the third-fastest in history, behind only two swims by the American.Quick GuideWorld Swimming Championships 2025ShowThe scheduleThe swimming portion of the World Aquatics Championships takes place from 27 July through 3 August at the  Singapore Sports Hub.The  heats start at 10am local time (2am GMT).

By then, McIntosh may already have claimed three or four golds. But the 800m is Ledecky’s fortress. It is, in US team director Greg Meehan’s words, the “gold standard”.McIntosh has said she chose to add the 800m this year because it presents the biggest challenge. She will need every ounce of stamina, especially with a projected 14 or 15 races in eight days, thanks to relay duties and quick turnarounds like Sunday’s 400m freestyle final followed 30 minutes later by the 200m IM semi. “It’s a very challenging schedule she’s set for herself,” Canada head coach Iain McDonald said. “But she thrives on challenge.”View image in fullscreenYu Zidi, 12, reacts after finishing the women’s 200m freestyle semi-final at China’s national swimming championships in Shenzhen in May.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesNotably absent from the 800m start list is Ariarne Titmus, the Paris Olympic gold medallistin the 400m freestyle, who is taking the year off. In that race, McIntosh took silver and Ledecky claimed bronze. Ledecky, however, won gold in the 800m in Paris,continuing her historic dominancein the event. This race offers a reordering of the long-distance hierarchy and potentially a watershed moment in the sport’s history. A McIntosh victory would not only dent Ledecky’s momentum heading into her home Olympics in LA 2028 but signal a true generational shift.Yet Ledecky remains a daunting force. In May, she rewrote her own nine-year-old 800m world record,clocking 8:04.12 in Florida. And while McIntosh’s programme is more grueling, Ledecky’s focused schedule may allow her to conserve energy for the marquee clash.Twelve-year-old Chinese swimmer takes stunning times to world championshipsRead moreEven if McIntosh comes up short in the 800m, she remains the overwhelming favorite in the medley events and the 200m butterfly. Her versatility is such that McDonald says it’s hard to even name her best event. Should she complete the sweep, she would join Phelps as the only swimmer to win five individual golds at a single worlds.But McIntosh isn’t the only prodigy drawing attention in Singapore.China’s Yu Zidi, all of 12 years old, will line up in the 200m and 400m IM and the 200m fly. Her qualifying times would have placed her fourth in each of those events at the Paris Olympics. Yu is already 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age. “There’s always someone coming up next,” McDonald said. “That’s the nature of this sport.”In the men’s events, all eyes will be on France’s Léon Marchand, the four-time Olympic gold medallist who rocked La Défense Arena not even a year ago in delivering a “perfect” home Games. His coach,Bob Bowman, has urged a more streamlined approach for Singapore: Marchand has dropped the 200m fly and 200m breaststroke to focus on the 200m and 400m IM, with the possibility of relay appearances.Marchand is expected to defend his world titles and may even challenge Ryan Lochte’s long-standing world record of 1:54.00 in the 200m IM. “The expectation is for him to do as well as he can where he is now, not where he was last summer,” Bowman said. Marchand returned to Bowman’s programme in Austin after a brief post-Olympic slump. Whether he can conjure the same brilliance in Singapore, three years out from LA 2028, will be one of the meet’s central questions.View image in fullscreenFrance’s Léon Marchand swam to four individual gold medals in six days at La Défense Arena last summer at the Paris Olympics.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesSprinters dominate the rest of the men’s programme. China’s Pan Zhanle, fresh off a blistering 46.40 to win Olympic gold in Paris, will defend his 100m free title. Romanian David Popovici, who held the world record before Pan’s rise, will be a top contender in both the 100m and 200m free. Ireland’s Daniel Wiffen, the reigning world champion in the 800m and 1,500m freestyle, is also aiming high. The 22-year-old has his sights set on Zhang Lin’s super-suit-era world record of 7:32.12 in the 800m, a mark many thought untouchable. “I believe that all world records will be broken,” Wiffen said recently. “And I’m willing to push myself to that limit to get it.”Great Britain’s Duncan Scott, an eight-time Olympic medallist, has streamlined his own programme in pursuit of that elusive individual world title. “That event is all I’ve got now, so I’m going to put all my eggs in one basket,” he said of the 200m IM, where he’ll again face Marchand.Scott also anchors Britain’s men’s 4x200m freestyle relay, the defending Olympic champions. The quartet – Scott, Matt Richards, Tom Dean and James Guy – now seek their first world title together.Elsewhere, American star Gretchen Walsh is looking to converther short-course successinto long-course dominance, and Australia’s Mollie O’Callaghan returns as a serious threat in the sprint freestyles.The Singapore Sports Hub’s new 4,800-seat arena is a fitting stage for the post-Olympic reset. Nearly 30 nations are expected to win medals, a testament to swimming’s growing global depth. But for all the newcomers and national aspirations, the defining narrative may still come down to two swimmers in a single race. “Perhaps Summer would be the one who wanted to challenge that,” McIntosh’s coach Fred Vergnoux said of her decision to take on Ledecky at 800m. “She accepted the challenge a bit early, for these worlds. But I think she’s ready.”Explore more on these topicsSummer McIntoshSwimmingKatie LedeckyUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You don’t know what’s going to show up,” Judge said. “That’s why I kind of pushed off a lot of that imaging and stuff like that because if I don’t what’s going on, it can’t hurt you, I guess.”Judge leads the major leagues with a .342 batting average and 1.160 OPS. He has 37 home runs and 85 RBIs for a New York team that opened a seven-game AL East lead by late May but started Saturday a season-high 5 1/2 games back of first-place Toronto.“All in all, we got good news today,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “I think all of us kind of feared the worst.”Knowing how tough Judge is, Boone had been worried. Judge told Boone of throwing difficulty during Friday’s 12-5 loss to Philadelphia.“I couldn’t throw past 60 feet,” Judge said. “We’re going up against a Phillies team, they can hit the ball over the park. I just didn’t want to put our pitchers in jeopardy, just not be able to come up and make a play for them.”Boone received results of the scan just before the start of Saturday’s game, when team officials were getting some more evaluation. Because pain impacted his throwing but not hitting, Judge fought going on the IL.“With that strain, then if you go out there and play with it you put the UCL in jeopardy, so we got to get that healed up,” Boone said.Boone said it was too soon to determine whether highly regarded prospect Spencer Jones will be brought up from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.Judge likely won’t throw for 10 to 14 days, then will need a few days throwing to build back arm strength before returning to the outfield.“I really was reluctant about going on any IL or anything like that,” Judge said. “I was like, ‘If I can hit, let me hit.’” he said. “I’ll start DHing, I think, once this 10th day is up.”Giancarlo Stanton, the team’s primary DH, will start to work out in the outfield next week in order to help fill in for Judge.“It’s never a relief knowing he’s going to be out at all, but for what it is, I guess you could say best case,” Stanton said.Judge said he first felt the pain in the sixth inning of Tuesday’s game at Toronto, when George Springer singled to right in the sixth inning off Jonathan Loáisiga. Judge made a strong throw home in an attempt to prevent the tying run, but Davis Schneider just beat catcher Austin Wells’ tag.An inning later, Judge winced after catching Alejandro Kirk’s seventh-inning fly in the right-field corner and throwing to second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr as Dante Bichette tagged up and went from second to third. Judge was seen by a Yes Network camera clenching his right hand in a fist.“He’s about as tough as they come and for him to even show any vulnerability or pain or whatever,” Boone said. “I knew we had an issue probably. And so any time you can fear the worst with that, but that’s why you wait to react, though. ... We got the MRI and got a clear diagnosis with it.”Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesMLBBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

While Norris soaredLewis Hamiltonwas left bereft, offering only apologies to his team for an “unacceptable” error that left him languishing in 16th place here.Norris took pole with a storming lap to edge out his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, by the slenderest of margins – 0.085sec – on the challenging circuit in the Ardennes mountains that rewards commitment and precision.

His final lap in Q1, enough for seventh place, was deleted for going beyond track limits at Raidillon and he was knocked out, having finished 15th in the sprint.“Definitely a weekend to forget,” he said. “I’ve got to look internally and apologise to the team because it’s unacceptable to be out in Q1, it’s [a] very, very poor performance.”Norris on the other hand, was in a feisty mood after his glorious run. He had finished third behind Verstappen and Piastri in the sprint, dropping a point to his teammate, who now leads the world championship by nine points. Norris had qualified third, six-tenths behind Piastri for the sprint, with some suggesting Norris could not match the Australian, to which he felt he had delivered a strong rebuke.“Three-tenths is just slipstream and not being the first out of the pit lane,” he said. “It was nothing to worry about but people like to make a lot of things up. I felt good and the car has been flying all weekend.“Oscar has been doing a good job and we’ve been pushing each other a lot. It’s tough because you see where your strengths and weaknesses are clearly and you learn from each other quickly, it’s good but a tough battle that we have at the minute.”View image in fullscreenThe crew from Ferrari work on the car of Lewis Hamilton, who finished 15th in the sprint race in what he described as a “very, very poor performance.”Photograph: Manon Cruz/APIt was on the first of the hot laps in Q3 that Norris set the pace through the middle sector to lead with a time of 1min 40.562sec, two-tenths up on Piastri with Verstappen half a second back in third. While Verstappen went out first for the final runs, he could not improve and Norris could do no better, but Piastri was flying and threw himself at the lap. He did go quicker but it was not quite enough to beat his teammate, as Norris held pole.For Red Bull, as openings go Laurent Mekies could not have asked for a more auspicious affair on the occasion of hisdebut weekend in charge. As the team enters a new era, their first race without the dismissed Christian Horner, Verstappen, around whom so much of the power politicking within the team has swirled, ensured Mekies at least began on a high with a win in the sprint race on Saturday morning.With rain forecast for Sunday,Red Bullhad opted to fit their larger rear wing for qualifying rather than the low drag version they had used for the sprint race, costing Verstappen some of the straightline speed that had proved so advantageous in the short form race.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He leads his long-standing rival Vingegaard by almost four and a half minutes and barring any last day mishaps, the Slovenian’s fourth yellow jersey seems assured.Tour organisers ASO confirmed in Pontarlier that any decision on neutralising the final stage would not be taken until Sunday afternoon and possibly during the stage itself.“Anything can happen,” Pogacar said of the final day’s combination of climbing and sprinting, “but I’m not promising I’ll go for it. We’ll try to enjoy the yellow jersey in Paris.”Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Australian Kaden Groves won the penultimate stage, from Nantua to Pontarlier, after breaking clear of a lead group in the final 16km. “There’s so much pressure in the Tour. All I ever get asked is: ‘Am I good enough to win in the Tour?’ Well, now I’ve shown them,” Groves, a stage winner in the Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a Espana, said.View image in fullscreenThe peloton is feeling the strain after a gruelling Tour with a draining first 10 days and too many long transfers.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersThe decisive action came on the descent of the final climb, the Côte de Longeville, 24km from Pontarlier. In the aftermath of a crash on a tight left-hand bend, Groves was among a group of three who moved clear. The 26-year-old then attacked alone in the final kilometres to win by almost a minute.After well over three thousand kilometres of racing, an ingrained fatigue is now stalking the peloton with numerous riders sharing Pogacar’s obvious weariness, without enjoying the rewards of his success. Many admit to being wrung out by a Tour with a draining first 10 days and too many long transfers.Tour de France 2025: Pogacar in line to win overall after Groves goes solo to win stage 20 – live reactionRead more“I feel like a nap as soon as getting on the bus,” the Lidl-Trek rider Toms Skujins said during the Alpine stages. Pogacar said: “If you look at the power files throughout the whole Tour, it’s been really amazing and tough. Even though it was one of the hardest I ever did, I enjoyed it.”Much has also been made of the Tour’s decision to augment Sunday’s traditional processional laps of the Champs-Élysées with three laps racing over the cobbled climbs in Montmartre. “I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Vingegaard said. “Montmartre seemed very beautiful at the Paris Olympics, with a great atmosphere.”“But when the riders arrived there, there were 50 in the peloton. Now there will be 150 of us fighting for position on a very narrow climb. It’s going to add more stress than we’d like.”However, the threat of rain overshadows the plan and even the Tour’s director of racing, Thierry Gouvenou, acknowledged that the Parisian cobbles can be treacherous when wet. “We know with the slightest drop of rain, Paris is a real ice rink,” he said before the Tour. “We saw it in the Olympic Games time trial. It can turn into a catastrophe.”View image in fullscreenKaden Groves celebrates his stage success.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersIf it does rain, then the Tour is likely to “freeze” the overall standings, to ensure that the general classification is not affected by a last-day crash. “The stage will be run, but the time will be frozen,” Gouvenou said.Others have been dismayed by a Tour route that failed to crack the seemingly unflagging Pogacar, but instead shattered the reserves of many in the peloton. “The transfers have been longer and more poorly organised than any I have ever witnessed in some 20 Tours,” Jonathan Vaughters, manager of the EF Education EasyPost team said.“Instead of trying to progress into a modern professional sport, ASO is looking for ways to regress the sport backwards in time. Ultimately, taking care of the athletes leads to better recovery, better health, and better racing.”Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

What format it takes, whether a sequel to the feature film, series or alternative, will be decided in due course.“I am so happy to be here in Basel for the Euros, the atmosphere is amazing,” said Chadha. “What I can share with you today is my very clear wish to bring the beloved characters from Bend It Like Beckham back to you and audiences globally very, very soon. Women’s football is more competitive, more exciting, and more global than ever. It is an honor for me to be a small part of it.”Chadha, who has fielded requests for a return of the story for years but has waited for the right plot to come to her so as to not tarnish the legacy of the original, added: “After 23 years and being unable to come up with a storyline that was as good as the original, I have finally found a fantastic story for aBend It Like Beckham follow up.”Released in 2002,Bend It Like Beckhamshowed football obsessed Jesminder “Jess” Bhamra balance joining the Hounslow Harriers and finding herself on the pitch while grappling with family, cultural and societal expectations of what a Punjabi British girl should be. It was a huge box office hit and is the only film distributed in every country in the world, including North Korea.“The original film, for me, was about lifting up girls and saying you can do and be anything you want, even though society dictates what you can and can’t do,” said Chadha, who has also confirmed US women’s national team manager,Emma Hayes, is collaborating on the new project. “That message is still relevant today. Even though women’s football rides so high around the world, and that’s amazing and it’s wonderful that the original film has been part of that legacy, I feel there is more that I can do and so that’s what I’m writing. It will be hard hitting, of course, but it will also be incredibly joyous, how can it not be as a follow up to Bend It Like Beckham?”View image in fullscreenEmma Hayes will act as a collaborator on the new film.Photograph: Daniel Cole/AP“I’m super excited to have connected with Emma who, when I first met her, said: ‘On my god, I was Keira Knightley, that was me!’ I know all the amazing work that she is doing both in front and behind the scenes for women’s football, so have brought her on board as a collaborator as I write the script which I’m working on right now.”Hayes, who won seven league titles, two League Cups and five FA Cups with Chelsea beforemoving into international football, winning Olympic gold two months after taking up her post, said: “I met Gurinder at a chance meeting in Cannes in June. It felt like the stars aligned for us to meet. I told her the massive impact the film had had on me when I was younger and that I was Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. I cried in the cinema watching the film because I felt just like Jess and Jules.”Hayes moved to the US early on in her career in search of greater opportunities and professionalism in the women’s game and it played a pivotal role in her development. “There was no hope for women’s football in Britain then, so I was going to the US to try my luck there,” said Hayes. “I could never have dreamed of how much that film helped change the women’s game. Now, I have the best job in world football as head coach of the US women’s national team. Like I said, the stars aligned and now I’m helping Gurinder with all my experience and insight in the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The mistake by Lucy Bronze that allowed Olga Carmona to score the only goal of the game; Lauren Hemp hitting the crossbar; the opportunities not taken; the surges of momentum not rewarded; the sense of a golden inheritance slipping inexorably through their fingers. For the players who remain, and for coach Sarina Wiegman, Sunday’s European Championship final offers a chance for redemption.If all this is normal and regular enough, then what is perhaps more unusual is that much of the above is also true for their victorious opponents.England v Spain: where the Women’s Euro 2025 final could be won or lostRead moreRestitution, revenge, a chance to erase painful memories, a collective resolve that this moment will not be taken from them, the chance to secure a meaningful legacy: these will be the stakes for Spain in Basel.Winning the World Cupin 2023 was a monumental achievement immediately tarnished by the actions of their federation. This final, by contrast, feels like more of a clean slate.Spain should win. They have been the outstanding team of the tournament so far, effortlessly gifted on the ball, ruthlessly disciplined without it, adding layers of complexity to their famous passing game, defending gallantly when the situation has demanded it. There has also been a sense of quietly building momentum not just in the tournament but through the year as a whole: pieces falling into place, players becoming more and more comfortable in their roles.But as Montse Tomé’s players have consistently made clear, Spain are competing for more than trophies. The bitter legal and public battles fought with their federation, the RFEF, are part of a longer struggle for recognition and equality, for respect and dignity. After all, if the greatest moment of their careers could be so cruelly taken from them, then what ultimately was the point of it?The 2023 World Cup was not the unifying moment for Spanish football that it could have been. Fifteen players had quit the national team before the tournament; three ultimately returned, and so for a squad marooned on the other side of the world, loyalties split between their present task and their absent comrades, a begrudging truce had been maintained with their disliked coach Jorge Vilda and the suits above him. It was a fragile show of unity, maintained only by their quest for a first major trophy. Once it had been secured, all hell broke loose.In hindsight, the unwanted kiss that Luis Rubiales planted on the lips of Jenni Hermoso was simply the trigger. The unresolved issues and grievances within Spanish football had lain unresolved for decades, and probably would not have been purged in any other way. The actions of Rubiales himself were egregious enough; what really hurt was the way the mechanisms of power and influence instinctively mobilised to protect him.Hermoso was urged to appear in a video publicly defending him, and after she refused, a statement insisting the kiss was consensual was written and published by the federation without her knowledge. “While the world has seen this, attitudes like this have been part of our team’s daily life for years,” she wrote on social media.When Rubiales finally resigned in an interview with Piers Morgan, having blamed “false feminism” for the storm of protest against him, he did so not out of genuine remorse or contrition but – as he admitted – out of a desire not to hamper Spain’s bid for the 2030 men’s World Cup. A Spanish courtfound him guilty of sexual assaultin February, and after ignoring an appeal from prosecutors who sought a jail sentence, fined him all of about £9,000.View image in fullscreenAitana Bonmatí scored Spain’s winner against Germany in the Euro 2025 semi-final.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APHas anything really changed? Rubiales is gone, as are many of the figures around him when he was at the RFEF.Vilda was sackedafter the tournament, and will take charge of Morocco in Saturday’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final. But the moment they shared and the platform it could have provided: they have gone forever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bronze remembers playing training games at Barcelona and encountering “like, clones and clones and clones of these amazing, technical, intelligent players”. And the 11 who will take the field against England on Sunday are the very best of them.It is not just the World Cup fallout for which Spain are trying to atone. Twelve months later they travelled to Paris as the overwhelming favourites for Olympic gold, only to be stunned 4-2 by Brazil in the semi-finals after a performance littered with defensive errors. They didn’t even win bronze, Germany beating them in the third-place playoff. The goalkeeper Cata Coll was inconsolable afterwards, but here has talked about how “life has given us a second chance”.This is a better team than 12 months ago, arguably a better team than two years ago, “like a steamroller” as Carmona describes them, albeit with an occasional habit of getting stuck in neutral. Capitalising on these fleeting passages is England’s best hope of upsetting the odds, picking their moments to attack, using their press and their physicality and their technical ability to rattle Spain off their game.And perhaps, for a country for so long indifferent to women’s football, where the sport was banned until 1980, where the women’s team have often been treated as an afterthought, Spain can finally enjoy their moment in the spotlight. There are big screens being erected across the country, from the Parque de Berlín in Madrid to the Plaza del Pilar in Gran Canaria. This is a team united and content again, longing above all for a chance to write their own story.*Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballSpain women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They had to come from behind against Sweden and Italy, winning the former on penalties and the latter in extra time.Asked how her decision-making process works in the dying moments of games with England trailing, the head coach, Sarina Wiegman, said: “First, I’m having a heart attack too. I just don’t show it.“We want to be best prepared, that’s our style of play. We’re also trying to prepare for what can happen in the game and what we need. We figured out what players we might need in certain circumstances if we want to change things. That’s what we talk about all the time and that’s how we prepare for a game. We have spoken through all the scenarios, but then during the game it’s a sense of what you feel is necessary.”There have been concerns about the fitness of Lauren James,who came off against Italy with an ankle injury. But the forward played a part in training in Zurich before the team travelled to Basel.Williamson rolled her ankle against Sweden. “My ankle is great,” she said. “My mum rolled her ankle a couple of days ago, so she’s taken all the attention away from me now.“I can speak for every single member of the squad when I say as long as we get the green light we would play through absolutely anything to be involved at this stage.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamLeah WilliamsonSarina WiegmanWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The question now, as they prepare to face Spain in Sunday’sWomen’s Euro 2025final in Basel, is can they pull yet another rabbit out of the hat?Perhaps the only thing we know for certain is that the country will be watching. More than 10 million saw England’s womenclaw their way past Italyin Tuesday’s semi-final, a figure that brought in ITV’s highest viewing figures of the year. After that, though, everything is up for grabs.Lionesses of 2025 echo Southgate’s 2024 England with bumpy ride to Spain finalRead moreThe former tennis player Brad Gilbert wrote Winning Ugly: Mental Warfare in Tennis, about how to emerge victorious when not playing well or facing a superior opponent. In Switzerland, the Lionesses have often served up the football equivalent. Yet they are just 90 minutes away from planting their size 6s in the pantheon of great England sports teams.That may raise some eyebrows. But make no mistake, Sarina Wiegman’s side are a staggering success story hiding in plain sight. Since she took over as manager in September 2021, England’s women have won 34 of their 47 competitive matches, drawing six and losing seven – an impressive win percentage of 72.5%.That record, as sports data company Opta shows, compares favourably with the “golden generation” of the England’s men’s team between 2001 and 2010, led by David Beckham, Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. They won 45 out of 67 matches – a win percentage of 67% – although they never got beyond the quarter-finals of a major tournament.It is also better than Gareth Southgate’s record of 61 wins from 102 matches between 2016 and 2024, a win percentage of 59.8%, although England did reach two Euro finals and a World Cup semi-final along the way.In fact, perhaps the closest parallel with the Lionesses is with the heyday of Sir Alf Ramsey’s World Cup winners, who won 26 out of 36 competitive matches between 1966 and 1971, a win percentage of 72.2%.Incredibly, Sunday will mark England’s fifth final in as many summers, with the men having reached the Euro finals in 2021 and 2024, and the women having lifted the Euros in 2022 before losing to Spain in the 2023 World Cup final. As a nation England gone from expecting heroic failure to being almost blase about a golden age.It is also easy to forget just how far women’s football has travelled. Just before the London 2012 Olympics, for instance, organisers withdrew 500,000 tickets for the football tournament from public sale because of a lack of interest – with Team GB women’s first game against New Zealand filling just a third of what was known then as Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, which has a capacity of 74,500.“There will not be many events over the coming two and a half weeks with so many no-shows and the attendance of 24,549 was a clear disappointment,”the Guardian wrote. “But to put it into context, the crowd was almost five times the number that watched Arsenal play Chelsea in last season’s women’s FA Cup final.”View image in fullscreenWomen’s football has come a long way since 24,549 watched Team GB narrowly beat New Zealand 1-0 at the 2012 Olympics.Photograph: Paul Harding/Action Images/ReutersIn a quirk of fate the 2025 Women’s FA Cup final,between Chelsea and Manchester Unitedat Wembley, was watched by 74,412 people. Enough to pack out the stadium in Cardiff. If you had predicted that in 2012 you would have been sneered at.Of course, England’s latest European adventure has been far from smooth. They were outplayed in their opening game against France. Then, in the quarter-finals against Sweden, they first came from 2-0 down with 11 minutes remaining to make it 2-2, before winning the penalty shootout after the Swedes missed two chances to knock them out.If that wasn’t fantastical enough, England also appeared to be going out in their semi-final against Italy until a late equaliser from the substitute Michelle Agyemang in the final minute of injury time. And there was then even more drama as Chloe Kelly scored the winner deep into extra time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can’t believe it myself.”Speculating how they compare with other great England and British national teams is one for the pub or posterity. However, to these eyes, they do not have the dominance of the England men’s Rugby World Cup winners in 2003, who won 42 of their 47 competitive matches between 2000 and 2003, a success rate of 89.4%. Many of the same players made it to a second World Cup final in 2007 too, though with a much poorer win record after their 2003 triumph.The England team who won the 2019 men’s Cricket World Cup, led by Eoin Morgan, will also have their supporters. Not only did they win 48 out of their 63 completed one-day matches between 2016 and 2019 – with one tied – for a win percentage of 76.2%, they attacked with rare fire and freedom.Those of an older vintage would probably also point to UK Athletics during the golden era of middle distance running in the 70s and 80s, when Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram won Olympic gold medals and world championship titles and smashed 20 world records between them. Especially as Daley Thompson, Tessa Sanderson and Fatima Whitbread were regularly winning medals too.But for sheer achievement, the extraordinary performance of Team GB Olympians takes some beating. In 1996, Britain won a solitary gold medal, along with eight silvers and six bronzes, finishing 36th in the medal table. Yet thanks to a huge injection of government and lottery funding, they have won more than 60 medals in each of the last four Olympics – including finishing second in the table at the Rio Games in 2016.Yet the Lionesses’ achievements should also not be underestimated. And they still have plenty of time to strengthen their case, starting on Sunday.It could yet be a classic. Spain like control, England thrive in chaos. The Spanish have the Ballon d’Or Feminine holder, Aitana Bonmatí, and another two-time winner in Alexia Putellas. And while England have great players too, they also have something much harder to define: that mystical combination of luck, fate, randomness and sheer bloody-mindedness. They couldn’t, could they?Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At that time, that’s how I felt. Since then, firm steps have been taken forward. That way of thinking is disappearing from society.England v Spain: where the Women’s Euro 2025 final could be won or lostRead more“We have to keep opening doors and normalising situations. At that time, after the press conference, with the victory, many walls were torn down. There is still work to be done, but we are on the right track.”In the aftermath of the final in Sydney, Spain’s triumph was soured when the Spanish Football Federation’s Luis Rubiales kissed the Jenni Hermoso on the lips without her consent.Rubiales was found guilty of sexual assault in Februaryand the conviction upheld in June.Spain’s head coach, Montse Tomé, said she was glad to now be discussing football matters rather than the Rubiales furore. “We are a team, they are players that have been fighting, working, with energy and now they are able to focus energy on football,” she said.“I can sit here and answer questions about football – this has changed. This means a lot to me. It shows the change we are getting. Right now, for all the effort I think the squad deserves [to be] winning. In the elite football world it’s not always the case [that you win] but we’ll do everything to try, tomorrow.”They beat England in a Nations League fixture in Barcelona in June, although they did lose 1-0 at Wembley in February. Tomé has drawn lessons from those matches. “I expect a balanced game against a team that is good in attack, they have a very powerful attacking line, in midfield they also have a high level and they’re very capable in defence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s already real in the digital hive mind | Barney RonayRead moreArsenal confirmed the news with a brief post on X that read: “This is where you need to be. Viktor Gyökeres is a Gunner.”Gyökeres will be expected to meet his new colleagues in Arsenal’s ongoing pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong. The Gunners face Newcastle in the Singapore National Stadium on Sunday before the concluding game of their tour, against Tottenham in Hong Kong on 31 July.Manager Arteta said: “Viktor has so many qualities. He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels. He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat.“We’re excited about what Viktor brings to our squad and are looking forward to start working with him.”Gyökeres moved to Brighton from Swedish side Brommapojkarna in January 2018, but spent time on loan at St Pauli and then Swansea and Coventry, before making a permanent move to the Sky Blues in July 2021.After Coventry were beaten on penalties by Luton in the 2023 Championship playoff final at Wembley, Gyökeres completed a £20.5m switch to Sporting. He scored 97 goals in 102 matches for the Portuguese side.Arsenal spent the concluding months of last season without a recognised striker following long-term injuries to Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz. Even before then, Arsenal were in need of a reliable scorer, and Arteta will hope his new signing can fire him to his first silverware since he won the FA Cup in 2020, and end the club’s two-decade wait for a Premier League title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Forest reacted furiously to the news and threatened legal action over an alleged illegal approach for the player.Forest were also preparing a complaint to thePremier League, arguing that Spurs’ conduct surrounding the proposed transfer had been inappropriate. The two-time European champions consulted lawyers because they believed Spurs did not have permission to speak with Gibbs-White and also felt there had been a breach in confidentiality regarding the release clause in the England man’s contract.Gibbs-White scored seven goals and added eight assists in 34 league games last season to help Forest finish seventh and qualify for Europe. He had been linked with Spurs and Manchester City. However, late on Saturday night, the midfielder signed a new deal with Forest which keeps him at the City Ground until 2028.The Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, said: “Morgan is a special player – not just in terms of talent, but character and mentality. He represents what we want this football club to be: he is a winner, talented, ambitious, fearless and proud.“There was significant interest from various clubs, but we were determined to build our future with Morgan at the heart of it. I promised our fans we would not only compete, but grow stronger and stronger every season. Today is another big step in that journey.”Speaking after signing his new deal, Gibbs-White told the club’s official website: “I’ve felt at home at Forest from the moment I arrived. The support from the fans, my teammates and everyone around the club has been unbelievable. I believe in what we’re building here – and with the backing of Mr Marinakis and the enormous ambition he has, I want to be part of making something special.

The playmaker was lively and his linkup play with Mohamed Salah will have impressed the head coach,Arne Slot, although his team’s vulnerability against some rapid counterattacks was exposed.Liverpool fell behind in the 10th minute when the outstanding Rafael Leão scored from a Christian Pulisic pass. Dominik Szoboszlai levelled 20 minutes later with a curling shot from the edge of the box following an assist by Rio Ngumoha.Rafael Leão was a key figure with his pace unsettling Liverpool on the break and he was again the architect of Milan’s second as they retook the lead early in the second half. The Portuguese winger powered past Conor Bradley on the left and set up the former England midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek to fire home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool were forced into playing the Greek international alongside Ibrahima Konaté in the second half as Joe Gomez had returned to Merseyside after an achilles injury.Luis Díaz was not involved with the winger looking increasingly likely to move to Bayern Munich while Darwin Núñez, another player set to depart Anfield this summer, was nursing a “minor” injury.“Conceding four isn’t what we want but you have to consider the circumstances, we missed seven senior players, and wanted to give 20 players playing time, so players have to play out of position,” Slot said. “We still were able to play our normal game, but we were a bit too open in the counterattack.”Liverpool travel to Japan to take on Yokohama FM in the J League World Challenge on Wednesday with their £79m signing, Hugo Ekitiké, likely to play some part.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolDiogo JotaArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

It has always been a market and it is more of a market now than it has ever been before. Everybody is constantly looking for a better deal, and everybody has a price. Every club has its place in the ecosystem and those higher up the chain will always take from those below them, who in turn will take from those below them.All a club can ever hope to do is to inch their way higher and higher in the structure, to increase the number of clubs they can feed on while reducing the number of predators who can feed on them.Eddie Howe: Newcastle have not held contract talks with Alexander IsakRead moreIt may be reassuring to think of the legendary servants, the one-club men of the past, but even the term “servants” betrays an uncomfortable truth. From 1885, when professionalism was legalised and the great clubs of the industrial north and Midlands began to acquire talent from Scotland, footballers have been a product to be traded.From 1963, when the retain-and-transfer system was scrapped, and increasingly after the Bosman ruling of 1995, players have had agency –, although even before that there were cases such as that ofWilf Mannion, who went on strike to try to force a move from Middlesbrough to Oldham.Since financial fair play rules began to be introduced 15 years ago, preventing an owner splurging a fortune on elevating his side, the clubs climbing the ladder most successfully are those who have accepted their position within the hierarchy and traded accordingly. Brighton’s ascent to become a top-10 Premier League side has been based almost entirely on their ability toidentify talent early and sell itat an enormous profit to Chelsea.There remains a reluctance to be seen as a selling club, but other than Real Madrid everybody is a selling club now. Far better to be a selling club than a letting-a-player-run-down-his-contract-and-leave-on-a-free club. Clubs who will have regarded themselves as the elite, as destination clubs, have to accept that almost everybody is a stepping stone . Perhaps for those who are battling to return to the elite, who are not confident in their status, that is a difficult adjustment to make.Marcus Rashford must stave off sense of anticlimax after Barcelona switch | Jonathan WilsonRead moreWhich brings us to Alexander Isak. The dance ofbriefing and counter-briefingthat has played out over the past couple of weeks has been fascinating and, frankly, a little baffling. If Isak wanted to leave Newcastle – and he was considering his future in the final weeks of last season – why wait until afterLiverpool signed Hugo Ekitikéand Chelsea acquiredLiam DelapandJoão Pedro, as well as for Arsenal’s move forViktor Gyökeresto be at an extremely advanced stage, to make that public? Does the scarcity of centre-forwards on the market push his price up? Or does the fact that potential suitors have no burning need for a striker reduce it?Understandably, Newcastle fans are reluctant to see the Swede go. He is, after all, probably the club’s best player since Alan Shearer. He is only 25; once upon a time it would have been possible to dream of him staying for the best part of a decade, scoring 200 goals.Last season was the best Newcastle have known since the first Kevin Keegan era. Theywon the Carabao Cup, their first domestic silverware in 70 years, qualified for the Champions League and their line was led by one of the world’s most coveted strikers. It was possible to imagine a future when Isak was joined by players of similar stature.But that is not how modern football works. Isak wants more: more money (and his £120,000-a-week salary does seem below the market rate) and a more consistent chance of winning trophies. Newcastle could hang on to him, hope he does not succumb to bitterness and try to add further stars.View image in fullscreenNewcastle won their first domestic silverware, the Carabao Cup, in 70 years last season.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockOr they could take £140m and invest it in strengthening the squad as a whole, accumulating more assets who can be sold at a profit so more can be bought, driving their ascent. It is cold and mercantile, it is far from the romance many would like to see in the game, but it is also the reality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere are two problems. First, the sense of loss if Isak goes, which is particularly acute for a fanbase that still carries the collective memory of the departures of Chris Waddle, Peter Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne in the 80s and the fear that the Saudi Public Investment Fund may essentially turn out to be the habitually beleaguered Stan Seymour in disguise. Isak is not the only Newcastle player pondering his future and there is a danger his departure is the start of a mini-exodus.Second, there is a lack of faith that the club is equipped to make the most of such a windfall. Paul Mitchell left this summer after a year as sporting director and although Jack Ross has been appointed as head of football strategy andSudarshan Gopaladesikanas technical director, with Ross Wilson likely to be named as sporting director soon, it is unreasonable to expect anybody taking up a role in July to coordinate a coherent transfer strategy for a window that closes on 1 September, particularly with Darren Eales stepping down as chief executive because of illness.View image in fullscreenAnthony Elanga is Newcastle’s only senior signing this summer.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThere has already been disquiet about a lack of incoming players, withAnthony Elanga the only senior signingto date as Newcastle have missed out on a number of targets, most recently James Trafford,who preferred to rejoin Manchester City.Although plans are being drawn up for a new stadium, there were fears last season that Newcastle might be the victims of a more general Saudi retrenchment. Meeting profitability and sustainability rules remains a check on expenditure, but with Champions League football this season there were reasons to expect the budget to be a little more generous.Instead, there is a sense of drift. In part that is misfortune, given the illnesses suffered by Eales and Amanda Staveley, who sold her stake in the club last summer. But the appointment of Mitchell never seemed a comfortable fit and the result is a vacuum. Last season was supposed to be the beginning of a glorious future for Newcastle; the fear within the frustrations of the past few weeks is that it was actually a summit.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedInside footballSaudi Arabia and sportcommentShareReuse this content"

India had endured the kind of morning that usually dictates a couple of paracetamol and the curtains being redrawn, such was the pummellingBen Stokesdelivered with bat in hand.It was not just Stokes, either. After his first Test century for two years drove England to 669 all out – 141 from 198 balls – the tourists were tasked with negotiating 15 minutes before the break – a negotiation that could scarcely have gone worse had a couple of contestants from The Apprentice been handling it. Chris Woakes conjured up two wickets in two balls before India had made a dent in the whopping 311-run deficit.Harry Brook drops the devilry but takes catch before India keep eye on the ball | Simon BurntonRead moreAnd yet by stumps this fourth Test had taken on a different complexion courtesy of a couple of hugely determined performances from Shubman Gill and KL Rahul. Resisting for two wicketless sessions that forced the Saturday crowd to make their own fun, they steered India to 174 for two from 63 overs. Though still 137 runs behind, there is a chance of rain on Sunday and the draw that seemed so unlikely is now possible.Kudos must first go to the two set batters, not least after 157 overs in the field. Though a decent surface in the main, enough deliveries were shooting low and yet at no point did their focus waver. Both do obduracy in the most elegant ways, with Gill’s low-slung hands still caressing the ball and Rahul all technical excellence. Reaching 78 and 87 not out respectively, two of India’s senior pros had delivered a message to those lower down.But it also hinted at some of England’s shortcomings when Stokes, their standout performer with the ball, is out of action. The supposed cramps that forced him off the fieldon day threemay well be something more sinister going by the sight of him clutching his upper leg a couple of times. Afterhis five-wicket haulin the first innings, all Stokes could do this time was run through the tactical playbook and wait patiently.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes salutes on making his century, his first in two years.Photograph: Steve Taylor/PPAUK/ShutterstockWoakes was the pick overall and his new-ball burst was something to behold. First went Yashasvi Jaiswal, squared up and edging to slip as Joe Root clung on at the second attempt. Then came a dismissal that Gautam Gambhir could relate to, Sai Sudharsan’s attempted leave on his first ball catching the bat and also flying to the cordon. Think back to the India head coach’s dismissal at the Oval in 2014, even if he would sooner forget it.But after the hat-trick ball to Gill was survived, the chief threat came from Liam Dawson trying to trap the two right-handers on the back foot with a bit of skid, only for the ball to be met with enough willow each time. And it was Dawson who put down the one genuine chance to materialise during an afternoon that seemed to just disappear. Gill sliced hard to backward point when on 46, only for the ball to burst through the all-rounder’s hands.Had it stuck, India would have been 74 for three and Brydon Carse’s account in the match would have been opened. Jofra Archer, his fellow quick, got the new ball to talk initially but a couple impassioned appeals for lbw were declined. This five-match epic is asking plenty of both sets of fast bowlers – even those who joined halfway – and India’s attack was certainly relieved to get off the park before lunch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not since 2014 had India shipped a 600-plus total in a Test match, while Jasprit Bumrah’s runs column running into three figures was simply a first.If the return of Stokes as a force with the ball has arguably been the biggest plus for England in this series then this innings was not far behind. Resuming on 77, Stokes opened up with a couple of imperious fours off Mohammed Siraj and then tipped past three figures with a flick down leg. Out came the celebration not seen for a good while – that crooked finger salute and a look to the sky to honour his late father, Ged.This was the first time an England captain has scored a century and claimed a five-wicket haul in the same Test match and soon the afterburners were lit as he and Carse (47 from 54 balls) ransacked 95 runs for the ninth wicket. When Stokes monstered Washington Sundar for a straight six it took him past 7,000 Test runs, something only Garfield Sobers and Jacques Kallis had previously combined with 200-plus wickets.But unless Stokes is able to resume bowling on day five, or others step up in his absence, India could yet wriggle free and head to the Oval with a chance of squaring the series. Gill, previously kept quiet for three innings, is also ominously back in the groove.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketBen StokesnewsShareReuse this content"

The elite coder, however, who goes by the online name Psyho, predicts he may be the last human to win the prestigious title given the incredible pace of technological progress.“That’s probable,” said Psyho, 41, who worked at OpenAI before retiring five years ago. “I would prefer not, mostly because I like these competitions and knowing there’s this magical entity that can do it better than me would be a little bit frustrating.”Advanced AI suffers ‘complete accuracy collapse’ in face of complex problems, study findsRead moreThere is an irony, Psyho acknowledged, in the fact that coders have contributed to their own professional demise.“Before the contest, I tweeted ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’,” he said. “I helped developing AI and I would be the one who would be the loser of the match. Although I won, in the end, for now.”View image in fullscreenPolish programmer Przemysław Dębiak, known as Psyho.Photograph: Courtesy of Przemysław DębiakThe AtCoder euristic division included 11 human participants invited on the basis of world rankings and a coding algorithm designed by OpenAI, which finished in second place, 9.5% behind Psyho’s winning score. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, tweeted his congratulations.The 10-hour contest involves solving a complex optimisation problem. A classic in the genre is the “travelling salesman problem”, where the salesman needs to figure out the shortest possible route between various cities, each visited once. These problems are simple to state, but finding an optimal solution is computationally very complex. So while ChatGPT is now routinely used to write boilerplate code, the AI’s performance on an open-ended logic problem will be viewed as impressive.“At the current state, humans – top humans, to be clear – are still much better at reasoning and solving complex problems,” said Psyho. But humans are “bottlenecked” by how quickly they can type code, while an AI can try out lots of small adjustments very rapidly.“The model is like cloning a single human multiple times and working in parallel,” he said. “AI might not be the smartest right now but it’s definitely the fastest. And sometimes multiplying a single average person many many times produces a better result than a single, special human being.”The result comes as major tech companies, includingMeta and Microsoft, are turning to AI to write software code. The Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei,said in May that AI could take 20%of white-collar jobs in the next one to five years.“Every profession has this right now, more or less,” said Psyho. “Some people have it coming right now – all of the white collar jobs. For manual jobs, robotics is lagging by several years.”Like many in the industry, Psyho is ambivalent about the potential impact of ever more powerful AI models. “We have a tonne of issues,” he said. “Disinformation, social impact, humans not having a purpose in life. Historically society moves at a very slow pace. Technological progress right now is moving at a faster and faster and faster pace.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ProgrammingSoftwareComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Tech companiesRead moreHis remarks came just days after US president Donald Trumpunveiled an aggressive low-regulation strategyaimed at cementing US dominance in the fast-moving field.One executive order targetedwhat the White House described as “woke”artificial intelligencemodels.Opening the World AI Conference, Li emphasised the need for governance and open-source development.“The risks and challenges brought by artificial intelligence have drawn widespread attention … How to find a balance between development and security urgently requires further consensus from the entire society,” the premier said.Li saidChinawould “actively promote” the development of open-source AI, adding Beijing was willing to share advances with other countries, particularly developing ones in the global south.The three-day event brings together industry leaders and policymakers at a time of escalating technological competition between China and the United States – the world’s two largest economies – with AI emerging as a key battleground.Washington has imposed export restrictions on advanced technology to China, including the most high-end AI chips made by companies such as Nvidia and chipmaking equipment, citing concerns that the technology could enhance China’s military capabilities.AI pioneer announces non-profit to develop ‘honest’ artificial intelligenceRead moreLi did not name the United States in his speech, but he warned that AI could become an “exclusive game” for a few countries and companies, and said challenges included an insufficient supply of AI chips and restrictions on talent exchange.At a time when AI is being integrated across virtually all industries, its uses have raised major ethical questions, from the spread of misinformation to its impact on employment, or the potential loss of technological control.Earlier this week,news companies were warnedof a “devastating impact” on online audiences as search results are replaced by AI summaries, after a new study claimed it caused up to 80% fewer clickthroughs.The World AI Conference is an annual government-sponsored event in Shanghai that typically attracts major industry players, government officials, researchers and investors.Saturday’s speakers included Anne Bouverot, the French president’s special envoy for AI, computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, known as “the godfather of AI“, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has in past years regularly appeared at the opening ceremony both in-person and via video, did not speak this year.The exhibition features predominantly Chinese companies, including tech companies Huawei and Alibaba and startups such as humanoid robot maker Unitree. Western participants include Tesla, Alphabet and Amazon.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChinaComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s like 2021 all over again.But the latest meme-stock rally could be even bigger than its predecessor four years ago, when investors piled into recognizable but unloved stocks, such as the video games retailer GameStop and the movie theatre chain AMC, according to the founder of theRedditforum that helped whip up the frenzy.Retailer Kohl’s, camera firm GoPro, fast-food chain Wendy’s and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme each staged rapid rallies this week, driven by abrupt surges in trading volume reminiscent of the the meme-stock craze of 2021, when social media memes boosted a collection of struggling stocks, triggering extraordinary and volatile leaps in value.Actress Sydney Sweeney helped bring clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters into the mania after it was announced the Euphoria and White Lotus star would front the brand’s latest marketing campaign. The company’s shares surged about 10% in trading on Thursday.Meme stocks are “about to leap-frog in size and scope and scale, so that retail traders are going to redefine what matters”, according to Jaime Rogozinski, founder of thewallstreetbetsReddit forum behind many of the volatile rallies.“The world of finance is clearly changing, with blockchain technologies encroaching, and AI agents that trade on their own,” he said. “And the collective of retail traders is adapting along with it.”Rogozinski founded wallstreetbets in 2012, but said Reddit ousted him as a moderator in 2020. His bid to sue the social media company for trademark infringement was dismissed by the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit last month.The forum’s users home in on stocks and share their own research. “It’s a decentralization of power of who can be financial analyst,” said Noor Al, a moderator on wallstreetbets. “Great ideas can now come from anyone, anywhere.“We’re seeing the power of retail push stocks, sometimes to the tune of billions of dollars, through the power of ideas, the power of community and the power of the people,” he added.The meme-stock craze of 2021, whichproduced stars such as Roaring Kitty, was a product of the Covid era, when many amateur traders were stuck at home and flush with pandemic stimulus cash.Whether this latest frenzy produces similar winners is not yet clear. Kohl’s finished the week up 32%, GoPro was up 66% and Krispy Kreme was up 41%. The rallies show some investors are willing to take on more risk, as stocks scale record highs and the market, dominated by big tech, becomes harder to beat.Often, meme-stock bets are unbound from economic fundamentals, as investors move to support a brand for romantic or ideological reasons. Donald Trump’s Trump Media & Technology Group, home to Truth Social, is valued at more than $5bn on quarterly revenue of about $1m.The wallstreetbets ethos “has always to some extent been about flaunting and exploiting the ironies, relevance or irrelevance” of the stock market, said Rogozinski, who pointed to Wendy’s, the hamburger chain, as a good example. “Wendy’s has always been a meme that goes back a decade. It brings a smile to my face, because on Reddit there’s always been this thing where they say: ‘Sir, this is a Wendy’s.’“It’s an inside joke, and I don’t even get where it started. It’s just a meme,” he added. The stock’s fleeting rise – it rallied 10% in two days, but finished the week broadly flat – shows some retail investors do not necessarily care about the typical factors that drive the market, such as tariffs and war in the Middle East. “It’s this ability for us to almost make fun of the financial system.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a good time to tune in, because retail players can react and provide insight faster.”Days traders are not necessarily bothered by a company’s financial performance, said Rogozinski. “You have this activist, elective investor who is saying, ‘I don’t care what the financial statements look like, I don’t care what the discounted cashflow is, I like the food, I like the video-game store, I like the meme. So dude, you can go back to Excel spreadsheets if you want, but I really like the chicken tenders,’” he said.There is now a “third component” to investment, beyond supply and demand, he claimed, “which is, ‘dude, I don’t care if you think it’s going to go up or not, or if they have assets or liabilities. I care about this company and I’m going to help it out. I’m going to go buy my jeans from American Eagle.’”Explore more on these topicsStock marketsRedditEconomicsUS economyRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some may know them from their comedicTikTokvideos, which regularly amass hundreds of thousands of views. Others may recognize them as host of Gaydar, a viral entertainment-education show about queer culture, history and current events; an interview Williams did with the New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani did go viral, after all. There’s also Williams’s drag performances, including those where they opened for icons such as Chappell Roan and Bob the Drag Queen. Or their bevy of musical theater roles – Lola in Kinky Boots, Dominique in Lucky Stiffs, to name a few.For years, Williams has been launching their own creative universe. As a 25-year-old genderqueer, Black artist, Williams, who uses they/she pronouns, has used their ever-growing social media presence (more than 2.8 million followers across their social media platforms) to fashion the career of their dreams outside anyone’s binaries. For their next project, Williams is set to perform in Saturday Church, a new musical at New York Theatre Workshop which opens 27 August. The play dives into the world of a sanctuary for LGBTQ+ youth. “It’s a feelgood musical,” said Williams of the production. “It’s just queer, Black joy, and there’s a beautiful message about it.”Williams will play a trans woman, another bonus in their ever-growing theatrical career. “The further I get in my transition, it’s been nice to feel affirmed,” they said. “It’s just been awesome to be in those spaces and to make a way for myself.” With talent and charisma, Williams’s rise is practically ordained; as they look forward to balancing their various projects, now comes the task of navigating their expansive future and chronic frustrations of being online.Growing upFor Williams, growing up in Davenport, Iowa – an industrial, midwestern town of about 100,000 people, was an exercise in strength. At school, Williams was bullied for “having a girl name”, they said. Their home life was equally tumultuous, Williams recalled, rife with abuse and neglect. But life in the midwest sowed the seeds for their future artistic passions. As a child, they sang in the church choir, later joining show choir, following in the footsteps of an older sister.For college, Williams attended Emerson College’s in the musical theatre program in Boston. University was one of the first times that Williams got to reflect on who they were, what they wanted. But musical theater came with its own binaries and limitations, especially as Williams is both genderqueer, meaning outside the typical binaries of gender, and Black. “It felt like: ‘Lord forbid you be somewhere else on the gender binary,’ and then, ‘Lord forbid you’re also Black at the same time’,” Williams said.Breaking the Binary: meet the founder behind a US theater company for trans and non-binary artistsRead moreEven when Williams attempted to create their own lane, they said they faced resistance from their professors. “There was a teacher that was like: ‘You keep bringing in girl songs. Why is that?’ And I tried to explain it to them, and it didn’t go well,” Williams said.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Williams returned to their home town to wait out the return to normalcy like most people. The isolation allowed for reflection and served as a moment that allowed them to fully realize their gender identity. “I had to admit a couple things to myself, like, ‘Yeah, I’m queer. Yeah, I’m probably genderqueer.’ And from there, it kind of spiraled,” they said of that time period, jokingly adding: “I call it the pronoun pipeline.”Around the same time, Williams started to create content on TikTok, quickly becoming known for short, comedic rants captured during their late-night walks. Most of their content was spur-of-the-moment musings on anything from Christianity and relationships toa new iPhone. In 2022, they started to speak more openly about being genderqueer, posting videos of their drag and makeup routine.Reflecting back on that time period brings a mix of feelings, Williams said. On one hand, it has been extremely gratifying to grow alongside longtime viewers. “The audience that’s been with me the longest has signed on to watch me evolve,” they said. “[They] watched me do makeup for the first time or try to glue down a wig. Those people are why I feel like I can keep going.” On the other hand, Williams sometimes wishes “the first version people knew me of was who I am today”.The rise of GaydarThe nature of their content has continued to grow. In 2024, Williams became the host of Gaydar, created by Amelia Montooth at the company Mutuals Media. The show quizzes an array of guests on queer culture in an attempt to find out if they are “straight, gay or homophobic”. Questions include anything from what a “lipstick lesbian” is to assessing a guest’s knowledge of a gay icon. Willliams herself is also learning alongside contestants, often in real time. “I didn’t know who Sue Bird was and the lesbians whacked me up and down the streets, oh my God,” they quipped.The show’s a comedic premise with the goal of inviting viewers to become educated, said Williams. “We are inundating queer history and queer culture into digestible questions and clips that lets people relax into the learning,” said Williams of the show. “They can take something in a funny way that’s more engaging than saying: “Here are the facts. Here’s a screenshot of this article I read, and you should care about it.”Early versions of the show featured mostly strangers Williams found on the street. The segment has since hosted a number of celebrities and public figures: singers Lucy Dacus, Reneé Rapp and Vivian Jenna Wilson, the daughter of billionaire Elon Musk. The New York City mayoral candidate Mamdani, an avid progressive, attracted social media buzz as one of the first politicians to grace the show. Mamdani shocked Williams when he was successfully able to name a lesbian bar in the city: the Manhattan-staple Cubbyhole.“He was just such a team player about it,” said Williams of the interview experience. “We let our audience, which is younger, know who he is and he got to speak for himself.” Williams added: “It’s cool to be a professional zeitgeist in that way, to know that throughout it all, we’re making a difference.”Williams’s ascent hasn’t come without difficulties. They have faced cruel harassment as they have been more public about their transition. “What they really like to do, especially with dolls, is pick apart fashion and makeup and hair,” said Williams, referring to online trolls. Williams added: “I want to believe that people are becoming more comfortable with transness, but I think they’re coming around to a very specific, stereotypical, western, white, skinny type of trans person. When someone doesn’t fit that standard, they get berated.”But Williams has found ways to consistently ground in the real world, alongside the growing pains. There’s their found family, a best friend from sixth grade. High school friends and their boyfriend as well as online friends they met through TikTok. And, of course, baking and video games are hobbies, living outside the pressure to monetize or make content of their life. A cake for a friend’s birthday was already in the works for later that evening. “It’s either red velvet or strawberry,” Williams said, with a large laugh. “I remember the color, not the flavor.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderBlack US cultureLGBTQ+ rightsTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What could go wrong? I went to find outThe tech billionaire’s ‘retro-futuristic’ drive-in and Tesla charging station has long lines, plenty of glitches – and adoring fansLois Beckettin Los AngelesSat 26 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTShareIt was just before lunchtime on its third day of operation, and the line outsideElon Musk’s newTesla Dinerin Hollywood already stretched to nearly 100 people.The restaurant has been billed as a “retro-futuristic” drive-in where you can grab a high-end burger and watch classic films on giant screens, all while charging yourTesla.After months of buildup and controversy, the diner hadsuddenly opened on Monday, at 4.20pm, the kind of stoner boy joke that Musk is well-knownfor. Hundreds of fans lined up to try burgers in Cybertruck-shaped boxes, or take photos of the Optimus robot serving popcorn on the roof deck of the gleaming circular diner.But that was for the grand opening. Less than 48 hours later, when we visited for lunch, theTeslaDiner experience was less a futuristic fantasy than a case study in how to fail with impunity. Many parts of the experience were breaking down, the food was mediocre, yet the fans were still cheerfully lining up to buy merch.The line to get into the diner on Wednesday morning was so long, an employee told us, in part because of technical problems. The app that allowed Tesla drivers to order from their cars was glitching, so the diner was “prioritizing” Tesla owners who had to come inside to order instead. This meant that non-Tesla owners in the walk-up line might need to wait as long as two to three hours before we got our food.View image in fullscreenA robot serves popcorn at the Tesla Diner in Los Angeles, California, on Tuesday.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAI expected at least a few people to leave the walk-up line immediately, but the only ones who did were two families of Tesla owners who went back to order from within their cars. Even if the app didn’t work for them, they would still get their food faster. The hierarchy was clear: things were broken for everyone, but owners of Musk products had to suffer slightly less.The rest of us kept waiting in the hot sun. “Retro-futurism”, in this case, seemed to meangorgeous, Tesla-inspired, mid-century modern architecturecoupled with wait times that would shutter an ordinary McDonald’s. An episode of Star Trek was playing on the giant drive-in movie screens, but the best entertainment available was watching tricked-out Cybertrucks arrive and depart. I counted at least six when I arrived, and more kept appearing: a neon orange Cybertruck with Texas plates, another floating on giant custom rims. I did not spot a single anti-Musk protester, though social media posts were advertisingprotests outside the dinerlater in the week.‘It is what it is’Musk’s special projects have often unfolded with a degree of chaos. Most recently, his attempt to dismantle the large parts of the US government ended with him feuding with the president he hadspent nearly $300mto elect.Cybertruck boxes and tacos: Elon Musk opens ‘retro futuristic’ Tesla Diner in LARead moreServing high-end burgers to Tesla fans while they charge their electric cars should be much easier than launching space rockets, developing brain implants or running a social media platform that is not overrun with hate speech and harassment. And Musk’s diner operation partners, the Los Angeles chefEric Greenspan, who advised Mr Beast Burger, and restaurateur Bill Chait, of République and Tartine Bakery, have impressive food industry credentials.But the billionaire CEO tends tomakebig promisesandnot quitefulfill them. That appeared to be true even for a tiny burger joint.You don’t have to own a Tesla to order a meal at the diner, and its appeal clearly reached far beyond Tesla drivers. There were many people in the walk-up line on Wednesday with babies and small children, some of whom were particularly excited to be visiting the Tesla Diner after seeing videos about it online. While we all waited and waited, employees in branded T-shirts brought us glasses of water and paper menus.Jake Hook, who runs a Los Angeles-focused “Diner Theory” social media account, had described the Tesla Diner menu to me as “all over the place”, with a combination of “very fast food shlocky” items combined with sandwiches made with “bread from Tartine”, the luxury California bakery. The diner also offers a mix of “own the libs” and “we are the libs” options: on the one hand, “Epic Bacon”, four strips of bacon are served with sauces as ameatfluenceralternative to french fries, and on the other, avocado toast and matcha lattes. There was a kale salad served in a cardboard Cybertruck: welcome to southern California.View image in fullscreenFood outside of  Elon Musk’s new Tesla Diner.Photograph: Lois Beckett/The Guardian“Diners are kind of a reflection of the community, and it doesn’t seem to really be that,” Hook told me over the phone. “It’s like a diner-themed restaurant.”An employee gave the Wednesday walk-up line another update: they didn’t have chicken, waffles or milkshakes, or any of the “charged sodas”, which came with boba and maraschino cherries and extra caffeine.“It gets better and better,” sighed a man behind me.Josh Bates and his son Phoenix were in town for the day from Orange county, where they lived. “We are big Musk fans,” he said.Phoenix, age 10, had been excited to visit the diner. “I never seenElon Muskopen a restaurant, so I just wanted to come here and see how the food is,” he explained.But after waiting in line for 20 minutes and not getting much closer to ordering, Bates decided it was time to find somewhere else for lunch. “It’s the grand opening – things happen,” the father said. “It is what it is. They’re doing the best they can.”Bates wasn’t the only Musk fan with this attitude. Ivan Daza, 36, who lived inLos Angeles, later told me that he had waited two hours the day before, only to be told around 6 or 7pm that the Tesla Diner’s kitchen was closed. He had brought his eight-year-old daughter back the next day to try again. She had seen the Tesla Diner on YouTube and was especially excited to see the Optimus robot. But it turned out that Optimus was not in operation.Daza said he was surprised by the various problems the kitchen seemed to be having – he thought they would have a “plan B”. But he was pleased the diner offered an “experience”.The prices, though expensive, weren’t that bad for Los Angeles. The burger was $13.50, without french fries. Later, as Daza ate the meal that had taken him two days to get, he grinned: “Delicious.”View image in fullscreenFood at the Tesla Diner comes in boxes shaped like cybertrucks.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAThe interior design was certainly closer to Disneyland than In-N-Out: all sleek and shining chrome, futuristic 1950s white chairs and tables, and beautifully designed lighting. The curved staircase up to the Skypad was decorated with robots in display cases on the wall. Inside a curved chrome window was what looked like a pretty ordinary, low-tech restaurant kitchen.I had waited in line for a full hour before I could place my order. When I finally got to the register, I asked an employee to remind me what on the menu was actually available. She said I needed to check the screen in front of me – they had whatever was there. It turned out, contrary to what I had been told, that I could order both chicken and waffles.After the long wait outside, my food arrived in about 10 minutes – much less than the three-hour wait I feared, but absurdly long for any fast-casual restaurant. A waffle, branded with the Tesla lightning bolt, was cold. The fried chicken had a tasty coating but was also cold. The heap of kale and tomatoes was only partially dressed with an odd dill-flavored dressing. The generic-brand cola tasted cheap and was served with a woke bamboo straw. But the food did come in elaborate Cybertruck boxes – and they were, to be honest, delightful.While locals seemed to be forgiving of the new diner’s glitches, some tourists were less impressed. Rick Yin, 32, who was visiting Los Angeles from China with his mother, had stopped by the diner on their way to the airport to “grab a quick lunch” that had turned out not to be quick at all. Yin had also been excited to see the Optimus robot in action, and had hoped the diner would be “more hi-tech”. What he had found was “a regular restaurant”.“It’s all right,” he said, while still waiting for his food. After eating, he said he liked the Cybertruck boxes: “That’s the only thing that’s worth it.”Musk’s ‘retro-futurism’I took my meal upstairs , to the Skypad, an open-air balcony with a view of the charging Teslas. The Twilight Zone was now playing on two giant screens. I sat down next to a steady line of people buying Tesla Diner merch: a $95 retro diner hoodie, $65 Tesla salt and pepper shakers, a $175 “levitating Cybertruck” figurine.There was a large popcorn machine in front of me, which seemed to be where Optimus had been serving snacks on opening night. Musk hadbeen posting on Xearlier in the morning that “Optimus will bring the food to your car next year” and suggesting the robot might be dressed in a “cute” retro outfit.In reality, Optimus was nowhere in sight. The robot was “out today”, an employee told me later, as if the pricey piece of machinery were a human celebrity with a busy schedule. “Maybe tomorrow.”View image in fullscreenGeneral view of Elon Musk’s new Tesla Diner in Hollywood, California.Photograph: AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images“Is it possible to get some popcorn regardless of the robot?” a woman asked.“It’s probably old popcorn,” an employee told her regretfully.A different employee warned me that I could not walk down the same staircase I had taken up to the Skypad because it was too crowded and that “everyone’s colliding with each other and trays and milkshakes”. I would have to go down another way: a bland flight of stairs without any hi-tech decoration.During a Tesla earnings call on Wednesday, as the company discloseddeclining revenue and profits, Musk highlighted his new burger palace as a success: “Diners don’t typically get headline news around Earth,” he bragged. He also called the diner “a shiny beacon of hope in an otherwise sort-of bleak urban landscape”. (It is located on Santa Monica Boulevard, in a neighborhood full of high-end art galleries.)I’d had plenty of time in the diner line to think about “retro-futuristic” experiences, and how good a description that was, not so much for this very ordinary diner, but for the rightwing political project that Musk had joined. We were now moving into a future that offered tank-like electric cars and on-demand drone deliveries, and also a resurgence ofmeasles outbreaksand women dying frompreventable pregnancy-relatedcomplications.But continuing to function in the United States right now requires being very good at compartmentalization. I tucked away the cardboard Cybertruck lids to show my co-workers, threw away the Tesla waffles, and went on with my day. Nothing works properly here any more, but hey, it’s an experience.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesElon MuskTeslaRestaurantsCaliforniaFoodWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hugely revealingRhik SamadderSat 26 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTSharePolice work rarely resembles The Shield or Line of Duty. It’s mostly paperwork, online training and referring people to driver offender courses. But sometimes life imitates art. In 2020, international police hacked the encrypted phone network EncroChat, used by organised crime gangs across the globe. For 74 days, they had access to every message and picture used to coordinate drug trafficking, money laundering, kidnap and murder. “It was the LinkedIn of organised crime,” explains Matt Horne, a former gold commander at the UK’s National Crime Agency (not the actor from Gavin & Stacey).Operation Dark Phone: Murder By Text (Sunday, 9pm, Channel 4) is a documentary-drama cleverly built around these messages, which appear like screenplay dialogue across scenes. It’s an arresting insight into how criminal gangs work – and just as revealing, how they talk. “Sweets” are bullets, while a “pineapple” is a grenade. A violent British criminal known as Live-long, lying low in Spain, organises an acid attack on a rival, in between sending pictures of his breakfast. Cucumber slices on labneh with paprika – nice. The trick, he instructs, is to stop the victim getting to a sink. Hold them down a few minutes, so the acid can do its job. Less nice.Incredibly, there is dark humour amid the grim. Mostly courtesy of the crims, who go by ridiculous two-word usernames on the anonymous network. There’s a Chris Morris absurdity to Mystical-steak, Valued-bridge, Top-shag. At one point, an agent explains how Live-long interacted with Ball-sniffer (who one assumes is lower down). For their part, the agents and white hats are living out the most exciting series of The Wire. In a year, they would usually encounter fewer than a hundred explicit threats to life. Once the curtain was lifted, they intercepted more than 150 in six weeks. Logistically, that’s a problem.View image in fullscreenDetectives had access to the criminals’ messages for 74 days.Photograph: Channel 4The show knows how to grab a viewer. Storylines develop, introduce formidable characters, and bring the action to a climax. Ace-prospect imports AKs and Glocks to the UK, one of which is bought by Live-long, who is looking to take on Ace-prospect in a personal revenge attack. Organised through go-betweens, neither side knows who they are dealing with. The NCA has a 24-hour delay when receiving message data, and must work round the clock to close the gap. When Ace-prospect’s hitman throws a pineapple into the garden of a rival, which fails to explode, the feds are faced with a dilemma: how to protect the lives of children nearby while keeping their intelligence and mission a secret?This is all far sexier than Crimewatch. Instead of losers sticking up BP garages, here are wealthy playas orchestrating crimes from overseas. Is it ethical? Is there a risk of making the criminals look cooler than their cucumbers? The glossy recreations showcase swimming pools, gym-fit bodies, weapons familiar from movies. The actor playing Live-long looks like Claes Bang, and spends the episode with his top off. Yet this is a morality tale. “I’m gonna take his eyes out and chase him around every jail,” writes Live-long from a darkened room, his teeth-whitening gumshield glowing ultra-violet like a nightmare acid trip.View image in fullscreenGang members contributed to their downfall with their constant oversharing, boasting and vanity.Photograph: Channel 4The empty glamour is not just the medium, it’s the message. These criminals’ downfall is their superficiality, their constant messaging and oversharing, their boasting and social media-amplified physical vanity. Live-long’s true identity is eventually uncovered because he sends a triumphant selfie. Can you imagine an old-school career criminal hearing that? I picture them slapping their forehead; except they’ve forgotten to unclench their fist and knock themselves out.The show’s charge comes from knowing this is real, not merely dramatic writing. Part of that charge is fear – a reminder that there are sociopaths among us who hold life cheap and take joy in violence. Operation Dark Phone is a four-part series, from the makers of 24 Hours in Police Custody, and promises far more jaw-dropping revelations as well as some overdue justice. Don’t watch it if your faith in humanity is wavering. I’ll probably be giving pineapples in the supermarket a wide berth too, just in case.Explore more on these topicsOrganised crimeThe watcherTelevisionNCA (National Crime Agency)EncryptionPoliceGun crimeCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brrrr. Brrrrrrr.That’s the sound ofDonald’s Trump’sdistraction machine, which has been running at full power as the president tries his best to stop us all from talking aboutJeffrey Epstein. Or, to be more specific, from talking about just howchummy he waswith the dead paedophile.Though he’s usually a master of controlling the narrative, none of Trump’s normal distraction techniquesseem to be working now. Indeed, at this point we should probably rename theStreisand effectthe Trump-Epstein effect because the president’s repeated insistence that there is NOTHING TO SEE HERE EXCEPT A VERY NASTY WITCH-HUNT only has people scrutinizing his dealings with Epstein more carefully. FromSouth ParktoScotlandto billboards inTimes Square, Trump can’t escape his past association with Epstein.Over the past couple of weeks, a lot of new information has come out about just how close Epstein and the president were. On 17 July, for example, the Wall Street JournalreportedTrump allegedly sent Epstein a 50th birthday card in 2003 with adrawing of a naked womanand a message which said, in part, “may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump denied writing the card and filed a $10bn lawsuitagainst the rightwing paper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, a day after the outlet published the story.The Trump administration is making viruses great again | Arwa MahdawiRead moreTrump’s lawsuit clearly didn’t scare off the Journal because,on Wednesday, it published a new report stating Trump’s name appears “multiple times” in justice department files aboutEpstein. On WednesdayCNN also publishednewly uncovered photos and video footage of the two men together, including one of Epstein at Trump’s wedding to Marla Maples at the Plaza hotel in New York in 1993 and footage from a 1999 Victoria’s Secret fashion event. Then, on Thursday, the New York Timesconfirmedthat Trump’s name appeared on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein’s 50th birthday, as the Journal first reported, along with a number of other well-known Epstein associates including Leslie Wexner, then the owner of Victoria’s Secret. The Times further reported that in 1997 the president had written a note calling Epstein “the greatest!” in a copy of Trump: The Art of the Comeback.While none of these new bits of information are evidence of criminal conduct on Trump’s part, the president’s furious reaction to anything Epstein-related, along with his administration’ssudden U-turnon its promise to release damning evidence related to possible Epstein clients, certainly makes Trump look like he’s got something to hide. And it’s not just Trump, of course. The sudden flurry of reporting about Epstein means that a lot of powerful men, including Bill Clinton, who the Journal says also sent abirthday letter to the disgraced financier, have been having a bad couple of weeks.The big question now is this: will the renewed interest in Epstein blow over in a few more weeks or could this deal a serious political blow to Trump and his lackeys? Trump is nicknamed the “comeback kid” for good reason: the man has an uncanny ability to shake off scandal. Still, nobody is completely untouchable; could the ghost of Epstein be the thing that finally topples King Trump from his throne? While that’s obviously an impossible question to answer, there are a few ways this could all play out.The first, and the best-case scenario for Trump, is that interest in Epstein organically fizzles out. That seems unlikely to happen given how furious the president’s base are; more than a third of them disapprove of how he’s handled the Epstein files, according to apoll from Quinnipiac University.The New York Times calls this“perhaps the most intraparty discontent Mr Trump has experienced as president”. The Democrats havealso seized on the issueas a way to fight Trump and will probably do their best to keep it in the news. While the Democrats are normally placid, they have beenvery much been on the offensewith the Epstein files.Another way (perhaps the most likely way) this could go is that the Trump administration brokers some sort of deal with Ghislaine Maxwell, the only person involved with Epstein who is in jail right now, in which she releases enough carefully curated information about the sex-trafficking case for Trump’s base to be satisfied, allowing the president to move on from the matter. Thedeputy US attorney generalhas met with Maxwell twice this week to see if she might have “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims”. While Maxwell’s lawyer has said Trump’s Department of Justicehas not offered clemency, Maxwell is rumored to beseeking a pardon. One can certainly imagine a situation in which she “cooperates” in a way that is mutually beneficial to her and Trump.The third scenario, which may be wishful thinking, is that Trump can’t contain the fallout over the Epstein files and the scandal massively hurts the Republicans in themidterms. OneGOP senator has already warnedthat “this is going to be an issue all the way through next year’s election.”Another possibility is that Trump continues his distractions until one actually sticks. The gen Z Democratic congressman Maxwell Frosthas joked that the“White House is about to drop proof of aliens” to stop people talking about Epstein. Joke or not, there’s certainly a non-zero chance of that happening. And if it’s not aliens, maybe Trump will start a nuclear war to shut us all up.Whatever happens with Trump and Epstein, however, I think it’s worth stressing that this case is about far more than the president. It’s about scores of vulnerable girls who were exploited by powerful men and let down by the justice system and parts of the media, which didn’t pursuethe story for years. I can’t help but notice how many Democrats only seemed to develop a passionate interest in the Epstein files when it became politically expedient for them to do so. Epstein’s countless victims deserve far better than that.Apology for South Korean woman convicted of biting tongue of alleged attackerIn 1965, 18-year-old Choi Mal-ja fought back against a man who she said was trying to rape her and bit off part of his tongue.

Welcomes come in all shapes and sizes tooSat 26 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Jul 2025 10.53 EDTShareAs an American comedian living in Scotland, I’m often asked: “Krystal, why don’t you talk about Trump more on stage? I’ll bet that subject is rife for comedy!” Yesterday he was in Washington, todaythe schedule says Scotland. I know this visit isn’t a personal attack on me, but woo boy, it sure does feel like it. I live in Edinburgh. But I didn’t come to Scotland so I could be around the most annoying, unhinged, rich Americans in existence.There are many reasons I don’t tend to talk aboutDonald Trumpthat much on stage. For one, that 10 to 20 seconds in the morning before I remember who occupies the position of president of the United States is honestly the best part of my day. And those few precious moments I savour will not be present for me over the next four days, because the aura of Trump’s presence will permeate my consciousness, not to mention all the major news outlets, with everyone giving their very strong opinions on this man who has managed to inflame humanity more than anyone in all of our collective living memory. And what’s more, he doesn’t seem to care.But it sure doesfeellike he wantsScotlandto love him, doesn’t it? He desperately wants to be embraced as Scottish. His mother was born on the Isle of Lewis, so I suppose that’s something.But the truth is, he’s just like any other American who comes to Scotland on holiday. I love asking American tourists what brings them to Scotland, because they always say the same thing. “Well, actually you see …I’mScottish. And I’m tracing my roots.” And I always say to them: “Wow. You should definitely tell every Scottish person you meet that. Watch out, because you’re going to be so popular.”If I had to find an upside to Trump visiting, and there aren’t many, I’d say at least it makes me look good in comparison. It’s the same reason I love having English people at Scottish gigs. I once dated a Scottish guy who said to me: “Don’t worry Krystal, I hate the English way more than I hate the Americans.” What an absolute sweetheart.And the thing is, as much as I hate to admit it, I know where Trump is coming from when he expresses a small need for Scotland to accept him. Because I feel the same. I love Scotland. I’ve had my kids here (and not just because it’s free and I can’t pass up a deal). I will always live here. I just know it. I’ve never lived anywhere longer than I’ve lived in Scotland. I have a lot in common with many Scots I encounter. I’ve been drinking heavily my entire life and yet for some reason, still can’t hold my liquor. I buy those weird little flat barbecues and burn a hole in the grass right under the “no barbecuing” sign. I’ve even accidentally said “aye” unironically more than once.Why don’t I talk about Trump more in my comedy? Honestly, I’ve lived here so long I know more about Nicola Sturgeon and thereintroduction of wolvesthan any of Trump’s day-to-day blunders.So he’s here, and nearly every person I’ve told that I’m writing this article has warned me that I’ll probably be monitored and put on some government list of scary, threatening comedians and writers who are flagged as they try to enter the US for saying unfavourable things about Trump. I guess we’ll just have to see how that goes.It’s difficult to put into words the way his visit truly makes me feel, but I know who could. Nine years ago, during another visit by Trump, the late comedian Janey Godleyknew exactly what to do. A one-woman protest, with a very very sweary sign making clear her absolute disdain for the would-be president. Humour and rebellion. Mutiny. Her act of defiance went around the world.With Trump in Scotland, on his golf course at Turnberry, Godley knew that no long, flowery language was needed. No 1,000-word opinion pieces. (Though she could smash those, too.)Mr President, you probably don’t even know who Janey Godley is. Which is one of the many reasons you will never, ever be Scottish. But she crafted those beautiful four sweary words saying exactly what she thought of you. She expressed in perfect, poignant prose what so many of us feel down to the marrow of our bones. I won’t quote her directly, of course, but we all know it.I’m sure you’ll enjoy your time here, protected by Scottish police and security. Playing golf and speaking with other powerful men. Enjoying the delicious Scottish tap water. And you’re allowed to do that, I guess. But we don’t have to like it.Krystal Evans is an American comedian who lives in Scotland.

In this story, trotted out occasionally since 2016 to reassure those who are worried about Donald Trump’s influence, the private and public bodies of American commerce, governance, healthcare and education are possessed of uncommonly robust internal accountability mechanisms, rock-hard rectitude, and a coolly rational self-interest. Trump can only do so much damage to America’s economy, culture and way of life, it was reasoned, because these institutions would not bend to his will. They would resist him; they would check his excesses. When forced to choose, as it was always accepted that they one day would be, between Trump’s demands and their own principles and purposes, the institutions would always choose themselves.This week put another nail into the coffin of this idea, revealing its valorization of American institutions to be shortsighted and naive. The latest intrusion of reality comes in the form of adeal that Columbia University madewith the Trump administration, in which the university made a host of academic, admissions and governance concessions to the Trump regime andagreed to pay a $200m finein order to restore its federal research funding. The deal marks the formal end of Columbia’s academic independence and the dawn of a new era of regulation by deal making, repression and bribery in the field of higher education.The story goes like this. After Columbia became the centerpiece of a nationwide movement of campus encampments in protest of the Israeli genocide in Gaza, the university administration began a frantic and at times sadistic crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus speech in an effort to appease congressional Republicans, who had gleefully seized upon the protests to make cynical and unfounded accusations that the universities were engaged in antisemitism. Columbia invited police on to its campus, who rounded up protesting students in mass arrests. This showed that the university would bend to Republican pressure, but did nothing to satisfy its Republican adversaries – who demanded more and more from Columbia, making their attacks on the university the center of their broader war on education, diversity and expertise.When theTrump administrationwas restored to power in January, the White House partnered with the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Justice to exert further pressure on Columbia, looking to exert a level of control over the university’s internal operations that is unprecedented for a private institution. This time, the university’s vast federal research funding – issued in the form of grants that enable university scientists, doctors and academics to make discoveries and pursue knowledge that has enormous implications for American commerce, health and wellbeing – was held hostage. Facing the end of its functioning as a university, Columbia capitulated and went to what was euphemistically called “the negotiating table” – really, an exchange on the precise terms of its extortion.The deal that resulted gives the Trump administration everything it wants. A Trump-approved monitor will now have the right to review Columbia’s admissions records, with the express intent of enforcing a supreme court ban on affirmative action – in other words, ensuring that the university does not admit what the Trump administration deems to be too many non-white students. The Middle Eastern studies department is subject to monitoring, as well, afteran agreement in March.The agreement is not a broad-level, generally applicable regulatory endeavor that applies to other universities – although given the scope of the administration’s ambitions at Columbia, it is hard to say whether such a regulatory regime would be legal. Instead, it is an individual, backroom deal, one that disregards the institution’s first amendment rights and the congressionally mandated protections for its grants in order to proceed with a shakedown. “The agreement,” writes the Columbia Law School professorDavid Pozen, “gives legal form to an extortion scheme.” The process was something akin to a mob boss demanding protection money from a local business. “Nice research university you have here,” the Trump administration seemed to say to Columbia. “Would be a shame if something were to happen to it.”That Columbia folded, and sacrificed its integrity, reputation and the freedom of its students and faculty for the federal money, speaks to both the astounding lack of foresight and principle by the university leadership as well as the Trump movement’s successful foreclosure of institutions’ options for resistance. With the federal judiciary full of Trump appointees – and the supreme court showing itself willing to radically expand executive powers and rapidly diminish the rights of other parties in its eagerness to facilitate Trump’s agenda – there is little hope for Columbia, or the other universities that will inevitably be next, to successfully litigate their way out of the administration’s threats. But nor does capitulation seem likely to put an end to the Trump administration’s demands. The installation of an administration-approved monitor seems poised to offer a toehold from which the government will impose more and more limitations on scholarship, speech and association. There is, after all, no limiting principle to the Trump administration’s absolutist expansion of its own prerogatives, and no way for Columbia to ensure that its funding won’t becut off again. The university, in time, will become more what Trump makes it than what its students do.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is likely to use its experience at Columbia as a template to extract substantive concessions and big payouts from other institutions. And these are not just limited to universities. On Thursday, the day after Columbia’s capitulation, theFederal Communications Commission approved the mergerof Paramount and Skydance. The pending merger – and the Trump administration’s threat to squash it – had been a rumored motivation for CBS’s decision to pay Trump millions to settle a frivolous defamation suit; it was also rumored to have caused an outcry at the CBS news magazine program 60 Minutes and the end of the evening talkshow The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, when writers, journalists, and performers on those shows stood by their critical coverage of the president or mocked the deal their bosses paid him. The shakedown, after all, is a tactic that lots of institutions are vulnerable to, and Trump is already using it effectively to stifle some of the most visible forms of dissent. The institutions are not standing firm against him; they are capitulating. They are choosing their short-term interest over their long-term integrity.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsColumbia UniversityOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS universitiescommentShareReuse this content"

His time would be better spent planning for a world beyond the ‘special relationship’Sat 26 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Jul 2025 03.38 EDTShareDonald Trump’s victory in last November’s US presidential election presented Keir Starmer, Britain’s Labour prime minister, with a choice – and an opportunity. Eithercosy up to a manwhose obnoxious, hard-right, ultra-nationalist policies are inimical to UK security and foreign policy interests, economic prosperity and democratic values; or risk a rupture with the US, a longstanding but overbearing ally, and seize the moment to redefine Britain’s place in the world, primarily through reintegration in Europe.Starmer made the wrong call – and Britain has paid a heavy price ever since. The cost to national dignity and the public purse will be on painful show this weekend as Trump, pursued by theEpstein scandaland angry protesters, makes an expensively policed, ostensibly privatevisit to his golf coursesin Scotland. On Monday, the prime minister will travel north to kiss the ring. More humiliations loom. In September, Trump will return for an unprecedented second state visit, at Starmer’s unctuous behest. At that point, the full, embarrassing extent of Britain’s thraldom will be there for all the world to see.Let’s be clear. Trump is no friend of Britain’s and is, in key respects, a dangerous foe. Efforts tocurry favourwith this narcissist will ultimately prove futile. Trump always reneges. His unedifying career is littered with broken promises and relationships, personal and political. His only loyalty is to himself. Right now, this wannabe dictator is busy making America not greater but weaker, poorer, less influential and more disliked. Don’t let him drag Britain down, too. It’s not too late to make the break.US leadership of the western democracies used to be taken for granted. Now it’s a problem. Politicians in both Britain’s main parties have difficulty accepting this shift. As so often, public opinion is ahead of them. Recent polling by the Pew Research Center found62% of Britonshave no confidence in Trump “to do the right thing regarding world affairs”. Most of those surveyed in 24 countries viewed him as dangerous, arrogant and dishonest. Thanks to him, the US’s international standing is in freefall.Giving Israel a free hand in Gaza is the most egregious example of how Trump’s policies conflict with UK interests. Starmer’sgovernment has condemnedthe deliberate killing and starving of civilians. Among the 55% ofBritons opposedto Israel’s actions, 82% believe they amount to genocide, a YouGov poll found last month. A majority backsadditional sanctions. Trump’s support for forced relocations, opposition to a two-state solution and close collaboration with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader charged with war crimes, all contradict stated UK policy. Trump bears significant personal responsibility for what Starmer calls the “unspeakable and indefensible” horror in Gaza.Starmer warned dramatically last month that the UK was in growingdanger of military attackfollowing Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Britain and other Nato states have steadfastly supported Kyiv. Not so Trump. Since taking office, he has toadied to Vladimir Putin, vilified Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suspended military supplies and questioned Nato’s future. Ignoring proliferation fears, Trump is simultaneously fuelling a nuclear arms race. Now the hapless Starmer has been panicked intobuying US jetscapable of carrying warheads and, it is claimed, hassecretly allowedUS-owned nukes back into the UK. This is not the Britain Labour voters want.Trump recently reversed himself on Ukraine, patched things up with Nato and criticised Putin. But he could change his mind again tomorrow. Oblivious to the glaring double standard, he congratulates himself meanwhile on “obliterating” Iran’s nuclear facilities – even though last month’s illegal US bombing was onlypartly successful. Britain rightly favours negotiations with Tehran. It wasn’t consulted.Trump’s tariff wars pose a direct threat to the UK economy, jobs and living standards. Despite Starmer’s deal mitigating their impact,10% tariffsor higher remain on most US-bound exports. Trump’s bullying of Canada, Mexico, Greenland, Panama and others over sovereignty, migration and trade feeds uncertainty. His irrational hostility to the EU may gratify the likes of Nigel Farage (and Putin). But endless rows between important allies do not serve Britain’s interests.Trump is fighting to kill off DEI – and the corporate cowardice over Gaza shows he’s winning | Jinan YounisRead moreThe advance of hard-right, nationalist-populist parties in Europe and, most recently,in Japansuggests the socially divisive, chauvinist agendas championed by Trump’s Maga movement have widening international appeal. That augurs ill for democracy in Britain and the world generally. For the same reason, Trump’s assaults on US constitutional rights, notably minority and gender rights, attacks on judges,universitiesand public institutions, and attempts to suppress independent media scrutiny are ominous. Such toxic behaviour is contagious. Trumpism is the new Covid. Britain needs inoculation.By slashing overseas aid, cutting public service broadcasters such asVoice of America, defunding and ostracising UN agencies, flouting international courts and pretending the climate emergency is illusory, Trump inflicts immense harm on the US’s reputation, global influence and soft-power armoury. He is wrecking therules-based orderthat Britain views as fundamental. It’s a gift to China, Russia and authoritarians everywhere. As Pentagon spending rockets to$1tn annually, his crude message is unmistakeable: might makes right. Brute strength rules.Trump is a disaster for the west and all in the UK who respect progressive democratic values. His second term will evidently be moreglobally perilous, destructive and destabilising than his first. In support of universal principles established centuries before anyone heard of him, Britain should steer clear of this walking, talking catastrophe. Rather than hug Trump close, Starmer should keep him at arm’s length for fear of infection.Don’t go to Scotland to see him, Prime Minister. Don’t waste your breath. Instead, start planning for the post-special-relationship era. Make the break. It’s time.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age.”Well, hallelujah.Except, here in Australia, we are still mired in the politics of climate and at risk of missing the window of opportunity for both environmental protection and economic benefit.Australia lifts ban on US beef but denies decision was made to appease TrumpRead moreRegulatory hurdles, worker shortages and community blowback in regional Australia have all combined to feed the culture wars and the erosion of social licence that is fundamental to progress the energy transition.AsEzra Klein, co-author of the viral book Abundance, has remarked of late, “We should be able to argue that the clean energy future should be fucking awesome.”Yet, we are failing.And in that we are betraying young people and those who are both most concerned about the impact of the renewables revolution on their communities and most at risk from the disasters that make it necessary.This week the first sitting of the 48th parliament typified time-wasting point-scoring politics with former Nationals leaders Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack teaming up to push for the repeal of the legislated net zero target, undermining the current leader, David Littleproud, in the process.This is irresponsible and gutless, and the Albanese government with its characteristic pragmatic caution must not allow its massive majority to be an excuse to curb ambition because it doesn’t need to try too hard to appear to be betterInstead, governments and oppositions at state and federal level need to go back to basics and carefully build the case to step communities through the big changes ahead from the point of view of an opportunity for affordable power and better jobs as well as a necessity.We know that Australians care about climate.Many have already been touched directly by climate disasters. Most will have seen their insurance premiums affected at the very least.The 2022 election was certainly influenced by the floods, fires and storms that led up to it, and the Morrison government’s refusal to “hold a hose”.And while theCoalitionsuccessfully channelled much of the 2025 election debate into cost-of-living pressure, even here in Goldstein, where the demographic is older than the national average, polling still consistently showed climate in the top three concerns of constituents.Many Australians also understand that climate and environment policy and the economy are intrinsically linked.In his recent address to the National Press Club, former Treasury secretary Ken Henry tied the two together, as he described failures in improving environmental management as “a wilful act of intergenerational bastardry”.The government has revived plans for a federal EPA after parking its promised broader reforms to environmental laws towards the end of the last parliament apparently under pressure from business.Henry argues for an overhaul that protects and restores nature, through high-integrity incentives for nature restoration and carbon storage with genuine cooperation between all levels of government and clear standards and decision-making.He frames nature restoration as an environmental and economic benefit, both of which are critical to the net zero transition.Speaking of which, what wasnottalked about in Canberra this week?While Joyce and McCormack try to ditch the 43% net zero 2030 emissions target (which is set as a floor not a ceiling because I negotiated that into the law with the federal energy minister,Chris Bowen), Australia’s net zero target for 2035 has not yet been set.The government has been waiting for advice from the Climate Change Authority to set the new nationally determined contribution (NDC), which required factoring in the outcomes of the Australian election and the 2024 US election.Now that all of that is over, to what extent will the Albanese government take its power amid this circular debate?Albanese government plotted to maintain native forest logging in NSW if court battle was lost, documents showRead moreSome in the business world, specifically the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, say a target of 65-75% would be “exceedingly challenging for the Australian economy”.Yet expert analysis shows that a 2035 target of sub 75% or more (on 2005 levels) is aligned with more than 2C of global heating. And, according to theClimate Council, “climate-fuelled disasters are expected to cost the Australian economy $94bn a year by 2060 if pollution levels remain high”. At least 8.8% of Australian homes will be uninsurable due to high exposure to climate disasters by 2100.There’s no question it’s complicated, practically and politically.But arguably, Labor has six years in power ahead. That’s a decent runway.And pragmatically, three-quarters of millennials and gen Z voters, now the largest group of Australian voters,named climate changeas an important consideration for the 2025 election.By 2028, there will be several hundred thousand more of them.And they’ll expect something beyond more “intergenerational bastardry”.Zoe Daniel is a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and former independent member for GoldsteinExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionClimate crisisCoalitionNational partyLabor partycommentShareReuse this content"

Starvation is not only the biological phenomenon of the body wasting away. It’s also the death rattle of society. Famine is the sight of people scavenging for food in a garbage heap. It’s a woman cooking in secret, hiding food from her starving cousins. It’s a family selling its grandmother’s jewellery for a single meal, their faces blank and emotionless, their eyes glazed. This is the degradation, the humiliation, the shame – and, yes, the dehumanisation – that happens when human beings scrabble for food like animals.This is a reality that no statistics can capture. And the methods for measuring food emergencies and assigning them grades – “famine” being the worst – break down when society breaks down in this way.But just as an experienced physician can diagnose a fever without having to send blood samples to the laboratory, veteran humanitarian workers, who witnessed the depths of human suffering in Biafra in 1969 or in Ethiopia in 1984, recognise these symptoms when they see them.And they see it inGazatoday.Turn to the statements of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – the US and Israel-backed organisation that began operating in May – and you enter a different world. The GHF presents itself as a professional, compassionate operation designed for the 21st century. You will see images of order and efficiency, anda proud announcementthat it delivered more than 2m meals yesterday from its four “secure distribution sites”.And alongside the pictures of those starving children, of women collapsing from hunger, there are also pictures of healthy young men. In contrast to the footage, filmed by Palestinian journalists, of the desperate scramble for the little aid still provided through the UN, the GHF hasimages of orderly distributions, of its own workers holding the hands of Palestinian children.Israeli spokespeople insistthat the United Nations has hundreds of trucks of food inside the Gaza perimeter that it refuses to distribute.But that rosy picture doesn’t stand even the simplest scrutiny. There are four reasons why it’s at best an improvisation by amateurs and at worst a cover for the crime of ongoing mass starvation.First, the numbers just don’t add up. In April, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UNcalculated the food stocksremaining in Gaza, after 18 months of siege and war, and two months of total Israeli blockade. It estimated that food availability would fall to only half what’s needed to sustain life at some point between May and July. That means that the aid effort needs to cover the entirety of Gaza’s food needs. Two million meals a day is less than half of what’s needed. The GHF rations may have slowed the march of starvation, but not by much.Second, you can’t relieve famine by numbers alone. The GHF system is like standing at the edge of a big pond and feeding the fish by throwing breadcrumbs. Who gets to eat its rations?Starvation strikes the vulnerable minority. The metric used by the UN for determining when acute food insecurity isat famine levelsis when 20% of families are facing extreme food shortage. Starvation strikes the weakest, not the strongest.Over the decades, humanitarian programmes have worked out how best to target the poorest, such as women without their husbands, looking after several children and perhaps elderly parents as well. It’s the last mile of aid delivery that counts.The GHF runs four ration stations. Three are in the far south of Gaza in the ruins of Rafah, one in central Gaza. They’re all in military zones. They open for short periods and short notice. To get these rations, people must camp out in the rubble – ready to rush to the gates at a moment’s notice, and running the gauntlet of the Israel Defense Forces’ military posts. They know that the only means IDF soldiers have for crowd control is firing live ammunition – even when they’re not shooting to kill.When the GHF speaks of “secure distribution sites”, it’s referring to how it controls its packages up to the point of handing them over, not to how it safely delivers them to the neediest. Dozens of aid seekers are killed each day trying to reach these sites.The Guardian view on starvation in Gaza: it will take more than words to halt Israel’s genocide | EditorialRead moreHow will the overstressed mother of hungry children, or elderly or disabled people, join this stampede? How would they run the gauntlet not only of those military posts but also of the gangsters keen to steal the most valuable foodstuffs for themselves, or to sell in the market? The GHF has no idea who is eating the rations. Theirs isn’t a formula for feeding the poorest. It’s the law of the jungle.Third, the assistance must be designed for what people really need. Top of the list are specialised foods to care for malnourished children who cannot consume regular meals, such as Plumpy’Nut, a ready-to-use therapeutic food.The GHF ration boxtypically containsflour, pasta, tahini, cooking oil, rice and chickpeas or lentils. No baby food. No Plumpy’Nut. And it has no trained nurses or nutritionists in the community to actually provide therapeutic care to starving children.Consider the desperate mother who’s literally at the end of the food chain: how will she cook the rations she gets? How does she find clean water? Israel hasreduced water availabilityto a small fraction of need, and isbombing the remaining desalination plants. What can she use to make a fire? Without electricity or cooking gas, she may burn garbage to heat food.And last and most tellingly, a truly humanitarian operation supports the afflicted people, respecting the dignity of those in need, working with the communities. The GHF, essentially, does the opposite: it humiliates and undermines.The social breakdown that we are witnessing, the degrading of human beings, is not a byproduct of the harm that Israel is inflicting. That’s the central element of the crime: destroying Palestinian society. The government of Israel shows no indication that it cares in the slightest whether Palestinians live or die. It wants to avoid the stigma of being accused of starvation and genocide, and the GHF is its current alibi.

I was able to meet some of them: in a rehabilitation centre for war veterans in Cherkasy and a mental health clinic for internally displaced families in Vinnytsia.Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, I’ve drawn many political cartoons about the war; drawings that feature Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Vladimir Putin and the occasional bear. It looked very different from the ground, where war is fought and lived by ordinary people, just like us. In the hospitals I visited in May this year, I sketched the precise way in which war is mapped on individual bodies and listened to the stories behind their scars. I drew what people told me, as well as what I saw, because trauma and hope are intangible things of memory and imagination. There’s nothing left to draw of an amputated limb but memories – the same could be said for a lost home or relative. These things are beyond a camera’s reach, which I think gives you licence to reach for a pencil.I watched an MSF psychiatrist help a soldier regain feeling in his paralysed hand using tiny scraps of textured materials intended to evoke strong memories. As she brushed them against his fingertips, she explained: “This cable-knit might remind him of a grandma’s jumper; this fluff, a child’s teddy; this one, grass.” I saw echoes of this image throughout the hospital in injured people reaching back or forwards to life beyond the war. People described their memories of peace in vivid terms, but when I asked what victory meant I was met with nonplussed stares. One soldier said: “No idea … but when it happens, I’ve promised my wife I’ll shave off my beard.” His beard was long. His wife was perched on his hospital bed and asked if I’d like to see how well her husband can lift his dumbbells with his one remaining arm.Dima (29)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianAfter Dima regained consciousness in the hospital, he phoned his mother to tell her that “everything was fine – just a few scratches”. “It wasn’t true,” he tells me. “There was a big hole in my leg and in my ear and arm.” He still can’t sleep. “My nightmares are always the same. They’re taking me from the hospital back to the trenches, and then I am above – I am the drone making the projectile drop that hits me.”Dima flies first-person view (FPV) drones so he knows how this looks. His psychologist tells him he might sleep better if he wasn’t on his phone all night. But he likes watching videos on Instagram and YouTube – mostly bodycam footage of the war that, he explains, help him to understand the “subtleties” of his own memories: what he did, what he could have done. He tells me about his mentor, Matrovski, who made him stay down in the trench while he looked out to see if the Russians were still there. Matrovski was immediately shot in the neck and bled to death.The shard of shrapnel that buried itself in Dima’s body when the drone projectile detonated is now sitting on his bedside table. He tells me: “It momentarily paralysed me from the bottom of my spine to the end of my extremities. I thought it had injured my spinal cord and I wouldn’t be able to walk. I thought ‘this is the end’. But I started to touch my head to see if I had any blood. I didn’t find any and I said to myself: ‘I am alive, I am not dead.’ I could hear the enemy drones watching. FPVs have a horrible squeaky sound – like Formula One [cars]. If it’s high, then it’s quiet. When it gets louder, then you worry. I could hear them watching so I lay very still and pretended to be dead. I heard them leave. Then I was screaming from the pain. I thought I would bleed to death.”He survived, he says, because “I am my mother’s only child. When I joined the army she cried and so I’d promised her that everything would be fine.” She is a kindergarten teacher, “the kindest person in the world. She has brown hair and green eyes like mine. Always smiling – even when she’s sad.”Olena (30)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianI ask Olena where home is. She tells me about the clouds in Luhansk. “They’re really beautiful, like mountains because there aren’t any tall buildings there. Home is where the sky has no missiles, just clouds and the sun and birds and planes – but not military, safe, with passengers. The most important thing is the feeling that you can look at the sky without being scared. After 2022, I had to again learn how to look at the sky without fear.”The first time Olena was displaced by conflict was in 2014, when she was 19. She “got on a train to nowhere” and wound up in Kyiv, searching through old Facebook friends for somewhere to stay. She rebuilt her life in Luhansk. She says: “I loved my flat. The children’s bedroom had pastel wallpaper with balloons. My husband and I built a big balcony and I pasted these stickers of pink peonies all over it. We had a great life, we didn’t expect to have war … even more war. Then we started hearing explosions from the frontlines … we saw the first missiles in the sky, interceptions – the children were terrified.”When the invasion happened, Olena and her family fled to Vinnytsia. She says that now “I feel like I have two lives. Part of my soul is left there back in that life. So I’m here, but at the same time I’m there.” When I ask her what she hopes for the future, she says: “I don’t see the future, for now. I live in the present day … I just think ‘I woke up in the morning, thank God, I went to work, thank God. My children went to school, God thank you.’” She has portraits of her children tattooed on her arms. She shows me her other tattoos: a mandala, a daisy with a plaster, birds. “They’re all connected to the war,” she says. “They’re like scars.”I show her my tattoos, and some of my drawings. Olena likes drawing too. She shows me a photo of one of her paintings – a road leading to a little house on a hill covered with bright yellow wheat. The sky is dark blue, because, Olena says, “it’s stormy, like it’s about to rain”. She points to the single lit window of the house. “I added this to be like hope.” I ask if this drawing is of a real place where she lived. She says no. “It’s an abstract place – a home in the heart.”Roman (40)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianIn 2022, Roman quit his job collecting parcels and joined a medical brigade collecting wounded and dead soldiers. He says that “sometimes the body parts were blown up into the trees”.When the drone detonated, his legs didn’t get that far. They ended up in the box next to him in the medical stabilisation centre, still with their shoes on. He says: “I remember looking at my legs in the box and I was so scared when I realised that I couldn’t get this part of my past back – that now my future would be very different. I was so sad to say goodbye to what was in the box … Then I realised it was too early to die. I hadn’t said goodbye to my family, or finished the house that I’d been building for them.”When Roman started building the house many years ago, he’d gone to the bank to take out a loan from a “very beautiful woman with white blond hair. I told her all about the house and she said: ‘Maybe one day you’ll show me.’ So I took her number and invited her to coffee.” Tanya and Roman married soon after and now have two children, Alexi, 12, and Yvan, 21. Their house is finally almost finished – “white pillars and blue walls – only a few tiles on the roof still to complete … maybe also a swimming pool”. He tells me how his family loved to go swimming in the sea in Odesa. “We used go all together. But if I imagine going back, I cannot understand one thing – how will I be able to go in the sea? Can you swim in a prosthesis?” I don’t know the answer but – after a long pause – Roman does: “Yvan goes to the gym. His muscles are even bigger than mine. He can bring me on his back into the sea. And I will swim with him. Then he’ll take me back out of the water and put me on the chair, and I’ll put the prostheses back on. That’s how it will be.”Roman called his wife from the hospital to tell her that he’d lost his legs but “not to worry: everything is fine”. He said to her: “Nothing has changed. I don’t want anything to change.”Inna (42) & Tetiana (48)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianInna and Tetiana come to talk to me together, exchanging glances before every answer, sharing tissues and whispered encouragements. Tetiana’s son, Valeria, and Inna’s husband, Mykola, are prisoners of war in Russia. They were captured on the same day in May 2022. Valeria is 27 now. Inna struggles to remember her husband’s age. She says it’s because “we don’t celebrate birthdays any more. When they were captured, everything stopped.” But when I ask what Valeria and Mykola look like, Inna answers: “Now or before?”Inna and Tetiana wait at every prisoner exchange in the hope that their relatives will be among those released. When they’re not, sometimes the soldiers who have been bring back news of them. That’s how Inna and Tetiana know how different their loved ones now look – “exhausted, so thin”. For the first year of her husband’s captivity, Inna struggled to eat. She says she’s a bit better now; she’s found Tetiana. “We have the same pain, we understand it.” The women believe that they have a “spiritual connection with their loved ones”, that they “must stay strong and cry less so they may also feel our hope and prayers”. Inna describes how her husband comes to check on her in her dreams.Inna says she likes to picture sitting with her husband in their garden back in Mariupol. Mykola liked to grow flowers there, “wild forest flowers – I don’t even know where he got those seeds. At the time I didn’t even like them! But now nothing would make me happier.” Tetiana says she also likes to picture Valeria “somewhere in nature – a field of white chamomile with the sun shining really bright … birdsong, fresh air.”Neither Inna nor Tetiana have had any direct contact with their relatives for three years. If they could talk, Inna tells me she’d say “that I love him – that we’re waiting”. Tetiana adds: “We’re waiting. We’re definitely going to wait.”Tetiana (66)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianTetiana cries silently throughout our conversation. She doesn’t want to stop or skip any questions; she always looks me directly in the eye. Her son Maksym was born in 1995, the same year as me. He was killed fighting in Donetsk on 8 May 2022.“It’s not possible to describe the burden of the pain I’m bearing,” says Tetiana. “I think about him every day; when I wake up, when I go to sleep. Sometimes when I’m walking and I see a young man who resembles mine – tall, gentle, strong – I think ‘oh’, because I had once such a boy.” She says her grief is “like the evening sky, like twilight – there’s still some light there, and the light is all Maksym”.Tetiana was born in Russia and came to Ukraine in 1974. She says they’re a railway family. “I worked there for 40 years. It’s where I met my husband. We wanted Maksym to join the railway too, but even from his childhood he always dreamed of joining the military.” As a boy, Maksym playedzarnitsain the woods. It’s an old Soviet war game, and the name translates from Russian as “heat lightning”. “This is how he will remain for ever for me,” she says. “Running through the woods. There’s a photo of his dead body which his commander took. I still haven’t looked at it: I can’t. Let him remain alive for me, for the rest of my life.”He was “always a military man – he loved his country”, but she says he was gentle too. In the trenches, he’d feed the lost cats and send her photos of them. She says he’d call to say: “Mum, don’t worry. Everything’s going to be fine.”Dmytro (43) & Petrov (40)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianPetrov says he and his older brother, Dmytro, have been “making little models of soldiers together since childhood, and conducting fake wars. Then we grew up and had a different kind of war.” Dmytro says that “in the war, we were always together”. They were together when the drone detonated under their car, killing the other two soldiers with them. The brothers are now recuperating from their injuries in the same hospital, in different wards. I talk to them separately, but each brother tells me mostly about the other.Petrov says that when the drone detonated, “I felt a very strong burning sensation and I was screaming. My brother was screaming that he was injured too and I was so happy that he was screaming because it meant he was alive.” Dmytro says: “I heard my brother’s voice and I calmed down. It probably all happened very quickly, but it felt like time stopped. When I realised that Petrov was seriously injured in all four limbs – how much blood he was losing – I knew that I had to provide medical aid for him or he would die. I’ve been on the frontline for a long time. I’ve tied a lot of tourniquets. So in this situation I’m not panicking. I’m calm. I tied the tourniquets. But I was worried about him.” Petrov says Dmytro worries too much, “but it’s natural, I’m his little brother.” Dmytro says: “I’ve been protective of Petrov since picking him up from kindergarten. He’s not weak, he’s very strong. But I have to look after him. He’s my little brother.”They are now healing well, although Dmytro says he’s worried about Petrov’s hands. His doctors say he’ll never regain full movement. Dmytro says his brother has “golden hands: whatever he likes to do with them, he does so well. He’s very creative: a sculptor, he plays the guitar.” Petrov says it was Dmytro’s guitar – his brother bought it but got bored after learning one song and quit, so Petrov learned to play instead.Petrov hopes the war has left him with enough movement in his hands to go back to making sculptures, and there’s one sitting on his bedside table in the hospital. It’s a phone stand with the insignia of his village’s brigade, which he insists on giving to me. I’m concerned that without it Petrov won’t be able to hold his phone, as one hand is swathed in bandages and the other sutured to his midriff. When I ask the doctors about this they explain: “To encourage the skin grafts on his hands to take, we connect the hand to the midriff where the blood supply is better.” They say Petrov spends a lot of his time on his phone, mostly video calling Dmytro in the hospital ward downstairs.Valentyn (51)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianIt was a rainy dawn and Valentyn had been sweeping for mines; dawn so as not to be seen, rain because it makes it harder for the drones to fly. He tells me that he never touched the mine – it reacted to the electromagnetic field of his body with a flash that, weeks later, he still can’t get out of his eyes. He holds up the bandaged stumps of his arms. “For this hand there is no hope. But for the other – one finger is still alive.” He displays the prosthetic he’s been given to hold a spoon. “The next device must be to hold a fishing rod.” With his one remaining finger, Valentyn mimes reeling in a fishing line. Valentyn’s grandpa taught him to fish and he still goes to the same spot on the Dnipro River. “It’s very beautiful, very calm. Just trees by the river. I like to go there alone. If I go with my friends they get drunk and scare away the fish.”Natalii (55)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianI meet Natalii at a women’s support group in Vinnytsia for refugees from Kherson. Today, they’re making flowers out of colourful pipe cleaners. The windows of the community room are filled with flowers that Natallii grows in little recycled pots. She talks about her garden back in Kherson, where she lived before the invasion: 200 sq metres filled with apricot trees, grapevines and flowers; her favourites were the pink roses. She shows me photos that a friend who stayed behind took recently. Their house has been utterly destroyed, but the roses in the garden are still blooming. Now Natalii lives with her family in a small apartment in Vinnytsia. “There’s no garden but a good window. For my birthday I was given a huge bouquet, and there were still some roots! Now I have seven big bushes in water on the floor in front of the window.” Natalii says her family think she’s mad, apart from her nine-year-old granddaughter, Anya, who also has green fingers. Anya’s father – Natalii’s son – always buys her flowers from the supermarket when he comes back from the front.For Natalii, “the flowers are like a memory from home … peace is the memory of the life that we were living there. Here, we are just waiting. My soul is in the garden back home in Kherson.”As Natalii talks, the other women twist their pipe cleaners into flower ornaments. Svitlana, 68, also a refugee from Kherson, has hands that tremble so violently Natalii helps her with the fiddly bits. I tell her about this project, and she says: “No picture could capture what we have lived through, what it is to have everything, to be together with all your family in your home, and then be living by the side of the road.” It’s a fair point.This project, facilitated by Médecins Sans Frontières, will be exhibited at The Arcade at Bush House, King’s College London, in SeptemberAbout the authorElla BaronPhotograph: supplied for bylineElla Baronis a political cartoonist at the Guardian"

I say, Are you early or am I late?“I’m always early,” says the actor, deadpan. “Or as my elder daughter refers to me, ‘aggressively early’.”Curtis is in a plain black top, heavy black-framed glasses and – importantly for this conversation – little or no makeup, while behind her in the gloom, a dog sleeps in a basket. She won’t say what part of the US she’s in beyond the fact it’s a “witness protection cabin in the woods” where “I’m trying to have privacy” – an arch way, I assume, of saying she’s not in LA – and immediately starts itemising other situations in which she has been known to be early: Hollywood premieres (“They tell me I can’t go to the red carpet yet because it’s not open and so my driver, Cal, and I drive around and park in the shade”); early-morning text messages (“I wake people up”); even her work schedule: “I show up, do the work, and then I get the fuck out.”This is the short version; in full, the opening minutes of our conversation involve Curtis free-associating through references to the memory of her mother and stepfather missing her performance in a school musical in Connecticut; the negotiating aims of the makeup artists’ union; the nickname by which she would like to be known if she ever becomes a grandmother (“Fifo” – short for “first in first out”); and what, exactly, her earliness is about. Not, as you might imagine, anxiety, but: “You know, honestly, I’ve done enough analysis of all this – it’s control.” Curtis knows her early arrivals strike some people as rude. “My daughter Annie says: ‘People aren’t ready for you.’ And I basically say: ‘Well, that’s their problem. They should be ready.’”“That’s their problem” is, along with, “I don’t give a shit any more” a classic Curtis expression that goes a long way towards explaining why so many people love her – and they really do love her – a woman who on top of charming us for decades in a clutch of iconic roles, has crossed over, lately, into that paradoxical territory in which she is loved precisely because she’s done worrying about what others think of her. Specifically, she doesn’t care about the orthodoxies of an industry in which women are shamed into having cosmetic surgery before they hit 30. Curtis has spoken ofhaving a procedure herselfat 25, following a comment made on the set of a film that her eyes were “baggy”. Regretting it, she has in the years sincemade the genuinely outlandish and inspiring decision to wear her hair grey and eschew surgical tweaks. That Curtis is the child of two Hollywood icons, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, and thus an insider since birth, either makes this more surprising or else explains it entirely, but either way, she has become someone who appears to operate outside the usual Hollywood rules. “I have become quite brusque,” says Curtis, of people making demands on her time when she’s not open for business. “And I have no problem saying: ‘Back the fuck off.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mary Rozzi/The GuardianI have become quite brusque, and I have no problem saying: Back off!I can believe it. During the course of our conversation, Curtis’s attitude – which is broadly charming, occasionally hectoring and appears to be driven by a general and sardonic belligerence – is that of someone pushing back against a lifetime of misconceptions, from which, four months shy of her 67th birthday, she finally feels herself to be free. Curtis is in a glorious phase of her career, one that, despite starring in huge hits – from the Halloween franchise and A Fish Called Wanda (1988) to Trading Places (1983), True Lies (1994) and the superlativeKnives Out(2019) – has always eluded her. The fact is, celebrity aside, Curtis has never been considered a particularly heavyweight actor or been A-list in the conventional way. At its most trivial, this has required her to weather small slights, such as being ignored by the Women In Film community, with its tedious schedule of panels and events. (“I still exist outside of Women In Film,” she snaps. “They’re not asking me to their lunch.”) And, more broadly, has seen Curtis completely overlooked by the Oscars since she shot Halloween, her first movie, at the age of 19.View image in fullscreenWith her Oscar for best supporting actress for 2022’s Everything Everywhere All at Once.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesWell, all that has changed now. In 2023, Curtis won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Deirdre Beaubeirdre in the genre-bending movieEverything Everywhere All at Once. That same year, she appeared in a single episode of the multi-award-winning TV showThe Bearas Donna Berzatto, the alcoholic mother of a large Italian clan – she calls it “the most exhilarating creative experience I will ever have”. Anyone who saw this extraordinary performance is still talking about it, and it led to a larger role on the show. Doors that had always been shut to Curtis flew open. For years, she had tried and failed to get movie and TV projects off the ground. Now, she lists the forthcoming projects she had a hand in bringing to the screen: “Freakier Friday, TV series Scarpetta, survival movie The Lost Bus, four other TV shows and two other movies.” She has become a “prolific producer”, she says, as well as a Hollywood elder and role model. All of which makes Curtis laugh – the fact that, finally, “at 66, I get to be a boss”. You’d better believe she’ll be making the most of it.The movie Curtis and I are ostensibly here to talk about is Freakier Friday, the follow-up to Freaky Friday, the monster Disney hit of 2003 in which Curtis andLindsay Lohanappeared as a mother and daughter who switch bodies with hilarious consequences. I defy anyone who enjoyed the first film not to feel both infinitely aged by revisiting the cast more than 20 years on, and also not to find it a wildly enjoyable return. The teenage Lohan of the first movie is now a 37-year-old mother of 15-year-old Harper, played by Julia Butters, while the introduction of a second teenager – Harper’s mortal enemy Lily, played by Sophia Hammons – allows for a four-way body swap in which Curtis-as-grandma is inhabited by Hammons’ British wannabe influencer. If it lacks the simplicity of the first movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to taking my 10-year-old girls when it opens next month.View image in fullscreenAs a baby with parents Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh and sister Kelly, 1959.Photograph: Donaldson Collection/Getty ImagesI witnessed my parents lose the very thing that gave them their fame and their life and their livelihood, when the industry rejected them at a certain ageIt is also a movie that presented Curtis with an odd set of challenges. She has a problem with “pretty”. When Curtis herself was a teenager, she says, she was “cute but not pretty”. She watched both her parents’ careers atrophy after their youthful good looks started to wane. Part of her shtick around earliness is an almost existential refusal to live on Hollywood’s timeline, because, she says: “I witnessed my parents lose the very thing that gave them their fame and their life and their livelihood, when the industry rejected them at a certain age. I watched them reach incredible success and then have it slowly erode to where it was gone. And that’s very painful.”As a result, says Curtis: “I have been self-retiring for 30 years. I have been prepping to get out, so that I don’t have to suffer the same as my family did.I want to leave the party before I’m no longer invited.” In the movie, Curtis was allowed to keep her grey hair (although it looks shot through with blond) but her trademark pixie cut was replaced with something longer and softer. I take it with a pinch when she says things such as, “I’m an old lady” and, “I’m going to die soon” – even in age-hating Hollywood, this seems overegged – but one takes the point that she found the conventional aesthetic demands of Freakier Friday, in which she “had to look pretty, I had to pay attention to [flattering] lighting, and clothes and hair and makeup and nails”, much harder than playing a dishevelled alcoholic inThe Bear.View image in fullscreenIn Halloween, 1978.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesOn the other hand, Curtis is a pro and, of course, gave Disney the full-throated, zany-but-still-kinda-hot grandma they wanted. (There is a scene in which she tries to explain various board games – Boggle, Parcheesi – to the owl-eyed teens that reminds you just how fine a comic actor she is.) It’s the story of how Freakier Friday came about, however, that really gives insight into who Curtis is: an absolute, indefatigable and inveterate hustler. “I am owning my hustle, now,” she says and is at her most impressive, her most charming and energised when she is talking about the hustle.To wit: Curtis was on a world tour promoting the Halloween franchise that made her name and that enjoyed a hugely successful reboot in 2018, when something about the crowd response struck her. “In every single city I went to, the only movie they asked me about besides Halloween was Freaky Friday – was there going to be a sequel?” When she got back from the tour, she called Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO. “I said: ‘Look, I don’t know if you’re planning on doing [a sequel], but Lindsay is old enough to have a teenager now, and I’m telling you the market for that movie exists.’”As the project came together, Curtis learned that Disney was planning to release Freakier Friday straight to streaming. “And I called Bob Iger” – it’s at this point you start to imagine Iger seeing Curtis’s name flash up on his phone and experiencing a slight drop in spirits – “and I called David Greenbaum [Disney Live Action president], and I called Asad Ayaz, who’s the head of marketing, and I said: ‘Guys, I have one word for you: Barbie. If you don’t think the audience that saw Barbie is going to be the audience that goes and sees Freakier Friday, you’re wrong.’”This is what Curtis means when she refers to herself as “a marketing person”, or “a weapon of mass promotion”, and she has done it for ever. It’s what she did in 2002 when she lobbied More magazine to let her pose in her underwear and no makeup – “They didn’t come to me and say: ‘Hey Jamie, how about you take off your clothes and show America that you’re chubby?’ The More magazine thing happened because I said it should happen, and I even titled the piece: True Thighs.”And it is what she was doing a few weeks before our interview when she turned up to the photoshoot in LA bearing a bunch of props she had ordered from Amazon, including oversized plastic lips and a blond wig. Curtis says: “There are many, many actresses who love the dress up, who love clothes, who love fashion, who love being a model. I. Hate. It. I feel like I am having to wrestle with your idea of me versus my idea of me. Because I’ve worked hard to establish who I am, and I don’t want you to … I have struggled with it my whole life.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPortraits: Mary Rozzi/The GuardianCurtis is emphatic that her ideas be accurately interpreted and, before our meeting, sent an email via her publicist explaining her thinking behind the shoot. “The wax lips is my statement against plastic surgery. I’ve been very vocal about the genocide of a generation of women by the cosmeceutical industrial complex, who’ve disfigured themselves. The wax lips really sends it home.”Obviously, the word “genocide” is very strong and risks causing offence, given its proper meaning. To Curtis, however, it is accurate. “I’ve used that word for a long time and I use it specifically because it’s a strong word. I believe that we have wiped out a generation or two of natural human [appearance]. The concept that you can alter the way you look throughchemicals, surgical procedures, fillers – there’s a disfigurement of generations of predominantly women who are altering their appearances. And it is aided and abetted by AI, because now the filter face is what people want. I’m not filtered right now. The minute I lay a filter on and you see the before and after, it’s hard not to go: ‘Oh, well that looks better.’ But what’s better? Better is fake. And there are too many examples – I will not name them – but very recently we have had a big onslaught through media, many of those people.”Well, at the risk of sounding harsh, one of the people implicated by Curtis’s criticism is Lindsay Lohan, her Freakier Friday co-star and a woman in her late 30s who has seemingly had a lot of cosmetic procedures at a startlingly young age (though Lohan denies having had surgery). In terms of mentoring Lohan, with whom Curtis remained friends after making the first film, she says: “I’m bossy, very bossy, but I try to mind my own business. She doesn’t need my advice. She’s a fully functioning, smart woman, creative person. Privately, she’s asked me questions, but nothing that’s more than an older friend you might ask.”But given the stridency of Curtis’s position on cosmetic surgery, don’t younger women feel judged in her presence? Isn’t it awkward? “No. No. Because I don’t care. It doesn’t matter. I’m not proselytising to them. I would never say a word. I would never say to someone: what have you done? All I know is that it is a never-ending cycle. That, I know. Once you start, you can’t stop. But it’s not my job to give my opinion; it’s none of my business.”As for Lohan, Curtis says: “I felt tremendous maternal care for Lindsay after the first movie, and continued to feel that. When she’d come to LA, I would see her. She and I have remained friends, and now we’re sort of colleagues. I feel less maternal towards her because she’s a mommy now herself and doesn’t need my maternal care, and has, obviously, a mom – Dina’s a terrific grandma.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At the back of my mind, however, I have a small, pinging reservation that I can’t quite put my finger on. I suggest to Curtis that she has natural advantages by virtue of being a movie star, which, on the one hand, of course, makes her more vulnerable around issues of ageing, but on the other hand, she’s naturally beautiful and everyone loves her, and most average women who –“I have short grey hair!” she protests. “Other women can –”They can, of course! But you must have a physical confidence that falls outside the normal –“No! No!” She won’t have it. “I feel like you’re trying to say: ‘You’re in some rarefied air, Jamie.’” I’m not! She responds:“By the way, genetics – you can’t fuck with genetics. You want to know where my genetics lie?” She lifts up an arm and wobbles her bingo wings at me. “Are you kidding me? By the way, you’re not going to see a picture of me in a tank top, ever.” This is Curtis’s red line. “I wear long-sleeve shirts; that’s just common sense.” She gives me a beady look. “I challenge you that I’m in some rarefied air.”I think about this afterwards to try and clarify my objection, which I guess is this: that the main reason women in middle age dye their hair is to stave off invisibility, which, with the greatest respect, is not among the veteran movie star’s problems. But it’s a minor quibble given what I genuinely believe is Curtis’s helpful and iconoclastic gesture.And when she talks about cosmetic surgery as addiction, she should know. Curtis was an alcoholic until she got sober at 40 and is emphatic and impressive on this subject, the current poster woman – literally: she’s on signs across LA for an addiction charity with the tagline: “My bravest thing? Getting sober”. I’m curious about how her intense need for control worked, in those years long ago, alongside her addiction?View image in fullscreenWith her mother Janet Leigh in LA, 1979.Photograph: Ron Galella Collection/Getty Images“I am a controlled addict,” she says. “In recovery we talk about how, in order to start recovering, you have to hit what you call a ‘bottom’. You have to crash and burn, lose yourself and your family and your job and your resources in order to know that the way you were living didn’t work. I refer to myself as an Everest bottom; I am the highest bottom I know. When I acknowledged my lack of control, I was in a very controlled state. I lost none of the external aspects of my life. The only thing I had lost was my own sense of myself and self-esteem.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mary Rozzi/The GuardianExternally, during those years of addiction, she seemed to be doing very well. Her career boomed. She married Christopher Guest, the actor, screenwriter and director, and they have two children and have stayed married for more than 40 years. (There’s no miracle to this. As Curtis puts it, wryly: “It’s just that we have chosen to stay married.And be married people. And we love each other. And I believe we respect each other. And I’m sure there’s a little bit of hatred in there, too.”) I wonder, then, whether Curtis’s success during those years disguised how serious a situation she was in with her addiction?“There’s no one way to be an addict or an alcoholic. People hide things – I was lucky, and I am ambitious, and so I never let that self-medication get in the way of my ambition or work or creativity. It never bled through. No one would ever have said that had been an issue for me.”Where was the cost?“The external costs are awful for people; but the internal costs are more sinister and deadly, because to understand that you are powerless over something other than your own mind and creativity is something. But that was a long time ago. I’m an old lady now.”She is doing better than ever. With the Oscar under her belt, Curtis has just returned in the new season of The Bear and has a slew of projects – many developed with Jason Blum, the veteran horror producer with whom she has a development deal – coming down the line. Watching her bravura performance as Donna Berzatto, I did wonder if playing an alcoholic had been in any way traumatic. She flashes me a look of pure vehemence. “Here’s what’s traumatic: not being able to express your range as an artist. That’s traumatic. To spend your entire public life holding back range. And depth. And complexity. And contradiction. And rage. And pain. And sorrow.” She builds momentum: “And to have been limited to a much smaller palette of creative, emotional work.View image in fullscreenAs Donna Berzatto, the alcoholic mother of a large Italian clan, in The Bear.Photograph: FX“For me, it was an unleashing of 50 years of being a performer who was never considered to have any range. And so the freedom, and the confidence, that I was given by Chris [Storer, the show’s creator], and the writing, which leads you … everywhere you need to go – it was exhilarating.”She continues: “It took no toll. The toll has been 40 years of holding back something I know is here.”Well, there she is, the Curtis who thrills and inspires. Among the many new projects is The Lost Bus, a survival disaster movie for AppleTV+ about a bus full of children trying to escape wildfires. The idea came to Curtis while she was driving on the freeway, listening to an NPR report on the deadly wildfires of 2018 in the small town of Paradise, California. She pulled over and called Blum; the movie, directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matthew McConaughey and America Ferrera, drops later this year. For another project, she managed to persuade Patricia Cornwell, the superstar thriller writer, to release the rights for her Scarpetta series, which, as well as producing, Curtis will star in alongside Nicole Kidman.This burst of activity is something Curtis ascribes to the “freedom” she derived from losing “all vanity”, and over the course of our conversation “freedom” is the word she most frequently uses to describe what she values in life. Freedom is a particularly loaded and precious concept for those on the other side of addiction and, says Curtis, “I have dead relatives; I have parents who both had issues with drinking and drugs. I have a dead sibling. I have numerous friends who never found the freedom, which is really the goal – right? Freedom.”View image in fullscreenWith husband Christopher Guest and daughters Ruby and Annie.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPA-EFE/ ShutterstockIt’s a principle that also extends to her family. Curtis’s daughter Ruby, 29, is trans, and I ask how insulated they are from Donald Trump’s aggressively anti-trans policies. “I want to be careful because I protect my family,” says Curtis. “I’m an outspoken advocate for the right of human beings to be who they are. And if a governmental organisation tries to claim they’re not allowed to be who they are, I will fight against that. I’m a John Steinbeck student – he’s my favourite writer – and there’s a beautiful piece of writing from East of Eden about the freedom of people to be who they are. Any government, religion, institution trying to limit that freedom is what I need to fight against.”There are many, many other subjects to cycle through, including Curtis’s friendship with Mariska Hargitay,whose new documentaryabout her mother, Jayne Mansfield, hit Curtis particularly hard, not least because “Jayne’s house was next to Tony Curtis’s house – that big pink house on Carolwood Drive that Tony Curtis lived in and Sonny and Cher owned prior to him.” (I don’t know if referring to her dad as “Tony Curtis,” is intended to charm, but it does.) There’s also a school reunion she went to over a decade ago; the feeling she has of being “a 14-year-old energy bunny”; the fact we’ve been pronouncing “Everest” wrong all this time; the role played by lyrics from Justin Timberlake’s Like I Love You in her friendship with Lindsay Lohan; and the “Gordian knot” of what happens when not being a brand becomes your brand.Curtis could, one suspects, summon an infinite stream of enthusiasms and – perhaps no better advertisement for ageing, this – share urgent thoughts about every last one of them. In an industry in which people weigh their words, veil their opinions and pander to every passing ideal, she has gone in a different direction, one unrestrained by the usual timidities. Or as she puts it with her typical take-it-or-leave-it flatness, “the freedom to have my own mind, wherever it’s going to take me. I’m comfortable with that journey and reject the rest.”Freakier Friday is in Australian cinemas from 7 August and from 8 August in the UK and USJamie Lee Curtis wears: (leopard look) jacket and skirt, byRixo; T-shirt and belt, both byAllSaints; boots, byDr Martens; tights, byWolford; (tartan look) suit, by Vivienne Westwood, frommytheresa.com; tights, byWolford; shoes, byBy Far.

(Said approval was announced on Thursday, with the extra caveat that Paramount would refrain from producing programs based on supposed diversity, equity and inclusion standards.)On Wednesday, the season premiere of South Park’s 27th season debuted, and lest you think that Parker and Stone’s billion-dollar deal would keep them from biting the hand that feeds,they came out chomping, delivering sharp digs at Paramount and CBS for their kowtowing to the president’s demands.‘South Park’s most furious episode ever’: the jaw-dropping Satanic takedown of Donald TrumpRead moreBut their most brutal stuff was reserved for Trump himself, depicting him as a petty, predatory tyrant (à la their past caricature of Saddam Hussein) overcompensating for a tiny penis – which, in the episode’s jaw-dropping closing moments, they show in graphic detail via a fake ad using the most realistic AI animation seen to-date.The episode has, in the short time since it aired, proven to be the most show’s most controversial in years. But of course, it’s nothing new forSouth Park, which is certainly the most controversial American sitcom – animated or otherwise – of all time.South Park proved controversial even before it went into production. Fox was originally meant to pick up the series – an expansion of Parker and Stone’s 1992 short student film The Spirit of Christmas (Jesus vs Frosty) and its viral follow-up The Spirit of Christmas (Jesus vs Santa). But when members of the network objected to the character of Mr Hanky – a talking piece of poop – Parker and Stone nixed the deal, eventually landing at the Paramount unit Cartoon Network.While other adult-oriented cartoons had paved the way in terms of both popularity and controversy (The Simpsons debuted in 1989 and Beavis and Butt-Head in 1993), it was clear from the start that South Park meant to push the envelope further than anything that came before it, so much so that a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer was inserted at the start of each episode:“All characters and events in this show – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated … poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.”This did little to curb its popularity with young audiences. Within a few episodes of the first season, South Park was a cultural force to be reckoned with. And reckoned with it was, particularly by educational and parental groups who, outraged at its unrelenting dedication to toilet humor, violence and especially profanity, tried their best to get it taken off the air (and, failing that, to ban its merch from schools).The series embraced this outrage, using it as fodder for meta-commentary by way of a fictional show-within-a-show, Terrance and Phillip, a constant source of outrage for the idiotic and easily led parents of the show’s main foursome. This would culminate in the 1999 feature film, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, which would – to the surprise of any number of cultural commentators – go on to earn as many accolades (including an Oscar nomination for best original song) as it did objections.As the series continued, its focus started to shift. It dropped popular but stale gags (such as the recurring “You killed Kenny!” bit), while evolving its characters in fascinating ways. Nowhere is this more evident than Eric Cartman, the spoiled, obese, bigoted breakout character. While always something of an antagonist, by the fifth season he was murdering the parents of a school rival and feeding them to him à la Titus Andronicus. Things only got darker from there, with Cartman coming to embody seemingly every hateful and degenerate vice humans are capable of. The fact that he would simultaneously remain the show’s most popular and beloved character brooked no shortage of handwringing from the show’s detractors (and often even their fans), who worried that viewers, particularly impressionable youngsters, were taking all the wrong messages from it.At the same time, messaging became a central part of South Park. While it always contained some level of social commentary and political satire, that aspect moved to the forefront. The singular schedule that Parker and Stone kept – episodes are developed and produced within a week of airing – allowed for them to take on hot button news items while they were still in the headlines. This was, and for the most part remains, unheard of when it comes to sitcoms (especially animated ones, which usually require a longer production schedule). Viewers were shocked when South Park ended up airing episodes about the Elián González custody and Terry Schiavo medical battles in real time (the latter airing mere hours before Schiavo died).Parker and Stone have described themselves as libertarians (although they’re Gen X libertarians and thus less simpatico with today’s breed) which meant that they were often pissing off both liberals and conservatives. For the most part, they were less interested in preaching their personal ideology than they were calling out others’ hypocrisy. As a result, no sacred cows were left untipped.Given the show’s sacrilegious origins, it’s no surprise that it’s biggest controversies came from their skewering of religion. Perhaps their most infamous episode to date is season nine’s Trapped in the Closet, which used the ridiculous R Kelly song to poke fun at famous Scientologists Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Even though the crux of the episodes revolves around those stars’ rumored sexuality, the real target was the Church of Scientology itself, which Stone and Parker depicted as a cult and scam, going so far as to animate, in detail, the bonkers mythology at the heart of the religion, which the church had strived to keep secret from the larger public.(Knowing how litigious the Church of Scientology is, everyone who worked on Trapped in the Closet was credited as John/Jayne Smith.)Comedy Central moved the episode from its original air date, purportedly at the demand of Cruise, who was starring in Paramount’s upcoming blockbuster Mission: Impossible 3, although all parties have denied this. What’s not disputed is that Parker and Stone threatened to quit the show if the episode wasn’t released. It eventually did air (after the action sequel came out), and although the cultural impact is impossible to quantify, it’s not coincidental that it marked the start of a hard public scrutiny of the Church of Scientology.One proven result of the episode was the high-profile departure of one of the show’s original voice actors, Isaac Hayes, who was a Scientologist. This, in turn, would lead to the show killing off his character, Chef, just a couple of years before Hayes himself passed away.Similar episodes targeting Mormonism and Catholicism followed, and while they brooked their share of objections from the Church of Latter-day Saints and various Catholic leagues, they were teacup tempests compared with what came in season 10.Amid an increasingly violent reaction from Islamic extremists over European cartoonists’ satirical depictions of the prophet Muhammad (something forbidden by certain sects within the broader religion), Parker and Stone inserted themselves into the issue by attempting to do just that (albeit by using rival animated show Family Guy as their in-universe proxy). Despite the unassailable moral point they were attempting to make – if they were allowed to make fun of every other religion’s sacred figures, they should be able to do so with Islam without fear of violent reprisal – the network once again balked, airing the episode but placing a black “censored box over the character of Muhammad.Thankfully, this did not lead to any violence, although when Stone and Parker touched on the issue again during the 14th season (in episodes 200 and 201, where the mere name Muhammad was censored by Comedy Central) it did lead to public death threats against them, as well as a demanded apology from Malaysia’s main conservative party.What’s most ironic about all of this is that South Park had already shown Muhammad in an early season, and even included the character in its original title sequence. No one objected to this at time, although this was before 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the global sea change those atrocities ushered in. Today, all these episodes have been scrubbed from streaming, although some are available on their respective seasons’ original DVD releases.Attempts to get South Park banned in various parts of the globe have been hit and miss, but China eventually succeeded. Already angry with the show for dealing with banned subject matter (including the Dalai Lama) and its intentionally over-the-top ethnic humor, the final straw came via the season 23 episode Band in China, which directly targeted American corporations’ expansion into the Chinese market in spite of the Chinese Communist party’s broad censorship and brutal repression of political dissidents.As much as they have managed to piss off social/religious conservatives and authoritarian regimes, Parker and Stone have also proven a constant thorn in the side of outraged liberals and leftists, less so because of any single issue they have dealt with – although their mocking of Al Gore’s warnings over climate change (represented in the show as a made up cryptid called ManBearPig) certainly earned them lots of criticism, which they eventually acknowledged, going so far as to issue a begrudging on-air mea culpa – than a larger feeling of irony-poisoned political nihilism.Certainly, much of modern conservative ideology is indistinguishable from the intentionally offensive antics of Cartman. One need only look at the volume of social media accounts belonging to rightwing shitposters that use South Park-style illustrations for their avatars and profile pics (although this trend isn’t nearly as prevalent as it was between 2010 and 2020).Over the past several seasons, as well as the handful of direct-to-streaming “movies”, South Park has taken on the right’s favorite issue, wokeness (in 2015, they introduced a new character, PC Principal, who embodies all of the worst qualities of overly sensitive millennials).At the same time, they were lampooning Trump, although in a less direct way than past public figures, choosing to use the character of Mr Garrison – the show’s resident hedonist reactionary – as an analog. But in 2017, Parker publicly announced that they would stop making Trump jokes, as he’d grown bored of them and didn’t want South Park to resemble supposedly liberal institutions like CNN. This response earned praise from the conservative figures, includingDonald Trump Jr(who would also go on to praise a recent South Park special for its woke pop culture reboots).Which brings us to the surprise of this most recent season premiere. While it’s hardly surprising that Parker and Stone would reverse course, given the extremity of Trump’s corruption and attacks on the first amendment, the directness of their attack still came as a surprise to both fans and detractors alike. Hours after episode aired, the White Housereleased an enraged response, in which they accused South Park and its creators of being hypocritical and inauthentic, while also claiming it hadn’t been relevant in 20 years.Obviously, any show that just inked a $1.5bn deal can’t be realistically called irrelevant, but it has been a minute since South Park has made headlines. While this isn’t new territory for the series, something feels different this time. There is a real sense of shock and betrayal coming from the right. Undoubtedly, this is because they recognize that much of the show’s fanbase is composed of their supporters. Unlike the weak tea being slung by Colbert and his ilk, this isn’t a case of preaching to the choir. While it’s ridiculous to think that South Park will be the catalyst for any real political change, it’s telling how hysterical the right’s ferocity against it has been over the course of just a few hours. That this is coming on the heels of broader backlash against the president from supposedly sympathetic sources over his refusal to release the Epstein files shows that, for the first time since the election, their back is truly against the wall.Trump is the most easily offended man alive, while Parker and Stone have never backed down from a fight. If the history of South Park is any indication, this latest controversy is just the tip of the iceberg (or, rather, the tip of a minuscule talking phallus).Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTV comedyAnimation on TVComedyTelevisionUS televisionDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were responding to a work that engages with the current levels of literary excitement around sex and marries this with sweeping historical vistas and a distinctive sensibility. It was joined on the shortlist by Miranda July’s exuberant odyssey of midlife desire,All Fours,andFundamentallyby Nussaibah Younis, a smart, quickfire account of a young academic’s work for a UN deradicalisation programme, which juxtaposes the world of Middle Eastern religious politics with a closeup relish for female sexuality.While younger generations, at least, have said in recent years that they want tosee more platonic friendship and less sex on screen, reading appetites appear to be going in the other direction, with a huge boom inromance and “romantasy”– the romance-fantasy hybrid driven by TikTok and the success of authors such as Rebecca Yarros and Sarah J Maas. We all have strong, mixed feelings about sex, and the cultural landscape reflects the whole spectrum of kinks and hangups. But that means that we have all the more need for writers like Van der Wouden, July and Sally Rooney, who push the boundaries of how explicit the literary novel can be while also giving us new ways of imagining how desire works within lives today.Ours is a dual age of identity politics and porn. We get our identities from sex – queer or straight, pansexual or “incel” – but it’s also the white-hot arena in which identity melts down. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, when pornography is everywhere andGillian Andersonis collecting thousands of sexual fantasies with anthropological zeal, it seems we still need literature to tell us new things about sex. What I found, reading recent work by authors including Rooney, Van der Wouden, Jen Beagin, K Patrick and Eimear McBride, were unpredictable fusions of the two impulses. Lovers, dutifully preoccupied with questions of identity by day, find that in bed they can transcend selfhood, outstripping their identities.Women’s prize winner Yael van der Wouden: ‘It’s heartbreaking to see so much hatred towards queer people’Read moreTo surrender individuality and accept the dissolution of the self, to lose sight of who is in control – these possibilities have preoccupied erotic writers since the early 20th century, when sex first became representable in literary fiction. Back then there was DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, staking the redemption of humanity on sexual transformation. In Lawrence’s wake came Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin and Georges Bataille – all about abjection and breaking taboos. Then the outrageously argumentative Norman Mailer and John Updike, whose frank delight in the female form called out for a feminist backlash. It came in the shape of Kate Millett’s wittily polemical 1970 Sexual Politics and a new wave of sexually explicit novels by women concerned less with celebrating than with demythologising sex. Erica Jong’s epochal 1973 Fear of Flying ushered in the “zipless fuck” – sex without strings – and allowed a generation of feminists to experiment with promiscuity, but for all its brilliance on psychoanalysis and marriage, the book is pretty terrible on sex.It took another backlash – within feminism itself – to make sex great again. In 1967 Susan Sontag had written The Pornographic Imagination, an essay defending writers such as Bataille from prudery and fighting to classify pornographic writing as literature, even or especially when it exceeded realism. “Tamed as it may be, sexuality remains one of the demonic forces in human consciousness,” she wrote – so why not make it a resource for “breaking through the limits of consciousness”? Angela Carter took on Sontag’s ideas in her 1978 study, The Sadeian Woman, arguing against feminists concerned to outlaw porn, and making the case for the “moral pornographer” – an artist who “uses pornographic material as part of the acceptance of the logic of a world of absolute sexual licence for all the genders”.Sontag and Carter saw that the power of sex lay in opening selfhood to otherness with extravagant force. Otherness and innovation go together, so great writing about great sex always has radical potential. The parameters they set out still define the best possibilities of what sex writing can be, though plenty of men – from Philip Roth to Michel Houellebecq – came along in the meantime to try to prove that male desire was still fascinating.Reading in our contemporary era, I find myself most riveted by writers who continue Carter’s tradition. Published earlier this year, Sophie Kemp’sParadise Logictells the satirical story of a young woman’s attempt to make herself into the ideal girlfriend and, in doing so, exposes the patriarchal nature of porn culture. But precisely because it’s so clever and sassy it reveals the limits of satire, whereas other contemporary novelists are bringing together the pornographic and the transcendent in a more transporting way.It’s telling that these writers are more often writing gay than heterosexual sex. Garth Greenwell, who has described himself as wanting to write scenes that are “100% pornographic and 100% high art”, is more trammelled by questions of identity than Alan Hollinghurst was when he wrote The Swimming-Pool Library – a book Greenwell credits as an inspiration. Greenwell is writing sex in the age of consent and dutiful identity politics, but arguably it’s these constraints that power his existential quest.There’s a scene in Greenwell’s 2020Cleannesswhere the pornographic and the transcendent explicitly entwine. The narrator has a BDSM encounter with a Bulgarian man he calls Svetcheto, “the little saint”. The usually submissive narrator has agreed to dominate. It’s a brutal scene, all the more frightening because it mirrors an earlier encounter when the narrator was dangerously violated. We’re worried both that he’ll reenact that violence and that he won’t carry off this new role. But then it becomes clear he’s enjoying himself. Suffused by mutual, unexpected transcendence, the couple’s porn-inspired identities simultaneously break down and burst into flower. Laughing, Svetcheto licks away the narrator’s tears. “Do you see? You don’t have to be like that,” he says. “You can be like this.”Sally Rooney writes sex scenes that are at once radiant and minutely observed by her overthinking charactersJen Beagin, K Patrick and Yael van der Wouden write moving, powerful portraits of lesbian desire, full of anatomical detail. Beagin’sBig Swissis a large-hearted tale of a love affair between Flavia, an absurdly beautiful gynaecologist, and Greta, the more klutzy, down-at-heel writer who’s paid by Flavia’s sex therapist to transcribe her sessions. “Her pussy looked like advanced origami. A crisp pink lotus flower folded by a master. Greta briefly rearranged it with her mouth.” The sex scenes in Patrick’sMrs Sare less metaphorical and more breathlessly desiring, though the prose is taut in its lyricism. It can feel like the plot – a love affair between the 22-year-old new teaching recruit and the headmaster’s wife in a girls’ boarding school – is an excuse for the sex scenes, but in a way that’s the point.In both books, it is striking how quickly sex reveals the existential need for transformation. Even in that first sex scene, Greta feels as if she’s reached a place “she’s been visiting in her dreams for years and forgetting”. Mrs S is casually historical – set in the 1980s or 90s – which means its identity politics can be implicit: the narrator wears a chest binder but the book doesn’t raise questions of trans identity. Instead it is preoccupied with the loss of identity, as the narrator feels herself remade as the “You” she becomes in her lover’s mouth. “It is as if she has always been waiting for this arrival, of me into my body. You. I don’t have a name. Isn’t it so much better, to not have a name, to be dropped straight from the clouds?”The sex scenes are more shocking in Van der Wouden’s The Safekeep because the subject matter is so serious. This is the story of a violently sudden passion that becomes a love affair between Eva, a displaced Jew, and Isabel, a gentile woman who has unwitting power over her. The book is set in the aftermath of the second world war and, given the gravity of the material, some reviewers have wondered if the sex scenes are necessary. But this is to miss the point, which is that the book only works if the relationship throws both women entirely off-kilter – using the edges of porn to show sex derailing not only their lives but their selves, and indeed the conventional novel form itself. Isabel finds herself vulnerably, joyously powerless in an unfamiliar body: “At Eva’s mercy, trapped between the cage of her teeth, she had grown a new shape.” Van der Wouden insists that her complex sense of character development justifies sexual explicitness. But she has also been clear in interviews that no justification is needed: “The girls deserve to have some fun. This was my mantra while writing: Let them have some fun!”So what about those writers daring to write explicit, ecstatic heterosexual sex? The most compelling are Eimear McBride, whose The Lesser Bohemians makes the reader feel as though they are almost inside the bodies of the protagonists, andSally Rooney, who is casually magisterial at writing sex scenes that are at once radiant and minutely observed by her overthinking characters. Like Greenwell, Rooney balances a commitment to a contemporary vision of identity and consent with a willingness to explore the pull of dissolution and abjection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But beneath these exterior sexual identities are their private bodily lives, and sex is the best means of growth they have. Rooney follows McBride in dizzyingly contorting her sentences: “Deep pressing almost hurting and she felt him throbbing, wanting to, and she wanted that also, wet inside, image of silver behind her closed eyelids, jetting, emptying into her …” Rooney is surprised that people don’t ask her more often about the place of sex in her novels; “the erotic is a huge engine in the stories of all my books,” she has said.But it is in All Fours that the full possibilities of Carter’s “moral pornography” are realised. July’s novel manages to be at once an ethnographic account of women’s perimenopausal sexuality and a more darkly anti-realist tale of a woman living out her sexual fantasies. The narrator spends vast sums transforming a small-town hotel room into a sumptuous dreamscape, where she tests her capacities for love and lust with Davey, a beautiful, potent but determinedly chaste young dancer she meets at the gas station. The encounters with Davey are brilliantly, exuberantly realised – all the more so because July never loses sight of their comedy. In the absence of sex, they seek consummation elsewhere, and at one point Davey changes her tampon. The scene is both bathetically comic, intensely erotic, and unexpectedly moving.‘This book is my bible!’ The women who read Miranda July’s All Fours, then blew up their livesRead moreBut it is once she and Davey part and the narrator has sex with sexagenarian Audra that the novel becomes incandescent. The narrator is home now, adjusting to her former life, but has negotiated a weekly night in the hotel. She seeks out Audra, who had a relationship with Davey years earlier, desperate to compare notes. “Fantasies are all good and well up to a certain age,” Audra says, “Then you have to have lived experiences or you’ll go batty.” And so Audra describes her sexual past with Davey, while both women masturbate, an experience that, for the narrator, “lit up new neural pathways, as if sex, the whole concept of it, was being freshly mapped”.As a sexual encounter, this is moving and original. As a vision of womanhood undergoing feats of change and confronting mortality, it’s extraordinary. This scene takes us beyond realism. In her life at home, July’s narrator is casually, matter-of-factly bound up in the sexual questions of her contemporary world: she has a nonbinary child and is anxiously aware how limited her sex life is by motherhood. But July uses the narrator’s experiences in the hotel room to bend and test our sense of novelistic, psychological plausibility. It is a place where identity can be discarded and remade.Sex remains at the centre of much of the best fiction, and we need powerful fictions to show us what sex is or can become. This is where realism comes up against something stranger, and body and consciousness undo and affirm each other, because it can be at once so ordinary, and so transcendent.Lara Feigel is the author of Look!

Some may know them from their comedicTikTokvideos, which regularly amass hundreds of thousands of views. Others may recognize them as host of Gaydar, a viral entertainment-education show about queer culture, history and current events; an interview Williams did with the New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani did go viral, after all. There’s also Williams’s drag performances, including those where they opened for icons such as Chappell Roan and Bob the Drag Queen. Or their bevy of musical theater roles – Lola in Kinky Boots, Dominique in Lucky Stiffs, to name a few.For years, Williams has been launching their own creative universe. As a 25-year-old genderqueer, Black artist, Williams, who uses they/she pronouns, has used their ever-growing social media presence (more than 2.8 million followers across their social media platforms) to fashion the career of their dreams outside anyone’s binaries. For their next project, Williams is set to perform in Saturday Church, a new musical at New York Theatre Workshop which opens 27 August. The play dives into the world of a sanctuary for LGBTQ+ youth. “It’s a feelgood musical,” said Williams of the production. “It’s just queer, Black joy, and there’s a beautiful message about it.”Williams will play a trans woman, another bonus in their ever-growing theatrical career. “The further I get in my transition, it’s been nice to feel affirmed,” they said. “It’s just been awesome to be in those spaces and to make a way for myself.” With talent and charisma, Williams’s rise is practically ordained; as they look forward to balancing their various projects, now comes the task of navigating their expansive future and chronic frustrations of being online.Growing upFor Williams, growing up in Davenport, Iowa – an industrial, midwestern town of about 100,000 people, was an exercise in strength. At school, Williams was bullied for “having a girl name”, they said. Their home life was equally tumultuous, Williams recalled, rife with abuse and neglect. But life in the midwest sowed the seeds for their future artistic passions. As a child, they sang in the church choir, later joining show choir, following in the footsteps of an older sister.For college, Williams attended Emerson College’s in the musical theatre program in Boston. University was one of the first times that Williams got to reflect on who they were, what they wanted. But musical theater came with its own binaries and limitations, especially as Williams is both genderqueer, meaning outside the typical binaries of gender, and Black. “It felt like: ‘Lord forbid you be somewhere else on the gender binary,’ and then, ‘Lord forbid you’re also Black at the same time’,” Williams said.Breaking the Binary: meet the founder behind a US theater company for trans and non-binary artistsRead moreEven when Williams attempted to create their own lane, they said they faced resistance from their professors. “There was a teacher that was like: ‘You keep bringing in girl songs. Why is that?’ And I tried to explain it to them, and it didn’t go well,” Williams said.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Williams returned to their home town to wait out the return to normalcy like most people. The isolation allowed for reflection and served as a moment that allowed them to fully realize their gender identity. “I had to admit a couple things to myself, like, ‘Yeah, I’m queer. Yeah, I’m probably genderqueer.’ And from there, it kind of spiraled,” they said of that time period, jokingly adding: “I call it the pronoun pipeline.”Around the same time, Williams started to create content on TikTok, quickly becoming known for short, comedic rants captured during their late-night walks. Most of their content was spur-of-the-moment musings on anything from Christianity and relationships toa new iPhone. In 2022, they started to speak more openly about being genderqueer, posting videos of their drag and makeup routine.Reflecting back on that time period brings a mix of feelings, Williams said. On one hand, it has been extremely gratifying to grow alongside longtime viewers. “The audience that’s been with me the longest has signed on to watch me evolve,” they said. “[They] watched me do makeup for the first time or try to glue down a wig. Those people are why I feel like I can keep going.” On the other hand, Williams sometimes wishes “the first version people knew me of was who I am today”.The rise of GaydarThe nature of their content has continued to grow. In 2024, Williams became the host of Gaydar, created by Amelia Montooth at the company Mutuals Media. The show quizzes an array of guests on queer culture in an attempt to find out if they are “straight, gay or homophobic”. Questions include anything from what a “lipstick lesbian” is to assessing a guest’s knowledge of a gay icon. Willliams herself is also learning alongside contestants, often in real time. “I didn’t know who Sue Bird was and the lesbians whacked me up and down the streets, oh my God,” they quipped.The show’s a comedic premise with the goal of inviting viewers to become educated, said Williams. “We are inundating queer history and queer culture into digestible questions and clips that lets people relax into the learning,” said Williams of the show. “They can take something in a funny way that’s more engaging than saying: “Here are the facts. Here’s a screenshot of this article I read, and you should care about it.”Early versions of the show featured mostly strangers Williams found on the street. The segment has since hosted a number of celebrities and public figures: singers Lucy Dacus, Reneé Rapp and Vivian Jenna Wilson, the daughter of billionaire Elon Musk. The New York City mayoral candidate Mamdani, an avid progressive, attracted social media buzz as one of the first politicians to grace the show. Mamdani shocked Williams when he was successfully able to name a lesbian bar in the city: the Manhattan-staple Cubbyhole.“He was just such a team player about it,” said Williams of the interview experience. “We let our audience, which is younger, know who he is and he got to speak for himself.” Williams added: “It’s cool to be a professional zeitgeist in that way, to know that throughout it all, we’re making a difference.”Williams’s ascent hasn’t come without difficulties. They have faced cruel harassment as they have been more public about their transition. “What they really like to do, especially with dolls, is pick apart fashion and makeup and hair,” said Williams, referring to online trolls. Williams added: “I want to believe that people are becoming more comfortable with transness, but I think they’re coming around to a very specific, stereotypical, western, white, skinny type of trans person. When someone doesn’t fit that standard, they get berated.”But Williams has found ways to consistently ground in the real world, alongside the growing pains. There’s their found family, a best friend from sixth grade. High school friends and their boyfriend as well as online friends they met through TikTok. And, of course, baking and video games are hobbies, living outside the pressure to monetize or make content of their life. A cake for a friend’s birthday was already in the works for later that evening. “It’s either red velvet or strawberry,” Williams said, with a large laugh. “I remember the color, not the flavor.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderBlack US cultureLGBTQ+ rightsTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was 15, and a weird mixture of studious and smart but also disruptive in class. I was also extremely virginal – both fascinated and terrified by the idea of having sex and in no danger of doing so for another half a decade. I was basically Rick.My parents were strict – my dad was the school headteacher – so I can’t think why they let me stay up late to watch it. Maybe they just wanted me out of the way so they could get on with other things.What drew me in right away washow silly it was. A lot of the comedy I’d liked had been clever stuff that was almost snooty, like Monty Python or Derek and Clive. The Young Ones was rude. It was the first time I’d seen slapstick and fart jokes that were actually funny.My cultural awakening: I joined Danny Wallace’s accidental positivity cult – and found the love of my lifeRead moreMy generation missed punk, but The Young Ones had a similarsense of anarchy – a “do it yourself” spirit, with a cavalcade of ideas being thrown at the screen. The alternative comedy scene – as well as the Comic Strip and French and Saunders – felt new and very galvanising. In the same way the Sex Pistols made anyone feel as if they could pick up a guitar, The Young Ones made me feel like I could make a living out of making people laugh: it didn’t matter if I was a regular kid at a comprehensive school in Somerset. This was a particularly important revelation, as my careers adviser had told me that I should give up on being a writer and work in a bank.Watching The Young Ones episodes on repeat to learn the lines by heart, I learned about the rhythm and language of comedy. Plus, I discovered that if you could do a good impression of one of the characters, you’d get a laugh at school the next day.I loved Rik Mayall. He was a handsome and sexy figure, but not afraid to make himself look ridiculous. He continued to inspire me throughout my life. Years later, as a comedy writer, I wrote some scenes for him in the sitcom Man Down, but he died before they were filmed. I was on the toilet when I heard the news. I cried, both upset that someone I loved had gone, and sad that I’d no longer be able to work with one of my heroes.The Young Ones was a show that parodied idiotic students, a bunch of men who didn’t want to grow up. Neither did I – and, thanks to The Young Ones, I didn’t have to.As told to Harriet GibsoneRichard Herring’s RHLSTPisatThe StandComedy Club,30 July to 10 August.Desiree Burch: Davina McCall’s MenopausingView image in fullscreenIllustration: Martin O’Neill/The GuardianA year ago, I was in the pit of a perimenopause crisis but I didn’t fully know it. I didn’t know there was an explanation for feeling depressed, suicidal, confused, exhausted and generally ill. Then I read Davina McCall’s bookMenopausing.The idea behind the book is simple: Davina went on to social media and got people to send their menopause stories. I listened tothe audiobookwhile I was travelling around gigging, and heard lots of different readers voicing their stories, interspersed with Davina’s chats with a doctor, who gave useful information about what was going on in these women’s bodies and minds.There are people in the book who left their careers because they couldn’t cope intellectually or emotionally. It just seemed crazy to me. A woman who has spent 25 years of her life building up her career shouldn’t just have to walk away because she’s too scared to say: “I don’t know what is going on. I’m losing words. I’m losing the ability to be in the present moment because of brain fog.”My cultural awakening: a Marina Abramović show helped me to stop hating my abusive fatherRead moreDavina’s book helped me to understand that I had reached a stage that was actually quite serious. So I went ahead and pushed my case with my doctor. After reading the book, I was able to say: actually I’m not depressed – I’m losing parts of my cognition due to fluctuating hormone levels.Most of the time, the doctor just asks: how’s your sex drive? But most of us experiencing perimenopause don’t care about sex at that point. I was more worried about staying alive, how I’d perform in my job and how words weren’t coming out of my mouth correctly. Being able to tell my doctor what was wrong was really important. I was given testosterone as well as oestrogen, and that was extraordinarily helpful.All of it has made me committed to trying to show up in my performances a bit more. I need to keep practising, keep exercising my brain. There has always been something so special in the art of live performance and being able to stay present – even if it means saying I forgot what I was about to say.Having Davina say that she’d gone through this was a big thing for me. So I’m always pushing her book to friends, to spread more awareness and bring the issue to the light.As told to Miriam GillinsonDesiree Burch: The Golden Wrathis at Monkey Barrel Comedy, 28 July to 10 August.Kiell Smith-Bynoe: Pantomime damesView image in fullscreenIllustration: Martin O’Neill/The GuardianGrowing up as an only child and a drama kid, I was probably quite annoying. I was always coming up with ideas and characters, but I wasn’t the type of kid to say: “Come and look at what I’ve done!” Instead I would do parodies of teachers or characters from the television in the privacy of my bedroom. One Christmas, at primary school, I finally got the chance to stand on a stage and show everyone what I could do. It was the nativity play, and I was playing the part of the innkeeper. I only had one line, which I’ve since forgotten, but I remember that when I said it, people laughed. I liked that feeling so much that I said it 10 more times. It flicked a trigger in my brain: I wanted to do this all the time. I just didn’tquitehave the skills to do it yet …I remember watching Dick Whittington and thinking, ‘I am so incredibly jealous of everyone who is doing this for a job’Then when my mum took me to see panto at Theatre Royal Stratford East, I was amazed and began to understand, at six years old, what it meant to properly put on a show. Not only was I impressed that there were children on stage – that this was something a young person might be able to do – but there was so much more to it than funny lines. There were theatrics, lighting and comedy characters, such as the famous pantomime dames.Michael Bertenshaw,one of our most famous dames, was very inspiring. I loved his massive hair, the bloomers and the songs – but mostly that he knew exactly how to get an audience on board.My cultural awakening: Buffy gave me the courage to escape my conservative Pakistani upbringingRead moreAfter that, I’d go to the panto every single year. Even though I knew what was coming next, the predictability made the chase scenes, the misunderstandings, the “He’s behind you!” jokes even funnier. I loved there was a baddie, and that you could boo and hiss at them. I remember going to see Dick Whittington and thinking: “I am so incredibly jealous of everyone who is doing this for a job.” Now I do get to do it as a character and sketch comic.To go to panto aged six, and see a show on such a big scale, with props and costumes, I realised thatthisis what you need to do to be properly engaging. Instead of, say, repeating the same line 10 times at the school nativity play.As told to Harriet GibsoneKiell Smith-Bynoe and Friends: Kool Story Brois atPleasance Courtyard,15 to 22 August;String v Spitta, with Ed MacArthur, is atAssembly George Square Studios,15 to 17 August.Explore more on these topicsCultureMy cultural awakeningComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After having no reception all day, her mobile started pinging with message after message containing verifications for her LinkedIn, Vinted andFacebookaccounts. Someone was trying to get in and change the contact details.At home she realised the hackers were also trying to take over herInstagramaccount. She tried to sort it out but it was late, she had work the next day and, she says: “I thought: ‘What damage could they do?’”What to do if you can’t get into your Facebook or Instagram accountRead moreWithin 24 hours she knew the answer: using her account, the hackers advertised tickets to Oasis’s Wembley Stadium gig on Saturday 26 July and stole £1,400 from her unsuspecting friends. They then sent a text demanding $100 (£75) to return the Instagram account. All day she was fielding messages from contacts. “I had about 20 different people text, saying they were about to send over the money and can I hold the tickets for them,” she says. “The hackers had impersonated me so well that my friends and family genuinely thought they were speaking to me.”Three weeks later, she is still locked out of her account, and Instagram has refused to recognise it as being fraudulent. It has ignored her requests for help. It did not respond to Guardian Money’s requests for comment.View image in fullscreenThe scammers’ post offered four tickets for the Oasis show at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 26 July.Photograph: SuppliedJones is a music fan and so the Instagram story offering four tickets to a concert did not seem out of place to her 600 followers – even her sister believed she had tickets to sell. “I’ve just returned from Glastonbury and I was away for Bruce Springsteen,” she says. “It’s not as if they’d taken it over and started advertising bitcoin.”The people who responded via Instagram were taken in by the scammers’ replies – one friend told her he thought they had been having a good catchup. It was only those who moved the conversation to WhatsApp or texts who found out pretty swiftly that the tickets did not exist. “They’re really impersonating me and it’s so invasive,” she says. “It’s distressing not knowing what is being said in my name.”View image in fullscreenA former colleague shared the post after a request from the scammers.Photograph: SuppliedThe fraudsters did not just leave the post for Jones’s followers to see – they messaged one of her former colleagues and asked them if they would share the posts. They agreed and inadvertently spread the scam more widely.The tickets were realistically priced and the post had good spelling and grammar. Victims were asked to pay into an account held with the online bank Revolut, with the fraudsters explaining that it was in the name of the friend who had originally bought the tickets.Official data shows £1.6m was lost tofraud involving gig ticketslast year – more than double the previous year’s figure – and Oasis’s high-profile reunion tour has been widely used to lure victims. Earlier this year, Lloyds Banking Group (which includes Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland) said more than 1,000 customers had fallen for scams linked to the Manchester band’s eagerly anticipated UK concerts.Lloyds said its data suggested that UK Oasis fans had lost more than £2m to fraudsters by March this year – the total is likely to have risen since. It found that fans lost an average of £436 each – about £200 more than the average amount stolen in a concert ticket scam – and said some had handed over more than £1,700.Chris Ainsley, the head of fraud risk management at the bank Santander, recently saw a Facebook account used for the scam – the post advertised four tickets, again for the 26 July concert, and included details of seat numbers and a WhatsApp number to contact. The scammers used the highlight tool to put it in front of the real account holder’s followers – this, Ainsley says, is a way to make a fraud “grow very quickly”.His team searched Facebook and found multiple other accounts had posted the same message, suggesting the same people had hacked them all.View image in fullscreenMessages from the scammers.Photograph: SuppliedJake Moore, a cybersecurity expert at ESET, says that by using Instagram and Facebook accounts linked to individuals, scammers give victims a false sense of security. “It’s not an Oasis Facebook group which is completely random – buying tickets there would be a complete gamble. Instead, they’re buying from people they know, or friends of friends – they’re verified. It’s doing exactly what we tell people to do,” he says.“The scammers can check the messages before and see how you sign off – if it’s a kiss or emoji maybe – and replicate that.” Moore says criminals who may be worried about their spelling or grammar giving them away can use AI to craft their messages. “Even if you take an extra minute to reply, the other person is not going to notice – you can even tell it to sign off each one with a smiley face, for instance.”You might think the criminals would carefully select accounts that give them the best chance of finding victims – Jones’s would have appealed because she loves live music – but the experts say that the fraud is not that sophisticated.Ainsley says the account he originally saw compromised had not been used since 2011, so anyone doing some due diligence might have taken that as a red flag. Moore says it is simply a numbers game, with criminals breaking into as many accounts as they can.Jones is not sure how the hackers got into her account but suspects she may have fallen victim to a phishing attack or used an insecure public wifi network.Moore says that often accounts are compromised because people use the same password in more than one place. Criminals will try the details across a range of sites – a practice known as “credentials stuffing”.In-app attacks are another way for fraudsters to get the details they need, Ainsley says. “Sometimes you will get a message that makes it look like you have been kicked off Facebook – it will ask for your details to log you back in,” he says.The best way to protect your account is to use the social media website’s two-factor authentication or two-step verification settings. “That extra layer will push the criminals to the next account – you are not the lowest hanging fruit,” Moore says.* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsScamsConsumer affairsOasisTicket pricesMusic industryFacebookInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can we put pressure on these Dr. Evil tech bros to do better?”Pointedly, the band put a musical backing behind their announcement: Bob Dylan’s Masters of War, an anti-war protest song that declares “you that build the death planes … I just want you to know I can see through your masks”.Californian rock band Xiu Xiu posted on Instagram on Friday that it was working on taking all of its music off “garbage hole violent armageddon portal Spotify”.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

It’s hugely revealingRhik SamadderSat 26 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTSharePolice work rarely resembles The Shield or Line of Duty. It’s mostly paperwork, online training and referring people to driver offender courses. But sometimes life imitates art. In 2020, international police hacked the encrypted phone network EncroChat, used by organised crime gangs across the globe. For 74 days, they had access to every message and picture used to coordinate drug trafficking, money laundering, kidnap and murder. “It was the LinkedIn of organised crime,” explains Matt Horne, a former gold commander at the UK’s National Crime Agency (not the actor from Gavin & Stacey).Operation Dark Phone: Murder By Text (Sunday, 9pm, Channel 4) is a documentary-drama cleverly built around these messages, which appear like screenplay dialogue across scenes. It’s an arresting insight into how criminal gangs work – and just as revealing, how they talk. “Sweets” are bullets, while a “pineapple” is a grenade. A violent British criminal known as Live-long, lying low in Spain, organises an acid attack on a rival, in between sending pictures of his breakfast. Cucumber slices on labneh with paprika – nice. The trick, he instructs, is to stop the victim getting to a sink. Hold them down a few minutes, so the acid can do its job. Less nice.Incredibly, there is dark humour amid the grim. Mostly courtesy of the crims, who go by ridiculous two-word usernames on the anonymous network. There’s a Chris Morris absurdity to Mystical-steak, Valued-bridge, Top-shag. At one point, an agent explains how Live-long interacted with Ball-sniffer (who one assumes is lower down). For their part, the agents and white hats are living out the most exciting series of The Wire. In a year, they would usually encounter fewer than a hundred explicit threats to life. Once the curtain was lifted, they intercepted more than 150 in six weeks. Logistically, that’s a problem.View image in fullscreenDetectives had access to the criminals’ messages for 74 days.Photograph: Channel 4The show knows how to grab a viewer. Storylines develop, introduce formidable characters, and bring the action to a climax. Ace-prospect imports AKs and Glocks to the UK, one of which is bought by Live-long, who is looking to take on Ace-prospect in a personal revenge attack. Organised through go-betweens, neither side knows who they are dealing with. The NCA has a 24-hour delay when receiving message data, and must work round the clock to close the gap. When Ace-prospect’s hitman throws a pineapple into the garden of a rival, which fails to explode, the feds are faced with a dilemma: how to protect the lives of children nearby while keeping their intelligence and mission a secret?This is all far sexier than Crimewatch. Instead of losers sticking up BP garages, here are wealthy playas orchestrating crimes from overseas. Is it ethical? Is there a risk of making the criminals look cooler than their cucumbers? The glossy recreations showcase swimming pools, gym-fit bodies, weapons familiar from movies. The actor playing Live-long looks like Claes Bang, and spends the episode with his top off. Yet this is a morality tale. “I’m gonna take his eyes out and chase him around every jail,” writes Live-long from a darkened room, his teeth-whitening gumshield glowing ultra-violet like a nightmare acid trip.View image in fullscreenGang members contributed to their downfall with their constant oversharing, boasting and vanity.Photograph: Channel 4The empty glamour is not just the medium, it’s the message. These criminals’ downfall is their superficiality, their constant messaging and oversharing, their boasting and social media-amplified physical vanity. Live-long’s true identity is eventually uncovered because he sends a triumphant selfie. Can you imagine an old-school career criminal hearing that? I picture them slapping their forehead; except they’ve forgotten to unclench their fist and knock themselves out.The show’s charge comes from knowing this is real, not merely dramatic writing. Part of that charge is fear – a reminder that there are sociopaths among us who hold life cheap and take joy in violence. Operation Dark Phone is a four-part series, from the makers of 24 Hours in Police Custody, and promises far more jaw-dropping revelations as well as some overdue justice. Don’t watch it if your faith in humanity is wavering. I’ll probably be giving pineapples in the supermarket a wide berth too, just in case.Explore more on these topicsOrganised crimeThe watcherTelevisionNCA (National Crime Agency)EncryptionPoliceGun crimeCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

More’s the pity.”Lucy ManganRead the full reviewFurther reading‘I danced my little bottom off!’ Anna Friel on a rejuvenating Oasis gig – and her new Jimmy McGovern dramaThe Narrow Road to the Deep NorthBBC iPlayerSummed up in a sentenceA visceral, passionate adaptation of a Booker prize-winning novel that’s set in three separate timelines.What our reviewer said“The Narrow Road to the Deep North is not an easy prospect, but it is an immensely powerful one, driven by strong performances and a bracing confidence in its ability to tell this story, at its own pace, in its own way.”Rebecca NicholsonRead the full reviewYou may have missed …Amol Rajan Goes to the GangesBBC One/iPlayerView image in fullscreenAmol Rajan Goes to the Ganges.Photograph: BBC/Wildstar FilmsSummed up in a sentenceAs he grieves his beloved father, the atheist broadcaster sets off on a pilgrimage that takes him on a surprisingly glorious spiritual adventure.What our reviewer said“What Amol Rajan Goes to the Ganges expresses most powerfully of all, certainly to this fellow bereaved Hindu, are the irresolvable particularities, and commonalities, of second-generation grief.”Chitra RamaswamyRead the full reviewFilmIf you only watch one, make it …GazerIn cinemas nowView image in fullscreenGazer.Photograph: Bulldog Film ReleasingSummed up in a sentenceCreepy and tense noir chiller with hints of Lynch and Cronenberg and star and co-writer Ariella Mastroianni radiating suppressed anguish and rage.What our reviewer said“A genuine skin-crawling unease seeps out of the screen for every second of its running time, helped by a brooding, moaning electronic score by Steve Matthew Carter.”Peter BradshawRead the full reviewPick of the restDyingIn cinemas nowView image in fullscreenDying.Photograph: Jakub Bejnarowicz/Port au Prince, Schwarzweiss, SenatorSummed up in a sentenceLars Eidinger plays a man embarking on a major orchestral project, but whose professional status is threatened by family turmoil behind the scenes.What our reviewer said“This is a bleak, bold, extravagantly crazy story which is emotionally incorrect at all times. Perhaps it could have been produced as a streaming-TV production but that would have deprived audiences of the pleasures of swallowing it whole.”Peter BradshawRead the full reviewFantastic Four: First StepsIn cinemas nowSummed up in a sentenceMarvel offers a superhero family sitcom with Mr Fantastic and Sue Storm living together as a dysfunctional family in a retro-futurist version of early 1960s New York.What our reviewer said“The result hangs together as an entertaining spectacle in its own innocent self-enclosed universe of fantasy wackiness, where real people actually read the comic books that have made mythic legends of the real Four.”Peter BradshawRead the full reviewFurther readingWhiteboard warrior: Marvel is priming Mister Fantastic to be the new leader of the AvengersAmadeusIn cinemas nowSummed up in a sentenceF Murray Abraham mesmerises as bland court composer Salieri who is eclipsed by Tom Hulce’s nitrogen-voiced genius Mozart in Miloš Forman’s masterpiece.What our reviewer said“The pure gorgeous villainy of F Murray Abraham once again floods the screen, as saturnine and sulphurous as ever, in this new rerelease of Amadeus in its original 1984 theatrical cut.”Peter BradshawRead the full reviewNow streaming …ToxicMubi; available nowView image in fullscreenToxic.Photograph: Akis BadoSummed up in a sentenceSaule Bliuvaite’s debut feature follows two Lithuanian teens seduced by a “modelling school” promising to take them away from their tough home town.What our reviewer said“Bliuvaite and her cinematographer Vytautas Katkus contrive striking tableaux and ambient setpieces, creating an emotional context for this drama: a world of alienation and desperate need, but also resilient humour.”Peter BradshawRead the full reviewBooksThe Empire of Forgetting by John Burnside.If you only read one, make it …The Empire of Forgetting by John BurnsideOut nowSummed up in a sentenceThe posthumously published final collection from a leading poet of our age.What our reviewer said“It’s our great good fortune that Burnside’s closing work is also one of his finest. He is attentive to the degradation of nature; staring it in the face and obliging us to stare at it, too. But more often than not, it’s the beauty that possesses him.”Sarah CrownRead the full reviewFurther readingJohn Burnside: ‘My stoner friends were into The Hobbit, but Gormenghast was darker’Pick of the restView image in fullscreenThe Parallel Path by Jenn Ashworth.The Parallel Path by Jenn AshworthReviewed by Blake MorrisonSummed up in a sentenceA writer’s reflections as she walks the coast to coast path.What our reviewer said“What’s captivating about her book is all the thinking she does mid- or post-trek: on writing, friendship, welfare, illness, climate change, protest marches, knitting, and why it is that in popular mythology ‘walking women’ are either models on a catwalk or sex workers.”Read the full reviewDrayton and Mackenzie by Alexander StarrittReviewed by Anthony CumminsSummed up in a sentenceA warmly comic saga about two tech entrepreneurs.What our reviewer said“A critique of disruptor-era genius is less important here than feeling and friendship; the winningly Edwardian, even Victorian, approach to storytelling extends right to the heart-swelling deathbed climax.”Read the full reviewFather Figure by Emma ForrestReviewed by Ella RisbridgerSummed up in a sentenceA slippery coming-of-age story about infatuation and ambiguity.What our reviewer said“The teenage girl, in Forrest’s capable and unusual fifth novel, is a kind of bottomless pit of need – for desire, attention and the world to come.”Read the full reviewFurther reading‘It was my gateway drug to self-harm’: a writer’s journey to finding the joy in makeupFair by Jen CallejaReviewed by Alex ClarkSummed up in a sentenceA surprising and playful study of the art of translation.What our reviewer said“Shepherding a piece of writing from one language into another requires so many minute responses, thought processes and decisions that the translator would find it impossible to suppress their own voice.”Read the full reviewYou may have missed …Beastly Britain by Karen R JonesView image in fullscreenReviewed by Kathryn HughesSummed up in a sentenceHow animals have shaped British identity.What our reviewer said“Hedgehogs were reputed to sneak into human settlements at night and steal eggs (true) and suck the udders of sleeping cows (almost certainly false).”Read the full reviewAlbumsIf you only listen to one, make it …Tyler, the Creator: Don’t Tap the GlassOut nowView image in fullscreenTyler, the Creator: Don’t Tap the Glass.Summed up in a sentenceThe soul-searching of last year’s Chromakopia is expelled – for the most part – by half an hour of early 80s rhythms and slick one-liners with the IDGAF attitude of his early years.What our reviewer said“Almost all of its 10 tracks seem fixated on the dancefloor. There are 808 beats, Kraftwerk-y electronics, a noticeable smattering of Zapp-like vocoder and electro, among other early 80s genres. The musical reference points are deployed with an evident love and understanding of the source material, never feeling like box-ticking or pastiche; the hooks work with enviable efficiency.”Alexis PetridisRead the full reviewPick of the restMadonna: Veronica ElectronicaOut nowView image in fullscreenMadonna: Veronica Electronica.Photograph: APSummed up in a sentenceAlmost three decades on, Madonna finally releases the long-promised Ray of Light remix collection.What our reviewer said“For diehards, the promised record is something of a holy grail. The old demo Gone Gone Gone is brilliantly weird, a wistful breakup ballad set to a squelchy electro beat that gives a surprising amount of insight into Madonna’s creative state at the time: here is one of the biggest stars in the world, in her creative prime, throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks.”Shaad D’SouzaRead the full reviewAnthony Braxton: Quartet (England) 1985Out nowSummed up in a sentenceThe free-collective energy of one of Braxton’s most intuitive groups jostles and enchants on this live recording – salvaged from cassettes – from a 1985 UK tour.What our reviewer said“Salvaged by state-of-the-art tech methods from former Wire magazine writer and Braxton chronicler Graham Lock’s original lo-fi cassette recordings, the set celebrates Braxton’s conviction that triggering loose improv through tightly challenging compositions can mirror the everyday flux of living.”John FordhamRead the full reviewEditrix: The Big EOut nowSummed up in a sentenceLed by Wendy Eisenberg, the Massachusetts band’s third album explores communication challenges in an articulate and exhilarating rock fusion.What our reviewer said“Editrix make complex music feel organic, like the natural thing to do, and imply that sound succeeds where words often fail us.”Katie HawthorneRead the full reviewYou may have missed …John Also Bennett: Στον Ελαιώνα / Ston ElaiónaOut nowSummed up in a sentenceOnce part of the Ohio noise scene, the US producer has moved to Athens, Greece, and makes oscillating bass flute music inspired by the view of the Parthenon from his window.What our reviewer said“This is blissful ambient music that resonates with a similar depth – though more warmth – to Kali Malone’s The Sacrificial Code, and stands to have just as much staying power.”Laura SnapesRead the full reviewExplore more on these topicsThe week in reviewsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not quite time for a Jet2 holiday yet, though – there’s still one more week of contractually obligated fun in the sun, starting with this compilation.Hannah J DaviesSuspicionMidnight, ITV1The cat-and-mouse thriller about a random group of strangers being framed for a violent kidnapping continues. There are potential answers in New York but can the amateur fugitives keep it together long enough to escape the UK? The fact that their plan requires reliable train wifi does not bode well.Graeme VirtueFilm choiceRumours, 1.15pm, 10.15pm, Sky Cinema PremiereA few weeks ago, Prime Video gave us Heads of State. A rollicking, deliberately dumb action movie about the US president and the British prime minister, Heads of State looked as if it was going to be the weirdest political film of the year. Turns out it wasn’t even the weirdest of the summer, because here is Rumours. With three writer-directors, including Guy Maddin, it’s a film about a G7 summit that finds itself being terrorised by marauding bog-zombies and, odder still, a giant brain. The fact that Cate Blanchett plays the German chancellor and Charles Dance the US president makes it stranger still. Highly silly and very funny, it’s not something you are likely to forget in a hurry.Stuart HeritageLyle, Lyle, Crocodile, 2pm, BBC OneView image in fullscreenThe performance of his life? … Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile on BBC One.Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/REX/ShutterstockLast year’s vaguely nightmarish Harold and the Purple Crayon is an example of the pitfalls of attempting to stretch a children’s picture book to feature length. With that in mind, 2022’s Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is a miracle. Based on a slight 1965 kids’ book, Will Speck and Josh Gordon’s film is an unexpected delight. There is a crocodile, he can sing, and all hell breaks loose. Not only are the songs (by The Greatest Showman’s Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) genuinely good, but Javier Bardem gives one of the performances of his life as Lyle’s unreliable owner.SHFallen Leaves, 9.45pm, BBC FourAs is to be expected – nay required – from the master of dour, deadpan humour, in Aki Kaurismäki’s latest romantic comedy his two lonely, Helsinki-based central characters struggle to express their feelings. The potential match of Ansa (Alma Pöysti) and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen) is further stymied by him losing her number, his struggles with alcoholism and their shared inability to hold on to a job. Not a laugh-a-minute plot description, admittedly, but being immersed in the director’s peculiarly Finnish world makes you wish the pair the best of an imperfect life.Simon WardellLive sportInternational Rugby Union: Australia v British & Irish Lions, 9.30am, Sky Sports Main EventThe second Test at the MCG.Test Cricket: England v India, 10.15am, Sky Sports CricketDay four of the fourth Test at Old Trafford in Manchester.Cycling: Tour de France, 10.45am, TNT Sports 1/1pm, ITV4The penultimate stage of the men’s race, a 184.2km route from Nantua to Pontarlier.Cycling: Tour de France Femmes, 4pm, TNT Sports 1Stage one, 78.8km from Vannes to Plumelec, with Giro winner Elisa Longo Borghini among the favourites.World Matchplay Darts, 7.30pm, Sky Sports Main EventThe semi-finals at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The motor is silent, the playlist is birdsong and occasional bleating sheep; all is serene. “This is easier,” I say to myself with a smile, recalling my previous attempt to visit theAldeias Históricas– a dozen historic hamlets bound by a 1995 conservation project – using woeful public transport. Revisiting this unspoilt pocket of Portugal, 155 miles (250km) north-east of Lisbon, near the border with Spain, is going to be effortless in an EV. And, best of all, the transport doesn’t cost me a penny.An hour before, I arrived in Castelo Novo, a four-hour train ride from the capital, and currently the sole hub of the Aldeias Históricas’sSustainable Urban Mobility Scheme. It was launched in 2022 to address local transport issues by providing five free-to-hire electric vehicles, alongside other community-supporting projects. It sounded too good to be true, but I booked the maximum three-day rental – enough time to see at least nine of the villages. I was informed that if I arrived by train, someone would meet me at the station.View image in fullscreenSure enough, Duarte Rodrigues welcomes me like an old friend. “The project’s main focus is tourism to the historic villages, but some of the cars are used for the community, to take elderly people to the market or distribute meals,” he says on the gorgeous drive to the medieval hamlet of Castelo Novo, 650 metres up the slopes of the Serra da Gardunha. Take-up was nearly equal between tourists and residents, he adds.A few minutes later, outside the romanesque town hall, Duarte hands me the keys to my Megane E-Tech with a wave. It’s worth staying for a night atPedra Nova, a gorgeously renovated boutique B&B, but it needs to be booked well in advance and I am keen to make the most of my time in the EV. Having decided to skip popular Piódão and Monsanto – now a House of the Dragon jet-setting destination – my first stop is Belmonte. Like all 12aldeias, this hazy hilltop town played a pivotal role in Portugal’s identity. A Brazilian flag flutters behind a statue of local legend Pedro Álvares Cabral, the first European to “discover” Brazil. I stroll through the old Jewish Quarter’s single-storey granite houses to Bet Eliahu synagogue, built 500 years after King Manuel I’s 1496 decree expelling Jews from the kingdom.View image in fullscreenCentum Cellas, a Roman villa near Belmonte.Photograph: Luis Fonseca/Getty Images/iStockphotoContinuing to 12th-century Linhares da Beira, I wander the leafy slopes of the Serra da Estrela – mainland Portugal’s highest range. Similar to much-loved Monsanto, the hamlet lies between and atop giant granite boulders. From the largest rocky outcrop, where the castle’s crenellated walls rise, the Mondego valley’s panorama is endless. Other than an airborne paraglider and a man hawking hand-carved magnets in the car park, there’s not a soul in sight.I walk a stretch of slabbed Roman road that once linked Mérida in Spain to Braga, north of Porto, and remember why I adore these villages. History is bite-size, hushed and unhurried, the antithesis of my home in the Algarve. After a brief drive, I park up and plug in outside the medieval defences of the most populatedaldeia.These small villages benefit a lot from tourism because there aren’t many people living here or many opportunities, so people are moving to the big citiesFounded in the ninth century, handsome Trancoso hides behind hefty, turret-topped walls that have witnessed royal nuptials and numerous skirmishes. Today, walking beneath weathered porticos and streets lined with hydrangeas, it feels like the calmest place in the world. As doesSolar Sampaio e Melo, a palatial 17th-century guesthouse – repurchased by a descendant of the original owners in 2011 – with an honesty bar and a pool shaded by turrets.Following a late breakfast ofsardinhasdoces, Troncoso’s sardine-shaped, almond-stuffed sweets, I make for Marialva. The satnav states 30 minutes, but with back-road detours to gawp at giant granite mounds around Moreira de Rei, I reach the massif-mounted castle well after lunch. Occupied by the Aravos, a Lusitanian tribe, then the Romans and Moors, this was a crucial site for the advance of the Christian Reconquista.An old chap in a checkered shirt sits hammering almonds from their shells outside his home. I buy a bulging bag for €7 and gobble a handful inside the semi-ruined citadel, where Bonelli’s eagles soar and cacti reclaim the stone. The flavour transports me to my Algarvian childhood holidays, when I’d hide from the sun (and my parents) under almond trees. For a second, it feels like Portugal hasn’t changed in 30 years. Perhaps here, far from the coast, little has.View image in fullscreenThe castle at Marialva.Photograph: Vitor Ribeiro/AlamyThe journey to Castelo Rodrigo is filled with awe, particularly around the craggy valley sliced by the Côa river. Just upstream is a unique collection ofrock art etchingsfrom three eras – prehistory, protohistory and history – andFaia Brava, Portugal’s first private nature reserve, co-founded by biologist Ana Berliner, her husband and others. In 2004, the couple renovatedCasa da Cisternainto a boutique guesthouse, and on its wisteria-draped terrace, Ana welcomes me with sugared almonds and fresh juice. I enquire about Faia Brava (Ana guides guests on excursions to the reserve and the prehistoric rock art) and whether they’re concerned about tourism growing.“These small villages benefit a lot [from tourism] because there aren’t many people living here or many opportunities, so people are moving to the big cities,” she tells me. “If you retain your people, and your young people spend those days living here, it’s very good.”As I poke around the castle ruins, I mull over how the Portuguese writerJosé Saramagodescribed Castelo Rodrigo in Journey to Portugal (1981): “desolation, infinite sadness” and “abandoned by those who once lived here”. I’m reassured that Ana is right. Lisbon’s tourism boom has createdEurope’s least affordable cityfor locals. Yet, in these hinterlands, the right tourism approach could help preserve local customs.I tiptoe across the ruined castle keep, transfixed by the endless panorama of olive groves, cherry trees and shepherd hutsUnlike most of thealdeias, Castelo Rodrigo was founded by the Kingdom of León. It became Portuguese when the 1297 treaty of Alcanizes defined one of Europe’s oldest frontiers. Reminders of Spain linger, such as the Ávila-style semicircular turrets and ruined Cristóvão de Moura palace, constructed under the Habsburg Spanish kings. Portuguese locals later torched it.With no charging station in Castelo Rodrigo (work is under way to expand the project to other villages, including the installation of chargers and the opening of new bases with additional cars in 2026), I drive to Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, the modern town below. AtTaverna da Matildeflamingchouriçoscents the dining room, and the pork loin –bisaro, an indigenous part-pig, part‑boar – is perfect. I sleep like a prince at Casa da Cisterna.Breakfast is a casual, communal affair of buttery Seia mountain cheese andpão com chouriço, followed by a quick stop atCastelo Rodrigo’s wine cooperativeto collect a case of robust Touriga Nacional (tours and tastings €18pp). In Almeida, a star-shaped military town, I roam the grassy ramparts before continuing south. Swallows soon replace eagles, and granite fades into gentle farmland.View image in fullscreenApproaching Castelo Mendo.Photograph: Daniel James ClarkeI breathe in the silence, standing by Castelo Mendo’s twin-turreted gate. It feels like the world has stopped. I tiptoe across the ruined castle keep and am transfixed by the endless panorama of olive groves, cherry trees and occasional shepherd’s huts.In search of coffee, I step into a dimly lit stone room below a sign that reads D Sancho. Inside is an old-world retail marvel. Photos of popes, boxes of wine, retired horseshoes, mounds of old coins and “mystery boxes” that I’m tempted to spend a tenner on. A hunched woman with a smile gifts me a shot ofginjinha, the local cherry liquor, and signals me to sit with her on the bench outside. We don’t speak, yet I somehow feel a connection to her land. I buy a bottle in the hope of taking that feeling home.Discovering Spain’s Sierra de la Demanda: the land that social media forgotRead moreMy final stop, Sortelha, comes with high expectations – Saramago promised a perfectly preserved medieval town. Hulking walls cradle a 16th-century cluster of stone houses dominated by a castle that crowns an outcrop. Almost on cue, fog and showers shroud it all in mystery. I retreat toO Foral, where plates ofbacalhau(salted cod) are bathed in pistachio-hued local olive oil.Parking back in Castelo Novo with a panic-inducing 7% charge showing on the dash, I am grateful to return the keys, and use the time before my lift to the station to survey the Knights Templar’s former domain from the 12th-century castle.Stopping outside the red door where Saramago reportedly once stayed, I ponder how he would describe these villages 44 years later. Hopefully, he’d recount that, for the traveller,timeless magic remains, but those returning and reviving have vanquished any melancholy.Complimentary EVrentals of one to three days can be booked online atplataformaaldeiashistoricas.com; reservations open about 75 days in advance.For details of the 12 Aldeias Históricas, visitaldeiashistoricasdeportugal.comExplore more on these topicsPortugal holidaysEurope holidaysCultural tripsFood and drinkRoad tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My knee-jerk reaction is anomelette, egg fried rice, the occasionalokonomiyakibut not usually fried eggs, which are still working on their acceptance into my dinner canon. Recently, they made a bid for my affection via these Malaysian eggs, ortelur masak kicap, in which they are doused in an onion, sweet soy, garlic and chilli sauce that works splendidly over rice. Welcome to the party, fried eggs.Malaysian eggsKecap manis is a dark and rich, thick and sweet Indonesian soy sauce that can easily be found online and in most south-east Asian supermarkets.Prep10 minCook20 minServes24 tbsp neutral oil, such as rapeseed4 large eggs1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced3 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1-2 bird’s eye chillies, stalks discarded, flesh finely sliced2 tbsp kecap manis¼ tsp ground white pepper1 tbsp light soy sauceCooked short-grain or jasmine rice, to serveMeasure 120ml water into a jug and put to one side. Put two tablespoons of the oil in a nonstick pan on a medium-high heat – test it’s hot enough by putting a wooden spoon in the pan: if bubbles form around it, the oil is ready. Crack in the eggs one at a time and fry for four or five minutes, until the whites are set and the edges are golden and crisp. Transfer the eggs to a plate.Pour the remaining two tablespoons of oil into the same pan and turn down the heat to medium. Add the onion, fry, stirring, for seven minutes, then add the garlic and chilli, and fry for another three minutes.Stir in the kecap manis, white pepper, soy sauce and the measured-out water, then leave to cook for a minute, just until the sauce bubbles. Slide the eggs back into the pan, cook for another minute or two, then turn off the heat.Serve the eggs hot over steamed rice with plenty of the sauce spooned over the top.Explore more on these topicsMalaysian food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodEggsRiceVegetarian food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Like all deceptively simple products, such as wine, coffee and chocolate, tofu’s character is rooted in its terroir: the soil, biodiversity, climate, plant species and production process. Most tofu is made by curdling soy milk with nigari, a coagulant made from magnesium chloride, which is naturally derived from seawater. It’s an ancient method still used across Japan and south-east Asia.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Boiling showed that all the tofus held their shape, while frying brought out major differences in colouring, crust and bite: some crisped up beautifully, others stayed soft and chewy, so if you mainly fry your tofu, that’s worth bearing in mind. It’s also worth noting that organic tofus are GMO-free by definition.The best supermarket tofuBest overall:Plant Menu organic super-firm tofuView image in fullscreen89p for 180g at Aldi (49p/100g)★★★★★A small, beige block with rounded edges and a sweet, familiar soya aroma. It’s a super-firm tofu with a dense, satisfying bite that holds up brilliantly to cooking, especially frying. Made with 57% EU-grown organic soya, it’s very high in protein (14g a serving) and astonishingly good value. A real standout.And the rest …Sainsbury’s So Organic super-firm tofuView image in fullscreen£1.34 for 300g at Sainsbury’s (45p/100g)★★★★☆A great blank canvas with a subtle aroma and gentle, sweet taste. Firm but moist, and transformed by frying to a golden-crusted, deep flavour. Made from organic, non-EU soya (34%), it’s high in protein and excellent value. Though a little lower in soya content, it delivers fantastic performance in the pan and at an incredible price.Cauldron organic authentic tofuView image in fullscreen£2.90 for 396g at Ocado (73p/100g)£3 for 396g at Waitrose (76p/100g)★★★★★Distinctively marbled and off-white/grey, this has a subtle aroma and a clean, complex flavour. Very firm and reacts well to frying, forming a satisfyingly thick crust. Made with 35.8% organic soya, using a mix of EU and non-EU beans, it’s high in protein and has strongsustainability credentials. A well-rounded option that’s a very close runner-up to the best overall.The secret to crisp tofu | Kitchen aideRead moreThe Tofoo Co Naked organic tofuView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 280g at Sainsbury’s (82p/100g)£2.30 for 280g at Tesco (82p/100g)★★★★☆An irregularly marbled block with a deep umami, almost smoky aroma and a lovely firm bounce. One of the densest, less traditional tofus tested, with a chewy bite. When fried, it forms a good golden crust with loads of flavour. Made in Yorkshire using organic soya from EU and non-EU farms. Great Taste Award-winning, very high in protein (16.5g per 100g) and a bold, characterful choice.M&S Plant Kitchen organic super-firm tofuView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 300g at Ocado (83p/100g)★★★★☆A uniform block with a sweet, subtle aroma, a soft bite and a gentle soya flavour. Holding its shape and forming a delicate, uniform golden crust when fried, this has one of the best textures in the whole test group. Made from organic, non-EU soya, it has 34% soya content and a respectable protein level.

Flavourful and pleasantly sweet, it’s perfectly crunchy and delicious when fried, with a consistent golden crust – perhaps the best overall for frying. Certified organic with non-EU soya, it’s been handmade in Devon since 1984 and holds a Taste of the West Gold award.Tesco Plant Chef organic firm tofuView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 399g at Tesco (49p/100g)★★★☆☆A uniform, cream block with a sweet, clean smell and a gentle flavour. Its soft texture makes it satisfying to eat raw, though it doesn’t crisp up easily when fried, hence the lower score (instead, it develops a chewy, caramelised edge with a spongy interior). Made from organic, non-EU soya (34%), it’s a good source of protein and exceptional value for organic tofu.Waitrose PlantLiving organic firm tofuView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 300g at Waitrose (65p/100g)★★★☆☆A gentle, savoury aroma and a soft bite with a slight sweetness. The texture is on the delicate side, especially when boiled, and it doesn’t fry especially well (pressing first will help). Made with 34% organic, non-EU-grown soya, it’s certified organic, but lacks firmness. Decent value, but there are more versatile options at a lower price point.House Foods premium firm tofuView image in fullscreen£3 for 400g at Ocado (75p/100g)★★★☆☆A white block with a soft bite, this has a sweet, subtle aroma and a clean soya taste. Despite being one of the softest in the test, it crisps up surprisingly well when fried, forming a light but satisfying crust. However, it’s the only non-organic product tested, and made with just 16% soya – far lower than the others. Limited provenance or sustainability information, so with such strong competition, it offers less value for money.Biona organic plain tofuView image in fullscreen£5 for 500g at Ocado (£1/100g)£29.94 for 6 x 500g at Amazon (£1/100g)★★★☆☆An irregular, mottled, off-white block that looks hand-shaped, and that’s full of bubbles. One of the firmest to bite with a complex, soya-forward flavour. Fries very well, forming a great crust. Certified organic with non-EU soya, it’s the only product tested with a fully reusable and recyclable container. Owned byWindmill Organics, a great company committed to organic farming, which earns it a bonus point.Explore more on these topicsTofuThe FilterFoodVegan food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
