There was something delightfully primordial about it – such a dominant sight of modern street life, just out there on the mud, vulnerable and surrounded by nothingness. Banter followed, images of an Amazon package floating in sea water: Amazon has made your delivery.Yet you couldn’t help but feel for the driver, who seemed to have descended on to theEssexmudflats in the darkness of Valentine’s Day in some kind of panic. They were attempting to access the Ministry of Defence-owned Foulness Island, and the usual entrance via a road bridge was closed for the evening.Their valiant mission to ensure the delivery was still made was thwarted after the concrete access road on to an ancient tidal byway known as the Broomway – claimed as the country’s most dangerous path, no less – broke up until it was nothing but gloop.To make matters more complicated, the six-mile route of the Broomway juts out into a military firing range. The driver had tried to turn around and head back to dry land, but it was too late.“They go so far down that muddy track until it gets impassable,” says Roger Burroughs, a farmer from Foulness. “And then they try to turn around. That’s where they get stuck.”The vehicle was at the mercy of the Broomway, and the tide was coming in. The driver had no choice but to leave the van and walk back to shore. Abandon shipment.View image in fullscreenThe concrete access road gives way to the muddy Broomway where vehicles can get stuck.Photograph: @yoursouthend/Twitter/XIt fell to Roger’s son, Jason, to save the delivery van from being washed out to sea. He was called on Saturday evening by the private security firm that guards the MoD testing range of Maplin Sands, as well as Foulness Island, but he was out at a friend’s birthday party. So the van stayed there. Another local farmer took a picture and posted it online and it spiralled into a news story.“In some ways, I feel slightly guilty,” Jason says. “I should have gone and pulled it out and there would have been none of this drama, but I thought, I haven’t been contracted, or, you know, I’ve got no authority to go and do this officially from Amazon, so if I damage their van I could be liable.”Instead he retrieved the abandoned van using his telehandler the next day. By that time, two tides had rendered it unusable.“Apparently the Amazon driver was a lady who’d been in the job three days,” says Jason. “She, I believe, got to the top of the sea wall and phoned her supervisor and said: ‘Am I doing the right thing here? I’m questioning this.’ And they said: ‘Does the satnav tell you to go that way?’ She said: ‘Yes.’ So they said: ‘Well, carry on.’”An Amazon spokesperson says all supervisors and delivery drivers are “delivery service provider/independent couriers, not Amazon employees … happily, the driver is safe, the van removed and we’re looking into why it happened.”It isn’t the first time this month Jason has been called upon to rescue a hapless delivery driver from the mud. Security guards phoned him the previous Saturday night as another delivery van had got stuck.“I spoke to QinetiQ[which runs Foulness] and said: ‘Can’t you block this off?’ They said it’s a byway, and they can’t. I said: ‘Well, can’t you put a sign up?’ And lo and behold, the following week, exactly the same happens.”It’s almost become a family business in its own right. Roger tells me of the day – 23 June 2018 – when he was tasked to rescue a brand new silver Land Rover Discovery. “It had done 100 miles. He paid just under £70,000 for it and I recovered it before the tide came in.”The Broomway has been used for more than 600 years. It first got its name as a track marked by sticks with shrubs tied to them – the brooms – stuck into the mud, which were placed 30 paces apart along its length. The brooms have long gone, and so these days walkers have to go by a blend of experience, vibes and, if that fails,GPS.“There’s no actual footpath,” says Brian Dawson, who took me out on the Broomway before he retired as a local guide in 2017. “You just sort of gauge it by what you can see ahead, and keep going for it.”The Broomway stopped being the main route on to the island after the MoD took over in 1915. It has been known as the country’s most dangerous path thanks largely to Robert Macfarlane’s description of his walk along it in his 2013 bookThe Old Ways. It is recommended you go with a guide.Set off at the wrong time, or in bad conditions, and you could be done for. Islanders have died in their scores over the years when they have misjudged the tide or simply lost their way. But then the thrill of dicing with disaster was once said to have been part of the attraction.The 19th-century writer Philip Benton, in his history of the Rochford Hundred, suggested some islanders relished the inherent risk the route posed to those who travelled it.“It is extremely perilous for any stranger to attempt the passage to or from this island without a guide, but the dangers attending it have been a pleasurable excitement to many. Some farmers would stay to the last, and then race the tide, and swim the creeks.”Sick cat taken by Amazon delivery driver is returned to Yorkshire familyRead moreBut in some ways, to call it Britain’s deadliest path feels a little hyperbolic. My memory of walking the Broomway is that it feels like an alien landscape, one where you just lose all sense of time due to the effects of an enormous and ever-changing sky and the reflection of light on translucent mudflats. And yet many people have died here, as the gravestones in the churchyard on Foulness attest.The last person to die on the Broomway was in 1919, a luckless man on the way back from the market at Rochford. “He’d probably had a skinful of booze and then on his way back, you know, left it a bit late,” says Brown.There have been more recent close shaves: Dawson tells me of two girls some decades back who had been out on the mainland and wanted to go home to Foulness, but it was raining and beginning to get dark.A search party went out to look for them in the morning, and they were found under the Foulness sea wall, sheltering from the worst of the weather.Dawson says people have wandered off the path and had to be pulled out of their boots on his excursions. The fact that weapons are often tested on the flats makes the quicksand more deadly.“When the ministry lets bombs go off, they make a hole,” says Dawson. “They don’t fill it in. Nature fills it in, but it never fills up as solid as it was before it was blown out.”Dawson is in his 80s and doesn’t feel he can physically go out on the Broomway any more, but he misses it. “Just being out there … you’ve got Southend, and you’ve got all the hassle and the fighting down there. You go a little further out and it’s peaceful. There’s nothing there, but you can enjoy it. For me, it’s so comforting.”We live in a world shaped by tech disruptors relying on cheap labour, but I wonder when looking at the picture of the Amazon van with water rising around it whether it might represent the limits of our faith in this model.Google is building agigantic AI data centreup the Thames at Thurrock.

The shadow cabinet from hell. Rejects, losers and deadbeats. A freak show. A tribute act.Reform have often been called a one-man band. The Nigel Farage party. So to counter this narrative, Nige took over Church House in Westminster and turned it into a tacky gameshow set. A remake of The Weakest Link. All to parade hisnew top team. The lucky men and women whose one job is to try not to fall out with one another in the next few years. No chance.Farage took centre stage; despite pretences, this was still all about him.His team were here entirely at his whim. Without him they would be nothing. The spotlight would remain on him throughout the 75-minute presentation. His appointees would only get their turn under lights for their five-minute introductions. Then they would be cast back into the shadows. Start as you mean to go on.“I was looking for three things,” said Nige. “Energy, experience and expertise.” Unfortunately, his first appointment had none of these. But Farage had had to find something for his deputy leader to do and, realisingRichard Ticewas unsuitable for any of the four main offices of state, had shunted him sideways into the lesser role of business, trade and energy. This was a very, very important role, he said. Primarily to reassure Tice. Dicky didn’t look reassured. He had hoped to be shadow chancellor. It was all he could do not to cry.View image in fullscreenRichard Tice looking at Nigel Farage during the press conference with Suella Braverman in the background.Photograph: Carlos Jasso/AFP/Getty ImagesPoor Dicky. His role in life is to be shat on by Nige. Going into the last election, Tice was the leader of Reform. Then Farage reckoned the polls were more promising than he had thought and elbowed Dicky out the way. “You don’t mind, do you?” he asked Tice belatedly. And Dicky said: no, it was fine. Because Dicky has no sense of self-worth. He knows he’s just an extra. Someone to make up the numbers. And since the election, he has endured any number of minor humiliations as Farage’s ego has grown. Culminating in this.Tice tried to look as if he were thrilled with his demotion. This is what he had always dreamed of. “I have a track record in business,” he said. True. He does have a small fortune. Mainly because he started off with a large one. Now was the time to get the country growing by 4% a year and to get rid of unnecessary regulations. You wondered if Dicky had had a personality transplant and was about to announce we would be rejoining the EU. But no, this was just a wishlist. As was his creation of a national sovereign wealth fund. Even Nige looked a bit nervous at this point. Dicky was even more of an idiot than he had thought.Next up was the job of shadow chancellor. Having looked around at the vast array of talent within the party –Andrew Rossindell,Sarah Pochin, the tax-dodgingNadhim Zahawi– Nige had decided to go for a former Tory whom he had recently described as a fraud. Step forwardRobert Jenrick. The man who had been part of the Conservative government responsible for much of the country’s decline. Honest Bob.Never one to refuse a planning consent to a party donorin need of a tax break.Honest Bob skirted over his own time in office. In a hasty piece of revisionism, he appears to have decided that the Tories left the country in good shape and that the problems all stem from the last 18 months of Labour. Wisely, he also decided to forget he had been an enthusiastic supporter of the Liz Truss budget. We are going to look after your money, he told us. If it’s all the same, Bob …On to the shadow home secretary. This went to the permanently grumpyZia Yusuf. He too wanted to be chancellor. Thinks he knows better than everyone, including Nige. Is guaranteed to fall out with almost everyone. Possibly even himself. He makes Kemi Badenoch look well balanced. Zia was focused on one thing and one thing only. Deporting immigrants. The more the merrier. Zia then took aim at Honest Bob. Things had got worse when Jenrick had been immigration minister. Nige may have time for Tory failures, but Yusuf didn’t.Last to be announced was Suella Braverman. She had beensacked as home secretaryand would now be happy to be sacked as shadow education, skills and equalities minister. Suella gave off distinct Butlin’s end-of-season-cabaret energy. Had she really defected from the Tories to be sidelined into a role in which she had no real interest? She had hoped for so much more. Foreign secretary maybe. But education it was. All schools were rubbish, she said. University was fine for her kids, but the little people should get back in their boxes and learn a trade. As for equalities, she had no interest in that at all. So she was abolishing it immediately. The shortest held shadow ministerial title of all time.And that was that. No one in Reform was currently up to the job of shadow foreign or defence secretary. Dicky and Suella had clearly been overlooked for them. Maybe Nige just hadn’t been able to get through to Matt Goodwin. Matt does have the air of someone who spends half the night watching Andrew Tate videos. Maybe Farage is saving Pochin for monoculture, media and sport.Come the media questions, Farage was quick to remind everyone that Reform really was all about him. The last 45 minutes had just been a nod to democracy. This was his party and he would do what he liked with it. One journalist dared to ask Honest Bob a question and Nige quickly interrupted: “I’ll take that one.” Jenrick retreated into the darkness. He understands the rules. For now. Cross Farage and you are toast.The longer the press conference went on, the more arrogant and objectionable Nige became. He startedridiculing female journalistsfor asking the wrong questions. Refusing to answer anything awkward. This was the thin-skinned, sexist, bad-tempered version of Nige that he tries so hard to keep under wraps. But he couldn’t help himself. Couldn’t bear relinquishing some control. He had had more than enough of letting the others have their five minutes of fame.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe politics sketchReform UKRichard TiceRobert JenrickNadhim ZahawiSuella BravermancommentShareReuse this content"

A campaign by activists, or a sign of our politically disparate times?Tue 17 Feb 2026 07.37 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 07.39 ESTShareIf you’ve started to feel like you’re living in an entirely different reality from most of the world, there’s a good chance that it’s because you’ve been looking at theRotten Tomatoes page for the Melania Trump documentary. There you will find two diametrically opposed numbers. First is the official Rotten Tomatoes score – the one aggregated across published reviews by professional critics – which sits at a minuscule 11%. But then there is the audience rating, which is based on scores from members of the general public. That score, incredibly, is 98%. (Admittedly, this is a score confined to “verified ticket buyers” –Rotten Tomatoes has another section it calls “All Audience”where the reaction is more … mixed.)Melania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreOf course, there has long been a chasm between public and critical opinion, which is why the film that won the most Oscars last year was a small character study about a disenfranchised stripper and the film that brought in the most money was about Minecraft. Even so, the disparity between the brutal reviews thatMelaniareceived (“The most depressing experience I have ever had in the cinema” – Mark Kermode) and the glowing public reviews (“Every red blooded American needs to see this movie to recognise the grace, sophistication and power of Flotius [sic]” – Jackie) is enough to give you whiplash.Who could be wrong here? Is it the liberal press, relishing an opportunity to land a hit on an unpopular president by trashing his wife’s expensive vanity project? Or perhaps it’s the public reviewers who (and this is just wild speculation) have decided to flood the site with fake reviews in a coordinated attempt to undermine dissenting voices. Who could possibly say?View image in fullscreenDivisive … Five Nights At Freddy’s 2.Photograph: Ryan Green/APEither way, with an 87% difference between critics and the public, Melania will now go down in history as the film with the biggest gap between critical and popular scores. Nobody will be sadder about this than the people behind Five Nights at Freddy’s 2, which held the title until recently. Professional critics gave that film a lowly score of 16%, while its audience loved it enough to score it 84%. Prior to that, according to research by digital entertainment platformJB.com, the film with the biggest gap was 2024’s Emilia Pérez. Despite winning the jury prize at Cannes and gaining a 70% critical score, the film’s audience gave it just 17%. There are others. The 2021 Dwayne Johnson-starring Red Notice scored 37% with critics and 92% with the public. Saw sequel Jigsaw scored 32% with critics but 88% with the public. Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin scored 83% with critics and 55% with the public.Clearly, there are two biases going on here. The films that do better with audiences tend to be formulaic crowd-pleasers like Red Notice and Jigsaw. They exist to be familiar and unchallenging, qualities that critics historically dismiss. And who can blame them, since literally all they do is watch films. All they want to see is something to break the monotony of passable entertainment. A terrifying arthouse film about a sexy alien getting burned alive in Scotland is much more likely to do that than a Ryan Reynolds buddy comedy.The other bias is that the films that did badly with the public – Emilia Pérez and Under the Skin – both have female leads. Which isn’t to say that the public hates women, but it is to say that an aggressively obnoxious quadrant of the public gets a bit weird when a film deals with women, or Black people, or transgenderism in any form.Emilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón got in hot waterfor a variety of reasons, but look at the films that have been review bombed in the past. Female superhero movies such as Captain Marvel. Female-oriented remakes like Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters. The Last Jedi, with its non-white female characters. The Little Mermaid with its non-ginger mermaid. There is a pattern to these things, and the pattern suggests that a lot of these public reviews – maybe, possibly, even Melania’s – are ideologically motivated.You need to take both scores with a pinch of salt. On one hand, critics tend to lean highbrow, which means they’re likely to underestimate something designed to sit solidly with audiences. Conversely, people who leave reviews online for free are absolute weirdos.But the gap is here to stay. You might have noticed that the gap between critics and the public is growing every year. Emilia Perez’s 53% gap in 2024 became Five Nights at Freddy’s 2’s 68% gap in 2025, which is now an 87% gap thanks to Melania. It’s impossible to imagine that this will ever be beaten – surely Melania was released in the perfect conditions for a percentage gap – but then again we’ve said that before. Perhaps one day something will come along to top it. A film made by someone genuinely contentious, dealing with a ferociously touchy subject that has caused people to lose their minds for thousands of years. A film that will start a legitimately tedious, all-encompassing, multi-stranded debate that will roll on for months and months until everybody loses the will to live. In other words: Mel Gibson’s The Resurrection of the Christ, this is your time to shine.Explore more on these topicsFilmMelaniaFilm criticismRotten TomatoesEmilia PérezUnder The SkincommentShareReuse this content"

Brit Ben Chaplin is a delightfully incompetent owner of a large dog who mistakes Uma Thurman’s producer for Janeane Garofalo’s radio presenter of a pet advice radio phone-in. Garofalo and Chaplin completely steal the film – I do wish people had given her more roles after it – and it’s touching, silly and (I’ve discovered over the years) a film for people like me who don’t really like romcoms or romantic films in particular.Rothko06Two for the RoadIt’s a bittersweet dramedy on a 12-year marriage that jumps back-and-forth in time.

Also it’s pleasingly self-aware that we all know how the basic Groundhog Day idea works, so it gets all the “wait – this all happened yesterday!” stuff out of the way with admirable efficiency.JebedeeWhat IfA romcom with Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan that is both romantic and funny, something that so many “romcoms” don’t actually manage … what a lovely film it is.KevcoeLonely HeartsEven though it was an AFI best picture winner, Paul Cox’s Lonely Hearts seems sadly forgotten these days, but it still keeps this heart warm as the years roll on. That it captures a Melbourne completely gone in all but memory just adds to its wonder, as does the incandescently beautiful Wendy Hughes, playing the impossible role of a plain-Jane. A film filled with gentleness … a rare quality.BobbskiWhite PalaceI’ve always had a soft spot for the 1990 film White Palace with Susan Sarandon and James Spader, justifying that opposites do attract. The final scene in the restaurant, is just single minded loveliness.Aubrey26The Russia HouseView image in fullscreenMichelle Pfeiffer and Sean Connery in The Russia House.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyOne of my favourites is the romance in The Russia House between Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, which was grounded, refreshing and human – his disheveled, boozy, and vulnerable middle-aged publisher begs the affection of Pfeiffer’s cautious Soviet mother – the world-weary nature of their characters mean the age gap wasn’t so significant. The film score is Jerry Goldsmith’s masterpiece – smoky and bittersweet with Slavic textures.shakercoolaThe Bitter Tea of General YenI’d nominate Frank Capra’s The Bitter Tea of General Yen with Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther.

Probably not. But what I can offer is a snapshot through my own lens: as a friend, a mentee and a collaborator onOperation Black Vote.Like many people, my first image of the Rev Jesse Jackson was that historic photograph taken in Memphis in 1968, pointing toward the direction of the gunman who had just assassinated his mentor, the civil rights icon Martin Luther King. That moment fixed him in history. Fast forward two decades and he reappeared in the global consciousness as the fast-talking, big-afro presidential candidate of 1984 and 1988, proudly proclaiming that Black was beautiful while building one of the most diverse political coalitions the US had ever seen.His charisma was undeniable, but it was his pulpit oratory that truly set him apart. “Say after me: I am somebody. I am somebody.” And then, the line that would echo across generations: “Keep hope alive.” Years later, he told me that sometimes when you lose, or think you have lost, you have in fact won – because you have paved the way for others to follow. In running for president, he became one of the most recognisable Americans on the planet. To Black communities across the world, he became our hero.I had to wait more than a decade after his presidential campaigns before I finally met him, at the 2001 State of the Black World conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Great African-American leaders such as the congresswomanMaxine Watersand the Rev Al Sharpton spoke before me. I joked that the brothers and sisters back home would never believe Sharpton and Jackson were my warm-up acts.Jackson approached me afterwards. “I like your style and your hustle,” he said. “How can I help?” And help he did. Over the next two decades he visited Operation Black Vote campaign events in the UK more than a dozen times. “What do you want me to say, Brother Woolley?” he would ask. “How do we move the dial here?”Voter registration and political representation were, and remain, our calling cards. Together we helped register tens of thousands of Black and minority voters across Britain. We crisscrossed the country campaigning, he the mentor and I the eager student. I watched how he acknowledged the unseen helpers in every room, sometimes spending 10 minutes thanking volunteers one by one. People felt seen, heard and valued. He rarely relied on a prepared script, but his team would surround him with pages of facts. He believed charisma should be matched with evidence.Visiting him during the Congressional Black Caucus gatherings in Washington DC felt like travelling with royalty. Black royalty. If he was a major figure in Britain, in the US you truly grasped at what he meant to Black America. He was its standard-bearer for social and racial justice.His influence stretched far beyond the US and the UK. Across Africa he was revered as a global freedom fighter. One of his final international trips was to Paris in 2021, where the president, Emmanuel Macron,awarded himFrance’s highest honour at the Élysée Palace. What was scheduled as a short ceremony lasted hours; Macron simply wanted to spend time with him. The following day he invited Jackson for a private visit to the Eiffel Tower.Jackson’s final overseas visit, however, was deeply personal for me. It was to Homerton College, Cambridge, where I had the privilege, as the mentee, of bestowing upon the mentor anhonorary fellowship. It is a moment I will never forget.In today’s fast moving, social-media-driven world of instant fame and fleeting attention, it is hard to imagine who the public icons of tomorrow might be. True public service often feels like a relic of another era, while cynicism and outrage dominate the spotlight.What we have lost is not simply a campaigner, preacher, politician or civil rights leader. We have lost a giant of a man. And I have lost a friend.‘I am somebody,’ Jackson said. And we all stood tallerHugh MuirExecutive editor, Guardian OpinionTo meet the Rev Jesse Jackson was to meet a colossus. He was big in aura and grand in stature. Something radiated from him like a sheen: a drive, a self assurance, a fixity of purpose. He had vision, sharp intelligence and he had craft. Oh boy, did he have craft.There was an elongated moment in a longinterview I didwith him in 2007, after a day of watching him talk and meet people during a visit to the UK, when I looked down at my notepad, listening all the while to his sonorous voice. It was his private voice, quieter, shorn of the performative element that marked him in public. I looked up and saw his eyes were shut, his head had lolled: he was pretty much asleep. He knew the message he wanted to send and how to impart it. He was literally doing it in his sleep.For those of us for whom Martin Luther King and his lieutenants were heroic figures from literary and TV history, a visit from a titan of the US civil rights movement was akin to touching the hem of a guru’s garment. He came and spoke at an all-seats-taken, queue-around-the-block event organised byOperation Black Vote. And after 10 minutes of his address, part lectern exposition, part cadence-littered sermon, the reason for much of the fuss and awe became apparent.“I am somebody.” Shorn of context, the sentence sounds self evident, perhaps trite. Adapted from a 1950s poem by Rev William Holmes Borders Sr, Jackson made it his mantra.When he led that chant, as he often did, in front of thousands of people, it said everything to those of us entreated by society, its leaders and its institutions to believe that we were less than somebody. “I may be poor, but I am somebody”, “I may be young, but I am somebody”, “I may have made mistakes, but I am somebody”. He did many tangible things, his Operation Push initiatives, his voter-drive campaigns, his hostage-release efforts, his presidential campaigns. But I’m not sure anything was as effective as his mass dissemination of three words that helped give dignity to a people whose lives were a relentless fight to keep it.He was a force, not least because he joined the dots. His presidential tilts in 1984 and 1988 were never going to end in the White House, but they nonetheless had traction because he understood the overlap between racial struggles and class. He saw people, but he also saw powerful themes, of othering, of inequality, of disenfranchisement. Leaders of that stripe are most dangerous – so mourn today, because we can ill afford to lose them.I was always inspired by his courageDiane AbbottLabour MP for Hackney North and Stoke NewingtonI first met the Rev Jesse Jackson when I was a brand new MP in the 1980s. We were to take many photographs together down the years and, to this day, there is one in pride of place in my office in parliament. Meeting Jesse for the first time was overwhelming. As most people know, he was a protege of Martin Luther King and was in the Memphis motel with him when he was murdered. He was a figure who was a link to the time of the very height of the civil rights movement.Meeting Jesse in the flesh was no disappointment. He was tall, commanding and charismatic. The kind of man people turned to look at in the street even when they did not know who he was.We kept in touch over 30 years. If he was in London, we would get together; if I was close by in the US, we would meet. I learned a lot from him. He was very brave and I have always tried to show a little of that courage. After all, however difficult things might be for me, I was not risking my life every day as he did. He taught me the importance of having principles and sticking to them. Above all, I learned from Jesse never to forget the importance of being a voice for the voiceless.His organising base was in Chicago’s South Side, but he was also a great internationalist. He travelled all over the world talking about racial justice in that inimitable southern preacher’s manner. The last time I met him was in 2021 at a conference in Paris about the international fight against racism.If any single person could be said to carry on the legacy of King, it was Jesse. There were others who kept the organisations going, spoke and campaigned. But unconstrained by a political party, he was the civil rights figure of the age. It was a privilege to have known him.He dreamed of a genuinely leftwing alternativeBhaskar SunkaraPresident of The Nation and founding editor of JacobinThe Rev Jesse Jackson was the electorally consequential figure of the US left in the long gap between the New Deal and Bernie Sanders’s emergence as a national force. Long before “democratic socialism” returned to mainstream debate, Jackson was doing the unglamorous work of building a multiracial working-class coalition – and scaring the hell out of the Democratic establishment in the process.His 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns weren’t vanity bids. They emerged from the space that the post-1968, “new politics” movement opened up, but offered a new alternative for the left wing of the Democratic party – more rooted in black political organisation and more economically ambitious than McGovern-era liberalism ever managed to be. Jackson came out of the civil rights movement and dreamed of fully transforming a party once littered with segregationists into an American analogue for the leftwing parties of Europe. Through the Rainbow/Push Coalition, he brought together black voters, organised labour, small farmers, peace activists and others into something that looked, more than anything else in US political life, like a genuine social democratic bloc.The programme was clear and serious. Anchored in demands such as full employment, this movement argued that the federal government should guarantee work and direct investment to abandoned communities. For Jackson, racism and economic neglect were the same problem, and the answer was public power.The party and history chose another path. Under Clinton, Democrats embraced deregulation and third-way triangulation: tax credits and market discipline where there might have been structural reform to address the effects of deindustrialisation and urban decay.Jackson famously clashed with Barack Obama during the latter’s 2008 presidential campaign, but he also made Obama possible. He expanded the electorate and proved that a black presidential candidate rooted in grassroots mobilisation could be a serious, national force. He also, in important ways, prefigured Sanders, an early supporter of his – the insurgent primary runs, the mass rallies, the fusion of labour demands and the language of moral urgency.In a country where the left has spent most of its history on the margins, Jackson made it matter. He told it to keep hope alive. With the rise of figures such as Zohran Mamdani, it still does.Jackson made Black history real for meNadine WhiteJournalist and film-makerThe Rev Jesse Jackson was one of those names I was aware of long before I understood why. He was simply there, part of the wider landscape of Black political life, hovering at the edge of my consciousness.I first encountered him in a school history lesson in the early 2000s when I was about 13. The US civil rights movement was referenced briefly, almost in passing. Martin Luther King was the centrepiece, as he always is, and the lesson moved on quickly. But I went home curious.Those were the days of dial-up internet and bulky computers, when looking something up still felt like a deliberate act. I started with King – his life, his assassination – and it was there that I came across Jackson’s name. He had been with King in Memphis on the night he was killed. That detail stayed with me.From there, I worked backwards, delving further into Jackson’s life and discovering the wider constellation of Black thinkers, organisers and artists who shaped that era.John Lewis. James Baldwin.Lorraine Hansberry. Nina Simone.Claude McKay.My mother had already laid some of the groundwork. Through reggae music and the striking portrait of Marcus Garvey that hung on our wall, I understood that these struggles weren’t confined to the US. It spanned continents and generations.Jackson would then turn up elsewhere. In cartoons such asSouth Parkand the Boondocks; on the news,crying openlythe night Barack Obama was elected US president. His presence bridged worlds from his pulpit to popular culture.For me, he represented continuity. He was proof that history wasn’t abstract or distant, but lived, felt and carried forward by real people. He connected the sacrifices of the past to the possibilities of the present, making it clear that progress doesn’t just arrive. It’s fought for, held on to and handed down.Explore more on these topicsJesse JacksonThe panelCivil rights movementcommentShareReuse this content"

There was the one about the founder who hadn’t taken a weekend off in more than six months. The woman who joked that she’d given up her social life to work at a prestigious AI company. Or the employees who had started taking their shoes off in the office because, well, if you were going to be there for at least12 hoursa day,six daysa week, wouldn’t you rather bewearing slippers?“If you go to a cafe on a Sunday, everyone is working,” says Sanju Lokuhitige, the co-founder of Mythril, a pre-seed-stage AI startup, who moved toSan Franciscoin November to be closer to the action. Lokuhitige says he works seven days a week, 12 hours a day, minus a few carefully selected social events each week where he can network with other people at startups. “Sometimes I’m coding the whole day,” he says. “I do not have work-life balance.”Another startup employee, who came to San Francisco to work for an early-stage AI company, showed me dismal photos from his office: a two-bedroom apartment in the Dogpatch, a neighborhoodpopular with tech workers. His startup’s founders live and work in this apartment – from 9am until as late as 3am, breaking only to DoorDash meals or to sleep, and leaving the building only to take cigarette breaks. The employee (who asked not to use his name, since he still works for this company) described the situation as “horrendous”. “I’d heard about 996, but these guys don’t even do 996,” he says. “They’re working 16-hour days.”Startups have never been particularly glamorous. When I started reporting on the industry a decade ago, people were cashing in on the new mobile app economy, andcoders were chugging Soylentto stay at their desks longer. Startups then, too, were defined byhustle culture,high-octane energyand the pursuit ofgrowth at all costs– ideas that, to some extent, have remained in the bloodstream of the industry.But in the last year, as the magic dust of artificial intelligence has settled in San Francisco, the vibe among tech workers does seem different. The excitement about a new epoch in tech – and all the money that comes with it – is now tempered with anxieties about the industry, and the economy. Some workers are going all in on AI while also questioning whether all that AI is good for the world. Others are effectively training machines to do their jobs better than they can. And many of the same workers who are racing to build the future are now wondering if the future they’re building has a place for them in it.The rest of us may be ambiently aware of these anxieties, but they are already tangible and keenly felt inside the tech industry. Even the biggest tech companies, once known for coddling employees with on-site massages and barber shops, havescaled backperks as they have escalated the expectations of workers. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have each been candid about their predictions that AI will replace some junior and mid-level engineers at their companies, and have respectively called for their workforces to be more “efficient” and “extremely hard core” as waves of layoffs set employees on-edge. Tech companies laid off about a quarter of a million workers around the world in 2025, according to areportpublished byRationalFX. In many of those layoffs, AI wascited as a main factor, even if the full reason for layoffs is often more complex.“If you were a software engineer five years ago, you could kind of write your ticket,” says Mike Robbins, an executive coach who has worked with companies like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Airbnb. Now, the balance of power has shifted away from tech workers, many of whom are left feeling anxious about their work performance. “When companies become less scared about losing employees, then they can be a little more forthright in terms of what they want and be a little more demanding.”Robbins, who wrote the book Bring Your Whole Self to Work, used to be asked to speak to companies and their leaders about topics like employee burnout, wellbeing and belonging – top priorities in the years during and shortly after the pandemic. “Quite frankly, we’ve stopped talking about all that,” he says. Now, company leaders want advice on topics like change, disruption and uncertainty in the workplace.Those themes – change, disruption and uncertainty – are each part of the fuel that has driven tech workers to put in more hours, at a higher intensity. Investment in artificial intelligence companies reachedrecord highsin 2025, yet workers are feeling scarcity in ways they haven’t before.“It’s definitely something that’s on everyone’s mind,” says Kyle Finken, a software engineer at Mintlify, which makes an AI tool for developers. “I think a lot of people are concerned like, ‘Oh, am I going to have a job in three years?’”Despite his fears, Finken, like many other startup employees I spoke to, feels energized by the “extraordinary innovation” happening in artificial intelligence and believes that there will still be plenty of jobs for software engineers in the future, even if those jobs look different from the pure coding roles of today. He and other tech workers characterized the current moment as a particularly creative and productive time in tech, where people are devoting extra hours to work not because their employers demand it but out of genuine interest in the new tools and capabilities. For example, Garry Tan, the head of the famous startup accelerator Y Combinator, recently bragged that he “stayed up 19 hours” playing around with Claude Code.Even those who felt excited about the pace of change acknowledged that AI was rapidly augmenting their work, in ways that could have uncertain outcomes for the jobs of the future. “This is definitely not an era of complacency,” says Finken.One reason for working so many hours is to keep up with tools and technology that are changing nearly every day. If you take the weekend off, you can miss a major development, which makes it harder to keep up with what competitors are doing. Another reason is to have something to show future employers, especially as more junior-level jobs are replaced by AI.“No one hires junior developers any more,” says Lokuhitige, the Mythril co-founder. Landing a job now requires “doing something cool”, he says, like building a new product or solving a problem that gets recognized as useful by larger companies. Job postings for entry-level tech jobs have dropped by a third since 2022, according toIndeed’s Hiring Lab, while job postings requiring at least five years of experience have risen. If you’re not grinding at a startup, you’re missing the prerequisite to get hired in the future.What this means for the rest of usWhile economists are torn about whether AI will replace most jobs or just change them, they seem aligned in the idea that AI has already reshaped a great deal of entry-level work and will continue to do so. Apaperpublished by Stanford researchers in November found “substantial declines in employment for early-career workers” in industries exposed to AI and suggested that areas where change is already occurring could be like a “canary in the coalmine” for the rest of the economy. The Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei, has suggested AI could eliminateabout halfofallentry-level jobs in white-collar industries within the next five years.The head of the International Monetary Fund recentlypredictedthat 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence, “like a tsunami hitting the labour market”. In San Francisco, you can already see the early signs, as Uber drivers compete with self-driving Waymos, and baristas are replaced by robotic coffee bars. Professional business services that support the tech industry have also beennegatively affectedby the layoffs. The pressure to grind in the tech world could be an early signal – a harbinger for what many other industries will feel soon.Robbins, the executive coach, says that companies once looked to Silicon Valley as a model of how they should operate, down to emulating policies like unlimited vacation days or adopting perks like free lunch in the office.“There was an idealization of tech and Silicon Valley for a long time across the business world. Some of that has changed,” he says. “Now, people aren’t asking me to tell them what’s going on in the Valley so that they can adopt it, the same way they were a decade ago.”Rather than a model of how we should all work, the tech industry may be a premonition for the anxiety and attempts to compensate that are coming for all of us."

So if you have an unencrypted environment where AI is used to detect known images, that is the low-hanging fruit that we should expect is no longer available on the open web, and that is something that we’ve talked about a lot for many, many years:that technology is available,it is detectable, it can be taken down. So we should no longer be finding known images.”The Online Safety Act, while a help, was not enough, police said.“You can’t have a world where you don’t have protective measures in place for children, and that is the challenge with the open web,” Jones said. “At the moment, there are not enough protective measures in place, although they are coming through and moving towards a regulated environment, that’s not coming in place quickly enough to contain this.”Becky Riggs, the acting chief constable for Staffordshire police who is the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for child protection and abuse investigation,said some platforms were better than others, and the number of referrals was rising despite the growth of end-to-end encryption, which means activity cannot be monitored.“Every victim that experiences this type of crime, it has unimaginable consequences, which are often lifelong and, sadly in the online world, are often relived as well because the images are shared across a network of individuals.”Jones said a proposed ban on under 16s using social media was “not a silver bullet” and the NCA said the livestreamed sexual abuse of children could be bought online and on demand for as little as £20.Police said there was no typical offender and previously it had been estimated thatup to 840,000 adults in the UKhad a sexual interest in children.Explore more on these topicsCrimeRape and sexual assaultChild protectionPoliceChildrenInternetSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

We cannot consent to the new statutory instrument that is necessary to set up our mayoral county combined authority in the months before our elections. So that’s it.“The contract is broken. The Conservative group is resolved that we will not be assisting this government to deliver LGR.”There are concerns that other council leaders could follow suit. Daniel Elmer, leader of South Norfolk council, said: “We were sold LGR as a mechanism for us to receive more money and powers locally. So far, that has not materialised and I am therefore not sure that we should be spending more of our taxpayers money on this.”Billig called the local government secretary,Steve Reed, a “two-faced bully” who had forced the council to agree not to ask for local elections to go ahead, in return for being given access to the government’s devolution priority programme. Mellig added that she had never met or spoken to Reed.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said Billig’s claims were untrue. “Norfolk’s place on the devolution priority programme has never been contingent on the timing of local authority elections and we remain committed to working with all local partners on mayoral devolution in Norfolk and Suffolk,” they said.Norfolk and Suffolk was one of six areas chosen for the government’s devolution priority programme to speed up mayoral elections – they were originally due to elect mayors in 2026, but this was delayed.Devolutionis happening separately to LGR, under which two-tier councils across the country will be merged into fewer unitary authorities.As well as the concerns about the political impact of thepostponed elections, some Labour MPs are also sceptical about the wider idea of reorganising councils, disputing the idea it will save money and warning that many of the new unitary authorities risk feeling too large and remote for many voters.One backbencher said: “I just don’t get why you would do something as complex and risky as this in a first term. It’s a second-term project, at best.” Some other Labour MPs, however, are supportive, saying the current two-tier system is confusing.Nigel Farage said Reed should step down over the election fiasco, while the Conservatives demanded he quit if he was “unable or unwilling” to answer questions about his “personal propriety as a minister” raised by the handling of the decision.The care minister, Stephen Kinnock, defended Reed, saying he was “doing an excellent job”. He said the situation was not “ideal” but the government wanted to work within the rule of law.Explore more on these topicsLocal electionsSteve ReedLocal governmentEnglandLocal politicsDevolutionnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the force admitted it was.Police in the UK are keen to show, sources say, that they will investigate without fear or favour, with allegations about Epstein and his links to the powerful swirling aroundAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who is the king’s brother.In all, four British police forces are now confirmed to be assessing claims to see if full criminal investigations are needed.The forces involved include Thames Valley police, which is assessing two separate claims against Mountbatten-Windsor and whether they merit a full criminal investigation, and Surrey police, which is assessing another allegation against him.Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all wrongdoing.The Metropolitan police is criminally investigating Peter Mandelson for allegedly passing information to Epstein while a Labour government minister.Bedfordshire’s police force has been unable to say if it is assessing claims that Luton airport was used by planes linked to Epstein to traffic women. Some police sources say it is assessing such claims.One senior policing source has told the Guardian that a “tsunami” of allegations was expected as a result of the release of millions of files relating to Epstein.In an article for the New Statesman last week, Brown said the Epstein files showed the financier’s jet making 90 flights to or from UK airports, including 15 after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a child.He said Epstein “boasted” about how cheap Stansted’s airport charges were compared with Paris.Brown said Stansted airport was where “women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another”, adding that “women arriving on private planes into Britain would not need British visas”.He said it seemed as though authorities “never knew what was happening”, referring to evidence uncovered by the BBC which showed “incomplete flight logs, with unnamed passengers simply labelled as ‘female’”.On Tuesday, an Essex police spokesperson said: “We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted airport following the publication of the US DoJ (Department of Justice) Epstein files.”A Stansted airport spokesperson said: “All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent fixed base operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.“All immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving on private aircraft are carried out directly by Border Force.“They use entirely independent terminals not operated by London Stansted and no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal.“The airport does not manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft.”In December, a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to Epstein had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.The statement from Essex police comes after the Guardian revealed that the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council (NPCC) said a national group had been set up to support UK police forces that are “assessing allegations” following the publication of the Epstein files.A spokesperson for the NPCC said: “A national coordination group has been set up to support a small number of forces assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.“We continue to work collaboratively to assess the details being made public to allow us to understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been published.“We continue to support our partners and contribute in any way we can to help secure justice for victims and survivors, and urge anyone who needs support to visitwhenyouareready.co.uk.”The investigation comes after the DoJ released 3.5m pages of information relating to Epstein. A panel of independent experts appointed by the UN human rights council on Tuesday said the tranche of documents released suggested the existence of a “global criminal enterprise”.The experts said: “So grave is the scale, nature, systematic character and transnational reach of these atrocities against women and girls that a number of them may reasonably meet the legal threshold of crimes against humanity.”Thames Valley police are assessing claims that Mountbatten-Windsor used his position as a British trade envoy to give potentially sensitive information to Epstein.They are also examining a claim that Epstein sent a second woman to the UK for sex with the former prince in Windsor in 2010.A lawyer who represented the late Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who alleged she had been sexually trafficked to Mountbatten-Windsor, said the former prince should be given “safe passage” to the US to give evidence about Epstein.David Boies said: “He’s got an obligation to tell what he knows. Now, I also think that if he’s afraid of being arrested in the United States, we ought to give him safe passage to come to the United States to testify, because we don’t want there to be any excuse for him not coming and telling what he knows.“But he knows a lot. How much I don’t know myself because they gave up in the litigation we had against them just before his deposition was supposed to be taken.”Earlier on Tuesday, the chair of parliament’s cross-party business and trade committee, Liam Byrne, said MPs could potentially investigate Mountbatten-Windsor’s work as a trade envoy.Emails released in the Epstein files appeared to show the former prince – who served as trade envoy between 2001 and 2011 – sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam with Epstein.Thames Valley police previously said they have held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinStansted airportEssexPoliceAndrew Mountbatten-WindsornewsShareReuse this content"

Unafraid of the work to redeem the soul of our Nation.”Biden added: “I’ve seen how Reverend Jackson has helped lead our Nation forward through tumult and triumph. He’s done it with optimism, and a relentless insistence on what is right and just.“Reverend Jackson influenced generations of Americans, and countless elected leaders, including Presidents. Reverend Jackson believed in his bones the promise of America: that we are all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.“While we’ve never fully lived up to that promise, he dedicated his life to ensuring we never fully walked away from it either.”Barack Obama called Jackson “a true giant” ina statementposted on Instagram.“For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history. From organizing boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect,” he said.Obama noted that Jackson’s two runs at the presidency in the 1980s “laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land”.“Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse’s lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him,” he said.Bill Clinton said he and former first lady Hillary Clinton were friends with Jackson for more than five decades, and were “deeply saddened” by his passing.“Reverend Jackson championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives,” he said ina statementon Instagram.“[He] never stopped working for a better America with brighter tomorrows, including his historic campaigns for the presidency in 1984 and 1988 in which he championed the concerns of Black, Latino, Asian, and lower income white Americans.“Hillary and I loved him very much.”Al Sharpton, the veteran civil rights campaigner with whom Jackson worked closely after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, called his friend and mentor “a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world”.Ina social media poston Tuesday, Sharpton wrote: “He shaped public policy and changed laws. He kept the dream alive and taught young children from broken homes, like me, that we don’t have broken spirits.”SeniorDemocrats, the party for which Jackson campaigned twice as a presidential candidate, were also quick to pay tribute.“He let us know our voices mattered. He instilled in us that we were somebody. And he widened the path for generations to follow in his footsteps and lead,” Kamala Harris, the first Black US vice-president,wrote on Instagram, also calling Jackson “one of America’s greatest patriots”.Recalling her days as a young law student in Oakland, California, Harris recalled having a “Jesse Jackson for President” sticker on her car.“As I would drive across the Bay Bridge, you would not believe how people from every walk of life would give me a thumbs up or honk of support,” she said.“They were small interactions, but they exemplified Reverend Jackson’s life work – lifting up the dignity of working people, building community and coalitions, and strengthening our democracy and nation.”Jackson, she said, was “a selfless leader, mentor, and friend to me and so many others”.Other Democrats celebrated Jackson’s stature in the civil rights movement.“America has lost a titan in the struggle for civil rights and racial justice. From his days at the side of Dr King, to his moral leadership in this century, Rev Jesse Jackson Sr spent his life pushing our nation closer to its own ideal,” Pete Buttigieg, transportation secretary during the Biden administration,said.The Democratic Georgia senator Raphael Warnock said America had lost “one of its great moral voices”.In a social mediaposthe wrote: “With an eloquence and rhythmic rhetoric all his own, Jesse Jackson reminded America that equal justice is not inevitable; it requires vigilance and commitment, and for freedom fighters, sacrifice.“His ministry was poetry and spiritual power in the public square. He advanced King’s dream and bent the arc of history closer to justice.”Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr, gave thanks for a life she said “pushed hope into weary places”.Ina poston Facebook, King wrote: “Rev Jesse Jackson Sr devoted his life to lifting people in poverty, the marginalized, and those pushed to society’s edges. He pushed barriers and opened doors so Black people and other excluded communities could step into opportunity and dignity.“With the Rainbow Coalition, he cast a bold vision of an inclusive society – uniting people across race, class, and faith to build power together and expand the table of economic opportunity. He was a gifted negotiator and a courageous bridge‑builder, serving humanity by bringing calm into tense rooms and creating pathways where none existed.”King said her family shared “a long and meaningful history with him, rooted in a shared commitment to justice and love”.The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said that Jackson was “one of the great and transformative political leaders in modern American history. He has broken down more barriers than most people could dream of doing.”“Jackson was a courageous civil rights leader who put his life on the line in the fight against segregation and racism – in the north as well as the south,” Sanders also said ina statement, adding, “his politics of togetherness and solidarity should guide us going forward.”Donald Trump, ina poston his Truth Social social media platform, called Jackson “a good man” and a “friend”, also noting he hadprovided office spacein New York for Jackson’sRainbow Push Coalition.Trump’s post, as is often the case, quickly turned political, and about himself. The president attacked the “scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left” who, he said, “falsely and consistently” called him a racist, and sought recognition for “funding Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), which Jesse loved”.Trump also took a swing at a familiar political foe, Barack Obama, whom, he claimed falsely, Jackson “could not stand”.Explore more on these topicsJesse JacksonCivil rights movementUS politicsKamala HarrisDonald TrumpUS voting rightsDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mauritius has denied the accusations.Under the deal, Britain would cede control over the islands to Mauritius but lease the largest, Diego Garcia, for 99 years to continue operating a joint US-UK military base there.Misley Mandarin, leader of the four people who landed on Monday on the remote Île du Coin atoll, said they were living in tents. They expect 10 more arrivals next week and many more in the coming year, he said.Mandarin, who was born in Mauritius, told Reuters that his father, Michel Mandarin, 74, was with him and had been removed from the island aged 14.“I am not in exile any more. This is my homeland,” he said, adding that he wanted to make it possible for the 322 people who he said were born on Île du Coin and still alive “to come home before they die”.He sought to reassure the US that the settlement did not threaten the military base on Diego Garcia.Up to 2,000 Chagossians were forcibly removed from the archipelago in the 1960s and 1970s and resettled mainly in Mauritius and Britain, with many wanting the right to return to their homeland.The UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination has urged Britain and Mauritius not to ratify the 2025 agreement, saying it risks perpetuating historical rights violations.The Mauritius attorney general, Gavin Glover, told Radio Plus the group had landed illegally and dismissed the move as a “publicity stunt organised to create a situation of conflict with the British government”.He said Mauritius would not exercise authority over theChagos Islandsuntil the treaty was ratified.Earlier this month, Donald Trump watered down his criticism of the UK’s plan to hand the Chagos Islands back, sayingthe deal was the “best” Keir Starmer could make.The US president had described ceding sovereignty as an “act of great stupidity” only last month. He also claimed the deal was one of many “national security reasons” why the US should acquire Greenland.After a phone call with Starmer, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Diego Garcia was “strategically situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean and, therefore, of great importance to the National Security of the United States”.He said US military operations had succeeded over the past year “because of the strength of our war fighters, modern capability of our equipment and, very importantly, the strategic location of our Military Bases.“I understand that the deal prime minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make.”But Trump added: “If the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our Base, I retain the right to Militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia.“Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a Base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense.”A spokesperson for the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “The UK government recognises the importance of the islands to the Chagossian community and is working with Mauritius to resume a programme of heritage visits to the Chagos archipelago. This kind of illegal, unsafe stunt is not the way to achieve that.“The vessel does not pose any security risk to Diego Garcia.”Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsMauritiusKeir StarmerDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Vinícius immediately ran to the referee, François Letexier, who stopped the match and crossed his arms to signal that he was activating the anti-racism protocol.Vinícius Júnior takes aim at racist ‘cowards’ after Benfica’s defeat by Real MadridRead moreIn TV footage, it seemed that the word that Vinícius reported back to the referee was “mono” (monkey) and when that was put to Madrid’s coach, Álvaro Arbeloa, afterwards, he said: “You have to ask the Benfica player what he said … I have no reason not to believe what Vinícius says.” Vinícius later posted that racists are “cowards who have to cover their mouths”, while Kylian Mbappé later said that Prestianni had used the word five times.“I spoke to Vinícius and he said one thing and Prestianni said another,” José Mourinho said, although the Benfica manager also questioned why Vinícius celebrated as he had.“What happened tonight is a disgrace,” Trent Alexander-Arnold said. TheReal Madridcaptain, Federico Valverde, said: “If you cover your mouth to say something it’s because it’s not right. It’s lamentable. The insult is very serious and it has happened lots of times to Vinícius.”Vinícius had been shown a yellow card for the celebrations and all over the pitch there were more confrontations, some heated, others dejected. At one point Mbappé appeared to accuse Prestianni of being a “fucking racist”. “I am proud of my teammates for protecting Vinícius and Vinícius for carrying on,” Valverde said. Mourinho said afterwards that there was a moment in which the Brazilian did not want to continue. “There was a great game for 50 minutes and then it ended,” the Benfica coach said.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho talks to Vinícius Júnior before the game is restarted.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/ReutersIt had been competitive until then, and very different tothe last time they metjust 20 days ago. Mourinho had said that he began his analysis by watching that game back but soon turned off and threw his early prep in the bin. This Madrid is not that Madrid, he said, and that was quickly clear. Arbeloa has settled on a structure that gives a more muscular presence in the middle, offering a solidity that simply wasn’t there three weeks ago and ultimately this was a controlled, impressive away performance from Madrid, until the moment which sadly eclipsed everything.Benfica had started brightly again, the noise rising as Rafa Silva was almost slipped in after just three minutes and there was willingness to run through the middle from deep, particularly from Leandro Barreiro, while Thibaut Courtois made a superb stop from Fredrik Aursnes. But this time they would not find it so easy to tear into Madrid. Real, for their part, increased the tempo and might have led in a frantic spell before half-time.Champions League roundup: Galatasaray hammer Juventus to seize controlRead moreMbappé, Álvaro Carreras and a superb touch from Vinícius set up Mbappé for the first chance on 42 minutes, only for the Frenchman to fire over. On 43, after Eduardo Camavinga had been allowed to advance, Mbappé turned and drew a save from Anatoliy Trubin. On 44, Vinícius got into the area to find Mbappé, whose shot was blocked. And then on 45, Trubin made a fantastic save from Arda Guler. At that point, all Benfica wanted was for the whistle to blow, although they were annoyed when it finally did – just as they had a chance for a quick throw that might have released them.Those laments did not last long, but far worse ones replaced them. They had only been back out four minutes when Vinícius was released on the left, cut inside across the corner of the area and struck a fabulous shot into the far top corner. Although they did eventually continue, while Benfica came back at Madrid, Courtois saving from Andreas Schjelderup, Prestianni getting booked for diving in search of a penalty, Mourinho getting sent off for protesting, and a late Sidny Lopes Cabral free-kick looping on to the top of the net, something had been lost, a sadness left in its place. The game had long since ended Mourinho said, and in the way that no one wanted.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBenficaReal MadridVinícius Júniormatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Some gleam from inside the sockets of her eyes, others are scattered over the young woman’s chin, forehead, cheekbones. A few float over the dark expanse of her brain.Each dot represents a metal sphere, about 2-5mm in size, fired from the barrel of a shotgun and revealed by the X-ray camera for a CT scan. Shot from a distance, the projectiles, known as “birdshot”, spray widely, losing some of their momentum. At close range, they cancrack bone, blast through the soft tissue of the face, and easily pierce the eyeball’s delicate globe. Anahita, who is in her early 20s, has lost at least one eye, possibly both.The image of Anahita’s head is one of more than 75 sets of medical images – primarily X-rays and CT scans – shared with the Guardian from one hospital in a major city in Iran, taken over the course of a single evening during the regime’sJanuary crackdown on protesters. The plain, grayscale images tell their own story of the deadly violence inflicted on protesters and onlookers by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).They provide further evidence of events described by doctors and protesters across Iran, where guards switched from more traditional ‘crowd control’ to opening fire with high-calibre assault rifles and shotguns. The records present a pattern of people being shot in the face, chest and genitals, atrend also seen in the 2022 “Women, life, freedom” protests. Collectively, they help to illustrate the scale of bloodshed, showing dozens of life-threatening injuries appearing at a single hospital in a midsize city within a few hours.Composite image showing 10 X-ray images of peoples’ heads in profile with pellets embedded in them, showing as white dots.A small selection of X-rays from patients shot in the face with metal ‘birdshot’ pellets. Medical analysts say the injuries were likely to cause blindness, disfiguration and in some cases, permanent brain damage and disability.Many of the images reveal catastrophic injuries that may be fatal even with immediate surgical treatment. The scan of Vahid*, a young man, shows a large-calibre bullet embedded in his neck, his trachea pushed to the right as blood pools and the damaged tissue swells. Scans of another man, middle-aged, show a bullet suspended in his brain, along with a large bubble of gas inside the skull, indicating a devastating brain injury. Medical experts describe it as “likely not survivable”. Two more young men have large-calibre bullets lodged next to their spines. The scan of a young woman shows a deformed bullet that appears to have entered the ribcage under her right arm, torn through the lung, where gas and blood have built up, and come to rest at the left of her spine.If you’re firing those kind of weapons at people you are, you are trying to kill themTrauma imaging expertAs part of a joint investigation between the Guardian andfactchecking platform Factnameh, the images have been assessed by a panel of health and ballistics experts outside Iran, including an emergency medicine doctor, a radiologist and a trauma imaging specialist. The images have also been assessed by an independent Iranian former ER doctor, who says the software used to capture them is consistent with that used in the hospital concerned and that they show no signs of tampering. Descriptions of the extent of the likely injuries are based on the doctors’ assessments, although they caution that without full medical notes and multiple sets of imaging, they cannot make definitive diagnostic statements about individual patients. Dr Rohini Haar, an emergency doctor, adjunct professor at UC Berkeley and medical adviser to Physicians for Human Rights who has reviewed the files, says the cases are “shocking” in their number and severity. “Using live ammunition and large-gauge bullets against so many individuals is … extremely unusual and notable, even globally.”View image in fullscreenX-rays from patients injured during the Iran protests. Top left: a person with a bullet to the brain; top right: a full metal jacket bullet embedded next to the spine; bottom left: a full metal jacket bullet in the neck; bottom right: a deformed bullet to the chest.Photograph: suppliedA radiologist and trauma imaging expert who has reviewed the images says that the group of patients would constitute “absolutely a mass casualty situation. Even for our large hospitals [in the US] … that would be a mass casualty alert that would overwhelm hospital resources.”Medical experts note that the images would only reflect patients that doctors think they can save, and who have survived to the point where doctors are able to administer detailed scans. Most people shot by a high-calibre round to the head, for example, “wouldn’t have got to a CT scan”, they say. During a mass casualty event, hospitals are forced to prioritise the cases that are life-threatening but treatable without requiring extensive resources, Haar says, meaning that the scans would only represent a small subset of the injured people who presented that night.Iran is one of a small number of states where armed forces and police use metal birdshot. While an individual birdshot pellet does not cause as much damage as a bullet, they can still be catastrophic. At long range, when the pellets spray outward, they will hit a crowd indiscriminately. Even a single pellet can cause terrible damage. The X-rays show several cases where just one or two pellets are present in the skull (indicating the person was likely hit at longer range), but they appear to have pierced the eye and come to rest in the socket. At close range, a person may be pierced by hundreds of pellets, causing the destruction of all surrounding soft tissue.View image in fullscreenA chest X-ray of a patient shot at close range, with birdshot metal pellets distributed throughout the right chest cavity.Photograph: suppliedHer face was covered in blood, and her younger brother was shaking uncontrollably … the eye could not be savedMember of surgery staffX-rays of the chest of Ali* show more than 174 metal pellets sprayed into his right chest cavity, the metal balls tightly packed, indicating he was shot at extremely close range. His right lung has partially collapsed, and is surrounded by leaking blood and gas. Even with extensive, immediate surgical intervention, his risk of death would be very high, medical experts who have reviewed the images say.“People think birdshot is less deadly than live ammunition. It’s not,” Haar says. “When you’re firing at point-blank range, all of those metal balls are penetrating – they’re like 100 tiny bullets.”As well as the violence of the injuries, the X-rays are notable for the patterns they reveal: case after case shows patients shot at short to medium range in the face, chest and genitals.Twenty-nine patients whose records have been viewed by the Guardian have been shot in the face with birdshot. Safie*, a middle-aged woman, still wears simple jewellery in the first CT scan of her head: the thin chain of a necklace dangles against the dark grey of her neck. Also lit up are the metal beads that have burrowed deep into the tissue of her brain. The scans show the progress of medical teams’ efforts to save Safie: a craniotomy, in which a section of the skull is removed either to perform surgery, or to relieve the pressure of the injured, swelling brain crushing against the skull. Later images show that some metal pellets have been removed from the skull, but more than 20 remain embedded in her head and neck. It is not known whether she survived.View image in fullscreenAn X-ray of a woman shot in the crotch, with about 200 metal balls embedded in her upper thigh and pelvic area.Photograph: suppliedAt least nine have been shot in the genital or pelvic area with birdshot or, in three cases, with high-calibre rifles. One woman, middle aged, has been shot in the groin, and has almost 200 metal balls distributed into her thighs and pelvic area. A 35-year-old man has similar injuries: birdshot scattered across his groin. According to the medical analysis commissioned by the Guardian, the injuries could cause “serious disfigurement” as well as “serious injuries to the genitals, perineum, rectum, and urinary bladder”. They conclude: “Bladder and bowel incontinence, sterility and impotence are possible long-term outcomes.”In nine of the patients, the high-calibre bullets are still embedded in the body and clearly visible in the scans. In another seven, the bullet is not visible, but ballistics and medical experts agree that the injuries shown – such as a femur bone shattered along a clear pathway, with metal fragments – are extremely likely to have been caused by a high-velocity bullet. The images showing projectiles have been analysed by two independent ballistics experts, who identify the bullets as full metal jacket rounds consistent with those fired from assault rifles such the AK-47 or KL-133 – weapons used by the IRGC. Full metal jacket bullets often do not deform on impact, holding a clear “bullet” shape. “These are lethal purpose weapons,” says ballistics expert NR Jenzen-Jones, director of Armament Research Services, who has assessed a subset of the images.In their review of the images, one of the medical analysts describes them as “the kind of injuries you would see in wartime: those are chest shots with a military weapon”. “If you’re firing those kind of weapons at people, you are trying to kill them.”Haar adds: “These are not the kind of little bullets that we usually see even in policing in the US. These are a whole different level of weapon.”View image in fullscreenA patient who appears to have been shot through the left femur, showing a pathway of shattered bone and metal fragments.Photograph: suppliedThe X-rays provide further evidence for a growing body of testimony from doctors on the ground treating those injuries, who say damage they have witnessed is catastrophic. Many report conducting dozens of surgeries to remove the eyes of those struck, including teenagers and children. One medic, Dr Ahmad*, whose identity and credentials have been verified by the Guardian, passes on comments from a surgery colleague who treated a very large number of penetrating eye injuries. His youngest patient was a 14-year-old girl, who was brought in by her parents and her brother. “Her face was covered in blood, and her younger brother was shaking uncontrollably,” he says. The parents say the family was at a demonstration when security forces began firing from the roof of a civilian building. “She was shot directly in the left eye [causing] devastating damage. The injury was so severe that the eye could not be saved and had to be surgically removed.”Ahmad says he has spoken to colleagues across the country who “report a recurring pattern of deliberate gunshot injuries targeting specific organs, most notably the eyes and heart, and less frequently the genital region. These injuries commonly involve penetrating eye trauma, globe rupture, severe intraocular bleeding, retinal damage, and permanent vision loss.” The pattern of injuries “strongly suggests an intent to cause permanent disability rather than unintended harm”, he says, and is “difficult to reconcile with random gunfire in chaotic environments and instead points toward deliberate targeting of vital and symbolically significant body parts”.Another doctor inside Iran, whose identity and medical credentials were verified by the Guardian, says those arriving in the emergency department ranged from grandparents to toddlers. “They came in with gunshots and also pellets in different locations on the body – to the chest, the abdomen, limbs, genitals … basically the entire body. Live ammunition wounds from pistols, AK47s,” he says. Among the older people was a grandmother in her mid-60s, brought in by her family. She had been caught in the violence when trying to pick up her granddaughter, and was shot at extremely close range by a pellet-loaded shotgun.“Pellet had spread all across her body,” the doctor says. Staff made two CPR attempts, but the woman died.“I am still trying to cope with it,” he says. “You can only witness so much.”*Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsIranRights and freedomProtestMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rights (Law)Human rights (Global development)featuresShareReuse this content"

She studied fashion and art design at North Kent College but has given up on only applying within this sector.“Not a day goes by when I don’t apply for at least a few jobs,” she says. “It does get pretty miserable after a certain amount of time, always doing the same thing, looking on the same websites, applying for similar jobs. It does get a little bit soul-crushing.”View image in fullscreenPoppy Blackman: ‘I can’t be picky.’Photograph: Courtesy of Poppy BlackmanBlackman’s story is an increasingly common one. Official figures show youth unemployment among 18 to 24-year-olds rose to afive-year high in the final three months of 2025. Strip out the Covid spike in 2020 and youth unemployment has hit an 11-year-high.On a wider net of 16 to 24-year-olds, youth unemployment is now higher than the EU average for the first time, rising to 16.1%, the highest level including the pandemic since 2014, when the jobs market was still recovering from the financial crisis.The EU average was 14.9% in the final quarter of 2025. The youth unemployment rate compares with an overall UK unemployment level of 5.2%.Former MP and minister Alan Milburn, chair of the government’s Young People and Work review, which is due to report in the summer, said the rise in youth unemployment posed an “existential” risk for the UK and could put “a generation on the scrapheap”.“This is not a short-term phenomenon, it’s a long-term one,” he told the BBC. “We’re seeing something dramatic changing in the labour markets.“Forty-five per cent of 24-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training have never had a job. If you haven’t had a job by 24, that entails a long-term scarring effect and you’re probably then stuck in a lifetime on benefits.”Ashwin Prasad, who runs the UK arm of Tesco, recently warned that the UK was“sleepwalking into a quiet epidemic”of joblessness, with millions of people out of work and on benefits.Some of this rise in joblessness is due to businesses looking to shore up costs in tougher times.Martin Beck, chief economist at WPI Strategy, said: “The economy has been sluggish for a long time and that tends to hit younger people first, because if you’re an employer and your demand is weak, you’re probably going to freeze recruitment. You’re not going to open up as many entry-level roles.”Economists say that while there are a number of issues contributing to the rise in young people being out of work, one big factor has been rising costs for employers.‘You hear back from maybe 10% of applications and usually it’s automated’Oxford graduate Jack, 21In herfirst budget after Labour returned to powerin 2024, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, increased the rate of employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) from 13.8% to 15% from last April. The threshold for NICs being levied was also cut from £9,100 to £5,000 a year.The national minimum wage has also risen every year since 2019, rising by 6.7% in 2025 and by 4.1% in April 2026.From April, the combined cost of employing someone age 21 and over will have risen by 15% since 2024, according to the Centre for Policy Studies, or £3,414. For 18 to 20-year-olds, the increase is 26%, or £4,095.TheEmployment Rights Acthas also added to costs for employers, with significant new rights for workers on sick pay, parental leave and zero-hours contracts.Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, an investment bank, said: “The ‘national living wage’ is probably the most significant factor over the last decade in terms of its impact on youth unemployment.“But if you then layer on top of that the employer national insurance changes, plus the Employment Rights Act, on top of pensions auto-enrolment – that is a lot to absorb.“We’ve had these incremental costs being burdened on employers as if it is just a free lunch. Well, I think we’re finding, it’s not a free lunch.”It has all left young people facing a brutal jobs market. Jack, 21, lives in London and graduated from Oxford University last summer with a first in history.He has since applied for more than 100 jobs, graduate schemes and internships and – despite landing his first internship, which started in January and runs for three months – he is now on the job hunt again.He says the application process is gruelling, made harder because of the prevalent use of technology in hiring.“You hear back from maybe 10% of applications and usually it’s automated, so you don’t even know what you’re doing wrong,” he says. “I’ve spoken to one human out of all those applications. I’ve even been interviewed by chatbots.”He feels trapped in what he describes as a catch-22. “Entry-level roles want you to already have a foot in the door. The roles in which you begin your career require you to have already been in roles in which you begin your career. It’s a classic case of the chicken and the egg,” he says. “I feel pretty drained and fed up.”Many graduates also say they are worried about companies using artificial intelligence to replace jobs. However, Jake Finney, senior economist at PwC, said its youth employment index for 2025 found AI was not a big factor.“We didn’t really find much of an impact at the economy-wide level, because ultimately, young people are concentrated in industries like retail and hospitality and these are not the sectors that have been hit by AI so far.“But if you look at the IT sector, which is obviously the sector that’s been most impacted by AI and automation so far, we’ve found that adult employment has been relatively stable, whereas youth employment has dropped by around a fifth.”Jonathan Townsend, UK chief executive of The King’s Trust, which helps young people find work, said: “More young people are coming to us eager to work but feeling locked out of opportunities.“This generation has faced a uniquely difficult start to working life. Many had their education and early work experiences disrupted by the pandemic, leaving gaps in skills, confidence and networks that are crucial for getting a first job.”View image in fullscreenSaalim Elhaj no longer sees himself pursuing a career in architecture.Photograph: Courtesy of Saalim ElhajSaalim Elhaj, 23, has decided to learn new skills to find a job. He graduated with an architecture degree in Manchester in June 2025. He moved to Southampton to be with his girlfriend and has mostly been unemployed apart from days labouring on construction sites. He no longer sees himself pursuing a career in architecture.“Even before finishing my course, I was quite disillusioned by the whole profession, but mostly by the economy,” he says.“I could see it wasn’t going to get any better. There weren’t many jobs for recent graduates. Even the year before I graduated, I could see it was stagnating. I was really confused about what I’m supposed to be doing in this economy.”After contacting some architecture companies and seeing how few jobs there were for recent graduates, he decided to expand his skillset and get experience in construction.He is now hoping he can do an apprenticeship in timber framing, a traditional method of building using heavy timber – if he can find someone to take him on. In the meantime, he regularly travels to London to volunteer with a timber framer so he can learn as much as he can.“It’s really bizarre, doing a university degree and now thinking about an apprenticeship, but everything is very uncertain and I really want to learn a skill.”Julie Leonard, chief impact officer at Shaw Trust, a national employment charity, said: “This generation has had a raw deal. They’ve faced a pandemic during the time when vital skills for the workplace are gained, and are starting their working lives during unprecedented social and technological change.”Explore more on these topicsYouth unemploymentUnemploymentYoung peopleJob huntingWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

Bram Stoker’s classic story of elemental evil knows the answer to that question. Dracula, the Ur-vampire and ultimate outsider of the literary canon, is played by Erivo, along with every other character in this deliciously wicked tale of the blood-sucking count.Except it’s not deliciously wicked in adapter-director Kip Williams’ stage reinvention. Williams has proven himself a Midas-touched spinner of old stories to new. His one-woman version of The Picture of Dorian Gray was deliriously original. His take on Jean Genet’s The Maids was punk inspired. What has happened here?In look, Erivo makes a magnificent modern Dracula with her piercings and tattoos, first appearing on stage in vest and trousers, all sharp angles and sinews. She has the long, pointed nails for it too, reminiscent of the thin, knife-like fingers ofFW Murnau’s Nosferatu.View image in fullscreenNails like Nosferatu … Erivo in Dracula.Photograph: Daniel BoudA team of camera operators transpose what is happening on stage to a gigantic screen. The live images are merged with pre-recorded footage. This use of technology has been utilised innumerable times on the West End stage, by Williams as well as others, but seems ill-suited to the horror genre, distancing us from the dread.Erivo appears ever smaller and more vulnerable on stage and your eye is drawn away from her, to the screen closeups. Sometimes images are superimposed on each other and look hallucinatory. It shows off what technology can do but the action itself is overwhelmingly static.That is because the story is narrated by Erivo, with only snippets in dialogue, which gives the sense of an audiobook accompanied by screen illustrations. It comprises mostly diary entries from journals and preserves the epistolary form of the book. Why, when it serves no dramatic purpose other than to remind us of the story’s original form?Erivo narrates swiftly, with accents differentiating characters along with a quick changing of wigs and clothes. So a pink-red wig and African inflected accent for count Dracula, a pin-striped shirt and clipped British accent for Jonathan Harker, the solicitor who becomes imprisoned in his castle, a high innocent voice for Harker’s fiancee, Mina, a blond wig for her friend Lucy, who falls victim to Dracula. But despite the speed, the atmosphere stays sedate, with none of the fever required, and no peril whatsoever. And characters seem so simplistic that they verge on the comical. Most ludicrous of all is vampire-slayer, Van Helsing, who looks like a gothic version of Gandalf with long white locks and weird goatee. Erivo’s feat of narration also seems to distract her from the actual acting, too neutral in her physical and facial expressions.View image in fullscreenChocolate box seduction … Erivo in Dracula.Photograph: Daniel BoudThe production seeks to focus on the battle between fear and desire in the story but there is neither chill nor heat here. Dracula brings no threat, even as he begins his blood-sucking in Whitby. There is no diabolicism or dark charisma in the repeated flashes of Dracula’s fangs. His three sharp-toothed vampire-women do not bring a sense of seduction either. A giant love heart appears on stage at one point, more chocolate-box than sexually suggestive. A snow scene is more atmospheric, but there is an abounding sterility in the storytelling which undercuts the building of emotional or atmospheric momentum.This is, for many, seen as a cautionary tale of the dangerous outsider-immigrant. Dracula travels to British shores and is likened to plague-like vermin by Stoker. This is not unpicked at all here, despite its current, real-world relevance.Erivo gives us a tantalising taste of her singing voice towards the end and it raises your hopes but is aborted into a few – exquisitely sung – lines rather than a song. It’s sad that the production plays so little of Erivo’s strengths, which might better have been reconceived as Dracula the Musical.AtNoël Coward theatre, London, until 30 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreCynthia ErivoBram StokerreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s sadly lacking in the granular detail that would really put his actions under the microscopeJack SealeTue 17 Feb 2026 17.30 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleEpisode one of Michael Waldman’s new three-part biography bears the subtitle “Who Are You?”. As well as the normal business of harvesting archive clips and interviewing his subject’s colleagues and rivals to build a picture of past events, Waldman has gained interviews withTony Blair, his wife, Cherie, and several of their children in an effort to capture the character of the politician who was re-elected twice as British prime minister. The question is: what sort of man is Blair?It is an approach that many political film-makers find impossible to resist. Detailed factual arguments can get boring, and overarching theses about the power structures that lift politicians into place would take too long to explain. But a narrative based on an individual’s psychology, where major events happen because a personality has imposed itself on the world? That is a source of readily relatable drama.View image in fullscreenDirector Michael Waldman interviewing Cherie Blair.Photograph: 72 FilmsSo, we go back to Blair’s childhood, where a contemporary of his at the Edinburgh private school Fettes College reports that “the school teaches you to survive – it knocks a lot of the emotion out of you”. While he was at school, his father suffered a stroke, which scuppered the old man’s dream of expanding his political activities far beyond the local Conservative party. Then, when Blair was reading law and finding religion at Oxford in the 1970s, a close friend died by suicide – interviewed here, a fellow student says Blair returned for the next new term with his long hair cut short and his cheery counter-culture leanings replaced by a steely drive to achieve.Blair took up politics in the early 1980s and vowed not just to become a Labour MP, but to lead profound reform of the party. Waldman gets the goss on how Blair repeatedly overtook those who seemed to have superior experience: he became an MP instead of his more politically engaged wife, Cherie, who didn’t mind, and then became the leader of Labour instead of his more established ally, Gordon Brown, who did.As well as sketching out the one-on-one battles that the ruthless Blair always won, Waldman asks about the eerily accurate premonition Blair apparently had in 1994 that the then Labour leader, John Smith, was about to die of a heart attack; he also quizzes all the Blairs on whether they felt the weight of the responsibility they bore as they moved into 10 Downing Street after Blair’s general election win in 1997. Blair reflects that, yes, it was hard to enjoy his first days in power, because of the gravity of the task, and because his mother, who had died as he was graduating from Oxford in 1975, was not around to witness his achievement.Such emotions would be keenly felt by the human being having those experiences but, in the context of Blair as one of the leading political figures of the age, they take up time that could be spent on wider questions. You cannot become prime minister without a lot of powerful people agreeing that you should, regardless of how able and persuasive you are and what traumas underlie your ambition. But The Tony Blair Story often seems to be reporting from a world where this is not the case. Aside from a comment hinting at Blair being chosen by a pre-existing group of “modernisers” within Labour – the person making this recollection being none other than Peter Mandelson – and a section looking critically at the meeting Blair felt it necessary to hold with Rupert Murdoch in 1995, it’s all Tony, doing it for himself. With no discussion of what interests his social and economic policies were serving – that he changed Britain for the better is vaguely assumed – we focus on Northern Ireland and Kosovo, which are presented as triumphs of Blair’s unique character.View image in fullscreenMichael Waldman interviewing Tony Blair.Photograph: 72 FilmsAll this is building towards the pivotal second episode, a feature-length critique of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In Waldman’s telling, Blair developed a messiah complex, believing not just that he could solve discrete problems but that he could win a grand battle of good over evil: under the febrile pressure of the post-9/11 “war on terror”, he tragically overreached. In its desire to psychoanalyse, the programme blurs a crucial distinction – between Blair thinking it was right to depose Saddam simply because the Iraqi dictator was a bad guy and him believing that the facts provided a robust justification for the war. It ends up bolstering Blair’s position that he did what he sincerely believed to be right: the Chilcot inquiry has shown that a rigorous examination of the factsthrows significant doubt onwhether he genuinely thought the prospectus for war he presented was an honest one, but such granular analysis is not Waldman’s style.We do see here that Blair had the conviction to reshape political territory rather than fret about what the existing lay of the land would allow, making him fundamentally prime-ministerial in a way that none of his successors have been. But The Tony Blair Story finds the Blair cult of personality a little too alluring.The Tony Blair Story is available on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTony BlairTV reviewTelevisionDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The image nods to the cover of her latest studio release, 2025’s score-settlingAm I the Drama?, in which the birds surround the rapper behind a storm-laced sky ready to burst. The reference is intentional: crows are whip-smart, cunning and capable of clinging to deeply held grudges for decades. Cardi’s arrival on stage tonight further underscores the ominous feeling; she appears with a long shadow behind her as a slice of album opener Dead plays: “I’m collecting body bags like they purses / I don’t even rap no more, I drive hearses.”She emerges in a haute couture trench coat resembling battle armor and with a shock of white in her dark hair, like Cruella de Vil if she’d grown up in the Bronx. Cardi then launches into the braggadocious Hello with pyrotechnics and smoke effects, the message clear: when someone crosses her, she doesn’t just want to embarrass them. She wants them in the ground.Cardi B: Am I the Drama? review – vigorous score-settling and brutally witty put-downsRead moreOn Am I the Drama? Cardi is at her most incisive when she’s ripping into an enemy. On the aptly named Pretty & Petty, she focuses her ire on the rapper Bia, who dissed Cardi on a 2024 track by brutally snarling: “Name five Bia songs, gun pointin’ to your head / Bow, I’m dead.” Similarly, the highest points of the musician’s ambitious LA show also revolve around snarling back at haters with expressive aplomb as she blitzes through three dozen songs in just under two hours.Cardi begins the six-act concert with a series of brutal numbers, including the ferocious Magnet, her vocals seething as she dials into a nemesis she deems “trash since birth”. An ode to the rare people with integrity, Salute, follows, where she clutches a fake rifle from below the stage, firing off sparks into the sky. After the menacing double hook of Check Please and Trophies, Cardi appears almost taken aback by her own savagery. She playfully proclaims to the crowd: “We started very motherfucking violent!”For the show’s second act, Cardi turns her focus to the lovers who scorned her. A poignant rendition of Ring, a plaintive duet withKehlaniabout trying to understand why someone stopped calling, is performed supine on the floor and trapped in a birdcage suspended from the ceiling. Dancers act out scornful scenes of suspected cheating, most viscerally with Thru Your Phone, a 2018 track that details catching a paramour whose lies were undone by technology.At the Super Bowl, Bad Bunny challenged the meaning of ‘America’Read moreBesides gleeful revenge, Cardi’s calling card is rampant horniness, and she romps through raunchy numbers including her remix of Blueface’s Thotiana, employing a chair for a seductive dance routine. Her timing was a little off here: at her Las Vegas show two days prior, she briefly fell off the chair during this number andcheekily blamed“the government” for the error – suggesting that she’s still got some kinks to smooth out in the show, particularly during the more tamped-down energy of tonight’s fourth act when she seemed a little winded. But the crowd is with her throughout the spectacle, bellowing the words and grinding during the final two acts, when Cardi unleashes her most high-octane hits and choreography where she sizzles on a revolving carousel resembling a strip club.The most stirring moments of the show nodded to Cardi’s Latin roots, with an act featuring her boogaloo trap hit I Like It and the breakneck-speed Bodega Baddie. In the latter, a defiantly merengue-steeped ode to her lineage, she salsa dances as her dancers hoist flags of Latin American countries high onstage. It’s a pointed touch for Cardi B, who made acrackabout her fans “jumping” ICE at the tour’s opener last week. Her message was clear: let them eat crow.Explore more on these topicsCardi BHip-hopRapPop and rockLos Angeleslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

He came on the set – this icon – and we got talking, about London. He started telling me about Michael Caine and all these cockney phrases that Michael must have told him. We’re getting on all right – and then all of a sudden, he gets a bit annoyed. It got to a point where I didn’t really understand what was going on, as we’d been having a good time. It turned out he was nervous. He was as nervous as Cynthia Erivo was, whose first ever film role it was. And I was gobsmacked – he’s been doing this for I don’t know how long, back to the 1960s, and then I realised that, for him, it’s brand new every time.That’s a sign of a great artist: he doesn’t rely on what he’s done before he’s going into it. He was a veteran, a legend, and yet he was nervous. And then, you know, we got into the groove and then it was fine. It’s just like what I imagine a football player goes through: you’re thinking about the match, getting wound up, and once you’re on the field, well, it’s, let’s get on with it. And that was Robert. Once the engines were warmed up, he was away.There were some great stories from the set. We had a scene with Elizabeth Debicki where she gets shot by him, and she falls on top of him. We had to hold the shot at that point, with them in position. He’s holding her up, they are like face to face – and then he starts to sing “Getting to know you, getting to know all about you” from The King and I. Amazing.View image in fullscreen‘No fool’ … Robert Duvall in The Godfather.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyAnother time his wife came in, lovely lady. We were shooting in the kitchen area of a very big building and she sets herself up in a corner. She has a briefcase with her and I’m thinking, what’s going on here? She opens up this briefcase, it’s almost like a spy movie, and then she gets out a telephone headpiece with a microphone and starts talking into it. I realised Bob had an earpiece and she’s reading him his lines – they’re doing a Brando! That made me laugh.What was so great about him as an actor is that, basically, he’s on the surface. Everything is on the surface so it can be manipulated in the scene to get the best out of it. He puts everything out there, for the film. That’s the thing about Bob: he was a proper artist. He’s willing to go there. If you watch The Apostle, the movie he wrote and directed, you can see how he can conjure things up. The congregation in the movie are with him because he can stir the pot in the way that the character does. He could do that because he’s a great actor, and not everyone’s a great actor.I think what made him what he was, was that in the telling of any story he was the rock. He brought gravity. Everything would have flown away if he wasn’t pulling it together. He was so skilled; without him, there is no Pacino, there’s no De Niro. You need those rocks. And don’t forget who his father was, a rear admiral in the US navy. He brought that military stuff with him: he knew that guy inApocalypse Now. And now we know that guy too. Robert was no fool.Look at his range: an actor, writer, director. He bet on himself. When he said he wasn’t going to do Godfather III, he knew himself. He wrote the songs in Tender Mercies. He did a tango movie. He had autonomy as an artist. And that’s the thing about Duvall. He always bet on himself. And because of that he died happy.Explore more on these topicsFilmRobert DuvallThe GodfatherWidowsApocalypse NowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is that OK now?Lucy Pasha-RobinsonMany women reading this will have experienced something similar: a warning that sharing public space isn’t a man’s job, it’s a woman’sTue 17 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 17.52 ESTShareWhat motivates a stranger to push a woman in public? That’s a question I’ve been stuck on this week after a man shoved me out of his way on an empty pedestrian street. I didn’t even see him coming – well, I wouldn’t have, as he came up from behind me.I had walked in his path, he barked at me. “What path?” I thought, baffled, as I took in the huge expanse of empty pavement around us. I was so stupefied by the encounter that I found myself frozen to the spot, watching him walk away in his blue anorak and technical rucksack. He could have been any man from anywhere on his way to work.As far as street harassment goes, many will have suffered far, far worse. But what made the incident uniquely disturbing was that it was the third similar encounter in as many months. In December, a man verbally harassed me on the tube as I went down an escalator – for walking “too slowly” this time.Last week, I was peering into a restaurant when I collided head-first with a man walking towards me. The pavement was empty and four metres wide. Why hadn’themoved out of the way? I asked him. Because I should have been looking where I was going, he told me.Perhaps I am a slow meanderer of the worst type and the story here is how unaware we have become in public spaces. Who doesn’t find other people annoying? Especially oblivious ones. “Am I oblivious?” I asked my husband. “No,” he told me, “but so what if you were?” He was right. Why, when someone bumps into me, is my reaction to say sorry, or move aside? Why was it the reaction of three men to shout or walk into me, to push me?I spoke to some women in my life about what had happened, and many shared similar experiences. A colleague tells me a story that is eerily similar to mine. A man barged past her from behind on an empty street – only she had the chutzpah to chase after him in a rage.Another colleaguewon’t run any moreafter a man tried to hit her with his lorry.Another was told she needed to “shut the fuck up” because she was supposedly talking too loudly in a pub with friends.Female black and brown friends describe experiencing casual racism on a scale they’ve never encountered before.A tall friend says she gets shouted at all the time. A small friend says she has never been harassed as much in her life as she was this summer.A man screamed “CUNT” in the face of an older friend.And I can bet almost every woman reading this will have had a similar experience. Of men wanting to teach them a lesson – that sharing public space isn’t a man’s job, it’s a woman’s.Somewhere along the way, the handbrake has come off. Feelings that were once contained now seem to be spilling over. After each encounter, I was left with a gnawing feeling disproportionate to the event itself, an overwhelming sense that something deeply sinister had happened. What thoughts do these men have about women if this is the stuff they are saying out loud? How do they treat the women in their lives if they are so angry they are capable of pushing a woman at 10.30am on a Friday?“Don’t let that prick ruin your day,” a woman said, after the incident. She appeared – and it is always a woman – like an angel to offer support and solidarity. But it did ruin my day. I walked around feeling heavy, ruminating on how anyone could behave like that, how he could break the social contract so completely.And the next time I go out alone, on a weekday morning, I assume the brace position. I feel the threat of violence just under the surface. I carry suspicion with me. I wonder what my next encounter with a stranger will look like.Lucy Pasha-Robinson is a Guardian assistant Opinion editorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why do I feel betrayed?Polly HudsonI’m a fan of the comedian and her decision initially made me feel like a haggard loser. But famous women are not obliged to act according to other people’s wishesTue 17 Feb 2026 11.41 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 12.44 ESTShareKatherine Ryan’s podcast is called Telling Everybody Everything, and she does. The comedian is honest to a fault: her comments are regularly reported out of context to create clickbait news stories that give people the wrong idea of what she meant and of her as a human, but she doesn’t stop. Her commitment to truth, especially in the celebrity world she inhabits, is as unusual as it is admirable. Topics others lie about – by omission or openly – she fronts up to as a default setting. Such ascosmetic surgery.On her most recent podcast episode, she confirmed that the operation she told listeners she’d had in December – not revealing the details because it could potentially become a work project – was a full facelift.Ryanis 42. (Side note: does this mean it won’t be a TV show? If so, big mistake. Huge.)It’s probably unnecessary to clarify that I’m a fan. I love her sharp wit and intelligence, but also her spirit, her boldness, her way of moving through the world. This USP of telling everybody everything means that the parasocial relationship between Ryan and me is thriving. I believe not only that I know her – and her family – but that we’re friends, with much in common. That’s why this news has cut so deep, no pun intended.I applaud her openness, especially when her peers insist that their youthful glow is down to drinking water, sleep, or using the miracle cream they happen to be promoting. But Ryan having a facelift at 42 is making me feel weird. Judged. Oddly … betrayed. Even though I am certain this wasn’t her intention.I’m eight years older than her, and trying toaccept ageinginstead of being ashamed of it. Someone in their early 40s having £16,000-worth of work done makes it seem as if it’s not OK for gravity to take its devastating toll on me. As though I’m a bit of a haggard loser. Sticking two fingers up to misogynistic societal pressure by defiantly getting older –on our own terms, perhaps with the odd non-drastic tweakment en route to soften the blow – felt like the kind of stand my mate Katherine and I might have made together. Now I’m on my own.The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons has added fuel to this fire by reporting an8% increase infacelifts in 2024 in the UK, while a survey by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found that patients were getting increasingly younger. A paranoia-inducing26%-32% of faceliftsare now performed on those aged 35-55, the survey found.She didn’t have a facelift for me. She didn’t ask anybody to form this vaguely creepy attachment to her – that was all meRyan’s justification for her decision – which, needless to say, she did not have to provide – was compelling: “I use my face for work. And it’s important that I recognise myself in the mirror as the woman that I feel like. And it’s important, I think, for my marriage that Bobby and I, we both get to enjoy the kids. I think that we should both have the same amount of physical damage.”I confessed a deplorable secret about motherhood to a friend – and it changed my life | Polly HudsonRead moreRyan has been pregnant six times in five years. She told everyone everything about the baby losses she has endured, too. “Bobby’s still a hunk,” she continued. “And my face has gotten fat and thin and fat and thin and fat and thin … almost metaphorically, I needed to do something to reclaim my identity, to reclaim my autonomy, to claw back the face that I had in 2019.” Ryan gave a nod to those “who want to age totally naturally with zero intervention. God bless you, do that. I got a facelift for you. I didn’t do it for me. This was a selfless act.”She’s joking, but as always, there is truth within. She didn’t have a facelift for me, and she wasn’t going tonothave one for me, either. She didn’t ask anybody to form this vaguely creepy attachment to her – that was all me. We may convince ourselves of the opposite, but the famous women we enjoy have no obligation to us. It’s not their duty to set standards, or be positive role models: they owe us nothing. Her face, and body, are her business.As a homage, a moment of radical honesty. I do not currently have a spare 16 grand kicking about to spend on my appearance. Can I be sure that I’d be taking this worthy moral stance if money were no object? Hand on heart, would I have a facelift if I had Katherine Ryan’s bank balance?

Under Keir Starmer, the group’s anointed torchbearer, Labour had a double-digit lead in the polls. Morgan McSweeney, the man who built Labour Together, was preparing Starmer for government with great hopes ofcleaning up politics. Now McSweeney is out of a job, Labour Together ismired in controversyand Starmer faces urgent questions about what he knew and when.Stories began appearing about Labour Together’s funding around November 2023. The most damaging, in a detailed report by Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, showed how, between 2017 and 2020, McSweeney hadfailed to declare £730,000in political donations to the organisation. The group attributed this to administrative error.But the story didn’t end there. Earlier this month Khadija Sharife and Irevealed on Democracy for Salethat Labour Together, when it was led by now government minister Josh Simons in 2023, hired a PR firm calledAPCO Worldwideto investigate the “sourcing, funding and origins” of the story and to dig dirt on journalists at the Sunday Times and elsewhere who were reporting its undeclared funding. APCO was paid £36,000 to dig up this dirt. The work was led by former Sunday Times journalist Tom Harper, who suggested, without evidence, that the journalists’ reporting may have originated in a leak orchestrated by Russia or China. Labour Together did not keep these insinuations to itself. It passed some of APCO’s material to the security services, raising serious questions about whether public authorities were drawn into an effort to discredit legitimate journalism.After closing ranks and apparently hoping that the story would go away, now Labour has been forced to respond. Starmer says that APCO’s work for Labour Together “absolutely needs to be looked into”. Simons, meanwhile,has said: “I was surprised and shocked to read the report extended beyond the contract by including unnecessary information on Gabriel Pogrund. I asked for this information to be removed before passing the report to GCHQ.” The Cabinet Office has reportedly launched aninformal inquiry. Excuse my scepticism, but this all looks a lot like marking your own homework. How can the Cabinet Office investigate Labour Together hiring a PR firm to smear journalists when the person who commissioned the work, Simons, is himself a Cabinet Office minister in Starmer’s government?When pressed, science secretary Liz Kendall pointed out that the “relevant regulatory body” – the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) – was also looking into the issue. But this is a nonsense. The PRCA will be looking into APCO, notLabourTogether – and it is a voluntary industry association, not a statutory regulator. When it comes to PR firms and private intelligence contractors, meaningful oversight barely exists.This scandal cuts to the heart of No 10. As we revealed on Democracy for Sale at the weekend, when APCO was hired, its London office was run by Kate Forrester, a Labour Together adviser whose husband was Starmer’s head of communications at the time. (Paul Ovenden was later forced to resignfrom government after offensive messages he had sent about Diane Abbott emerged.)We know that Starmer’s right-hand man McSweeneywas awareof APCO’s work; and that Starmer himself took a keen interest in journalists and media coverage during his ascent to power. Given all this, the prime minister’s claims on Monday that he “didn’t know anything” seem increasingly hard to square with the public record.The journalists targeted by APCO were not simply writing negative stories. They were uncovering a crucial and largely unnoticed fact about Starmer’s rise: that his leadership campaign had benefited from hundreds of thousands of pounds in undeclared funding. This money mattered. It paid for detailed polling and analysis of Labour members during the final years of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. McSweeney used this data to construct Starmer as the candidate best positioned to win. Had Labour Together’s funders – including businessman Trevor Chinn and hedge fund manager Martin Taylor – been publicly known at the time, the campaign’s carefully cultivated image of Labour unity could easily have fractured.Senior figures now in government, including cabinet ministers such as Steve Reed and Lisa Nandy, were involved in Labour Together at the time. The Electoral Commission eventuallyfined the organisation £14,250for multiple breaches of election law. But, in part because of APCO’s well-paid efforts to smear and discredit journalists, the story never fully broke through. Labour Together used the firm’s material to suggest it had been the victim of a Kremlin hack, successfully shifting attention away from its own conduct.This episode raises broader questions. London is the global centre of the private intelligence industry, worth areported £15bn a year. Its activities remain almost entirely opaque. APCO’s work for Labour Together only became public because of a rare leak. Without it, we would know nothing.How many other journalists have been targeted like this? How many political organisations have quietly hired private intelligence and PR firms to dig dirt on critics, identify sources and shape narratives? As Jon Cruddas, a co-founder of Labour Together,put it to me: “This is dark shit.”WhenStarmer came to power promising to clean up politics, he wrote in the Guardian that journalism is “the lifeblood of democracy”. But we now know that the vehicle that powered his rise, populated by his key people, ran an orchestrated campaign to smear journalists. Simons – the person who commissioned APCO – is still a minister in Starmer’s government.Simons’ position is surely untenable now. But Starmer needs to go further than just dismissing a single minister. Either he commissions an independent inquiry now – and answers urgent questions about what he himself knew, and when, about this tawdry affair – or he too becomes implicated in what will be seen as a continued, and increasingly unsustainable, cover-up. So everyone – and particularly all of us journalists – will learn much from what he decides to do next.Peter Geoghegan runs the investigative websiteDemocracy for SaleDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Politics must respond to this disenchantmentTue 17 Feb 2026 05.03 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 08.08 ESTShareYou can feel Labour’s electoral coalition fraying in the cold, rain-soaked streets of south-east Manchester. With nine days to go now until the historicbyelection in Gorton and Denton, one thing unites these otherwise diverse communities: a visceral contempt for the prime minister.Mention Keir Starmer’s name and people laugh: not with affection but disbelief, as though it’s faintly absurd to treat him as a serious topic of conversation. “He just doesn’t stick to his word,” says a middle-aged woman walking her dog, stressing that her real feelings would be impolite to print.And it is hard to argue with her, not least as Starmer’s government reels again afteryet another head-spinning, chaotic U-turn– this time forced upon him by Nigel Farage and Reform. A plan to delay local elections abandoned in humiliating fashion, not because the PM realised it was the wrong thing to do, but because Farage raised a legal challenge and Starmer knew he would lose it.“He says he’s going to do something and then doesn’t,” the dog walker says. Her view is widely shared:according to YouGov, six in 10 Britons believe Starmer is untrustworthy, with just two in 10 believing the opposite.These are the fruits of a political project crafted by Morgan McSweeney,Starmer’s recently departed chief of staff. It was smart politics, he clearly believed, to mislead the Labour membership into voting for him six years ago by offering leftwing policy pledges and then abandoning them. But the founding sin became the defining trait: voters routinely perceive this government to be innately deceitful and duplicitous.Walk the streets of Gorton and Denton now and the resulting draining of trust is easily discernible. Labourtook half the votehere in 2024. Now its coalition is splintering in two directions at once: towards Zack Polanski’s Greens on the populist left, and Nigel Farage’s Reform UK on the Trumpian nationalist right.Commentators like to divide the constituency neatly in two: younger, more diverse Gorton; older, whiter, more working-class Denton. There are certainly an astonishing number ofGreen partyposters and garden stakes in Gorton, while union jacks are more visible in Denton.People don’t always fit into neat boxes, though. An older woman in Denton voices her grievances about “illegal migrants” taking jobs and then tells me she’s voting for the Green candidate,local plumber Hannah Spencer. A white man in his 70s uses his thick Mancunian accent to denounce Rachel Reeves for what he sees as a vendetta against pensioners – and says he too will back the leftwing insurgents.View image in fullscreenReform UK’s byelection candidate, Matt Goodwin, speaks at hustings at St Peter’s church in Levenshulme, 12 February 2026.Photograph: Mark Waugh/The GuardianSpencer is bullish about Denton. Reform tend to “assume that white working-class communities all think and act in one and the same way,” she says, “and that we don’t care about each other. I think they’ve really, really underestimated how much people actually do care about having a place for everyone to live.”Yet while the constituency is saturated with anger and disillusionment, that anger expresses itself in very different ways. For those drifting to Reform’s candidate,Matt Goodwin, immigration is almost always the first grievance voiced. A middle-aged woman is voting for Reform because “Britain seems full with immigrants at the moment, and there’s not enough houses”. Her three sons, she complains, cannot even get on the council-house waiting list.Here is how rightwing populism feeds on the wreckage of a broken economic model. People are left feeling trapped in a zero-sum game: if only there were fewer foreigners, there would be more homes, more jobs, more security for them. But tens of thousands are trapped on council-house waiting lists because thestock has been flogged offand not replaced. She notes, entirely reasonably, that flats are going up “everywhere you look in Manchester”, but assumes they are for refugees – when the real problem is that expensive flats are being built that local people cannot afford.Whether the Greens can defeat the rightwing populist answer to popular grievances depends on a mostly youthful army of activists. The party claims it knocked on 11,000 doors on Saturday alone – roughly a quarter of households here. But its rise has been sudden; it has little historic infrastructure in the seat and is building from nearly scratch. “The main thing is that nobody is voting Labour,” says longtime resident and activistAlly Fogg. “It’s become almost impossible to find a Labour voter anywhere.”It is certainly a struggle to findLabourvoters here. I do find one party loyalist, who argues the media hold Starmer to a harsher standard than they did his Conservative predecessors. Even he, however, is wavering: he will decide on polling day which candidate is best placed to stop Reform.Labour remains bullish about its prospects, although this byelection upends normal expectations management. Normally, you do down your chances to motivate your voters, but if you’re competing with another progressive party, a different calculation applies. If its vote has not collapsed, then it will be down to a new “shy Labour voter” – that is, like Tory supporters before them, a reluctance to admit your voting intentions because of the stigma attached.What is undeniable is that even the party’s remaining grassroots struggles to articulate a coherent purpose. A cheerful canvasser from Bradford tells me “equality” is a core Labour value. When I ask which policies embody that, she falters.Party briefings insist support is holding among local Muslim voters, despite fury over British complicity in Israel’s war in Gaza. Leftwing activist Farrukh Haroon dismisses that claim out of hand. “Their vote has tanked,” he says. Labour treated Muslim communities as “voting fodder” and “colonial subjects” – but, he argues, “that has been broken.”What should really frighten anyone invested in the future of democracy is the level of angry disengagement on display here. Some of those I spoke to made clear they had given up on voting: that they now had a solidified contempt towards any politicians. These are citizens that the Greens’ brand of populism has yet to convince.After so many years of living standards and public services in crisis, the hope that sustained so many people has shrivelled. There is frustration, some apathy, but most obviously despair – and if that despair hardens, it could carry this country into far darker territory. Once trust has been eroded, as is evident here, no one can be sure what happens next.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsByelectionsOpinionLocal politicsManchesterLabourReform UKGreen partyGreater ManchestercommentShareReuse this content"

The 1980 landslide election of Ronald Reagan, who clinched the presidency with a whopping 489 electoral college votes against Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, swiftly pulled the Democratic party to the right in the political and cultural wave of the “Reagan Revolution”.For those Democratic constituents left behind, however, a challenge was mounting, mostly within US industrial cities whose economies were ransacked by Reagan’s “trickle-down” economics. Recordtax cutsfor the wealthy had come at the expense of a contracted social safety net, thus exacerbating inequality and collapsing much of the working class into the poor. Grassroots resistance campaigns spawned across the country in response to this dire urban crisis that had disproportionately devastated African Americans, and between 1982 and 1984 they had registered 2 million new Black voters – the largest gain in registered Black voters since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader, dies aged 84Read moreThese hands-on voter registration drives were orchestrated much in part by RevJesse Jackson, the nationally known civil rights activist whodiedon Tuesday. Jackson had cut his teeth as one of Martin Luther King Jr’s youngest and most charismatic lieutenants in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and throughout thecivil rights movement. By the 1970s, in the wake of King’s assassination, Jackson had transferred the movement’s master-classes in strategic organizing into founding Operation Push, a populist leftist offshoot of the SCLC that coalesced progressive whites, LGBTQ+ communities, environmentalists, Asian Americans, Indigenous Nations, Latinos, anti-war activists and labor unions. Jackson led discussions with leadership across the country about the prospect for a national Black-backed progressive movement that could map a viable path to a Democratic nomination for president.Like many African Americans, Jackson felt utterly betrayed by much of the Democratic party’s abandonment of socially progressive issues, democratic socialist economics and capitulation to Reagan’s unchecked far-right neocon policies, which openly set out to undo the social and legislative gains of the civil rights movement. With a bloc of 2 million new voters, however, Jackson, who earned a reputation as Washington DC’s “shadow senator”, also knew that Black communities held the margin of victory for democratic primaries in their hands. He knew that that power could not be given away to white Democratic candidates who often made an about-face into center-right politics in their general races.View image in fullscreenJesse Jackson during his second campaign for US president in 1988.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianJackson gathered a group of Black political strategists including Walter Fauntroy, a DC congressman and founding member of the Congressional Black caucus; Rev Joseph Lowery, famed civil rights leader and SCLC co-founder; and professor Ron Walters, the noted University of Maryland political scientist to assemble the “People’s Platform”, a bulleted mandate of reforms that called for increased corporate taxes, decreased military spending, single-payer universal healthcare and fair wage policies.The People’s Platform did more than identify the vision for Jackson’s National Rainbow Coalition of leftist populists. For Walters, who would go on to serve as Jackson’s chief campaign adviser, it was a tactical political yardstick by which Democratic candidates could be measured in order to garner Black support. The platform strategy, which Walters explained as “dependent leverage”, set out to force white liberals into picking up the Black-backed political platform instead of putting Black support behind whiteDemocratsand hoping to get Black demands heard.By the fall of 1983, however, Jackson knew that dependent leverage fell short of the more immediate political force ofindependentleverage, which didn’t rely on awaiting concessions, but rather withheld Black support by running Black candidates who challenged white Democrats’ strongholds in the primaries. It was Jackson’s acute insight into the efficacy of independent leverage as a movement strategy that birthed his historic 1984 presidential bid.On 3 November 1983, he gathered his “rainbow” of diverse supporters into a Washington DC convention center and announced his run, becoming the first major Black candidate for president and only the second since the small, grassroots run in 1972 of Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who joined him on stage. The announcement was riding a lightning rod of Black political momentum.That same month, as a result of the Voting Rights Act of 1982, which protected the rights of racial and ethnic minorities to draw “majority-minority congressional districts”, the largest US cities elected a full suite of Black mayors including Chicago’s Harold Washington, Philadelphia’s Wilson Goode, Birmingham’s Richard Arrington, and Charlotte’s Harvey Gantt. Many of these party newcomers were alumni student activists of the Freedom movement who, by the 1990s, would expand Black mayoral power into Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland and Newark, eliciting the rallying cry from Jackson that“our time has come.”Jesse Jackson: ‘The gated community does not protect you from the pandemic’Read moreJackson envisioned his run with its electrifying “Run Jesse Run!” slogan as a front and center means to“confront liberals with liberators”and steer mainstream politics toward “the moral center of racial justice, gender equality, and peace”. He successfully shifted Black politics and leftist coalition building from the sidecar of the Democratic party and into the driver’s seat. It was Jackson’s intention to convert electoral politics into a spotlight for larger issues of Black families, inequality and economics. His flame for unapologetic progressivism was fueled by Black dissatisfaction with both Reagan and the mainstream Democrats who chased his constituents by dismissing low-income urbanites and communities of color as “special interests”.For the Black managerial and professional class, Reagan’s opposition to affirmative action presented a direct threat to the anti-discriminatory private sector policies that had more than doubled their ranks since the 1970s. For the Black working class and unemployed, Reagan’scorrupt usheringof the crack-cocaine and mass incarceration epidemics into inner cities proved devastating alongside the obliteration of government spending on healthcare, education and job creation. Jackson took the private sphere mumblings of Black dissent from barbershops and church basements to the public podium of campaign stops and convention arenas. He shined the flashlight on party practices that sought to suppress Black votes and dilute the Black voting bloc rather than answer to it.Confronted with Jackson’s formidable challenge, white candidates on the campaign trail downplayed their dependence on the Black vote, even when post-election analyses revealed that many white Democrats, especially in the south, had depended on as much as 90% of the Black vote in their victories. Newspaper columnists labeled Jackson an extremist, while even Black centrists like the then Atlanta mayor, Andrew Young, warned he would spoil the race for Democratic frontrunner and former vice-president Walter Mondale who desperately needed Black primary voters in the south to defeat Senator John Glenn. These outraged reactions were only confirmation for what Jackson defiantly proclaimed in a 1984 speech: “We [Black voters] can win without the Democratic party, but the Democratic party cannot win without us.”View image in fullscreenJesse Jackson campaigning in Winterset, Iowa, on 3 February 1988.Photograph: jean-Louis Atlan/Jean-Louis AtlanIn a run that was far more of a moral crusade than bid for office, Jackson 84 is often misunderstood as a power grab by a charismatic camera-ready activist, or a Hillary Clinton-esque glass ceiling moment meant to put Black firsts on to the major party tickets. From the outset, however, Jackson’s chief political aspiration was to hold the party accountable to those he called “the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised”, who Reaganomics and the white liberals enriched by it had left to rot.Jackson always intended to dovetail massive Black voter turnout for his run into down-ballot races for Black and leftist candidates. Cooperation up and down the ballot accomplished Jackson’s goal of exposing Democratic primary suppression of Black votes and boosted the power of Black votes in states that have held such longstanding Black blocs in congressional districts that the current Republican party cannot map a path to midterm victorieswithout redrawing them.The momentum continued into Jackson’s second bid in 1988 (he nabbed an endorsement byBernie Sanders, whose own presidential run would beinspiredby Jackson’s model), a year after which David Dinkins was elected the first Black mayor of New York and Douglas Wilder seized the first Black gubernatorial victory in Virginia.Mondale, who ignored adopting even the most minimal issues concerning Black voters, and did not campaign in Black communities until his last week, lost to Reagan in a landslide. Disillusioned by how Mondale had taken Black communities for granted as a “captured vote”, Walters, Jackson’s campaign manager, authored adetailed manualfor the steps a Black candidate would have to take to reach the White House – 21 years before Barack Obama’s historic win, where Jackson was among thousands gathered in Grant Park, Chicago, his face flooded with tears.When the Baptist minister strode to the Democratic national convention podium, head high, on 17 July 1984, no one expected him to be brief. After a drag-out defeat in the primaries, Jackson’s one-hour speech proved to be the high note for an otherwise uninspired convention. From the podium, the rousing orator addressed gay rights, Islamophobia and Native sovereignty, all threaded into his explanation for centering Black voting power in a fight for the party from within. “What does this large Black vote mean? Why do I fight to win second primaries and fight gerrymandering and annexation and at-large [elections],”he belted. “Why do we fight over that? Because I tell you, you cannot hold someone in the ditch unless you linger there with them.”Jesse Jackson – a life in picturesRead moreIt is an ethos for coalition building that reverberates into today’s leftist frustrations with a Democratic party that has also been pulled center by a hard-right administration. Many on today’s left are wondering what is to be made of the recent lightning-rod momentum churned up by the democratic socialist populist campaign of the New York City mayor,Zohran Mamdani, and gubernatorial Democratic wins inNew JerseyandVirginia. They are wondering how to hold a party accountable when it abandons its most downtrodden, expands militarism while contracting social services, and readily offers socialist policies to corporations while spurning calls for free and shared public resources from the masses.Jackson’s strategic legacy was that no vote is captive to a party that has not earned it, and that marginalized and overlooked voters are best heard when coalitions that prioritize their common social and economic stakes challenge the party where their electoral margins for victory are the most vulnerable. Jackson’s campaign was audacious because it was never really about him as a candidate but, rather for taking the reins back on an electoral process that wanted Black votes without including Black people.It was a rebellion masked as a campaign. As the Harvard political theorist Brandon Terry wrote, “Jackson’s campaigns were, at bottom, a remarkable attempt to merge symbolic and structural politics … His campaign helped refound a Democratic party whose internal corruptions and hierarchies had been the target of civil rights activism. That blend of charisma and concrete party reform is all-too-rare in American history. ” Forty-one years later, “Run Jesse Run” hasn’t run out of relevance for how those who have been historically deprived of the most power can move swiftly to reclaim it.Explore more on these topicsJesse JacksonDemocratsUS politicsCivil rights movementcommentShareReuse this content"

But lately, you’re likely to also find a half-done newspaper crossword, a ton of stationery, the book I’ve restarted three times, and whatever scraps and trinkets I’ve picked up throughout the day to put in my scrapbook.Analog is back, and it feels like we need it more than ever. In a world where getting just aboutanythingdone means being sucked into a digital black hole of apps, sign-up forms, harrowing social media feeds and carnivorous advertisers, it’s no surprise that we keep reaching back for the comfort of the physical: Polaroids, vinyl records, real birthday cards. It all helps us slow down and appreciate a world where not everything is online.This most recent return to analog has been marked by asurge in popularityof physical media and “grandma hobbies” like crosswords, knitting and crafting. Meanwhile, companies are also seeing a shift; the arts and crafts company Michael’ssaid thatsearches for “analog hobbies” on its site have gone up 136% in the last six months, while Google Trends suggests a 160% increase in searches for the same term.In an era of frictionless digital experiences, there’s something magical about obsolete technology | Tansy GardamRead moreMy own return to analog finds itself manifested in major scrapbooking projects, taking my notes by hand, converting my digital journal into a physical one, and carving out dedicated time during which my cellphone functions “like a landline” – meaning I have nothing but calls coming through that bad boy.And while I hate to prove my mother’s generation right in affirming that “life would be better if it wasn’t for all those damn screens!”, I fear they were on to something. Leaning into analog has helped me stay off my phone, forced me to be present in my activities and helped me embrace the sensory joy of it all. From rifling through my purse for a pen or taking in the smell of an old book, to seeing my own handwriting and spending time rewinding cassette tapes, interacting so intimately with the things we enjoy just feels good.The uniqueness of physical media – defects and all – adds to the thrill of experiencing things you can actually touchThe uniqueness of physical media – defects and all – adds to the thrill of experiencing things you can actually touch. I love when a vinyl has a scratch that no other one has, when an old photograph has a message written on the back, or when my crossword pages bear the markings of my failed guesses. These are the pieces that add real texture to our experiences and color to our memories.And I feel lucky that the analog life is are-discovery for me. I’ve lived long enough to have my own library of analog things, and seen how they become a time capsule – a monument to times past and the things we loved.In that way, I think one of the best parts of the analog experience is we actually get tokeepthe stuff we use. Book’s gone out of print? I still have my own signed copy. Putting on some music? Well, let me tell you the story about how I found this record at an old store that doesn’t exist any more.Yes, the digital world means less clutter and less physical waste (yay paperless!), but for all its promises of efficiency, productivity and just making life easier, the digital world leaves much to be desired. An email doesn’t hold the same emotional and tactile quality as a handwritten note from a loved one, and not even the best filters can re-create the feeling of looking at a good Polaroid. As I rebuild my own personal archive of old things, I focus on gathering stuff that I really need, and thinking carefully about how to make my new hobbies and systems as sustainable as possible.Analog media adds a layer of ownership and intimacy over our experiences of the world that is simply impossible to replicate when those experiences are mediated by a screen and via tech companies. And while we’re nowhere near a post-screen era, the appeal of analog tells me we haven’t completely lost touch with the world around us.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Perpetrators of abuse must be properly held accountableTue 17 Feb 2026 13.59 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 17.52 ESTShareHours before she hanged herself in 2023,Katie Maddenspoke on the telephone with her abusive former partner, Jonathon Russell, who had been banned from contacting her after an alleged assault. After hearing testimony at the inquest into her death, the coroner cited Ms Madden’s long, toxic relationship with Mr Russell as a contributory factor in her suicide. But there has been no criminal investigation into her death.As ourreportingthis week has highlighted, this is a tragic but far too familiar story. The Domestic Homicide Project, a programme led by the National Police Chiefs’ Council, recorded 98 such suspected suicides following domestic abuse in 2024, compared with 80 cases where victims were killed by their partners.Even those bleak statistics are likely to be a severe underestimate. New research from a suicide prevention programme in Kent, shared with the Guardian, found that fully a third of all suspected suicides in the county occurred in the context of domestic abuse. Extrapolated nationally, that could mean that as many as 1,500 victims are taking their own lives each year.It is a scandal that such studies have not already been carried out on a national basis. The numbers we do have underline the pressing need for better and more joined-up prevention strategies. But as Ms Madden’s case illustrates, there also needs to be a radical change in the mindset of authorities investigating suicide, informed by a deeper understanding of domestic abuse.Too oftenin such cases, superficial and cursory police investigations have failed to take into account the wider context that has led a victim to take their own life. Phones and laptops have not been seized; locations of death have not been properly secured and viewed as potential crime scenes. Against a backdrop of official indifference, it has required the persistence of bereaved relatives to shine a light on the harrowing circumstances that preceded their loved one’s death.This is clearly an unacceptable state of affairs. Justice is not being done for victims and their families, and perpetrators are not being held properly to account. The only successful prosecution of a domestic abuser for manslaughter was in 2017 – in a case where the defendant pleaded guilty. It is, as Dame Vera Baird, the former victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, has said, “a shocking record”.The campaigning organisation Advocacy after Fatal Domestic Abuse has called for the introduction of a new law, specific to suicide triggered by domestic abuse. That proposal merits serious consideration, particularly as it would force a national reckoning about causation. In relation to victims whose sense of self and agency has been crushed by violent, coercive and controlling partners, it is deeply flawed to think of suicide as a voluntary, free act. The legal framework should reflect that, as should police procedures. Routes of criminal investigation that should have been pursued have been closed down, deepening the grief of the bereaved.A coroner found that Kay Barter’s daughter, Georgia, took her own life after suffering years of violence and coercive control. Shetoldour reporter: “These suicides must be recognised for what they are. It’s not suicide. They need to investigate why these women have become so desperate.” Her voice and the voices of so many other grieving relatives need to be heard.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It cannot justify delaying elections. Tweaking maps won’t enrage voters; stagnant pay and broken services willTue 17 Feb 2026 13.58 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 21.31 ESTShareBeing forced to abandon plans todelay local electionsin England with fewer than three months’ notice is not just another policy U-turn by the government. It brings to a head issues of aptitude and judgment. The rationale seemed sound: avoid electing councillors to bodies that would be abolished under Labour’s reorganisation of local government. The political problem was that21 of the 30 councilswere Labour-led. That created a perception – fair or not – of democratic manipulation.The elections should have gone ahead. The Electoral Commission last Decemberwarnedof “unprecedented” uncertainty around them. The commission was clear: “Scheduled elections should as a rule go ahead as planned, and only be postponed in exceptional circumstances.” Changing course late in the day puts their smooth running at risk and piles pressure on staff. In defending their decision lastmonthbefore retreating on Monday, ministers look unprepared and out of their depth. Even worse, Labour reverse-ferreted after a legal challenge from Nigel Farage. He has taken to theairwavesto crow.Sir Keir Starmer has U-turned so often that even his own side is starting to doubt his authority. Labour’s plans to postpone elections were made to look like a stitch-up to keep it in control of councils. Whether justified or not, such a perception was fertile ground for Reform. The opposition that really ought to worry the prime minister is in hisparty’s ranks. Labour MPs fear a damaging narrative taking hold. This is a well-founded concern. One sober thinktank said ministers were playing “fast and loose” with democracy.Councillors will worry not only that they face elections they thought were postponed, but that they now look evasive. In Labour’s defence, it could be said that the original policy – simplifying two-tier councils with districts and counties into unitary authorities – was a necessary administrative reform. But delaying elections before pushing through the shake up was politically naive. Experts had urged caution, and the Institute for Governmentwarnedlast year that if polls were delayed, some councillors would end up serving six-year terms.Labour needs to replace the idea that it was cancelling elections with the idea that the party’s plans are about fixing a broken system. It is important to recognise that only inSurreywill the May elections see councillors in 2026 take up positions in two new unitary councils: East Surrey and West Surrey, which replace the existing county and 11 district councils. As part of the deal, the bankruptWokingcouncil gets a £500m bailout. Surrey will be a test case for whether the new council structure works more efficiently than the old ones.The election U-turn does not unwind Labour’s programme. More than 20 areas in England have submitted over 70 plans for new unitary authorities. A surge in Reform UK votes could rattle Labour enough to pause the process. That would be the wrong decision. The case for caution over Labour’s push isn’t Faragist posturing but democratic shortfall: withfewer councillors and bigger authorities,council decisions inevitably move further from the people they affect. Local government reorganisation, however, is not an emotive issue for most voters. Election timing controversies rarely have long half-lives. What Sir Keir needs is a more social democratic, and frankly competent, answer toflatlining living standardsandfailing public servicesthan he has offered up so far.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Four children sat shellshocked in my lounge, having just been removed from their home. They didn’t know or trust us. We tried our best to make them feel comfortable with cookies, doughnuts and crisps, but it would take several days before they were ready to tuck into treats.Fostering has been one of the biggest privileges for my wife and me over the past 20 years. Against the background of unimaginable trauma and being let down by those who should have been caring for them, we have seen how children receiving consistent and persistent love, support and compassion can begin to rebuild their lives.We have seen many children return home, while others have started a new chapter through adoption. Three children have become permanent members of our family, and while that is a joy, it means our home is full. It therefore breaks our heart to hear when children in care are being placed in another county, or separated from siblings, or housed in residential settings without family support.So I am very pleased that fostering is finally getting some ambitious political leadership. Josh MacAlister, the children’s minister, has set atarget of 10,000new approved foster care places, andhelpfully points tothe Homes for Ukraine scheme as the inspiration for a sea change in fostering recruitment.I am optimistic that, with robust support for the children, foster carers and children’s services, these 10,000 foster care places will be found. Every child deserves a family – a place to feel safe, seen and loved. Playing a small part in someone’s life in this way can make a huge difference. I have seen first-hand how rewarding this can be, and I highly recommend it.Dr Krish KandiahHenley-on-Thames,OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As a lifelongManchester Unitedfan, I have no doubt that Ratcliffe has brought the game into disrepute and sullied the club’s reputation. His vile comments constitute a failure of moral leadership and a betrayal of the club’s proud and pivotal role in the anti-racism work of Kick It Out, making him wholly unfit to be co-owner of a club with an unparalleled global fanbase, including in Africa and Asia.In his memoir, poignantly titled Belonging, the lateHerman Ouseley, founder of the Let’s Kick Racism Out of Football campaign in 1993, wrote candidly about the stonewalling and deeply entrenched resistance he encountered from many club owners over racism. Without the moral leadership, courage and tenacity shown by Lord Ouseley, the chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, the campaign may never have got off the ground, let alone developed into a model replicated globally. As a board member of the Manchester United Foundation, Lord Ouseley was supported by the club’s then legendary manager, Alex Ferguson, who will also find Ratcliffe’s remarks repugnant.Simon BirdDoctoral researcher, King’s College LondonJim Ratcliffe’s comments on immigration were offensive and misleading. What was most troubling was the language used, which carried an echo of a colonial mindset, reducing certain groups to problems to be managed rather than people with equal dignity. Given Britain’s history, we should be particularly wary of rhetoric that devalues those who come here from former colonies, often to fill roles this country urgently needs.The reality is that Britain has long depended on overseas workers to sustain essential public services. The NHS, in particular, was built, and continues to function, because doctors, nurses and carers from abroad have filled chronic shortages. Many did not simply “take” from Britain; they helped to build it.Inflammatory language of this kind risks worsening staff shortages in healthcare and other vital sectors, while contributing nothing to a serious debate. If immigration is to be discussed honestly, it should begin with facts, fairness and perspective, not scapegoating.Dr Arun MidhaSwanseaThe comments by Jim Ratcliffe are not only offensive and harmful but blatantly incorrect, and will stir further hate and division. Working with organisations such as Show Racism the Red Card, Migrant Voice has – as part of the “Migration. Making Britain Great” campaign – highlighted that the diversity of the Premier League, and migrants playing in it, is a strength that is reflected in Britain’s communities.Immigration doesn’t undermine a country’s character; it enhances it. British culture, including football, is based on migration, on adapting and evolving to new ideas. That is something to be celebrated, not condemned.Nazek RamadanDirector, Migrant VoiceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It takes more than building the primary schools necessitated by such schemes to get people out of their cars, especially as walks to school are extended by the very low densities secured by huge consumption of productive farmland.Nor should the developers be given credit for “mixed tenure” housing. They managed to get East Herts council’s aspirations for 40% “affordable” housing reduced to 23%, using cynical “viability” provisions in planning guidance that enable developers to demand high rates of return and so reduce their obligations to provide affordable housing. And don’t forget that much “affordable” is simply slightly-less-unaffordable – and can include little or no social-rent housing.The “garden town philosophy” has created a few “cookie-cutter estates”, but much has fallen foul of part of developers’ “blueprint for the future”: their unwillingness to provide much of the big infrastructure that is needed. In the end, like Gilston and several of the “new towns” the government is mulling, all they really create is car-dependent sprawl.Jon ReedsSmart Growth UKNews of yet another “garden village” arriving sometime between now and the next ice age prompts me to write before I’m formally admitted to a hospice for those still waiting on national infrastructure. We are assured these schemes need only 20 years of planning and another 25 to build. At this rate, the ribbon‑cutting will be attended by my great‑grandchildren – a theoretical cohort, as I don’t have any – assuming they can get through the traffic caused by the still‑unfinished access roads.While the housing crisis is happening in real time, we persist with timelines that make medieval cathedral builders look hasty. Meanwhile, empty buildings across the country quietly decay despite already having roads, pipes and occasionally roofs. Refurbishing them would deliver homes within a single human lifetime, but instead we embark on multi‑decade odysseys of inquiries and consultations.If the final “village” ever opens, I trust the hospice staff will wheel me out to witness this triumph over time, money and common sense.Richard EltringhamLeicesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is increasingly clear that millions of working-age people are drifting out of the labour market not through choice but because of long-term health problems and inadequate support systems around them.Tackling worklessness requires proactive, health-centred approaches that help individuals stay in or return to work. We also know that time out of work is corrosive. Good-quality work improves physical and mental wellbeing, providing income, social connection and purpose, and protects against social exclusion.Occupational health should form a key part of this support, including early intervention for chronic conditions and stronger partnerships between health services, employers and employment support agencies. Evidence shows that people off sick struggle to find work without dedicated support and without reform to the system, health-related worklessness will continue to grow.Employers, too, have a role to play by embedding high-quality health support into workplaces and making reasonable adjustments that enable people with health conditions to fully participate. Only by combining health-focused return-to-work initiatives with economic opportunity can we reverse the trend of rising inactivity and help people fulfil their potential.Nick PahlChief executive,Society of Occupational MedicineExplore more on these topicsUnemploymentHealthlettersShareReuse this content"

The Olympic curling community is still all in a twist about everything that’s gone on in the sport since a row broke out between the Sweden and Canada sides on Friday. “The whole spirit of curling is dead,” Canada’s Marc Kennedy said on Monday night after his team’s 8-2 victory against Czech Republic, which felt like a bold take coming from the man who started this entire farrago by repeatedly telling his Swedish opponent Oskar Eriksson to “fuck off” after Eriksson accused him of making an illegal double‑touch.On Tuesday, the Canadians were outplaying the British. They beat them handily, 9-5, which means Bruce Mouat’s team have to beat the USA team and hope other results go their way if they’re going to make the semi-finals.Winter Olympics 2026: women’s figure skating, GB lose crunch men’s curling match, and more – liveRead more“Mouat gave us a couple of misses to work with,” Kennedy said. “Which isn’t something we’ve had from him before.” Then he left, grateful, he said, that he hadn’t had to face “a nuclear question”. There have been a lot of those in the past few days. On Tuesday morning there was talk that one of the Swedish journalists had new photographic evidence of the Canadian women’s skip making another double‑touch. There has never been a bonspiel quite like it.The way the Canadians play it, curling is a sport where a competitor is supposed to take his opponent’s word. “This whole trying to catch people in the act of an infraction sucks,” Kennedy said on Monday. “We don’t look for infractions at grand slams. We don’t look for that kind of stuff on tour. We just trust that the people around us aren’t trying to cheat. If somebody does something out of hand, it just gets dealt with in the moment, and you move on, you don’t need the officials to manage our game. That’s where the spirit of curling is in a little bit of trouble, and, honestly, that’s probably come from the quest for medals.”Curling, Kennedy says, is supposed to be a game for gentlemen. “It is what it is,” he said ruefully. “The sport is evolving.”And how. The row has turned out to be the biggest thing to happen to it since it was brought back into the Olympic programme in 1998. The slow-motion footage of Kennedy brushing the stone with his forefinger has gone viral, and the internet is overflowing with sloppy AI skits of Kennedy nudging ice hockey pucks and knocking over figure skaters at the ice rink. On TikTok someone put together a spoof of Kennedy and Eriksson in a whole Heated Rivalry situation, which has pulled in 2.5 million views. It’s fair to say the organisers were caught short by the speed and size of the reaction.View image in fullscreenGreat Britain need other results to go their way to reach the semi-finals.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAThey ended up bringing in two extra referees just to police the hog‑line, then took them away again after the curlers complained about it. “We’re not at some bonspiel in Saskatchewan, we’re at the Olympics,” the Canada team’s coach, Paul Webster, said. “We have untrained people doing things they’ve never done before. I have a lot of respect for people who are here and volunteering their time, but I think we really have to question if we’re doing new things at the Olympic Games.”Whatever has been lost, some of the curlers acknowledge that something has been gained too, though no one is sure whether it’s for the better or not. The sport couldn’t buy this publicity if it tried. The Curling Group are launching a new international franchise competition called The Rock League next April, Mouat and a bunch of the others have already signed up to play in it.“There’s been a lot of talk about the negativity of everything that’s going on,” the Canadian skip, Brad Jacobs, said. “But when you actually look at everything that’s gone on, and you consider how many eyeballs turned to curling over the last 72 hours, it’s probably the best thing ever for our sport.“What does the world feed off nowadays? Negativity. But that’s OK. Like I said, all of that negativity brought a lot of eyeballs to the sport of curling that maybe have never even considered looking at it before.” The pity is that unless Great Britain get lucky it won’t be Mouat they are watching, even though he is widely regarded as the best player in the sport today.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBCurlingWinter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you’d asked her 18 months ago where she expected to be competing this week, she would have told you she would be at the Utilita Arena in Birmingham running the 60m at the UK Indoor Championships, not standing at the top of the world’s newest ice track riding a £75,000 bobsleigh.“I was tricked into it,” Nelson says. “You laugh, but it’s true.” Nelson got into it only after the GB bob pilot Adele Nicoll sent her a message on Instagram just after the Paris Olympics asking if she fancied giving it a go.Winter Olympics 2026: crunch time in curling, slopestyle, bobsleigh and more on day 11 – liveRead more“I didn’t know anything about it before I went down, I’d never seen a crash. I didn’t even know people did crash, the closest I’d ever come to a bobsleigh before was watching Cool Runnings,” Nelson says, before the two-woman bob, which starts official practice on Tuesday afternoon before the competition on Friday.Nelson’s idea of speed was what she could achieve on her own two feet. She is one of the most decorated female sprinters GB has had. She was part of 4x100m relay teams that won gold medals in the European Championships in 2014 and the Commonwealth Games in 2022, and silver at the WorldAthleticsChampionships in 2019 after bronze at the 2013 worlds, as well as an individual bronze and silver medals at the European and the World Junior and World Youth Championships. It was only four years ago she was picked as the team captain for the European Championships in Munich.Then everything went wrong. “I’d had a brilliant year, there was no reason for me to think I would stop. Then I got injured.” It was her achilles. The doctors gave her six months to recover, then decided she needed to have surgery. It cost her a year of competition. “I would have loved to have been at the Paris Olympics, but it was all just too much of a rush.” She was 32 and “ready to retire” when she got that Instagram message.View image in fullscreenAdele Nicoll and Ashleigh Nelson compete in the two-woman bob at the 2025 world championships in Lake Placid, New York.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images“It caught me at a vulnerable time,” Nelson says. “I didn’t make the Olympic Games and it was around that time Adele messaged me, I was feeling a bit sad and vulnerable, so when she said: ‘Do you fancy bobsleigh?’ I was like ‘maybe’. And then 18 months later I’m at the Winter Olympics, which is a bit bizarre.”There’s a long history of track athletes making the crossover from one sport to the other, bobsledders need to have that explosive sprinting ability to set the sled off and running down the mountain. Joel Fearon, James Dasaolu, Mark Lewis‑Francis, and Montell Douglas are just a few who have made the switch.But it’s not for everyone. As Nelson found out when she tried it for the first time during a training camp in Lillehammer.“There’s no cushion. There’s no seatbelt. There’s no airbags. The first time I went down I was told: ‘Whatever happens, just hold on tight, don’t let go.’ When I got to the bottom my body was in shock, I’d had a lot of caffeine and when I got out of the sled my nervous system was on edge. I just said: ‘What was that?’”The experience of being a passenger in a bob, if you’ve never been lucky enough to try it, is something like being stuck in the drum of a washing machine and tossed down a mountain. Nelson comes from a sporty family. Her brother was a sprinter, her father played for Stoke, her cousin Curtisplays for MK Dons. But this was a first, even for them.View image in fullscreenAshleigh Nelson crosses the line during the heats of the women’s 4x100m relay at the 2022 European Championships in Munich, where she was the GB captain.Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images“I called my mum afterwards and said: ‘Mum, I don’t think this is for me,’” Nelson says. “And my mum said: ‘Well you’ve gone all the way to Norway, you’re supposed to be there for two weeks, just stick it out.’” A few days later she had her first run with Nicoll as her pilot, “and that wasn’t so bad. You still get rattled, and some tracks are worse than others, but when I’ve got a driver like Adele I know that I’m safe.” Which still doesn’t necessarily mean Nelson enjoys it. She cheerfully admits that she races with her eyes tight shut.“Why am I going to open them?” Nelson laughs. The large part of her work is in the first 50m, and she’s exceptionally good at it. “I’m fast, I’m strong, I’m not just here because I’ve got nice hair. I squat 260kg.” But after that: “I’m in the back with my head tucked between my legs holding on to the sled! I can’t see anything that’s happening. I memorise the track and I count the corners so I know where I am, but when you’ve got your eyes closed and you’re going 80mph you’ll forgive me if I get a bit disorientated.” After the year she’s had, you can.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBBobsleighWinter OlympicsAthleticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s about assimilation’Read moreThe commentator, Stefan Renna, said Edelman had supported the actions of the Israeli military in the Gaza conflict and he suggested that this breached the International Olympic Committee’s rules on political statements by athletes at the Games.“Our journalist wished to question the IOC’s policy regarding the statements made by the athlete concerned,” RTS said in a statement. “However, although factual, such information may have appeared inappropriate due to its length within the context of a sports commentary. For this reason, we removed the segment from our website last night.”The IOC said on Tuesday that questions about individual comments made by commentators must be directed to broadcasters. The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Renna said in his commentary that Edelman defined himself as a Zionist, posted messages on social media in favour of what Renna referred to as the “genocide” in Gaza and had mocked a “Free Palestine” inscription he had seen on a wall on the sidelines of a World Cup race, among other things.“One can therefore question his presence in Cortina during these Games,” he said, citing IOC rules on athletes’ military connections and active support of war, including through their activities on social media.The American-born Edelman, who the Times of Israel said is the first Orthodox Jew to represent Israel at theWinter Olympics, posted on social media that he was aware of Renna’s commentary, which he described as a “diatribe”.“[We are] a team of six proud Israelis who’ve made it to the Olympic stage. No coach with us. No big program. Just a dream, grit, and an unyielding pride in who we represent,” he wrote. “I don’t think it’s possible to witness that and give any credence to the commentary.”IOC rules on active support of war relate only to Russian and Belarusian athletes who are allowed to compete at the Olympics as neutrals despite the ban on their countries, following Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Renna, who has been forbidden by RTS from discussing his commentary, also cited the case of Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who wasdisqualified from the Olympics last weekfor wearing a helmet depicting compatriot athletes killed since the Russian invasion.Edelman and Menachem are due to complete their third and fourth runs on Tuesday. They were in last place after their first two runs.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSwitzerlandIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

One minute England are contemplating title showdowns in Paris, the next they face a must-win game against Ireland to remain in contention. A swift riposte to thedefeat in Scotlandlast weekend is required urgently and Steve Borthwick’s team selection reflects the management’s desire for a significant gear change.It has clearly played straight into the hands of Henry Pollock, whose ambition to start for England isabout to be realisedafter seven caps off the bench. His promotion reflects the need to re-energise all involved in the Murrayfield meltdown, as does the starting return of Tom Curry and Ollie Lawrence, Tommy Freeman’s shift back to the wing and Marcus Smith’s bench resurrection.Borthwick backs ‘superstar’ Pollock to deliver euphoria when England host IrelandRead moreThere could easily have been further changes. Borthwick’s first instinct is to give his players the benefit of the doubt but even he hesitated after the experience of last Saturday. “There are players in the team this week who are playing because I’m backing them to put in a performance that they’ll want to put in after last week,” the head coach said, slightly ominously.He did not name names, saying only that he’d “had a lot of conversations with players not selected who are very, very disappointed”. Several, presumably, will come roaring into the frame if there is no instant reaction to the31-20 loss in Edinburgh. While one defeat would not normally prompt an extreme team-sheet makeover, the nature of the Calcutta Cup debacle has clearly shaken England’s coaches wide awake.If you really want your side to rebound spectacularly, who better to whistle up than the ball of energy that is Pollock, the irrepressible Tigger to Borthwick’s less excitable Eeyore. The first time the pair met was at Franklin’s Gardens in Northampton when Borthwick paid a visit to meet Saints’ posse of international wannabes. “I was stood in the car park and this bundle of energy just bounced up to me. Typically when an 18-year-old meets the England head coach for the first time they are usually on the shy and retiring side. The first thing he said was: ‘How are you, mate?’ I thought: ‘Right, you’re different.’”Borthwick was also struck by Pollock’s match-clinching jackal off the bench in a crucial Champions Cup pool game against Munster 13 months ago, never mind the back-rower’s spectacular try – and subsequent “pulse check” celebration – against Leinster in Dublin last May.The net result is that Pollock, now 21, has been picked to wear the No 8 jersey with Ben Earl, England’s most consistent player in this championship to date, shifting to seven. In some respects it changes precious little with Borthwick keen to stick to the blueprint of picking three No 7s. At the same time, though, it gives Pollock a little extra licence to roam.Out on the wide outside is where English rugby’s young tyro can be an absolute nightmare for unwary defenders, particularly on the shoulder of someone such as Freeman. England lost out aerially against Scotland but this time it takes scant imagination to foresee George Ford hoisting the ball towards Freeman’s wing with Pollock sniffing for any juicy loose balls. There have been few English forwards, aside perhaps from Tom Croft, with Pollock’s searing pace and poacher’s instinct.View image in fullscreenTom Curry returns to the starting XV for England in their match against Ireland.Photograph: Jamie Johnston/Focus Images Ltd/ShutterstockNor will he be afflicted by big-game nerves. Ashe said last month: “I don’t look at a challenge and think ‘what if?’ or ‘what could go wrong?’” It was the same when he went to Leinster last year. “I wasn’t going into the stadium feeling nervous about playing against Josh van der Flier or Jack Conan. I was just so excited to show the world who I am.”Ireland, naturally, will have a different scenario in mind. Slow down England’s ball, stop them at the gain-line and force them into a slugfest and Pollock and co will have less time and scope to moonlight out wide. Having coached the British & Irish Lions in Australia last year, Andy Farrell has also had a closeup look at several England players and knows exactly where their strengths and weaknesses lie.That said, Farrell is a massive admirer of Curry and also backed Freeman as a Lions Test starter. He may also wince slightly at the return of the fit-again Lawrence to add more midfield punch and recall what happened the last time Smith played against Ireland at Twickenham.On that occasion it was Smith’s dramatic late drop goal which saw England home 23-22 after they had been 12-8 down at the interval. Ireland are supposedly more vulnerable these days but that was the widespread view about Scotland this time last week. While Henry Arundell, having avoided a ban after his Murrayfield red card, will be keen for a less stressful afternoon this time, that cannot be guaranteed.From Borthwick’s perspective, either way, the stage is set for Pollock to bounce England out of their Scottish introspection. “I will challenge him to express himself, be himself and bring what gets people jumping up and down with joy,” the head coach said. As Winnie-the-Pooh’s old mate would say: “The most wonderful thing about Tiggers, is I’m the only one.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Steve BorthwickEngland rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Désiré Doué came off the bench to engineer an impressive turnaround for PSG, who conceded a goal in the opening minute and were 2-0 down after 18 minutes as Folarin Balogun grabbed a double for the hosts.The 20-year-old Doué replaced the Ballon d’Or winner Ousmane Dembélé, who went off injured after 27 minutes, and proved decisive for the visitors as he struck two superb goals and set up one for Achraf Hakimi.Apparent racist abuse of Vinícius Júnior overshadows Real Madrid’s win in BenficaRead moreMonaco spent most of the second half down to 10 men after Aleksandr Golovin was shown a red card for a studs-up tackle that raked down the shin of Vitinha with the referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, upgrading his original caution to a sending off after consulting the touchline screen.PSG are now in an advantageous position for the return leg in Paris next Wednesday as they look to progress to next month’s last 16. However, the European champions were in all sorts of trouble after 56 seconds when Nuno Mendes had a stray crossfield pass cut out in midfield, handing Monaco a first attack with Golovin chipping for Balogun to head home from close range.Balogun outsprinted Marquinhos to double Monaco’s lead, before Wout Faes pulled back Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to give away a 22nd-minute penalty. However Vitinha’s effort was saved by Philipp Köhn.Yet the tie swung as Doué came on and scored with his first touch in the 29th minute after being teed up by Bradley Barcola. Doué’s rifling shot in the 41st minute was parried away by Köhn, but Hakimi reacted quickly to pounce on the rebound and make it 2-2 before the break.View image in fullscreenAchraf Hakimi fires in an equaliser for Paris Saint-Germain.Photograph: Frederic Dides/AFP/Getty ImagesGolovin’s dismissal in the 48th minute left Monaco on the back foot as the visitors then dominated proceedings and should have had more than just the 67th-minute winner from Doué; another superbly struck shot that flew into the goal from the edge of the penalty area.Galatasaraydelivered a dominant performance to dismantle 10-manJuventus5-2 in the first leg of their playoff, with Noa Lang and Gabriel Sara starring in a scintillating display.The hosts took the lead in the 15th minute when the Brazilian Sara struck a thunderous long-range shot that left Michele Di Gregorio with no chance. However,Juventusequalised almost instantly when Teun Koopmeiners reacted quickly after Pierre Kalulu’s header was saved by Ugurcan Cakir, converting the rebound in the 16th minute.The Italians edged ahead in the 32nd minute as Koopmeiners doubled his tally with a driven shot from outside the box after Weston McKennie found him. Galatasaray equalised just after the break when Lang slotted home a rebound from Baris Alper Yilmaz’s effort. The Turkish side then regained the lead on the hour mark as Davinson Sánchez turned in a precise Sara set piece.Juventus’s troubles mounted in the 67th minute when the substitute Juan Cabal was shown a second yellow card, for a reckless challenge, leaving his side to play the remainder of the match with 10 men.View image in fullscreenDanny Makkelie shows a red card to Juan Cabal (second right) of Juventus.Photograph: Erdem Şahin/EPAGalatasaray capitalised on the numerical advantage and increased their lead in the 75th minute. Victor Osimhen produced a sublime assist, threading the ball to Lang. The Dutch winger expertly fired a right-footed shot from the centre of the box, leaving Di Gregorio rooted to the spot.The home side added a fifth in the 86th minute. Osimhen created another chance, setting up the substitute Sacha Boey, who smashed a fierce shot to seal a resounding victory.Serhou Guirassy scored one goal and created another as hostsBorussia Dortmundclaimed a 2-0 victory over Italian visitorsAtalantain the first leg of their playoff tie. The match kicked off 15 minutes late as the Dortmund team bus was caught in traffic, but they were fast out of the blocks as the striker Guirassy put the home side in front inside three minutes with a header at the back post.Dortmund doubled their advantage in the 42nd minute via Max Beier after he was teed up by Guirassy in a deserved victory for the German side, withAtalantaoffering little in the way of a goal threat.The return leg will be played in Bergamo next Wednesday, with the winners to meet either Arsenal or Bayern Munich in the last 16.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueMonacoParis Saint-GermainGalatasarayJuventusBorussia DortmundAtalantanewsShareReuse this content"

Ryan One and Jack Moylan scored before Jack Vale's second-half red, with Ivan Varfolomeev and Robert Street netting after the dismissal.Their undefeated streak dates back even longer, with their last league loss coming 16 games ago on November 22.Bolton dropped two points in third but it could have been three as their 1-1 draw at Reading was secured deep in a lengthy period of added time.Jack Marriott's first-half goal looked to the decider but Mason Burstow pounced in the sixth additional minute to keep Wanderers above of the chasing pack.That group is lead by Bradford, who edged a 1-0 win over fellow play-off hopefuls Stockport thanks to Antoni Sarcevic.Huddersfield lost ground in sixth, undone 1-0 by Luke Molyneux's penalty as Doncaster banked three important points.Burton escaped the relegation zone and plunged second-bottom Rotherham into even deeper trouble, Tyrese Shade's effort enough for a 1-0 win. Leyton Orient replaced them in the drop zone after going down 3-1 at home to Plymouth.Elsewhere Barnsley beat Peterborough 2-1, Exeter and Wycombe drew 1-1, Port Vale went down 2-1 at Stevenage and Blackpool scored the only goal against FA Cup surprise package Mansfield.In League Two, Swindon cut Bromley's lead at the summit down to three points.Andy Woodman's pace-setters took a third-minute lead against Cheltenham through Mitch Pinnock but were pegged back to draw 1-1, while the Robins left Barnet with a 2-1 win.

It was, as Ruby Walsh pointed out on the voiceover, a reminder of how the National has been revived and transformed.A glance back no further than the 2011 Grand National, however, also offers clear evidence of how much the great race has changed, even in the space of 15 years. The field, of course, is now down to a maximum of 34, rather than the 40 runners that we all grew up with, but it is the depth of quality in the names, ratings and weights that were published on Tuesday that stands out.The bottom weights in 2011 raced off a rating of 138. The 34th name on the list for 2026 – ie, the last horse guaranteed a run – is Jagwar, on 152, and while a rating of 144 might well get you an outing on 11 April it is far from guaranteed. Although Don’t Push It, the eventual top weight in 2011, raced off a mark of 160, the top dozen in this year’s handicap are all rated 160 or above.“This year’s race really stands out in terms of quality,” Martin Greenwood, the handicapper responsible for setting the weights, said on Tuesday. “Although entries are slightly down overall [to 78 from 90 in 2025], it’s at the bottom end, where trainers are now realising there is no point in entering as they have no chance of getting in.”From one year to the next, the depth of quality in the Grand National has been increasing, and that has been reflected in the results, with the best horses increasingly shrugging off burdens of 11st or more to come to the fore. Nick Rockett, wholed home a 1-2-3 for Willie Mullins12 months ago, carried 11st 8lb, while I Am Maximus, the 2024 winner, finished second under 11st 12lb, and Grangeclare West was next over the line with 11st 8lb.View image in fullscreenA triumphant Patrick Mullins on Nick Rockett in 2025.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSome will argue that the race has changed so thoroughly that it no longer bears comparison with the Grand National back in “the good old days”. They point out that the trip has been cut along with the numbers, and complain that the fences are too soft and the outcomes are all too predictable.On the latter point, though, the form book suggests otherwise, with winners at 50-1 and 33-1 in the last four years alone. And while there will always be those who feel that a race without a steady series of fallers is not a “proper” National, the easier fences have led to several runnings where as many as two dozen are still in with a chance as they cross the Melling Road for the final time. For a once-a-year TV audience keeping track of their sweepstake entries – and, perhaps, being introduced to racing for the first time – that can only add hugely to the excitement and spectacle.It is true that there is a certain uniformity about the names attached to many of the leading contenders. The biggest Irish stables now dominate the National entries, as they do at Cheltenham next month, and Mullins alone has 10 of the top 34 in the weights. However, there is still room too for the kind of windmill-tilting by the smaller yards that has always been the National’s stock in trade.Mr Vango, already among the most popular chasers in training, is guaranteed a run for Sara Bradstock’s stable having narrowly missed out last year. “We’ve got to get enough rain,” Bradstock said on Tuesday, “but otherwise we’re obviously very much looking forward to what he’s good at, which is jumping and stamina. He’s a great big horse to carry weight, so we’re delighted to get a chance if the ground comes.”Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowLudlow: 2.00Island Bridge2.33Hornica3.05Theonewedreamof3.35Petty Cash4.05Diamonds Galore4.35Count Adhemar5.05ManigodSouthwell: 2.20Bank On Frank2.55Disguisedlimit3.25Smokehouse3.55Zamek4.25Farmer Jimmy4.55AsaKempton: 5.30Silver State (nb)6.00Zoffandia6.30Crimson Rambler (nap)7.00Comic Hero7.30Silent Strike8.00Shallow8.30SolarizeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Oscars Brother, meanwhile, needs another run to qualify but is 24th on the list if he can and will bid to make 27-year-old Connor King, who has just two horses at his stable in County Kildare, the youngest winning trainer in National history.Oscars Brother attracted some early money in the betting on Tuesday, down to around 33-1 from an early 40-1, but Iroko, fourth when favourite as a seven-year-old 12 months ago, is again a clear market leader, at a top price of 7-1.Iroko is one of just three runners at 16-1 or shorter in the early betting, with I Am Maximus on offer at 12-1 to become the first top-weight to win since Red Rum in the 1970s and Haiti Couleurs,the Welsh Grand National winner, next at 16-1.Nick Rockett (25-1) is running out of time to get a qualifying run if he is to attempt to repeat last year’s win, but Grangeclare West (25-1) is on course to return toAintreewhile another runner from the Mullins yard, Spanish Harlem, is an interesting contender for his owner, Peter FitzGerald, the founder of Randox, the race sponsor for the last 10 years.View image in fullscreenSean Bowen rides Haiti Couleurs clear to win the Welsh Grand National last December.Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesThe eight-year-old looked the likely winner of the Thyestes Chase, often a significant Grand National trial, in January before unseating his inexperienced jockey at the last, and could offer some early value at around 40-1.“He was very disappointing for a long time, but extreme distances over fences has brought out the best in him,” Patrick Mullins, last year’s winning rider and his father’s assistant, said on Tuesday.“The profile is right in my book and I don’t see why he won’t take to the fences, he’s got plenty of experience and jumps well.

Arsenal have preserved all concessionary ticketing categories and will continue to distribute 1,000 free tickets to the local community.The club said: “While were are making progress towards winning major trophies, we are still working towards financial sustainability. Our investment in our playing squads and infrastructure is dependent on the revenue we drive in the face of rising costs.”The Arsenal Supporters’ Trust said it was “disappointed” with the price rises. “We firmly believe that with the football sector benefiting from ever-increasing broadcast and commercial revenues it is time to stop squeezing match-going supporters so hard.” The trust observed that Arsenal reported a 10% increase in revenue last season.The club are close to announcing Bukayo Saka’s contract extension, worth about £300,000 a week. The 24-year-oldagreed a new deal until 2031 in January.Safe standing will be introduced first in the Clock End, then in the North Bank lower from 2027-28. In total 13,500 home and away supporters will eventually be able to stand while watching.Mikel Arteta has said he is looking at Arsenal’s warm-up routines “big time” as he seeks an explanation for why his players keep pulling up before matches. Riccardo Calafiori dropped out of the lineup for theFA Cup tie against Wiganlast Sunday after sustaining an injury in the warm-up, the second time it has happened to the player, and the fourth time in the season overall. Arteta said he was confident the Italian would be available against Wolves but said the club were “looking into” their pre-match habits.View image in fullscreenGabriel Martinelli (left) and Riccardo Calafiori of Arsenal warming up before the game against Wigan.Photograph: Dylan Hepworth/Every Second Media/Shutterstock“We are big time looking at it,” Arteta said. “The incidents were very different: the first time was Willy [Saliba] rolling his ankle against Liverpool, then we had two incidents with Ricky [Calafiori] in the warm-up in a very similar way, then one with Bukayo after he was rested in midweek – didn’t play against Kairat Almaty – then against Leeds he has an incident.“It’s very unusual. I think it’s only happened once or twice in the six [previous] years I’ve been here. But it’s happened four times this year. We are looking into it, but it is what it is. We have to learn.”Arteta added that he had learned to dread the opening of his office door as the clock ticks down to kick-off but said the spate of pre-match injuries had also led him to question the value of the process.“The warm-up is so that the players are activated to be absolutely at their best physically and mentally, to be connected with their teammates. It’s to tell the body the game is coming, the adrenaline is going to start to pick up, the testosterone has to be in the right spot and you’re ready to compete. To change that sometimes is tricky.“It’s a really good area to look at, though. What would happen if we didn’t do the warm-up? Because then at half-time we sit for almost for 15 minutes and then we go full guns again in the second half. So maybe it’s something to think about.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalFootball ticket pricesMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

Woods, who has not played competitively since the 2024 Open Championship, has also somewhat remarkably left the door open to teeing up in the Masters this year.With the USA still reeling from defeat by Europeat Bethpage in September, thoughts have turned towards attempts to reclaim the Ryder Cup in Ireland. Woods is the PGA of America’s first choice as captain. The 50-year-old will determine whether he believes he can commit sufficiently to the role.“They have asked me for my input on it and I haven’t made my ­decision yet,” Woods said. “I’m ­trying to ­figure out what we’re trying to do with our [PGA] tour. That’s been driving me hours upon hours every day and ­trying to figure out if I can actually do … our Team USA and our ­players and everyone that’s going to be involved in theRyder Cup, if I can do it justice with my time.“Serving on two boards and what I’m doing for the PGA Tour, I’m ­trying to figure out if I can actually do this and serve the people that are involved and serve them at an honourable level.”View image in fullscreenTiger Woods played for the US at eight Ryder Cups and could captain their attempt to reclaim the trophy in 2027.Photograph: Matt Dunham/APWoods has a longtime alliance with JP McManus, the owner of the Ryder Cup venue at Adare Manor. Europe are still to confirm captaincy plans for 2027 but the expectation is that Luke Donald will remain in position for a third Ryder Cup in succession. Needless to say, the PGA Tour will want to avoid any Woods decision‑making process turning into a saga.The 15-time major winner is part of a PGA Tour committee which will soon reshape the tournament ­schedule. “I thought I spent a lot of hours practising in my prime,” Woods said. “It doesn’t even compare to what we’ve done in the boardroom. It’s been challenging. We’re trying to do the right thing.”Woods was ­speaking in Los ­Angeles, where he is the tournament host at the ­Genesis Invitational. He underwent disc replacement surgery on his back last October. It was a surprise, then, to hear his answer when asked whether Augusta National and a Masters appearance in less than two months’ time is off the table. “No,” he said.“My body has been through a lot. It’s just one of those things where it’s each and every day, I keep trying, I keep progressing, I keep working on it, trying to get stronger, trying to get more endurance in this body and ­trying to get it at a level at which I can play at the highest level again.”Explore more on these topicsGolfTiger WoodsRyder CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Saturday, Chris Kavanagh and his assistants had a night to forget at Villa Park without the comfort blanket of VAR. One poor decision is forgivable, two is careless, but there were a hat-trick of howlers, with Tammy Abraham clearly offside for Aston Villa’s opener. Lucas Digne needed his own dedicated review booth, escaping with a yellow card for an agricultural tackle on Jacob Murphy and avoiding a penalty for handball. Officials ruled that Digne handled the ball outside the penalty area, an impressive feat given that he both took off and landed inside the box as he jumped to block a cross. Kavanagh and one of his assistantshave been stood down by PGMO, presumably rebranded because they can’t stop dropping Ls.Over in Italy, where refereeing errors are invariably handled in a measured, rational way, Juventus were on the end of a harsh call in Saturday’s 3-2 defeat to Inter. Having already been booked, Pierre Kalulu brushed the arm of Andrea Bastoni, who went down as if clipped by a freight train. Kalulu was sent off and with no VAR review for second yellows, it was left to Juve’s directors to try and rewrite the verdict, with Damien Commoli and Giorgio Chiellini getting up in Federico La Penna’s grill at half-time. La Penna is now being hounded by online abuse and threats, with police advising himto stay at home for his own safety, while Commoli and Chiellini have now been slapped with bans.View image in fullscreenAndrea Bastoni getting his celebrations on in the midst of all that.Photograph: Daniele Mascolo/ReutersHeading next to Spain, where referring errors are also handled in a measured, rational way, and Barcelona’s shock defeat at Girona on Monday. Fran Beltrán scored the winner for Barça’s noisy neighbours, with referee César Soto Grado missing a foul on Jules Koundé by Claudio Echeverri in the buildup. Less egregious than the long weekend’s other examples, it was not corrected by VAR – leading to predictable conspiracy chat across a range of Social Media Disgraces. Any accusation of institutional bias against your club in particular is likely to fall apart under any real scrutiny, but in this case, angry Barcelona fans have yet to explain why the same officials awarded their team a penalty, missed by Lamine Yamal. Much like Eddie Howe and Luciano Spalletti before him, Barça manager Hansi Flick tried to defuse the situation. “The referees are doing their job. Sometimes their work isn’t good,” Flick mused. “Sometimes the referees are [at] the same level that we play … which is not a good level.”The weekend’s weirdest refereeing decision actually came in Verona’s 2-1 defeat at Parma on Sunday. After just 11 minutes, Verona’s Gift Orban protested to the referee, Luca Pairetto, after being denied a foul in the centre circle; he was met witha straight red card. It appears Orban was sent off for dissent – in which case, whatever he said must have been as profane as it was concise. So, four separate controversies: one triggered by VAR’s absence; one where VAR could not intervene; one where it could have, but didn’t; and one where VAR had less information than the referee. It’s fair to say match officiating is stuck in a frustrating feedback loop, with no easy way out.The reductive suggestion that we should consign VAR’s mics and monitors to the nearest wheelie bin clearly won’t lead us to a righteous utopia, but the constant, baffling inconsistency in its application makes being pro-VAR a tough hill to die on. What we can all agree on is that referees do not deserve death threats, fuelled by tribalistic accusations of corruption. What’s more, football managers (the people most directly affected by bad decisions) should not be left as officials’ last line of defence, choosing their words with precision to avoid stoking an online witch hunt. Once upon a time, the worst fallout from a bad decision would be a forensic takedown from Alan Hansen on Match of the Day. Now, a digital rage cloud forms and refuses to disperse, other calls from years ago dug up and clipped as evidence of a wider agenda. And if you’re hoping to find answers after reading this far, we’re sorry to say we don’t really have any.

The 47-year-old former Juventus manager,brought in last weekas the sacked Thomas Frank’s replacement until the end of the season, believes instilling the players with confidence is his most important task.“The team need, I believe, first of all, to get some confidence, to get some courage, but also, in same way, the concrete things in the pitch,” Tudor told Spursplay. “Of course, I’m coming here knowing that situation is not easy. There is no time to find excuses. What I said from the first day here, each of us need to give something more, something extra.”Frank was sackedafter eight months in the wake ofa 2-1 home defeat by Newcastle, which extended Spurs’ winless top-flight run to eight matches. The club are 16th, five points above the relegation zone, and Tudor faces a tough mission in his first game, at home to title-chasing Arsenal on Sunday.“The position of the club in this moment is one that nobody can accept,” Tudor said. “Every Tottenham fan cannot accept the situation. We are aware of that. But it’s not enough to just be aware of that.‘Ferryman’ Igor Tudor has the record to steer Tottenham to safetyRead more“The situation is not easy because we have a lot of injured players, so we need first to find the best system to suit the players that are available in this moment.

So the training from today, that’s the key.“The coach needs to show the path, where is the way we want to go, how we want to go, and the players need to accept this.”Tudor, sacked by Juventus in October last year after an eight-game winless run, said he was aware of the club’s culture and the fans’ demand for a stylish brand of winning football. He added: “I believe in the style. The style is more important than the system, of course. So every club has its particularity. That is first as a culture of the club, which kind of football they like.“So it’s always important to think about that, but in the same way, not forget who I am, what I want, what the team can achieve.

Files suggest some of the agency’s own tools and systems may also be running on Microsoft servers.US tech workers call on CEOs to demand Trump remove ICE from citiesRead moreThe documents – obtained by the Guardian and its partners+972 MagazineandLocal Call–raise questions about whether Microsoft technology is facilitating an immigration crackdown by an agency accused of conducting unlawful operations and using excessive force on a large scale.ICE enforcement operations have surged over the past year as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign. The agency is now at the centre of abattle in Congressover its funding, sparked by the deaths of two people in Minneapolis, that has led to apartial shutdownof the US government.In July, ICE received a $75bn budget increase, making it thehighest-fundedUS law enforcement body. With this unprecedented increase in funds, the agency has embarked on aspending spreeon technology, awarding contracts to large firms such asPalantiralongsidelesser-knownproviders.ICE, which has beenlikened toa domestic surveillance agency, enjoys access to vast troves of data on people living in the US. It has a growingarsenalof surveillance technology, includingfacial recognition apps, phone location databases, drones and invasivespyware.As the agency expanded through 2025, itboostedspending on cloud computing. Amazon and Microsoft, both longtime providers to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have emerged as beneficiaries of deals worth tens of millions of dollars struck by third-party resellers.The leaked documents do not specify the kinds of information stored by ICE on Microsoft servers. However, they indicate the agency has used Azure services including “blob storage” of raw data, as well as AI tools that analyse images and videos, and translate text.In January, according to the files, ICE held almost 1,400 terabytes in Azure, which if only comprised of photographs would be equivalent to approximately 490m images. This was up from 400 terabytes in July 2025 after climbing through the second half of last year, files suggest.ICE is also using virtual machines on Azure, according to the documents. These are effectively computers that run in the cloud but that can be accessed remotely. ICE appears to be renting these high-powered computers to run software.The agency, which hasmore than doubledits workforce since January 2025, is also understood to have significantly expanded its access to Microsoft’s suite of productivity apps which provide users with access to document management tools and an AI chatbot.It’s unclear from the files whether ICE is using Azure to store or analyse information collected through any of its surveillance or intelligence gathering activities, or whether the cloud platform supports other functions, such as the running of detention centres or deportation flights. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson for Microsoft said it “provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE, delivered through our key partners”. They said Microsoft’s policies and terms of service “do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity”.The spokesperson added: “There are currently many public issues relating to immigration enforcement, and we believe Congress, the executive branch, and the courts have the opportunity to draw clear legal lines regarding the allowable use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.”Quick GuideContact Harry Davies about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry  using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company later appeared to narrow this position. It acknowledged to employees it had contracts with ICE and DHS, but said it “does not presently maintain AI services contracts tied specifically to enforcement activities”.Microsoft is not alone in facing disquiet among employees over its business with federal immigration authorities. For large US tech groups, ICE and sister agency Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have long been customers, but have become increasingly controversial for their aggressive tactics and involvement in fatal shootings.Last week, Amazon workers and activistsprotestedoutside the company’s Seattle headquarters, demanding the company cut ties with federal immigration agencies. The company benefits from a series of large cloud deals with DHS to provide cloud infrastructure to ICE and CBP.At Google, which provides cloud services to both agencies, more than 1,300 workers have signed a recentpetitionwith a similar set of demands. “DHS is violating civil and national law as well ascivil and human rights,” the petition reads. “We must end our complicity in powering them.”Beyond the headlines: inside stories from the Guardian’s investigations team.On 16 March, join the Guardian’s investigations team, Paul Lewis, Sirin Kale, Lucy Osborne, David Conn and Harry Davies, for a deep dive into the stories behind some of the Guardian’s biggest headlines.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MicrosoftComputingAI (artificial intelligence)Trump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Jerí has denied wrongdoing and said the appointments were legal.The shake-up at the top of Peruvian politics comes amid a tit-for-tat row between the US Trump administration’s newly appointed ambassador to Peru,Bernardo Navarro, and China.Navarro, who began his diplomatic duties in Peru this month, lambasted “cheap Chinese money”in a post on X– adding that there was “no higher price to pay than losing sovereignty”, in what appeared to be a pointed reference to the port of Chancay, which is majority-owned by the Chinese firm Cosco Shipping Ports.The fully automated port is located about 50 miles north of Lima. Previously, US officials have suggested that the deepwater port could be used for naval activities, which Peru has denied.In response, China’s foreign ministry decried what it called the US’s “false accusations and disinformation against China’s cooperation with Peru” concerning Chancay port.Keen to deflect the US’s diplomatic broadside, Peru’s foreign ministry posted aphotograph on Xof its minister shaking hands with China’s ambassador to Peru, Song Yang, to mark the lunar new year and praising Chinese investments and bilateral trade relations.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasChinaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases. Macías’ asylum in the UK was first reported by Mexicannews outlet N+.Macías was first lady of Veracruz from December 2010 to October 2016, when her husband resigned amid allegations of organised crime and embezzlement. He was alleged to have siphoned away billions of pounds from state coffers.At the time, Duarte and Macías’ alleged crimes came to embody the graft that has plagued Mexico for years, and was particularly rampant during the government of then-president Enrique Peña Nieto. Mexico remains one of the most corrupt countries in the world, with Transparency Internationalrecently rankingit as 141 out of 182 countries.After his resignation, Duarte fled the country, but was arrestedsix months later in Guatemala. He was jailed in Mexico on money laundering and criminal conspiracy charges. Mexican prosecutors recently requested to extend his sentence on charges that he embezzled £215,000 from a state fund that was supposed to support children and the elderly.While serving as first lady, Macías reportedly enjoyed the use of a 15-acre, $9.7m ranch called El Faunito, where the walls were decorated with paintings by Latin American masters such as Rufino Tamayo and Fernando Botero.She was also head of the state welfare office, where she is alleged to have awarded contracts worth millions of pounds to shell companies. Authorities later found a warehouse filled with goods belonging to the couple, including Macías’ notebooks.On Tuesday, Sheinbaum displayed a page from one of those notebooks where Macías had written “I deserve abundance” over and over again.Macías disappeared from view shortly after her husband’s capture. In 2018, a Mexican judge issued an arrest warrant for Macías, accusing her of embezzlement. Days later, Duarte’s successor, Miguel Ángel Yunes,presented the findingsof a months-long surveillance effort, alleging she was living a life of luxury in London.According to Yunes’ investigation, Macías had a home in Belgravia, one of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods, less than a mile from Buckingham Palace. Macías reportedly spent at least £60,000 a month, and attended a “face gym” to strengthen her facial muscles.The day the findings were released, Interpol reportedly issued a red notice for Macías’ arrest, although she does not currently appear on the agency’s wanted list.Macías wasdetained by British authoritiesin October 2019 but she was released after paying £150,000 to face the extradition charges on bail. She also agreed to wear an ankle monitor.In 2022, Westminster magistrates court ruled in favour of her extradition to Mexico but Macías’ legal team filed several appeals to halt the process,according to local news reports, alleging that the case against her had expired, a fact that the Mexican foreign ministry had not shared with British authorities.Macías had also filed an asylum petition with the British government, alleging that she was the victim of political persecution by the Mexican government.According to news reports,the disgraced first lady was granted asylum in the UK last year.As well as condemning the British government’s ruling, President Sheinbaum also questioned how Macías was able to live in one of the world’s most expensive cities.“This person, who has been living in the UK for quite some time now, who knows where they got the money? Because having children there, living in a special place, where did they get it from?”Explore more on these topicsMexicoLondonAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, he was released from the Nowshahr prison, along with two other signatories of the statement, Vida Rabbani and Abdollah Momeni.Khamenei regime will not be able to keep control of Iran, says dissenting film-makerRead moreNo further details on any charges against Mahmoudian were immediately available. All three were released on bail.Mahmoudian is nominated for best original screenplay at the Academy Awards , along with Nader Saeivar, Shadmehr Rastin and the film’s director,Jafar Panahi. The film, a revenge drama inspired by Panahi’s own time in jail, is also nominated for best international feature as a submission from France.“Mehdi Mahmoudian, Vida Rabbani, and Abdollah Momeni peacefully exercised their right to express their views, but the regime responded by accusing them of ‘insulting the supreme leader’ and ‘propaganda against the Islamic Republic’,” Panahi said in a statement on Tuesday.“For years, such charges have been used as tools to criminalize thought, silence criticism, and instill fear in society. Turning a civil and peaceful act into a national security case is a clear sign of intolerance toward the independent voices of citizens.”Mahmoudian, a writer and political activist, has previously been imprisoned multiple times, including a five-year term that ended in 2014 on charges of “mutiny against the regime”. Panahi, who has himself been jailed and put under house arrest by the Islamic Republic regime, and Mahmoudian met in prison.Thousands were killed in last month’s nationwide protests in Iran. International pressure has grown over the regime’s crackdown on demonstrators, including a mass protest held over the weekend in Munich. On Friday, the US president, Donald Trump, said that regime change in Iran“would be the best thing that could happen”.Explore more on these topicsFilmIranJafar PanahiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Pokémon-style app for birdwatching launchesUsers of Birdex get points for each bird they see and can compete with friends, with 200,000 sightings logged so farChris BaraniukTue 17 Feb 2026 11.42 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 11.45 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleA new app has launched that aims to gamify birdwatching by allowing people to collect digital cards of UK bird species whenever they record seeing one.Users ofBirdexaccumulate points for each bird they see, with less common and rare species yielding the greatest rewards. It is possible to add friends and compete over bird sightings. The app has got birdwatchers talking online – though it has raised hackles among some for its use of AI-generated artwork.“Birds are great,” said Harry Scott, 24, one of the developers behind the app, who works in marketing. He and a collaborator built the app as a side project over a period of six months and he said the idea was to layer a rewards-based experience over birdwatching with a view to engaging young people in nature“I think birdwatching and Pokémon do share a lot of similarities,” he added. But does using a smartphone to tot up bird sightings not mean screens getting in the way of nature? “I think it’s more about using technology … as a tool to learn,” he said. “We’re trying to make sure that that screen time [people are] having is a lot more positive.”One Birdex user, Michelle Williams, a psychologist in London, said she enjoyed using the app to record garden birds such as robins with her two children aged seven and eight. “This is an opportunity to get out and help them engage with nature,” she said. “There is something nice about collecting a set, isn’t there?”However, some have criticised the app’s developers for using AI to generate depictions of birds. “If the art is AI it’s an instant uninstall, sorry,”wrote one Reddit user.Scott said they used AI in various ways during development because they had limited funds but they plan to hire artists in the future. The app is currently free to use, though some content or features may eventually be paywalled.To date, users of Birdex have counted appearances of more than 200,000 birds. There could be a citizen science impact if those records are made available to bodies such as the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), said Viola Ross-Smith, a science communications manager at the trust. The BTO has its own app, BirdTrack, for recording bird sightings.Ross-Smith said Birdex was “pretty engaging” and her son, a fan of Pokémon, “thought it looked quite cool”. But she questioned whether it might come with some risks for birds if people were encouraged to seek out vulnerable species such as the capercaillie, a rare, large woodland grouse that lives in parts of Scotland.It isillegal to disturbcapercaillies during their nesting season and visitors to the Cairngorms have frequently been warned not to go looking for them. Ross-Smith suggested Birdex could include such warnings.Explore more on these topicsBirdwatchingBirdsWildlifeAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

Johnson, who has just finished a 10-hour shift on his boat, the Golden Shore, is concerned that plans for a new salmon farm will put fishers like him and his two sons out of business.“They say it’s just one farm,” says Johnson. “But it’s one farmmore. There’s only so much water and we’re at saturation point.”The Shetland Islands councilapproved plansfor the new farm last week. For decades, the Scottish archipelago’s fishing community has shared the nutrient-rich waters of Britain’s northernmost region with the fish farms clustered around its “voes”, or inlets.But by approving what will become the UK’s largest-ever salmon farm, the council has deepened the rift between the islanders who make their living from fishing and the farm owners, and drawn criticism from environmental groups, which fear lasting ecological damage.The site, next to Fish Holm, off Shetland’s east coast, is a place Johnson and others have long relied on as among Shetland’s most fruitful scallop beds. The scallop fleet, which itself is notwithout its critics, has 30 vessels, each crewed by between one and three people. The Shetland Fishermen’s Association (SFA), representing 450 members, says the company running the planned site, Scottish Sea Farms (SSF), has not considered the environmental impacts on fish and shellfish nursery grounds.View image in fullscreenSydney Johnson, who fishes for scallops near Fish Holm with his sons, is one of many locals who oppose the farm. ‘It’s a fine shame to all involved,’ he says.Photograph: Kirstie Clubb/The GuardianSSF, which says it has taken account of the fishing body’s demands by making the site smaller, employs almost 300 people, including 160 on 20 farms, making it the islands’ biggest employer after the council.The company, which is jointly owned by the giant Norwegian seafood companies SalMar and Lerøy, will build 12 pens, each 160 metres in circumference, which will together hold up to 6,000 tonnes of salmon.It’s hard to figure out why our own council are hell bent on destroying our living for the gain of a few big NorwegiansSydney JohnsonThe farm has been described by SSF as marking a “new era” of aquaculture, expanding some of its existing sites in the strait into one bigger farm atFishHolm. There would be more fish in fewer but larger pens located in deeper “high-energy” waters, where there are stronger tidal flows.This, the company says, will reduce problems with sea lice, disperse waste and keep fish healthier.Johnson is not convinced. “It’s hard to figure out why our own council are hellbent on destroying our living for the gain of a few big Norwegians,” he says. “It’s betrayal at the highest level and it’s a fine shame to all involved.”He dismissed as “laughable”claims submitted by SSF during the consultation, using its environmental impact assessment and data provided by the Shetland Fishermen’s Association, that the site was worth just £500 of scallops a year for each vessel.Johnson pointed to that day’s catch, worth about £400 alone he says, adding: “I’ve had four times that at Fish Holm in a day. They need to sack their accountant.”View image in fullscreenWith demand for salmon growing fast, SSF is giving up the Collafirth 3 site to expand at Fish Holm.Photograph: Scottish Sea FarmsThe SFA itself says the company misapplied the statistics and that it did not reflect the way the area was currently fished.Most of the island’s once family-run salmon farms are now controlled by big business, largely owned by Norwegian and Canadian multinationals. They produced38,000 tonnesof salmon, worth£174m, in 2024 – about afifth of Scotland’s output.Continuing mortalities means to me that the industry hasn’t done what it promised to do in 2018Edward Mountain, MSPShetland is seen as a new frontier by an aquaculture industry keen to expand but struggling with high fish mortality rates and rampant disease. In May, SSF expects to open another farm – the largest in Shetland so far, with production expected to reach 4,000 tonnes – and is assessing an additional seven sites. Last week, before Fish Holm was approved, the Canadian-owned company Cooke Scotland also filed anapplicationfor a farm off the island of Vementry in western Shetland.The approval of SSF’s huge site marks a crucial juncture for Scottish salmon farming, which is worth an estimated£950m to Scotland’s economy, according to a report commissioned by the industry.View image in fullscreenSSF’s Foraness farm. It wants to use deeper waters with stronger tidal flows to keep fish healthier by reducing sea lice and dispersing waste.Photograph: Shetland By DroneOn 25 February, the Scottish parliament’s rural affairs and islands committee is due to question salmon farming executives as part of a continuing inquiry. Last year, the Holyrood committeecriticised the Scottish governmentfor its “slow progress” on regulating the industry.It called for stricter rules and greater transparency of mortality rates at farms, amid concerns over persistently high numbers of salmon deaths. The industry has said that many of the problems are outside its control and that warming seas spur the growth of blooms ofplankton and micro-jellyfish, which sting, cut and block the gills of the fish, killing them or aggravating other problems. Campaigners blame welfare issues such as overcrowding.In January 2025,Finlay Carson, the committee’s convener, told the Guardian that if no progress was made to address its concerns within 12 months, the committee would begin to look at a moratorium on industry expansion.The peerie boats are heritage … For Shetland to be known for just producing millions of salmon would be sadWilliam CooperSince then, deaths in fish farms have got worse. The latest 2024 data, from the Scottish government’s figures across a whole production cycle to harvest, shows a survival rate of 61.8%, the lowest since the 1980s.In October,more than 250,000 salmon diedunexpectedly in Shetland’s farms alone, which one company blamed on plankton blooms and jellyfish in warm weather.Ariane Burgess, Green MSP for the Highlands and Islands, tells the Guardian: “A moratorium on new farms and expansions would allow regulators to ensure that existing rules are being properly enforced and to begin addressing the impact of salmon farming on our seas, our local economies and other marine-based jobs.”View image in fullscreenScottish farmed salmon production has soared by 23% in the past six years to 192,000 tonnes in 2024. There are applications for 20 new farms.Photograph: Karen Appleyard/AlamyEdward Mountain, a Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands who convened the first parliamentary inquiry into salmon farming in 2018, says he would now vote for a moratorium on salmon farm expansion. “I say that with great difficulty as I believe it is a really important industry toScotland. But continuing mortalities means to me that the industry hasn’t done what it promised to do in 2018, which was reduce mortalities and prevent problems,” he says.One larger farm can reduce overall seabed impact compared with several smaller farmsKaryn Lumsden, SSFSince then, Scottish farmed salmon production has soared by 23%,from 156, 025 tonnesin 2018 to192,000 tonnes in 2024. More than 58 planning applications have gone ahead (20 for new farms and 38 for reconfiguring existing farms, which includes extensions), according to data compiled by community campaigners and analysed by the environmental charityWildFish. Only three applications have been refused, one of which is being appealed, the charity says.Nick Underdown, Scotland director at WildFish, says the latest approval is an “unprecedented expansion of industrial salmon farming that carries significant environmental risk”.“Salmon farming is costing our marine environment, while foreign-owned salmon farm companies shift their profits to Norway, the Faroes and Canada,” he says.Back on Shetland, residents are weighing up the costs and benefits of the farm. SSF hasdonated more than £300,000 to local causes, from school laptops to Shetland’s girls’ football team.View image in fullscreenFish Holm seen from the Shetland mainland.Photograph: Kirstie Clubb/The GuardianView image in fullscreenWilliam Cooper, whose home overlooks Fish Holm, says the row over the new farm has changed his opinion of the industry.Photograph: Kirstie Clubb/The Guardian“It’s a big employer and it pays good wages,” says William Cooper, a retired engineer from Mossbank, which overlooks Fish Holm. While his wife, Denise, is put off by images of sea lice infestations, he is unbothered by the environmental arguments but admits the row has changed his mind about the industry, despite the jobs.‘The Vikings looked at this view – can’t they just leave it?’: island split over plans for salmon farmRead more“The peerie [small] boats are heritage – how it’s always been done,” he says. “For Shetland to be known for just producing millions of salmon would be quite sad really.”SSF has declined to comment on Fish Holm, but says in a statement that it is committed to “coexisting with other marine users while delivering long-term benefits for the islands”. Karyn Lumsden, SSF’s head of communications, says the Fish Holm plans include vacating one site and adds: “One larger farm can also reduce overall seabed impact compared with several smaller farms producing the same volume of fish.”A spokesperson for Salmon Scotland, which represents the salmon farming industry, saysit is looking forward to updating Holyrood’s rural affairs and islands committee with the sector’s progress, including “improved survival and continued investment in fish health and welfare”.Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansFishing industryScotlandFish (Environment)Fish (Food)FishingConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were the second gift from Trump that Starmer has chosen to buy, havingpaid for a personalised necklacelast year.Official rules say the government should keep ministerial gifts worth more than £140 unless the minister in question decides to pay the value over that limit.Downing Street would not reveal the exact value of the cufflinks, which are understood to have been purchased as a gift for the prime minister’s son.Last year’s visit was acarefully managed affairduring which the president received the largest military ceremonial welcome for a state visit in living memory before being hosted by the king at Windsor Castle for a lavish dinner.Starmer gave the president a ministerial red box embossed with the presidential seal and title, and the first lady a silk scarf designed by Ukrainian children.In return he received a personalised silver necklace, personalised silver cufflinks and a personalised golf club. His wife, Victoria, received a pair of women’s cowboy boots.The Cabinet Office said last year Starmer had chosen to buy the necklace, but that the cufflinks, golf club and cowboy boots had all been retained by the department. The prime minister only recently decided to buy the cufflinks, according to officials.The records show he received a number of other gifts in September worth more than £140.They included a wooden carving from Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian National Authority; a personalised rugby shirt, leather boots and beer from the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese; and a display model of an AI supercomputer from the technology company Nvidia. All were retained by the department rather than being bought by Starmer.Ministerial gifts can occasionally cause diplomatic controversy, such as when Barack Obama gave Gordon Browna DVD box set of 25 classic American filmsduring the then prime minister’s visit to Washington in 2009. Brown in contrast had given the then president an ornamental pen holder crafted from the timbers of the anti-slavery ship HMS Gannet.Gifts from Trump have also previously caused upset, albeit in his private life.The actor Charlie Sheen told The Graham Norton Show in 2016 that Trump had given him fake diamond and platinum cufflinks embossed with “Trump” as a wedding present.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

He is one of the journalists now accused of tasking private investigators to use unlawful methods to secure stories.The claims form part of thelegal action brought by Doreen Lawrence, Stephen’s mother, and six other people against Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL), which publishes the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.ANL denies all the allegations, which include phone hacking, tapping and “blagging” – the use of deception to obtain information.In a combative appearance at the high court, Wright said he had been accused of the “most despicable allegation put to any journalist”, stating that the allegations were “absolute cobblers”.The high court has been played a recording of a private investigator, Christine Hart, in which she says she “100% blagged” information from Lawrence on Wright’s orders by pretending to be a journalist from the Guardian.ANL said in its written submissions that Hart has since denied carrying out any illegal activity on behalf of the publisher’s journalists.Wright said while he was aware of Hart, he remembered her as a freelance journalist who had pitched him stories that he did not use. He said he never asked her to “blag” information about Lawrence.“You’re scraping the barrel,” Wright told David Sherborne, the lead barrister acting for the claimants, who also include Prince Harry and Elton John. “[You’re] scraping the bottom of the cesspit.”In a written submission, Wright said he had the “utmost respect” forDoreen Lawrenceand was proud to think that she considered him a “professional ally”.“When I first learned of Lady Lawrence’s allegations against me, I was completely devastated,” he said. “To this day, I struggle to understand how she could be persuaded to take such a course of action.“I worried that her casting me on the side of the racist and corrupt could whip up worse than a Twitter mob and, having worried intensely about my family over the past three years, felt that I had to improve security measures at our home.“I have never bugged, burgled or ‘blagged’ information about Lady Lawrence, her family members, or her legal representatives. I have never asked anyone else to do any of these things for me.”Sherborne pointed to both Hart’s alleged admission and records of a £75 payment to her, with “Wright” as a reference. However, Wright said to the best of his knowledge, it did not relate to him.Wright denied Sherborne’s suggestion that he was a regular user of private investigators or that he had paid police officers for information. He said he was being portrayed as being “guilty until proven innocent”.Wright compared some of the accusations being made about corrupt payments to those made byCarl Beech, a man who made false accusations of murder and child sex abuse.“People can criticise me for some things,” Wright said. “I worked tirelessly for 25 years to help the Lawrence family to get justice for their son. This is nonsense. Mr Sherborne, you should be ashamed of yourself.”The case continues.Explore more on these topicsAssociated NewspapersNational newspapersDoreen LawrenceNewspapersDaily MailnewsShareReuse this content"

I think we felt that was safe enough at this stage for us to put the proposition forward to government for consideration,” he said.Mannion has apologised for the letter, saying it was “badly worded” and he “regretted the confusion, anxiety and concern” it created. He and Gorman said it was “intended to express a more general view in support of the principle of new towns”.They have since written to the government saying there were “fundamental flaws” with the planned new town in Adlington, and it was “unacceptable to Cheshire East council”.The Conservative group on the council has submitted a motion, to be debated next week, saying it no longer has confidence in the leader or deputy due to their original letter, and calling on them to resign.Opposition councillor Hayley Whitaker said the letter “sealed the fate for Adlington” and was written “with no consultation, no scrutiny, no public or councillor opinion”.A petition signed by more than 19,000 people opposing the new town was handed to the government in December.New set of forest towns to be built between Oxford and CambridgeRead moreThe housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, said decisions on new towns would be made “in the national interest” and not “based on the number of signatories to a petition in opposition”. The commitment to new towns is a flagship part of the government’s pledge to build 1.5m homes.Adlington, a village on the border of the Peak District, has a population of about 1,200, with the proposed new town on green belt land intended to ease the housing burden in neighbouring Stockport and Macclesfield.Critics have said it is the wrong type of housing in the wrong area, and it would create unnecessary “urban sprawl”. The leader of Stockport council likened it to someone in Westminster “throwing a dart at a map”.Unlike other new town proposals, the plan was designed by private developers Belport, rather than a local authority.“This is our home, and it’s now in somebody else’s hands – I think the whole village is fairly traumatised. None of us know where we stand. It’s really worrying for a lot of people,” said Aysha Hawcutt, who has lived in Adlington for 16 years with her husband and two sons.“It also makes you think, was there betrayal at some level? Who do you trust? What can you believe?”Mannion and Gorman have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsCheshireLocal governmentHousingPlanning policyLabourCommunitiesNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite periodic document dumps of the files since Congress mandated their release late last year, the justice department is still withholding about 3m files.Clinton’s comments, at theMunich security conference, came as she and her husband, Bill Clinton, the former president, prepare to give sworn depositions on the affair before the House oversight committee.New Mexico approves truth commission on alleged Jeffrey Epstein ranch abuseRead moreHillary Clinton is scheduled to testify on 26 February, while Bill will appear the day after. It will be the first appearance by a former president in front of a congressional panel in more than 40 years.Clinton, the former secretary of state, said she and her husband were being treated unfairly compared with other witnesses and were being singled out.“I think everybody should testify who was asked to testify,” she said in response to whether she thought Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Prince Andrew, should appear.“I just want it to be fair. I want everybody treated the same way. That’s not true for my husband and me, because [when] other witnesses were asked to testify, they gave written statements under oath.“We offered that [but] they want to pull us [in]. Why do they want to pull us into this? To divert attention from President Trump. This is not complicated.”Trump, who is mentioned thousands of times in the files released so far, told reporters in response to Clinton’s comments that he had been absolved.““I’ve been totally exonerated,” he said, speaking on Air Force One. “They’re getting pulled in, that’s their problem, we’ll have to see what happens. I watched her in Munich, and she seriously has Trump derangement syndrome.”Bill Clinton is also featured in the files, but says he cut off contact with the disgraced financier after information emerged of his sexual crimes against minors. The released files includephotos showing the former president in a hot poolwith Epstein along with a person the justice department described as a victim.Bill Clinton has denied wrongdoing and has also called for all the files to be released.The Clintonsagreed to give filmed behind-closed-door depositionson 3 February after committee members signaled they were ready to hold them in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena filed by James Comer, the committee’s Republican chair.Comer rebuffed the pair’s offer to provide written testimony under oath.Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 US presidential election to Trump, told the BBC that she had never met Epstein, but had met his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a jail sentence as a convicted co-conspirator in his sex-trafficking crimes, “on a few occasions”.“We have a very clear record that we’ve been willing to talk about, which my husband has said he took some rides on [Epstein’s] airplane for his charitable work,” she said.“I don’t recall ever meeting him. I did [meet Maxwell] on a few occasions, and thousands of people go to the Clinton Global Initiative (a program involving business and government leaders established by the former president’s Clinton Foundation.) So it’s not it’s not something that is really at the heart of what this matter is about. They are accused, and in both cases, were convicted, of horrific crimes against girls and women. That should be the focus.“We have nothing to hide,” she added. “We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly. We think sunlight is the best disinfectant.”The Clintons have called for their hearings to be held in public. Comer has said he is happy to hold public hearings in addition to the closed-door testimony.Explore more on these topicsHillary ClintonJeffrey EpsteinBill ClintonDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

That case would not be affected by the proposed settlement.But the settlement would eliminate some of the risk from an eventual and uncertain supreme court ruling – both for Bayer and for patients seeking damages.Germany-based Bayer, which acquired the Roundup maker Monsanto in 2018, disputes the assertion that the weedkiller’s key ingredient, glyphosate, can cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But the company has warned that mounting legal costs are threatening its ability to continue selling the product in US agricultural markets.“Litigation uncertainty has plagued the company for years, and this settlement gives the company a road to closure,” Bayer’s CEO, Bill Anderson, said on Tuesday.The proposed settlement was filed in St Louis circuit court in Missouri, home to Bayer’s North America crop science division and the state where many of the lawsuits have been brought. The settlement still needs the court’s approval.Explore more on these topicsBayerCancerPesticidesnewsShareReuse this content"

Then after being removed, the actor allegedly punched one male patron who was helping the bar manager, before returning and punching a second man in the nose.LaBeouf was then held down by bystanders until police arrived and he was taken to a hospital. He was subsequently discharged, arrested and charged with two counts of simple battery.Labeouf was ordered released on his own recognizance later Tuesday, just as the culmination of New Orleans’s weeks-long, annual celebration of carnival hit its climax. His next hearing in the case was tentatively scheduled for 19 March.Thousands of people, mostly in various costumes, gathered in and outside Royal Street Inn and Bar early Tuesday afternoon. A bartender and a bouncer at the establishment each said LeBeouf was not welcome back after his release from custody.The celebrity gossip outletTMZposted a video of LaBeouf, purportedly taken early Tuesday morning, in which he is shirtless and exchanging words with another person. The video then reportedly shows the actor being attended to by paramedics.Reports of LaBeouf engaging in unruly behavior across New Orleans have surfaced for several days. Robert Skuse, the doorman of Ms Mae’s, a local bar, toldthe Hollywood Reporterthe actor showed up in a “somewhat belligerent state”.“​​In the middle of the mayhem, he did the ‘Do you know who I am?’ bit,” Skuse said.LaBeouf was reportedly asked to leave after trying to get behind the bar and serve drinks to customers.LaBeouf haspreviously discussedhis struggles with sobriety, crediting fellow actors Mel Gibson, Sean Penn and Josh Brolin for their help. He attended court-mandated rehab after a 2017 arrest in Savannah, Georgia, an experience that inspired his semi-autobiographical film, Honey Boy.In 2020,FKA twigs, the English singer whose real name is Tahliah Barnett,suedLaBeouf for sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress, alleging a pattern of “relentless” abuse.In the lawsuit and in aninterviewwith the New York Times, Barnett said LaBeouf, whom she dated from 2018 to 2019 after meeting on the set of Honey Boy, knowingly exposed her to a sexually transmitted infection, attempted to strangle her and slammed her against a car.

China’s Jingye Group bought it out of receivership in early 2020, but announced last year that it was planning to shut the Scunthorpe steelworks amid losses of £700,000 a day.After Jingye rejected support to buy raw materials, the UK government stepped in withemergency legislation to take controlof the plant.Since then, daily losses have widened to £1.2m, with the total bill reaching £359m, according to figuresdisclosedto parliament last month.graphSteel industry analysts have questioned how long the government will keep propping up British Steel, as costs mount at a time when production levels in the wider UK steel industry have tumbled to the lowest level in more than a century.Gareth Stace, director general at industry body UK Steel, said deals such as the one with ERG were “essential to underpinning a sustainable turnaround” at British Steel.“Rail is a strategically vital, high-value product and central to British Steel’s long-term plan, as well as to the wider UK steel sector. Unlike more commoditised grades, rail requires advanced capability, consistent quality and long-term customer relationships. British Steel is a globally respected manufacturer with a strong international customer base,” Stace said.He called on the government to strengthen UK import safeguards and work on ensuring energy costs for UK steel producers matched those of their international competitors, adding: “Contracts alone cannot address the structural pressures facing the sector.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryManufacturing sectorRail industryTurkeyLincolnshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.View image in fullscreenMichael Wooldridge.Photograph: Steven May/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Live News.The scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”Despite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.This arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs withjagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.The problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a2025 surveyby the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”Wooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it hasinsufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”Explore more on these topicsScienceAI (artificial intelligence)Star TrekComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

This was in line with what economists had been expecting and was up from 5.1% in the three months to November.Joblessness in the UK has steadily risen since 2022, and businesses have complained that tax rises by Rachel Reeves in her last two budgets have exacerbated this, with rises in national insurance contributions (NICs) and the minimum wage causing particular issues.UK unemployment rate hits five-year high of 5.2% as wage growth slows – business liveRead moreEconomists said younger workers were bearing the brunt of this slowdown in hiring. Unemployment for 18- to 24-year-olds was 14% in the three months to December, the highest rate in five years – or nearly 11 years excluding the pandemic – amidconcerns that Britain is slipping down global league table for youth employment.Martin Beck, the chief economist at WPI Strategy, said: “Higher labour costs, reflecting last year’s increase in employer NICs and rises in the adult minimum wage appear to be weighing most heavily on entry-level hiring. At the same time, firms are likely reassessing junior roles in the face of rapid advances in AI.”UK unemployment chartIn the three months to December, wages excluding bonuses in Great Britain increased by 4.2%, easing from 4.4% the previous month.In the private sector, pay rose by 3.4%, the lowest level in five years, while wages in the public sector rose by 7.2%. Once adjusted for inflation, annual pay excluding bonuses rose by just 0.8% in October to December, the lowest rate since August 2023.Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “This slackening in pay growth is likely to gather momentum in the coming months as the downward pressure from mounting lay-offs and higher employment costs increasingly weakens workers’ bargaining position.”UK youth unemployment chartThe number of people on company payrolls also continued to fall, down 134,000 on a year ago, and by 46,000 over the quarter. On a monthly basis, payrolls fell by 11,000 in January.However, a sharp monthly decline reported in December compared with November was revised upwards by the ONS, from its original estimate of a fall of 43,000 to a fall of just 6,000.The figures suggest the Bank of England is likely to make another cut to interest rates by the spring, as inflationary pressures, such as higher wage growth, appear to be easing.The Bank has forecast that the unemployment rate will rise to 5.3% this year and that wage growth will moderate from 3.4% last year to 3.25% by the end of the year as inflation falls. At the its recent meeting earlier this month, the Bankkept rates on hold at 3.75%.Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at CapitalEconomics, said: “The lack of green shoots of recovery in the labour market and further fall in wage growth supports the idea that the Bank of England has at least a couple more interest rate cuts in its locker, with the chances of the next cut happening in March rather than April edging higher.”Inflation – which measures the pace of price rises – hit 3.4% in December, up from 3.2% a month earlier. The ONS will release data for January on Wednesday.The work and pensions secretary, Pat McFadden, said: “We know there is more to do to get people into jobs.“Our £1.5bn drive to tackle youth unemployment is a key priority and this month we announced that we’ll make it easier for young people to find and secure an apprenticeship, which comes on top of our investment to create 50,000 new apprenticeships.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsOffice for National StatisticsUnemployment and employment statisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their incomes, adjusted for rising shop prices, have flatlined, leaving them no better off than they were a year earlier.The most recent surveys of consumer confidencereveal a dismal pictureof households worried about growing debts and shrinking savings now that their incomes have flatlined.UK unemployment rate hits five-year high of 5.2% as wage growth coolsRead moreThere is also the looming threat of redundancy or more likely, the prospect of rival firms putting a block on hiring, which forces workers to stay in their current, possibly not very well-paid job.Unemployment rose to a fresh five-year high of 5.2%in the three months to December 2025, the Office for National Statistics said, reflecting a reluctance among employers to hold on to staff with little to do, in the hope of better times, or hire new people.UK unemployment chartHospitality and retail businesses blame the government for increasing business rates. Professional services firms say their investments in artificial intelligence make them think twice before advertising new jobs.Either way, at the end of last year, the UK employment market was a gloomy place for the average worker to go job hunting.In this environment, there would usually be some relief courtesy of the Bank of England. Officials in Threadneedle Street would be cutting interest rates to give the economy a lift.UK youth unemployment chartHowever, at its most recent meeting, the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC)held interest rates at 3.75%after a majority of the committee said they needed to be sure of eradicating rising inflation before they helped the economy.The economy expanded by only 0.1% in the three months to December, indicating that the UK’s growth rate was stagnant, much like the real wages growth of workers in the private sector.One of the extra costs faced by homeowners since the pandemic has been the jump in mortgage payments once they switch fixed-rate deals. Millions of homeowners have left behind mortgages with a 1.5% interest rate to sign contracts for 4% or more, adding hugely to their monthly bills.The Bank might have helped bring this cost down, at least for the many hundreds of thousands who will need to remortgage this year and also those who will in years to come.Consumer confidence is forward-looking. People think about rising mortgage payments, job insecurity and the likelihood of a decent pay rise when pollsters ask them how they feel about their personal finances.For Rachel Reeves there is the potential for a turnaround this year. The jobs data showed a rise in the number of people finding a job after a long period of inactivity. The claimant count also fell from a year ago, indicating that fewer people are claiming work-related benefits.More broadly, inflation is on track to fall and once that trend is considered to be fixed by the MPC, interest rates will fall again.By the end of the year, the UK could be in a much better place. But, if the cost of all this is persistently high unemployment, it is unlikely anyone will thank the chancellor.Explore more on these topicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

What will his distillery in whisky’s holy land look like?Catherine SlessorTue 17 Feb 2026 11.16 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 12.26 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on Google‘Idon’t like waste,” says Shigeru Ban. It’s a simple statement – yet it encapsulates everything about the Japanese architect’s work. He takes materials others might overlook or discard – from cardboard tubes to beer crates, styrofoam to shipping containers – and subjects them to a kind of alchemy, refining rough edges and transforming fragility into sturdiness.The outcome is a perpetually ingenious and curiously poetic scavenger architecture that finds beauty and purpose in the everyday. From high-end boutiques to housing for refugees, Ban’s buildings blur the lines between eastern and western design traditions, between the luxurious and the ordinary, and between what constitutes a temporary building and permanent one.The strength of a building has little to do with the strength of its materialsBut then Ban considers all buildings to be inherently temporary. “In a big city like Los Angeles or Tokyo,” he says, “large buildings can just disappear, especially in the commercial sector – torn down to make way for new ones that will make more money for developers. Whereas a building made of paper can be permanent, as long as people cherish it.”Recently awarded the 2026 American Institute of Architects Gold Medal, and due to give a lecture at the Royal Geographical Society in London this week, Ban is a globetrotter on the architectural circuit. But he is still consumed by his core mission to improve people’s lives, especially in areas of disaster and conflict. He is building a new hospital in Lviv, in the less war-ravaged west of Ukraine, using cross-laminated timber. “Ukraine has one of the biggest laminated timber factories in eastern Europe,” he says. “They used to export it to Canada and the US but now they can’t. So they’re looking for an opportunity to deploy it within Ukraine.”View image in fullscreenEmergency relief … cardboard tube housing with beer-crate foundations for the displaced population of Kobe after the 1995 earthquake.Photograph: Hiroyuki HiraiFor Ban, architecture is a set of flexible systems rather than fixed structures. It should be mobile and responsive. He knows buildings are exposed not only to human vicissitudes but also the cataclysmic impact of geology and weather. Japan is subject to natural disasters that can reshape cities in seconds. Its Meteorological Agency records earthquake activity: mostly low-level rumbles, but as ubiquitous as a spot of rain in the UK. And although its modern buildings are required to conform to the world’s most rigorous standards of seismic design, larger earthquakes can still be catastrophic.In the aftermath of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, which killed more than 5,000 people, Ban designed the Paper Dome, an ostensibly temporary structure to replace the city’s destroyed Takatori Catholic Church. Constructed in five weeks by volunteers working with donated materials, and featuring recycled cardboard tubes as columns, its elliptical shape was based on Bernini’s baroque church of Sant’Andrea al Quirinale in Rome. Over time it became a symbol of the city’s reconstruction, evolving into a community centre that hosted weddings, concerts, meetings and film shows. After 10 years, it was dismantled and shipped to the village of Taomi in Taiwan, which itself had endured an earthquake in 1999. “It’s still there,” says Ban.The idea that you might construct a building out of cardboard tubes invariably precipitates Proustian remembrances of Blue Peters past, where presenters wrestled with the insides of toilet rolls to contrive all manner of creations, from advent calendars toThunderbirds’ Tracy Island. Yet where others have a signature style, Ban has a signature material. The term “paper architect” is often disparagingly applied to architects given to theorising and proposing fanciful schemes but never actually building anything. In Ban’s case, it literally means he builds with paper.View image in fullscreen‘The government didn’t care about privacy’ … Shigeru Ban.Photograph: Hiroyuki Hirai“I started developing structures out of recycled paper in 1985, long before people started talking about environmental issues,” says Ban. Traditional Japanese buildings employ slidingshojiscreens, made from translucent rice paper stretched across timber frames. And Japan has a heritage of exquisite paper-making. But it’s quite a leap from that to something robust enough to hold up a roof.Ban started looking at the cardboard tubes that are a staple of the textile industry as cores for bolts of fabric. Rather like the insides of toilet rolls, you never see the tubes until the fabric has been exhausted, and then they are quickly discarded. “They were stronger than I expected so I started testing them more seriously,” he says. “I knew that the strength of a building has little to do with the strength of its materials. Concrete buildings can easily be destroyed by an earthquake while many centuries-old timber buildings survive.”The Christchurch authorities emailed saying: ‘Are you the architect who can design a temporary church free of charge?’Ban collaborated with renowned Japanese structural engineer Gengo Matsui, an expert in traditional materials such as bamboo, and their experimentation with cardboard tubes fed into the development of a new type of building system – one that was eventually approved by the Japanese Ministry of Construction. “Essentially,” says Ban, “I developed a new way of using an existing yet disregarded material.”As well as the Paper Dome, Ban devised simple, modular houses for Kobe’s Vietnamese community displaced by the 1995 earthquake. Walls fabricated from cardboard tubes were supported on foundations made of sandbag-filled beer crates, enclosed by a light roof of tent sheeting.He also designed lightweight partitioning made of cardboard tubes and fabric screens, for use in large halls where displaced citizens might take refuge. “People had to sleep on the floor without any privacy,” says Ban. “I believe privacy is the most basic human right, but the government didn’t care.” Now his partitioning system is officially employed all over Japan in evacuation or disaster relief scenarios. It was even used after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine when refugees started fleeing into neighbouring countries.View image in fullscreenThe stuff of drams … how Ban’s timber distillery in Speyside will look.Illustration: Shigeru Ban ArchitectsThe experience led Ban to establish the Voluntary Architects’ Network, an NGO that develops temporary housing and other buildings for victims of natural disasters and conflicts, from Pakistan to Altadena. Employing low-cost, recyclable local materials and local labour, it aims to bridge the gap between immediate disaster relief and the construction of more permanent structures. Sometimes Ban is directly commissioned, other times he just goes where he thinks he is needed.Larger-scale buildings have included a temporary concert hall for L’Aquila in central Italy, to supportthe post-earthquake reconstructionof a city famous for its classical music scene. The project was jointly announced by the Italian and Japanese governments at the2009 G8 summit, relocated to L’Aquila, where a bemused Silvio Berlusconi brandished a section of one of Ban’s cardboard tubes.You could almost say that cardboard has an affinity with the divine. The now famousCardboard Cathedralin Christchurch, New Zealand, was constructed in the wake of the 2011 earthquake, which badly damaged the city’s 19th-century cathedral designed by English gothic revivalist George Gilbert Scott. “I got an email from the Christchurch authorities,” Ban recalls. “They said, ‘You must be the architect who can design a temporary church free of charge.’” An array of cardboard tubes 60cm in diameter, reinforced with laminated timber, make up the cathedral’s soaring A-frame. Above the altar, there’s even a tubular cardboard cross.View image in fullscreenMeringue peaked roof … Centre Pompidou-Metz, France.Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty ImagesIt’s not all hair-shirt pragmatism, though. Ban is equally at home in Ginza, Tokyo’s insanely glamorous shopping district, contriving luxury boutiques for fashion houses – or in Speyside in the Scottish Highlands, the holy land of whisky, where he is currently working on a distillery with an elaborately arboreal structure that would not look out of place in The Lord of the Rings. He has also designed an art museum with a distinctive basket-weave facade in the Colorado ski resort of Aspen, and an outpost of Paris’s Pompidou Centre in the eastern French city of Metz, topped by a meringue peaked roof that seems to have more in common with the extravagances of Frank Gehry.But Ban’s outlook is not that of a typical starchitect. “Architects work mainly for people with wealth and power,” he says. “And because wealth and power are invisible, we’re hired to create monuments to them. I want to use my experience not only for the privileged, but also for the person who has seen their home destroyed.”Ban is currently working on the reconstruction of houses on Japan’s Noto Peninsula, which were destroyed by an earthquake on New Year’s Day 2024 that killed more than 700 people. It will incorporate timber recycled from a vast ring-shaped installation designed for last year’sOsaka Expoby fellow Japanese architectSou Fujimoto. The original official plan was to dismantle and burn what was billed as the world’s largest timber structure. “But I thought that was such a waste,” says Ban. “So I proposed some of the timber be used in post-earthquake reconstruction. We’re also salvaging roof tiles and other material from ruined houses.” As ever, waste not, want not.Shigeru Ban Complete Works 1985-Todayis published by Taschen.

He has been depressed, intoxicated, suicidal and horny in equal measure, all of which was topped off in the most recent episode with a sweaty bunk-up with a guy in a club.How do we know he’s fully going off the rails? That’s easy: the club scene was directly preceded by a shot of Muck in the shower, singing For He is an Englishman from HMS Pinafore. And he hasn’t been the only one lately. InThe Night Manager,Hugh Laurie burst into a rousing verse of the song. You probably don’t need reminding that his character Richard Roper is, to put it mildly, a bit of a bad egg.Perhaps this is to be expected. Although the works ofGilbert and Sullivanhave gained a reputation for being chummy, collegiate and a little pompous, For He is an Englishman is in fact a bitingly satirical piece of faux-patriotism. Although it sounds like something to be bellowed by tipsy Last Night of the Proms poshos, the song speaks to the kind of blind nationalism that bases exceptionalism purely on the location of one’s birth. “For he might have been a Roosian, a French, or Turk or Proosian,” it goes, “But in spite of all temptations to belong to other nations, he remains an Englishman.”No wonder the song has become the rallying cry of the rich and horrible. Both Muck and Roper’s sense of superiority by birthright drips out of them. There aren’t many songs that can nail this precise feeling with the sheer accuracy of For He is an Englishman.What’s interesting, though, is how its use has evolved over time. Prior to this year’s sudden burst, the song has been used here and there on television, and not always to denote villainy. Perhaps the best-known example is the episode ofThe West Wingthat paraphrases the song in its title, season two’s And It’s Surely to their Credit. Here, a couple of characters bicker about the song, unable to decide whether it is from HMS Pinafore or The Pirates of Penzance, before the episode concludes with most of the main cast singing it togetherIn all honesty it’s a little empty. The song is performed without any real thematic cohesion; it is simply a reference that allows some vaguely insufferable people to show everyone how well versed in musicals they are.View image in fullscreenSideshow Bob’s rendition to Bart Simpson is the gold standard performance of the tune.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarAnother show to feature the song without much meaning is House; in the opening episode of season six Dr House sings the song to mask the noise of him faking a urine sample. The wink here, of course, is that the actor who played House was actually an Englishman, Hugh Laurie, who clearly likes this song more than anything else on Earth. In fact, it is highly possible that Laurie is now the only actor to have performed this song twice on two different shows. He is almost certainly the only actor who has performed it in two different accents; in his native English inThe Night Manager, and in the chewy, geographically nonspecific American accent he had to adopt for House.However, despite this rush of new renditions, the gold standard for televisual For He is an Englishman usage remains The Simpsons’s Cape Feare, arguably the best episode of the best series ever made. After the rake joke, and the tattoo joke, and the “Bart, you want some brownie?” joke comes the moment where Bart Simpson stalls for time by flattering Sideshow Bob’s ego, asking him to perform HMS Pinafore in its entirety. He obliges, and his performance ends with a rousing blast of For He is an Englishman, concluding with a round of applause and a drop-down union jack.It’s perfect because it hits every aspect of the song with total ease. It has the pomposity ofThe West Wing, and exposes Sideshow Bob’s anglophile pretensions. Also, let’s not forget that Sideshow Bob is an utter bastard, so it covers the villain quadrant too.Obviously the fact that so many baddies are singing the song in 2026 speaks to how the UK is perceived at the moment – isolated, stuck in the past and out of touch, yet still oddly full of itself – but we still have some way to go before we can top The Simpsons. Perhaps let’s make Hugh Laurie stand on a rake when The Night Manager returns.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionKit HaringtonThe Night ManagerGilbert and SullivanThe West WingThe SimpsonsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A corporate takeover suddenly means his ex-wife Dame V (Cantopop diva Sammi Cheng) is in charge and intent on replacing the regular hostesses there to schmooze clients with her “fighter jet” upgrades.No sooner do Foon and V start sparring about how the joint should be run, then they discover there’s a takeover within the takeover: playboy Prince Fung (Chun Yip Lo), V’s partner on the original deal, does the dirty on her and pulls out. As the contract’s guarantor, either V stumps up the $80m needed to buy EJ, or she is liable for the cancellation fee – when Fung plans to swoop in for a pittance. So the perennial soft touch Foon agrees to team up with his no-nonsense ex, all for the sake of saving nostalgic razzle-dazzle.Directed by Jack Ng – also responsible for2023’s smash legal drama A Guilty Conscience– Night King feels unfortunately retrograde in its parading of what the tabloids once called a “bevy of beauties”; they are only slightly individuated and mostly foils for catty comedy served up by Foon and his right-hand man Turf (Yeung Wai Lun). Compared to the likes of Hustlers, it’s also strangely coy and sanitised about what this courtesan work entails. The absence of rawness and chemistry carries over into V (the only truly proactive woman here) and Foon’s rekindled relationship; their spats about past disappointments and sharing “woes, not wealth” are nearly as contrived as the hostesses’ chat-up patter.The film juggles a number of plotlines – the race for Foon and the girls to up their numbers, a love triangle between him, V and a spare-wheel hostess (Fish Liew), and a late-breaking Ocean’s 11-style scam that is a foregone conclusion – without satisfactorily closing any. There’s the odd sharp line: “Bring them there and back again, like hobbits,” says Foon of the punters. But in terms of getting into the nitty-gritty of the hospitality and sex trades, this lounge-lizard glass-tip to bygone Kowloon feels behind the times.Night King is in UK and Irish cinemas from 20 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsHong KongDrama filmsAsia PacificComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The McManus brothers’ Redux Redux is a decently handled example from the low-budget end. It traps a bereaved mother and a bratty tearaway in a Sisyphean revenge cycle, playing like an intimate version of Terminator where the credibility of 12-step grief recovery, rather than the future of humanity, is what’s at stake.Actually, Redux Redux is technically a multiverse film. Hailing from the only universe where multiverse travel has become possible, Irene (played by the directors’ sister Michaela McManus) uses what looks like a banged-up gas boiler to skip between different timelines. But there is one constant: she always ends up murdering Neville (Jeremy Holm), the short-order cook and child-killer who abducted her daughter. She hopes to find the one multiverse where her daughter is still alive. Instead, on her umpteenth payback, she interrupts Neville with 15-year-old Mia (Stella Marcus) cable-tied in his backroom.The loop functions nicely as a metaphor for the repetition-compulsion of trauma, with Irene locked into hatred, and her new ward showing unsettling enthusiasm for their business. Despite the temporal trimmings and some early jinks with the fellow grief survivor Jonathan (Jim Cummings) Irene serially picks up, the McManuses settle into a linear affair that doesn’t overly dally with the kinks and paradoxes of time/multiverse travel. It’s essentially centred on Mia’s attempts to give Irene the slip, as well as fleshing out (arguably not enough) the “underground railway” infrastructure for multiverse travel.The upside of this straightforwardness is a certain fleet-footed confidence as the McManuses imbue the road runs and shootouts, echoing through eternity, with aChristopher Nolan-esque inexorability. But if it has the style, the substance isn’t fully present until the closing act, which finally starts to make the timeline convolutions collide fully with the protagonist’s broken psyche. If it’s not quite devious enough overall, Redux Redux still opens up a punchy murder-revenge side alley for the genre.Redux Redux is on digital platforms from 23 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The victim’s last words were: “Film it!”Mehraneh Salimian graduated from art school the same day, and that final wish guided her and her partner, Amin Pakparvar, to make their documentary short premiering at theBerlin film festivalon Tuesday. Memories of a Window is dedicated to the slain woman,Shirin Alizadeh, and the role of amateur videos in recording and emboldening dissent in Iran.View image in fullscreenA man paints Freedom on a wall.Photograph: Anonymous archival footageNow film students in Chicago, Salimian and Pakparvar worked from a large trove of anonymous smartphone videos – they estimate they viewed about 2,000 clips – as well as their own footage gathered in Tehran during the 2022-23“Woman, Life, Freedom”uprising.“We’re hoping that we can isolate this period of time in Iranian history. Although there has since been even more brutality happening, more violence, that period was important too,” says Salimian, 26.In their film, they highlight the unique perspective of people filming from the purported safety behind car or home windows to hold authorities to account and challenge official narratives of violent incidents – a technique also used recently duringanti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.“It was a great tension between the lies or false information the state media was presenting of the movement and what we were experiencing,” says Salimian.“Protesters started filming the events and they anonymously uploaded them online. It was like a movement happening from behind windows.”Salimian describes that space as “like a threshold, a site that was not in the street, but did not have the safety of the home”.View image in fullscreenUnable to attend … the directors Amin Pakparvar, left, and Mehraneh Salimian.Composite: Courtesy: Berlin Film Festival“Shirin was one of the people who was shooting the events from behind her window when she was shot and killed,” on 22 September 2022, she says. “I was very, very moved. It shook me to the core.”Alizadeh was in a car driven by her husband, with two other travel companions, when they saw protesters being shot dead in the street in the north-eastern town of Salman Shahr as they sought to drive back to their home city of Isfahan. Her smartphone footage of the throng of demonstrators as security forces opened fire features prominently in the film, along with her command to one of the fellow passengers, “Film it!” as a woman appeared to lie on the roadside shot dead.Seconds later, at least one bullet pierced the rear window of the car and hit 36-year-old Alizadeh in the neck and head, according to Amnesty International. She died in hospital.Those distressing images are intercut with rousing scenes shot by Salimian and Pakparvar, 28, from their flat during the same period, in which neighbours join a chorus of anti-regime protest songs from their own apartments.It’s their courage that is contagious and although they have been suppressed, they see the value of uprising again and again“For decades Iranians have been protesting and every time their voices have been suppressed and censored. But a couple of years after that, they protested again in higher numbers,” says Pakparvar. “It’s their courage that is contagious and although they have been suppressed, they see the value of uprising again and again.”The protests evolved from a focus on restrictions of women’s rights, including the compulsory hijab, toward the more broad-based movement that erupted in recent months. With it came aninternet blackoutby the authorities to prevent the sharing of such videos, says Pakparvar, as well ashorrific violence against demonstratorsin which thousands died.“This is a strategy of state and it’s kind of working but not fully. There wereStarlink satellitesthat people managed to use” to distribute images, he says. “Every day we see more and more videos of the massacre. It’s heartbreaking.”The film-makers say they will be unable to attend the premiere in Berlin because they are in the US on student visas, and would be barred from returning under thetravel banreimposed by President Trump in 2025. But they will join the presentation by video link.Watch a clip from Memories of a WindowThe feedback in Chicago has already confirmed the film’s resonance, they say, with fellow students comparing it toChina under the Covid lockdownand US activism during theBlack Lives Mattermovement. “It shows that we are living in a very vulnerable moment internationally and people are looking for freedom in various contexts,” says Pakparvar.Both are optimistic they will one day return to a free and democratic Iran. “We are pretty hopeful to be honest. They can’t control it any more,”Pakparvar says of the regime.“Maybe if you had asked us 10 years ago, we would have had no general sense of what kind of freedom we want. But now it’s crystal clear. We know our rights, we know the goal, and we know the values that we want in our life and in our home country. You see millions of people are aware of that and we’re moving toward it.”The Berlin festival haslong championed Iran’s dissident film-makers. On opening night on Thursday, Iranian creatives walked the red carpet holding “Free Iran” signs. The next day, Iranian independent film-makers staged a performance with volunteers lying on the ground to symbolise those killed during the January protests.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festival 2026ProtestIranDocumentary filmsMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsActivismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The subject itself and the film’s attitude towards it, its editorial slant, are habitually plain enough and the procedure is metonymic: the camera focuses on a part, and the whole is illuminated by implication. Often they have a sexed-up, quirky story to tell, which might mean a selective and sneakily tendentious approach to editing the material. But that is not quite the case with the films ofFrederick Wiseman. His colossal, immersive movies about ordinary people and ordinary lives enclosed in some kind of institution, and characterised by the absence of voiceovers, intertitles or the off-camera directorial presence of the interviewing voice, are not amenable to the elevator pitch; they are the entire elevator shaft itself, and the whole building that houses it.Whereas epic-length films might be generally held to be appropriate for big and distinctively historical subjects, such as Claude Lanzmann’s Shoah or Marcel Ophüls’s The Sorrow and the Pity, Wiseman applies the maximal approach to static cross-section studies of sometimes less obviously momentous topics such as Paris’sCrazy Horsenightclub or the French restaurantLe Bois Sans Feuilles. However his greatest works are top-to-bottom body-politic pictures of public institutions, huge, intricate constructions of unglamour; his movies themselves were virtual institutions, movie-edifices mirroring their subjects in architectural form and indeed almost always funded by one particular public institution: PBS, the Public Broadcasting System.View image in fullscreenLike Kafka’s  Castle … Welfare (1975).Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyTiticut Follies (1967) is about the life of Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Massachusetts, with the title alluding, with a hint of the Marat/Sade, to the hospital’s annual revue. Essene (1972) is about a Benedictine monastery, and Primate (1974) about a primate research centre. The 1986-7 tetralogy Blind, Deaf, Adjustment & Work and Multi-Handicapped is about the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, while his gigantic and gigantically sombre Near Death (1989), running at six hours, is about a hospital’s intensive care unit.View image in fullscreenFrederick Wiseman in 2024.Photograph: MediaPunch/ShutterstockHis masterpiece is arguablyWelfare, from 1975, a huge study of the social provision bureaucracy in New York whose title has an irony as vast and inscrutable as the place itself. (A British equivalent might be called Benefits.) We see a wide array of people, stressed officials, security guards and desperate claimants; Wiseman shows that the welfare office, like Kafka’s Castle, both imprisons and repels them; they cannot penetrate it – or escape it.Watching a Wiseman documentary is to feel that you are encountering a huge archive resource, a massive audio-visual database from which you are at liberty to make your own edits and selections. It is arguably a uniquely empowering and valuable approach, though others might feel that a Wiseman documentary, at once huge and unsignposted, can overwhelm and doesn’t necessarily provoke any great change in the institutions being shown.My own favourite among Wiseman’s films ishis rich and vibrant In Jackson Heightsfrom 2015, an ethnographic study of a diverse New York community, under pressure from gentrification, and the title’s first word is important: you really do feel that you are in this place, in some real-time, unedited sense. Wiseman’s films were monuments to human suffering and human challenge and human potential.Explore more on these topicsFilmFrederick WisemanDocumentary filmscommentShareReuse this content"

And we’re not the only onesJames BalmontTue 17 Feb 2026 03.38 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 03.40 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWhen I joined the band Swim Deep 13 years ago, my dreams were much like those of any young musician: to play Glastonbury, to tour America and to hear our music on the radio – all of which we’ve managed to achieve. But what I hadn’t counted on was finding a fanbase inChina. Despite us never having knowingly released our music there, Swim Deep recently returned triumphant from our fourth run of shows on Chinese soil in barely 10 years, and we’re not the only British indie band benefiting from this unexpected opportunity.View image in fullscreenWay beyond … Craig Dyer of the Underground Youth, on tour in China.Photograph: Courtesy: The Underground YouthChina has had an enthusiasm for British and Irish pop acts for years, long before its ¥500bn (£531m) music industry overtook France to becomethe world’s fifth largestin 2023. Jessie J became a phenomenon after winning the country’s premier singing competition in 2018, while Westlife have spent decades playing to thousands in Chinese arenas and stadiums. But less heralded is a growing interest in grassroots UK indie bands, for whom the unexpected demand – and promise of excellent pre-gig catering – presents a financial and spiritual lifeline as returns increasingly diminish on home soil.The Underground Youth, formed in Blackpool in 2008, have spent more than 15 years “slogging night after night through small clubs in the UK and Europe”, says frontman Craig Dyer. Twelve albums in, Dyer says that touring at home is no longer financially viable, with accommodation and catering costs often outstripping performance fees.In China, the experience is quite different. Tours are often pitched to artists as all-inclusive offers, with promoters taking on a financial risk by booking large venues and covering internal travel, hotels and hot meals on top of a multishow fee – a risk they’re happy to take, because of the passion for British artists among Chinese fans. “It’s some of the best treatment we’ve had,” says Dyer, citing the 14 gigs they’ve played there since 2019. “We’re in nice hotels, being taken out for meals, and having small cares taken care of without thinking. And the professional level of the venues goes above and beyond what we’re used to.”View image in fullscreenGone shopping … Nicholas Wood (left) and Kat Day (right) of the KVB, in China.Photograph: Courtesy: The KVBFor Kat Day of Manchester-based darkwave duothe KVB, the second point is particularly encouraging: “We’re an audiovisual band, and the venues in China are often equipped with beautiful LED screens. I wish we had the funding to make our venues this good.” It’s not just the technical capabilities that are impressive, either. “Venues are often in shopping centres, which is quite genius,” she continues. In the UK, she says, “all of our venues are getting shut down – Moth Club [in Hackney] is fighting tooth and nail to keep open. But who’s going to complain about noise in a shopping centre?”Swim Deep’s first gig in China, in 2014, was bizarre: we had arrived in Hong Kong to discover that the venue was an Italian restaurant with all the tables and chairs pushed to the side. But on the mainland, we’ve mostly encountered ultra-modern spaces like those Dyer and Day enthuse about. And like them, we find our audience numbers in China often far surpass what we’d expect to find at home. In September 2019, our biggest UK festival show took place at 110 Above in Leicestershire, in front of a crowd of 500. A few months later, we played to 10,000 people at sunset on the main stage at Strawberry music festival in Guangzhou; we were the only UK act on the bill.Sea Power, who formed as British Sea Power in Reading in the mid-90s, have had similar success. Their first visit to Beijing was a “catastrophe”, says frontman Jan Scott Wilkinson – the band had arrived to find the festival they had been booked for was mysteriously cancelled, so they instead went to the Great Wall to play acoustically to some “very bemused local families”. But in May 2025, four new headline shows turned to six after tickets sold out within hours. “We were playing up to 3,000 capacity venues,” Wilkinson says. “It was like playing in London every night.” The band have two separate trips planned in 2026 – a festival in May, and a dozen further shows later on. “We’re old. We’re no longer desperately trying to break or grow,” Wilkinson says. “So it’s a nice surprise to do something like this and be treated like kings.”View image in fullscreenSea Power on tour in China, 2025.Photograph: YuTheir popularity is easily explained: in 2019 Sea Power scored video game Disco Elysium, which “deals with communism, capitalism and all kinds of philosophies and political thoughts”, says Wilkinson, and was anunexpected hit in China. But for other bands, the source of their Chinese fandom isn’t well known, especially as western platforms such as Spotify and Instagram are blocked in the country. “We were told that fans liked us because we looked like a couple from one of these Chinese soap operas,” says Day of the KVB. Galway’s NewDad, meanwhile, went viral on Rednote in 2024, with the Chinese social media platform flooded with makeup tutorials recreating the look of the porcelain doll on their Madra album cover.Levek Lee has travelled thousands of miles from her native Guangdong to huge cities, to see British bands such as Wolf Alice and Ride – and her personal experience offers some insight into Chinese fans’ engagement with western music. Having discovered acts like Jake Bugg and Swim Deep via the algorithm of now defunct Chinese streaming platform Xiami Music in the 2010s, she began importing records from UK stores such as Banquet Records in Kingston upon Thames, often waiting for a month or more for purchases to arrive. Studying in Sheffield for her postgraduate degree cemented her affinity with the “spirit of rebellion” embedded in British music and fashion.“I enjoyed Chinese music but it tended to be more mainstream and pop-oriented,” she says. “But British indie music felt like a closer expression of my authentic self. I think Chinese music fans are also constantly searching for that kind of distinctiveness.” Furthermore, “I think [the success] also has something to do with the British music industry: there are loads and loads of bands out there, so there is something for everyone.”View image in fullscreenSwim Deep in Guangzhou, 2019.Photograph: HasongZipping through China via ultra-efficient bullet train is an eye-opening experience for UK artists; stories of Wuhan jam sessions with mohawk-wearing Chinese punks, meet-cutes with Chinese indie legends Carsick Cars, panda spotting in Chengdu and trips to subterranean Shanghai clubs that feel “like The Matrix” are among the highlights these bands share with me. After-show encounters with queues of excited fans bearing armfuls of merch and handmade gifts are no less cherished. But not every aspect of touring in China is liberating.“In Nanjing, our tour manager came backstage with two police officers who wanted to run through the setlist and our understanding of the law,” says Dyer. “I had to sign documents saying that I wouldn’t swear, get naked, endanger anyone in the crowd or say anything negative about the regime.” All lyrics must be submitted for approval before an artist’s arrival in China, to ensure compliance with local censorship laws. The process can result in well-known songs being denied without explanation. “All well and good,” says Dyer. “But it’s a bit of a mood killer 15 minutes before you go on stage.”‘It’s like oxygen – it’s everywhere!’ Why Korea is hot for trot, the cheesiest pop imaginableRead moreBureaucracy aside, UK artists are broadly enthusiastic about their Chinese touring experiences, with the avid work of independent promoters includingSo Ready Presents,Mentha Project,Haze Soundsand Blank Joy central to those experiences. With British acts including Shame, Matt Maltese and Caroline all playing China this year, the bookings show no sign of abating; and with the promise of visa-free travel for UK citizens, artists may soon find themselves with company on their outbound flights.“I feel absolutely blessed that we can go to these places and meet these people who are so passionate and so kind,” says Day. “It’s special. There’s a lot of animosity towards China, but I think people need to go and see it for themselves.”Swim Deep’s fifth album,Hum, is released on 19 June on Submarine Cat Records.Explore more on these topicsIndiePop and rockChinaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her ex-husband, Dominique, who will almost certainly be in jail for the rest of his life for drugging and raping his wife and recruiting 50 men over the internet to do likewise, takes his place among the monsters of our age. In his absence, the reader may experience a version of what happened in Gisèle Pelicot’s own family – namely, the misdirection of anger towards her.I have read enough books by female survivors of male sexual violence to say with confidence that Hymn to Life is unique. Pelicot – she decided to keep her married name in the interests of giving those of her grandchildren who share it a way to be proud rather than ashamed – was 67 when her husband of almost 50 years was arrested in 2020 for upskirting women in a supermarket in Carpentras, a small town in the south-east ofFrancenear the couple’s retirement home in the village of Mazan. When the police investigation uncovered a cache of videos and photos in which an unconscious Pelicot was shown being sexually assaulted by scores of men, she entered a nightmare.A Hymn to Life is alive with the kind of detail that wouldn’t look out of place in a good novel, but it’s the expression it gives to something glimpsed at during the trial that makes it so singular; namely, the transformation of Gisèle Pelicot from a self-avowedly ordinary woman, “content with my little life”, into a figure of astonishing power. After her husband’s arrest, she moved from Mazan to the Île de Ré, where in an effort to share her state of mind with new friends she told them she’d “been struck head-on by a high speed train”. (In a moment of grim humour, one neighbour took her literally and remarked, “the surgeon who had rebuilt my face had done an excellent job”.) Detailing what it took to emerge from this state to become a national – if not global – icon is the unsparing mission of the book.Part of Pelicot’s renewal entailed confronting a question that lurked in the minds of millions of observers during her husband’s trial: how could she not have known? She writes wretchedly of “the shame of having understood nothing – of feeling like an idiot in the eyes of others, and in my own.”. To that end, the book is a detective story in which the reader accompanies Pelicot back through her memories in search of clues overlooked. Was it significant that her husband came from a violent, sexually abusive family governed by a father who brutalised them? Was his behaviour linked to “our patriarchal, sexist society” – words, she writes, “I would never have uttered before”? Had her own beloved mother not died of cancer when Gisèle was nine, might she have been less quick to marry this person?The worst thing about being a victim, she writes, is being lectured – by her children, by court psychologists, by the pressBoth Pelicot and her husband are from rural backgrounds two generations removed from poverty. But while Dominique struggled to stay employed, Pelicot thrived, rising from an entry level job as a secretary at an energy company to a management position. She wonders if her success fuelled her husband’s resentment. And then there was the couple’s sex life. Sifting for evidence, she puts before us Dominique’s decades-old request for anal sex and to film them in bed. If she had indulged him, she wonders, might his offences have been forestalled?This last thought experiment will be recognised by anyone who has been involved with an abuser and pursued the logic that by acting differently, they might’ve altered the outcome. Or as Pelicot puts it: “I might have prevented it all, I might have saved us.” In the days and weeks after her husband’s crimes were revealed, she sought refuge in memories of the happy times, urging her three children to remember that Dominique had been a good dad, a form of denial that upset them so violently that for a while, of her three kids, two weren’t speaking to her. (They have since reconciled).The most serious rift was with her daughter, Caroline, who has written her own memoir and with whom Pelicot was at loggerheads for months. Whereas Caroline “broke down”, growing so distraught she spent a night in a psychiatric unit, her mother returned home from the police station and did her husband’s laundry. “Putting on a brave face was all I knew how to do,” writes Pelicot, but it went further than that. When the weather took a turn for the worse, she worried that Dominique would be cold in jail and dropped off a sweater. “What is left for a woman my age,” she laments, “when she doesn’t have a husband any more, just her children and grandchildren?”I’ll confess, this is where I lost it; the abject thrust of a sentiment in which Pelicot seems to register the loss of a husband – any husband – more forcefully than the violence her actual husband had done to her. She explains that she is of a generation of women for whom, “the principal axis of our lives was the man we had married”, and that this conditioning can’t be undone overnight. If we’re angry with Pelicot, she’s angry right back. The worst thing about being a victim, she writes, is being lectured – by her children, by court psychologists, by the press – that there’s a right and wrong way to do it. How dare we, she implies, and of course she is right.The trial took place in 2024 and occupies only the last fifth of the book; “It was those bastards I wanted in the spotlight, not me,” she writes of her decision to open proceedings to the public, giving rise to her famous statement and the subtitle of the book, “shame has to change sides”. She wrestles with the word “dignified”, often used to describe her in that period and which she finds coded and judgmental – another incitement to silence. While the horrific rape videos play in court, Pelicot stares fixedly at her phone, scrolling through happy photos of her grandkids. Her courage, she writes, comes from the memory of love from her mother and from the women who gather outside the court every day to support her. “This crowd saved me.”By the end of the book, by feeling her “way forward at my own pace”, she reaches a place where she is able “slowly and painfully” to let her husband go. He is “a pathetic creep”, she writes, but she won’t be bullied into arriving at someone else’s conclusion. “I know my story has fuelled disgust for men, but it has not done that for me.” The memoir ends not only in defiance of her abusers, but of those observers who would bend her story to a different, more strident conclusion. Instead, this: she meets a man, Jean-Loup, falls in love and moves in with him. What can one possibly say but bravo? “The feeling persists: love is not dead.”A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides by Gisèle Pelicot, translated by Natasha Lehrer and Ruth Diver, is published by Bodley Head (£22).

Her ingenious, Booker-longlistedLove and Other Thought Experimentswas structured around philosophical thought experiments, from Pascal’s Wager to Descartes’ Demon, with a chapter narrated by an ant living inside a character’s brain.The Schoolhouseexplored the ethics of self-directed schooling and of policing in a complicated cross-period procedural. Now she turns her attention to questions of justice, freedom and power in the 1970s United States, with a tripartite structure bringing together three women – two real and one imagined.It’s 1971: the Manson Family have just been found guilty and hundreds of thousands are marching against the Vietnam war. In the Netherlands, 25-year-old Andrea Dworkin escapes her abusive husband and attends a debate between Chomsky and Foucault on justice and power. Back in the US, the poet Muriel Rukeyser throws herself into protesting once again, though her lover, the literary agent Monica McCall, tells her rightly that her health won’t stand it. The third character is loosely based on the family history of Ward’s own Korean-American wife.Phyllis Patterson welcomes her son home to rural Illinois from the army base in South Korea, and attempts to build a relationship with her new Korean daughter-in-law and grandchildren. All three women are testing their own capacity for justice in an unjust world.It’s a clever idea for a novel, using the connections between the women as hinge points. Andrea goes on to become Muriel’s assistant, though their relationship never quite takes off on the page. And in the background is the imprisoned South Korean poet Kim Chi-ha. Muriel campaigns for his release and discovers a connection between him and Phyllis’s daughter-in-law, June, that enables Ward to draw Phyllis and Muriel’s stories together in the rather brilliant but also chaotically accelerated denouement.The tripartite structure generates problems for Ward to solve. The shifting perspectives mean that the individual sections can sometimes have the unsatisfactoriness of annual catchups with friends, rather than the intimacy of shared daily lives, especially as the years pass and we end up in 1975. It becomes harder to care about Andrea in particular, as she’s glimpsed publishing book after book, and fighting for revolution. It’s also a challenge combining real and imagined people. Ward does an impressive job at making Andrea Dworkin talk, animating her into speech, but when she writes out her thoughts as stark declarative sentences I found it awkwardly fake in ways I might not have with a made-up character. “She thought, This is it. This is my time. I am alive and I have work to do. I must start now.”The gain of the structure is the sense of a world unfolding in parallel across continents, as these women grapple with the shared dilemma of how to rise to the challenge of tolerance and fellowship. The real triumph of the book is Phyllis: a generous but querulous housewife who came into her own in the war, and now shares her bedroom with a chicken called Dolly. When Phyllis’s husband Boyd dies through an act of sacrifice on June’s behalf, Phyllis becomes aware of “anger like a stone in your stomach”, making it hard to forgive June.Phyllis’s achievement is finally to see her own cornfield in rural Illinois through June’s eyes, understanding that June stares at this field with such intensity because she misses her home landscape. This is movingly conveyed by Ward, as she shows Phyllis finally ridding herself of her stone, coming to understand that her daughter-in-law is as bright and free-spirited and quixotically determined as she is. It’s Soozie, Phyllis’s granddaughter, who brings them together, and who will take on the mantle of both women in the next generation. And the generosity required to sit back, and to let the next generation do it better, is shown in Muriel’s story too, as she accepts that she may fail the world and the world may fail her, but the work will be done regardless.There’s not much hope for justice in the wider world in this novel, any more than there is in ours now, and Ward seems quite consciously to be writing from one world to another. Andrea Dworkin learns here from Foucault and Chomsky between them that justice is always an instrument of power. Did Dworkin and Rukeyser and their circles succeed in making the world a little bit more just and a little bit more free, by placing a little bit more power in the right hands? Ward seems to be dramatising her own ambivalence about whether to rage against the loss of revolutionary activism and try to revive it, or to accept that loss and focus on justice in our personal lives. Certainly, the reverberations of revolution are felt by Phyllis, as she sees “how her life was part of these lives, that she existed in all these moments”, and learns to be both more powerful and more just. And, insofar as the revelation of the strength of sympathetic engagement is what the novel has always done best, Ward movingly demonstrates the need to use this to keep freeing ourselves, day after day.Lara Feigel is the author of Custody: The Secret History of Mothers (William Collins).

One mourns people. But one can also mourn a state, a system, an ideology – even those that were deeply flawed. In 2019, the artist Henrike Naumann built an East German living room and rotated it by 90 degrees. The sofa, chairs and coffee table – all in the unmistakable aesthetic of the 1990s – climbed the wall. The carpet became vertical. Cabinets hovered near the floor alongside a CD rack, baseball badges and a flag bearing a slogan in Sütterlin script: “Beware of storm and wind and East Germans who are enraged.”The installation – titled Ostalgie (a portmanteau of the German words for “east” and “nostalgia”) – made physical what many had felt but struggled to articulate: the collapse of the GDR and its aftermath for those who had lived through it and felt it on some level as a loss. That rupture was not abstract. It tilted the room. It unsettled the ground beneath your feet.Few artists examined the emotional infrastructure of German reunification – and its global resonances – with such power and clarity as Henrike Naumann, treating design history as social history and redefining what political art could look like. This weekend, on 14 February, she died at the age of 41, after a cancer diagnosis that came too late. In just a few months, the world will see her work at the German pavilion at the Venice Biennale, which she has conceived in tandem with the artist Sung Tieu but will now never get to see in situ.View image in fullscreenTag X (Day X) by Henrike Naumann at the Haus der Statistik, in Berlin in 2019.Photograph: Omer Messinger/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockNaumann was among the first millennial artists from EastGermanyto gain international recognition and emerged as one of the most distinctive voices of her generation. Born in 1984 in Zwickau, in what was then the GDR, she came of age in a unified yet deeply dysfunctional landscape: two political orders, two ideologies and countless “isms” that collided and continue to battle over authority and interpretation. That upbringing taught her early on that history is never singular or objective, no matter how insistently it is framed as such.After studying stage and costume design at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and scenography at the Film University Babelsberg Konrad Wolf, Naumann worked as an artist for more than a decade. She won numerous awards, her works entered international collections and she exhibited in museums, galleries and biennales around the world.She became known for installations made from used furniture, design objects and video works – walk-in analyses of specific historical moments. She sourced many of her pieces on eBay from private individuals. In her hands, wardrobes, sofas and armchairs became historical documents once more, carrying the biographies of their former owners. History did not just hang on walls; it sat in the room with you.At the Haus der Kunst in Munich – a building erected by the Nazis – she placed armchairs from the Hitler era alongside post-reunification wall units and decorative figurines from the 1990s, revealing unsettling aesthetic continuities across modern German history. At Documenta in 2022, she presented a temple to the trance subculture of the 1990s, exploring the strange convergence of radicalisation and hedonism that marked that decade. In an exhibition at the Bundestag, she dissected the ideology of the Reichsbürger movement – those who believe the German Reich still exists, who see themselves as a threatened people in an occupied country, and who hoard weapons in preparation for an imagined reckoning. In another installation, she created a “German Unity Mourning Altar”, complete with a Milka-purple funeral wreath bearing the inscriptionDer Deutschen Einheit – In stiller Trauer(German Unity – In silent mourning) – a gesture at once humorous and unsettling.View image in fullscreenTag X (Day X) in Berlin, 2019.Photograph: Omer Messinger/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockHer personal background was always a starting point, a prism through which she examined broader political and social belief systems. Yet part of her international success lay in the fact that her work never remained confined to an East German landscape. She understood that the 1990s were not merely a local story of strange interiors, neo-Nazis and techno clubs, but a laboratory for understanding how societies metabolise rupture – and how political extremism does not begin and end with flags and speeches, but settles quietly into living rooms. In 2022, at SculptureCenter in New York, she extended this inquiry, examining the role furniture played in the storming of the US Capitol in 2021. As she once put it: “I think I like furniture because it’s something that everybody has. It’s not so abstract – it’s something everyone can relate to.”Last year she examined the role of state artists in the GDR and under National Socialism, while remaining conscious of her own position within that lineage. With her German pavilion in Venice – rebuilt by the Nazis in 1938 and long a site of controversy – she knew she, too, would be read as part of this national history.In her work, history was a battlefield of narratives; nothing and no one stood alone. Every object and every space carried a past that shaped the present. She traced connections between violent ruptures and regime changes, placing them along a continuum and asking which histories we failed to think together – which stories we chose not to see and where one stands within that history.View image in fullscreenNaumann at the Marie Elizabeth Luders Haus in Berlin in 2024.Photograph: Imago/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Live News.In one of her recent lectures, Naumann compared art to chocolate. Neither is essential for survival. Both are luxuries. Yet taste – like aesthetic experience – carries memory and emotion. It lingers. We would notice its absence.We will notice hers. Henrike Naumann’s art altered how we look at rooms, at objects, at the seemingly quiet surfaces of everyday life. In doing so, she made visible what is bubbling beneath the surface – not only in Germany, but far beyond it.Explore more on these topicsArt and designGermanyEuropeNazismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not having any cash. ENO knows all too well how that particular predicament feels. Somehow, though, Jamie Manton’s new production of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s opera manages to make a virtue of thriftiness, yet still feels substantial.For a start, it’s big. In Brechtian style, the whole breadth and depth of the Coliseum stage is open: it feels almost as if this should be an immersive production, with the audience up there in the performers’ midst. Milla Clarke’s set, centred on a huge container, reuses elements that ENO regulars will recognise from productions long past, and the costumes look like the spoils from a charity-shop sweep – which fits the trashy aesthetic.View image in fullscreen‘Costumes like the spoils from a charity-shop sweep’… the ENO chorus nailing it at London Coliseum.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAnd it’s uneven – but then, so is the opera itself. There are longueurs in this story of exploitation and greed, set in a US desert dystopia. It first reached the stage in Berlin in 1930, and you might say that the feeling in the world now is not so very different, but Manton doesn’t give us obvious parallels or references to Trump and Vance. The joke is more on us. Those sucker tourists, initially in office wear, making their first appearance like extra audience members, lined up in the aisles and stood in the boxes.There are sparky touches, including the human megaphone that arrives to announce each scene, looking like a white-clad alien wearing the kind of conical collar your cat gets wrangled into after an operation. A tap-dancing hurricane limbers up passive-aggressively before threatening the townspeople with his belligerent fancy footwork.View image in fullscreen‘The tart with less of a heart than you think’ … Danielle de Niese, centre, with Zwakele Tshabalala, Alex Otterburn and Mark Le Brocq.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLizzi Gee’s choreography is also on show in some neat numbers involving treadmills as the characters trudge towards Mahagonny – including the Alabama Song, made famous outside the opera house byDavid Bowieandthe Doors, here delivered by Danielle de Niese. Benefiting more than most from the subtle amplification, she brings star quality to Jenny, the tart with less of a heart than you initially think. Simon O’Neill makes all Jimmy MacIntyre’s lines sound like Wagner, and Elgan Llŷr Thomas sings elegantly as Jack, even as he’s eating himself to death. Rosie Aldridge is a formidable Widow Begbick, cutting the whisky with liquid siphoned off from the tank next to the urinal. Jeremy Sams’ English translation is, characteristically, razor-sharp.In his first appearance as ENO’s music director designate – he takes up the post next year –André de Ridderkeeps the orchestra energised, but the stars are the chorus, onstage most of the time, who nail Weill’s tricky ensemble writing with a conviction that few opera company choruses worldwide could match.

The resulting tragedy has a snarling, pent-up energy. Patrick Marber’s 1995 version, originally written for TV, unfolds in a similarly compact 75 minutes – but turns less on sex than a very British class warfare.We’re on the country estate of a Labour peer, on the night of the party’s 1945 election landslide. As the staff celebrate offstage – Chattanooga Choo Choo and In the Mood – John the chauffeur (Tom Varey) sinks a glass of his master’s best burgundy. Like Churchill, he says, it’s “robust, full-bodied – and finished”.View image in fullscreenPsychological pile-up … Liz Francis and Tom Varey in After Miss Julie.Photograph: Teddy CavendishSwaying in her full-skirted black frock, the peer’s daughter comes below stairs like a wheedling kitten, demanding attention in a voice of thin-beaten silver. Liz Francis’s Julie provokes, drinks (“Do you think I’m a dreadful lush?”), flirts. “Do I shock you?” she purrs. “Not as much as you’d like to,” retorts John.John is engaged to Christine the cook (an excellent Charlene Boyd, dog-tired but diligent) – but he and Julie fall into a combustible night and bleak morning after. Marber’s text shares a rebarbative gleam with his first plays, Dealer’s Choice and Closer. Steeped in spite, the writing is at its sharpest when at its meanest. “You’d shame a two-bit tart in Piccadilly,” sneers John, while Julie derides his beer swilling and “demob disaster” of a suit.Dadiow Lin’s intimate, assured production has a malicious clarity. Handsomely designed by Eleanour Wintour, her in-the-round staging reveals John’s fingermarks red on Julie’s shoulder. Marber delineates the psychological pile-up of Julie’s upbringing (“You don’t know what it’s like to be daddy’s special girl”) but the show doesn’t thrum with Strindberg’s unhinged, poisonous desire. The heroine might be “off her rocker”, but tragedy doesn’t land with inevitable force.It’s class that animates the disaster here – the election might promise a new dawn, but the characters can’t discard long-ingrained habits of deference or command. The country might seem on the cusp of change, but Varey’s eyes narrow with mortification, and he jumps to it with shoe polish and coffee grinder when his master calls.AtPark theatre, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrePatrick MarberreviewsShareReuse this content"

The ceremony is staid, traditional, down to the restaurant’s menu, full of classic dishes such as vol-au-vents and foie gras on toast. In pictures of the judging ceremony, the judges wear dark suits; each has four glasses of wine at hand.The winner of the Goncourt, as the prize is called, is likely to enter the pantheon of world literature, joining a lineage of writers that includes Marcel Proust and Simone de Beauvoir. The prize is also a financial boon for authors. As the biggest award in French literature, the Goncourt means a prime spot in storefronts, foreign rights, prestige. By one estimate, winning the Goncourt means nearly €1m of sales in the weeks that follow.In November 2024, the Académie Goncourt gave the prize to a novel by Kamel Daoud, a celebrated Algerian writer living in France. His victory came at a tense moment for France and its former colony. The relationship, never an easy one, had been strained by the Algerian state’s increasing political repression of its people and French involvement in the dispute betweenAlgeriaand Morocco over Western Sahara. (France has sided with Morocco, which claims sovereignty over the territory; Algeria has supported independence movements there.)Daoud’s own career has been shaped by this troubled relationship. Though he has long been a literary star in both countries, he moved to France in 2023, claiming he could neither “write nor breathe” in Algeria. Daoud’s French publisher, Gallimard, one of France’s largest, was prevented fromparticipating in the 2024 book fair in Algiers. No explanation was given but many suspected it was because Gallimard had published Daoud’s latest novel, Houris.Houris took on a subject that had long been controversial: Algeria’s civil war or “black decade”, a conflict between the government and armed Islamist groups over the course of the 1990s. Estimates of the number of dead vary; somego as high as 200,000. Massacres of civilians occurred across the country, many of them later claimed by Islamist groups.The period remains delicate to discuss. In 1999, a law was introduced that provided legal clemency to Islamist fighters who put down their weapons. In 2005, Algeria passed a reconciliation law that widened the amnesty. But unlike some such laws, which require some form of justice to be served to the perpetrators, this law “allows for official forgetting, without any reflection on the actions of either side”, as one historian told me. “The executioners just went home.”The reconciliation law isvery broadly worded, making it illegal “to use or exploit the wounds of the national tragedy to undermine the institutions of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, weaken the state, damage the reputation of all its officials who have served it with dignity, or tarnish Algeria’s image internationally”. The black decade is still not taught in Algerian schools. In interviews for the novel, Daoud dwelled on the law’s wide reach. The civil war, he said, is “a taboo subject that you can’t even think about”.Houris,whichwas not published in Algeria, tells the story of the war through a 26-year-old woman, Fajr or Aube (Dawn), who, as a child, survived a massacre at Had Chekala, a village where a real massacre took place in January 1998. In the novel, terrorists killed Aube’s family and cut her throat with a knife. The attack gave her a large scar across her neck: her “smile”, as she calls it. To breathe, Aube has undergone a tracheostomy, a procedure through which the neck is opened to access the windpipe. She wears a cannula, which she sometimes hides with a scarf. “I always choose a rare and expensive fabric,” she says. But the injuries from the attack mean that, two decades on, her voice is barely audible. For her, the scar is a sign of a history that many want to forget. “I am the true trace, the most solid of signs of everything we lived through for 10 years in Algeria,” she says.As the book opens in 2018, Aube finds herself pregnant with a girl whom she calls herhouri,the name of a virgin of paradise in the Muslim tradition. As she contemplates an abortion, she returns to the site of the massacre. The novel takes the form of an interior monologue between Aube and her unborn child. This is punctured by the introduction of Aïssa, a man who has collected stories of the civil war, which he rattles off like a human encyclopedia. He talks at length about the Algerian civil war and the reasons that it remains a controversial part of the country’s heritage. As he says, “there are no books, no films, no witnesses for 200,000 deaths. Silence!” The Goncourt judges praised Daoud for giving “voice to the suffering associated with a dark period in Algeria’s history, particularly that of women”.Eleven days after the Goncourt ceremony,a woman appeared on an Algerian news show. She wore a blue-and-white-striped shirt; her long hair was tied into a bun. This left her neck visible, and attached to it, some breathing apparatus with a cannula. She introduced herself as Saâda Arbane, 30. Daoud, she claimed, had stolen her personal details to make his bestseller. “It’s my personal life, it’s my story. I’m the only one who should determine how it should be made public.” For 25 years, she said, “I’ve hidden my story, I’ve hidden my face. I don’t want people pointing at me.” But, Arbane said, she had confided in her psychiatrist. “I had no filter, no taboos. I told her everything.” Her psychiatrist was Kamel Daoud’s wife.Arbane is now suing Daoud in Algeria and in France, through different cases that present her position from two different angles. In Algeria, her case centres on her medical records which, she claims, were stolen from a hospital in Oran and used as research material for Daoud’s book. In France, she is suing Daoud and his publisher Gallimard for invasion of privacy and libel.Daoud argues there is no basis for such claims, and that his work is based on many stories from the Algerian black decade. He has argued that it is not Arbane herself who is ultimately behind these cases, but that they are part of a wider attempt by the Algerian government to bring down prominent critics of the ruling regime.In France, where news about Algeria is closely followed, the cases have become caught up in larger questions about history, colonialism and international relations. “Kamel Daoud, from ‘invasion of privacy’ to the Franco-Algerian diplomatic battle,”read a headlineabout his case. The legal battle brings in a wide cast of political players. Arbane is represented by famous human rights lawyer William Bourdon and his associate Lily Ravon; Daoud’s lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont-Haïk, recently defended former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.The case against Daoud touches upon so many questions that haunt the literary world. To whom does a story belong? Is it acceptable to use another person’s tale for one’s own gain? Does the answer change when one person is a man, the other a woman; one person famous, the other the victim of an event that left her almost literally voiceless?But the more I tried to drill down on what really happened, the question seemed an even larger one. Daoud’s defence has hinged on his persecution by the Algerian state. But what kind of behaviour can persecution justify?Daoud is Algeria’s best-known writer. His work has been translated into 35 languages, and he regularly writes for French outlets about Algeria and contemporary affairs. “A brilliant, indeed dazzling, thinker,” is how one critic described him.Daoud was raised by his grandparents in a small Algerian town called Mesra, while his father, a policeman, worked in different parts of the country. As a teenager, he was attracted to Islamism but quit the movement at 18. “At a certain point, I no longer felt anything,” he later told the New York Times.In his early 20s, he turned to journalism, covering the Algerian civil war. In 1998, he reported on the massacre at Had Chekala, one of a number of villages where hundreds of people were killed during Ramadan by Islamist forces. Two years later, he started his own column in Le Quotidien d’Oran,the French-language paper in the coastal city of Oran. It was called “Raïna raïkoum”, meaning, roughly, “My opinion, your opinion”. He began to write short fiction, and in the 00s won acclaim for his short books and story collections. “He was very famous,” says Sofiane Hadjadj, his former editor at the Algerian publishing house Barzakh.View image in fullscreenKamel Daoud in 2024 after being announced as the winner of the Goncourt prize.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPAIn 2010, Daoud wrote a column for Le Mondein which he reimagined the story of the unnamed Arab man murdered in Albert Camus’s existentialist novelThe Stranger. He wrote from the perspective of the dead man’s brother, calling back the story told by the novel’s protagonist, a French man named Meursault.The column caught the attention of Hadjadj and his colleagues, who encouraged him to turn it into a novel which they published in Algeria in 2013.When the novel, The Meursault Investigation,was republished in France in 2014,it became a sensation. With Daoud’s clever conceit, the novel enabled the colonised to talk back to the colonisers through a rebuttal of one of France’s most cherished literary works, itself written by a white Frenchman born in Algeria. The novel, too, offered a complex critique of Algeria’s postcolonial development. “Kamel Daoud’s novel The Meursault Investigation may have attracted more international attention than any other debut in recent years,” wrote Claire Messud in the New York Review of Books.Daoud was welcomed with coverage across the English-speaking media. The Guardiancalled the book an “instant classic”, and the New York Times profiled him at length. In Oran, Daoud was already a star. But after the publication of Meursault, Hadjadj says, “There was an explosion.”The novel’s success brought Daoud unusual visibility for a writer. In Algeria, an imam accused Daoud of apostasy after one of his media appearances in which he questioned the role of religion in the Arab world.He also took a prominent place in French culture, writing a column from Algeria for Le Point,a conservative weekly, where he opined on everything from immigration to #MeToo. His writing was lyrical, sometimes impressionistic, and often returned to the dangers of fundamentalism of all kinds. “All my work,” he wrote in an introduction to a collection of the last decade’s columns, “insists on one point. ‘Be careful! A country can be lost in a minute!’”A frequent guest on TV and radio, Daoud was a notable Algerian voice in a culture that remains often dismissive, and sometimes vindictive, towards its former colony. When President Macron made a state visit to Algeria in 2022, he took the time to have dinner with Daoud.While Kamel Daoud’s star was rising, Saâda Arbane was figuring out the best way to move past a terrible tragedy. She was born in 1993 in a small town in Algeria to a family of shepherds. In 2000, Islamist terrorists murdered her parents and five siblings. No one knows if there was any motivation for the attack on their town; it’s likely that, as with many in the period, there was none. The terrorists cut Arbane’s throat and left her for dead. She was six years old.Arbane was first brought to a local hospital, then transferred to Oran, where she spent five months in a paediatric intensive care unit. From there, she was transferred to France, where she received a tracheostomy operation and was fitted with a cannula. After such an ordeal, “I don’t know that many would be still standing,” her aunt told me.One of the paediatricians in the Algerian health service, Zahia Mentouri, decided to adopt Arbane. Her adoptive family came from a distinguished lineage: Mentouri had led paediatric intensive care units across the country and briefly been minister of health and social affairs. Her adoptive father, Tayeb Chenntouf, was a well-known historian of Algeria who belonged to a Unesco committee on African history. Together, they lived in Oran.For some time, Arbane could only consume liquid. Although her family held out hope that surgery might allow her to speak more clearly, it was not possible to reconstruct her vocal cords. The attack left psychological scars as well. A medical report from 2001, after her transfer to France, describes how, at the beginning of a hospital stay in France, her only drawings showed plants surrounded by thorns. When she started drawing people, the same report states, they had all visible tracheostomies, covered up with scarves. (The report is included in Arbane’s evidence for her French trial.)Arbane had trouble in school in Oran. Few people could understand her. At first, she could not even whisper. “Everyone would stare at her cannula,” said one relative. Classmates called her “Donald Duck” because of her fractured voice. Even today, Arbane’s words are not always clear to those who don’t know her well. For this article, I spoke to her twice via Zoom, with her husband acting as a kind of interpreter, repeating what she had said.View image in fullscreenSaâda Arbane, right, with her lawyer Fatma Benbraham, during a press conference in Algiers in November 2024.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesGrowing up, Arbane almost never discussed what had happened to her. She did not bring it up with her family, several relatives told me, nor did they ask questions. “To be a child with a tracheostomy, to speak with a whisper, coughing through one’s neck, secreting and wiping snot from one’s neck: I was a freak show to kids and to many adults,” she told me.Her relatives describe Arbane as someone with unusual determination. “She completes every task she starts,” said one family friend. She spent the last year of high school in France. In 2016, she married and had a son, whom she credits with saving her life. She opened a beauty salon in Oran in her late 20s. “She has fairy fingers,” the family friend said.Arbane found comfort in riding, something that reminds her of her biological family, who kept horses. As a teenager, she competed internationally. An article in L’Écho d’Oran about the 2009 horse riding championship of the Maghreb, a high-level event, describes how “Saâda Arbane ‘knows the obstacles’; she jumps over them in silence, with determination and elegance”.In 2015, Arbane started to see Dr Aïcha Dahdouh, a respected psychiatrist in Oran, who was close to Arbane’s adoptive family. In Arbane’s recollection, she initially went to talk about issues she was having with her mother. Arbane met with Dahdouh in an office in the University hospital of Oran, sometimes with her mother, sometimes one on one. She found Dahdouh easy to talk to, and soon they “talked about everything”. Dahdouh, Arbane recalled, took notes during the sessions on pieces of paper which she put in a folder. (I attempted to reach Dahdouh via two email addresses and her telephone number, as well as through her husband, but she did not respond to these inquiries, nor to a detailed list of the claims made in this article.)The relationship between Arbane and Dahdouh, Arbane’s lawyers contend, was far closer than is normal between a patient and therapist. They became friends. In texts, Dahdouh wrote to Arbane in the informal “tu” rather than the more formal “vous”. “You’re an angel,” Dahdouh wrote in one message; another she signed “big kisses”. They had sons of a similar age, for whom they discussed organising outings such as pyjama parties. “The relationship started with the children,” Arbane said when we talked. In messages, Dahdouh referred to Arbane’s son as “min [sic] petit cheri” – my little darling. Dahdouh sent a picture of herself at the beach with their sons. Another picture shows them together standing by the water. Dahdouh solicited Arbane’s help renting out an apartment she owned with Daoud.Around the end of the Covid pandemic, in 2021 Arbane believes, she met up with Dahdouh along with their children. Dahdouh brought her husband. Despite his fame, Arbane didn’t know much about Daoud. “Reading isn’t my thing,” she told me. She sensed that he was surprised by her appearance. Dahdouh told her that she hadn’t shared any details about her background or the attack.In Arbane’s telling, a few weeks later, during Ramadan, Dahdouh and Daoud invited her over for coffee. Daoud told her that he wanted to write a book about her story. After she refused, he said that he would respect her decision and that there were many stories like her own. He gave her a book about the Emir Abd el-Kader, a 19th-century Algerian leader, renowned for his equestrian prowess, who fought against the French colonial invader.A short time later, according to the lawsuit, Dahdouh invited Arbane’s adoptive mother to her office and made the same offer on Daoud’s behalf. She said no and told Arbane. Her adoptive parents, Arbane says, had warned her to be careful. But they died in quick succession in 2022 and 2023. When Arbane brought up the book in a later session, Dahdouh told her, “I’m here to protect you.”The two continued their sessions until Dahdouh and her husband left for France in 2023. Afterwards, they stayed in touch. Though the situation was uncomfortable, Arbane said, she had made clear that she did not want her life to be the basis of anything Daoud was writing. Besides, she was confident that her most personal details were protected by patient-doctor confidentiality.Houriswas published in France in August 2024. Over the next few weeks, Arbane and her family began to receive calls and texts about the book. “I’m with a guy and his wife. They’re talking about Algeria,” a childhood friend texted Arbane in September. “He talked about a writer who published a book. And the story sounds like your life. 😱”Arbane forwarded it to Dahdouh. “Congratulations on the book,” she wrote.Dahdouh replied that she would bring her a copy. “The heroine has a daughter that she calls ‘ma houri’. The story sounds a bit like yours.”Arbane continued to ask Dahdouh for an explanation. A few weeks later, Arbane wrote to her again, “Hi Aïcha, I hope you’re doing well. I got a call today from a woman saying that there’s a book that talks about [my] story by Kamel.”The next day she received a response, much more formally written.“Dear Saâda, I hope you’re doing well. Kamel’s writing generally provokes a lot of reactions. Some people are saying the same thing about other characters … I’ll bring you the book and you’ll read it yourself. The thing that annoys [those people] is that the character named ‘Aube’ who sounds like you is a heroine.” Dahdouh added, “I hope the story doesn’t bother you too much.”Arbane recalls, “I had more and more questions in my head after each sentence.”Arbane says that Dahdouh gave her a copy of the book while visiting Algeria in October 2024. The copy was dedicated with a note from Daoud. “Our country has often been saved by courageous women. You are one of them. With my admiration, Kamel.” Still, Dahdouh warned her not to read the book as it might be too emotionally heavy for her.Arbane didn’t read it right away, and she continued her friendship with Dahdouh. A few days later, Arbane recalls, Dahdouh left her son at her house. When she came to pick him up, they began again to talk about the book. Dahdouh suggested that Daoud might give Arbane’s information to a film-maker for a possible adaptation. Arbane, she said, might benefit from money from the film and that it would allow her to buy an apartment in Spain, where her husband had family.“This confirmed my fears,” Arbane told me. Finally, she started to read the book. She says she didn’t sleep for the next three nights. “I felt betrayed, naked,” she told me. “The entire world was reading something that was mine.” Arbane’s relatives told me that her mental health deteriorated after the book came out. Daoud “slit her throat a second time”, a relative said.After reading the book, Arbane contacted a cousin of her adoptive father’s, who was a lawyer. On her advice, she went to the hospital in Oran where she had seen Dahdouh and requested her file. The hospital did not hand it over. She lodged a complaint on 18 November, according to her French lawyers. The judge asked for the file, she says, but the hospital said they had not found it.In total, Arbane’s lawyers count approximately 30 similarities between Arbane and “Aube” in the novel. Both Arbane and Aube are rare survivors of a terrorist attack in which their throats were slit. Both lost the ability to speak after the attack and could only whisper. Both received tracheostomies. Arbane’s biological parents were shepherds; Aube’s parents raised sheep. Just like Arbane, Aube describes being compared to Donald Duck and recalls how, for a time, she could only eat liquid food.Like Arbane, Aube lives in Oran; one of the apartments she lived in (including the neighbourhood, building letter and floor) is described in passing in the book. Arbane was adopted by a former minister of health, herself an adoptee; Aube was adopted by a famous lawyer, herself an adoptee. Arbane’s adoptive mother never celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid, during which sheep are traditionally slaughtered. The same is true of Aube’s adoptive mother. Both Arbane and Aube attended a high school called the Lycée Colonel Lotfi, owned a hair salon, and love perfume and horses.Arbane’s aunt, Fadhela Chenntouf, told me that although she and her niece were very close, when she read the novel, she discovered things about Arbane that she had never known. In the book, Aube’s tattoos recall her murdered family. Arbane also has a number of tattoos, including one that recalls her biological mother. “She never said that the tattoo had a meaning for her, but she told Aïcha Dahdouh,” said Chenntouf.Arbane’s lawyers claim that she confided in her therapist about the difficulties she’d had when she discovered she was pregnant, as Aube does in the novel. Like Aube, Arbane had acquired three pills for a possible abortion, though abortion is illegal in Algeria. Like Aube, Arbane did not take the pills and gave birth to a child. Even the scar across their neck is the same length: 17cm.Daoud’s response to the Arbane case shifted in the months after the publication of his novel. At first, in a 3 September interview with the French magazine Le Nouvel Obs,he said he hadbeen inspired by a “woman with a breathing tube, though she was not the only mutilated one”. This was some weeks before Arbane’s appearance on Algerian TV, in which she accused Daoud of having used her life story for the novel. The week after that, on 21 November 2024, Arbane’s Algerian lawyer, Fatima Benbraham, held a dramatic press conference, in which she announced that Arbane was suing Daoud and held up pictures of her scars. “He built his success on Saâda’s misery. For a second time, he strangled my client’s voice,” she said. “He stole her life, her story and her pain and he leaves her without any life at all.” The lawyer appeared on a TV talkshow to launch a highly personal attack on Daoud, his new life in France and his family. (Benbraham did not reply to a request for comment. Arbane changed lawyers in July 2025.)Benbraham also filed a separate case against Daoud and Dahdouh on behalf of an association of victims of terrorism, on the ground that the book violated the 2005 reconciliation law which restricts discussion of the black decade. The law has only been invoked three times before, always in connection to political statements and never against a novelist.After these developments, Daoud began to speak about Arbane in a different way. On 3 December 2024,almost two weeks after Benbraham’s press conference in Algiers,Daoud wrote an article in Le Point in whichhe referred to Arbane as a puppet of the Algerian government. “This victim of the civil war is being manipulated to achieve a goal: to kill a writer, defame his family and save the deal between this regime and these killers.” He continued: “Apart from the visible injury, there is no common ground between this woman’s unbearable tragedy and the character Aube.” In the same article, he claimed that Arbane’s story was well known in Oran, citing an article in a Dutch paper published two years before his book, though this article had only the barest outlines of her story. He did not acknowledge that he knew Arbane personally, nor that his wife had been her psychiatrist.In February 2025, further evidence emerged that seemed to support Arbane’s claims. The French investigative outlet Mediapart revealed that the novel’s working title had been “Joie” or joy, a translation of the name Saâda. According to Mediapart, an earlier version of the text carried the following dedication: “To an extraordinary woman, the real heroine of this story.” (Daoud did not respond toMediapart.Gallimard did not respond to several requests for comment.)Last summer, I contacted Daoud over email. He responded almost immediately, thanking me for my interest. Over the next few months, we exchanged a few more brief emails. He declined to meet. The case that had been launched against him, he wrote, could not be fully understood without investigating “the abuses, mass arrests, the regime of terror, the suppression of the press and multiple imprisonments in Algeria”.View image in fullscreenKamel Daoud in Strasbourg, France, in April 2025.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyIn recent years, Algeria has become increasingly repressive. In 2019, a popular uprising called the Hirak movement fought against the possible fifth term of president Abdelaziz Bouteflika. It was a broad movement: “Men and women, all classes, all political backgrounds as well,” according to Mouloud Boumghar, a law professor who has worked extensively on human rights in Algeria. But it was crushed with the beginning of the Covid lockdowns.Bouteflika resigned in 2019 and died in 2021. Since 2019, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who had served in various roles in Bouteflika’s cabinet, has been president. Today, Boumghar says, no one can stand out, no voice can speak up without risking prison. “The regime once clamped down more intelligently,” he says. Now, “it’s brutal”. Since President Tebboune came to power, Daoud wrote to me, almost “no press conference, no debate, no media or partisan campaign has been allowed outside official communications”. Dozens, even hundreds of people have been arrested. “Influencers, activists, publishers, singers, military personnel, opponents.” In France, the persecution of the French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal has attracted particular attention. In 2025, Sansal, a critic of the Algerian regime, wassentenced to five years in prisonfor “attacking national unity”. President Macron stated that that Algeria was “dishonouring” itself in imprisoning the writer.Daoud was not always such an outspoken critic of the Algerian government. For much of his career, according to his former editor Hadjadj, Daoud “wasn’t an ally of power, but he wasn’t an opponent”. He pointed out that President Tebboune had chosen to grant a rare interview to Daoud and a colleague at Le Pointin 2021. But in the years that followed, as the government became increasingly repressive, Daoud intensified his writings against the regime, and the regime seemed to turn on him. In Le Point,Daoud described how, after he hosted Macron in Oran in 2022, guests at their dinner were “subjected to legal harassment” and the restaurant owner was forced to close his establishment for some time. “I myself faced online harassment, troll farms and surveillance.” As Franco-Algerian relations deteriorated, he felt that “the machine was about to close in on me. I am a writer, French-speaking, Arabic-speaking, independent and unique. I was called a ‘traitor’.”In August 2023, Daoud received a phone call from the head of the secret service in Oran. He asked whether Daoud could stop by his office for coffee. “The invitation ‘to come have a coffee’ is always the prelude to an arrest in Algeria,” Daoud later wrote. Shortly thereafter, he and his family left Algeria for Paris. “When we arrived in Paris at 6am, in summer, I immediately started writing Houris,as though it were a sacred dictation.”Since Arbane launched her legal action, Algeria has issued two international arrest warrants for Daoud; in June, he cancelled a trip to Italy out of fear of extradition. Daoud told me that, unable to return to Algeria, he has recently missed his mother’s funeral. He has pointed to the virulence of the Algerian state’s response as an explanation for the current affair. In his email to me, Daoud noted that many of the individuals who had propagated and backed the case against him had ties to the regime, suggesting that this was further evidence of a state-led campaign against him.(Arbane’s lawyers in France have filed another suit, for libel, against Daoud and the newspaper Le Figaro for a statement in which he dismissed the idea that Arbane had a case of her own and suggested that she was a tool of the Algerian state. Arbane says that she does not follow politics.)In his emails, Daoud did not address Arbane’s specific accusations, but stated that “the character Aube is imagined, a pure fiction”. In December, I sent him a detailed list of questions relating to specific claims in this article. In response, I received an email from his lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont-Haïk, who said she and her colleagues had provided long and detailed legal submissions to the court, as well as evidence showing that “Madame Arbane’s story goes against reality”. She did not offer anything specific. When I wrote again in February to ask whether she would share this evidence, she did not reply.Among the literary community in Algeria, the Arbane-Daoud legal battle has been viewed with a certain ambivalence. Daoud is a polarising figure in his home country, and as he has gained readers in France, he has lost admirers in Algeria. Faris Lounis, an Algerian literary critic who has written extensively about Daoud, believes he is successful because he tells French conservatives what they want to hear. “The Algerian writer has to be useful,” he told me. (Lounis cited a column where Daoud accused French Muslims of being “useful idiots” for the French left.) In his columns in Le Point, Daoud often criticises Algeria – a fact that is interpreted differently, several people told me, coming from a writer who now lives in France. Another Algerian reader described Daoud’s columns to me in this way: “It’s Arabs, Muslims, Arabs, Muslims, morning, noon and night – that’s only a slight caricature.”And although Houriswas well received in France, its reception among Algerian readers and scholars of the country has been more complicated. Tristan Leperlier, a scholar of novels of the black decade, has described Hourisas a “heavily political novel, bogged down in cliched images, caricaturing oppressed yet heroic women and violent imams”. Leperlier and others point out that numerous books and films in Algeria have been made about the civil war, many of them by women, something Daoud has largely passed over in interviews.Yet no one disputes that the Algerian state really has made life impossible for Daoud. According to Lounis, “There’s the use of Saâda Arbane’s story [by Daoud] … That’s one fact. And there’s another: the instrumentalisation of the case by the Algerian state.” “He’s living through something absolutely terrible,” says Hadjadj, who described the Algerian media campaign against Daoud as a “lynching”. But, he notes, it has ended up “overshadowing Saâda’s story”.In France, the Daoud case almost immediately got mixed up with that of Sansal, said Elisabeth Philippe, a prominent literary critic and an editor at Le Nouvel Observateur. “Very quickly, we made it into a political issue,” she told me. From that point on, it was inevitable that the story would be swirled together with the rancorous public conversation about the Franco-Algerian relationship, which, in France today, almost always ends up becoming a conversation about Islam and immigration. To take one example of many: on French TV in June, during a discussion about Boualem Sansal, the contrarian writer Pascal Bruckner called Algerians a “brainless people”. “They kicked us out,” he said, “and now they want to come here.”Amid the furore, Hourishas sold over 450,000 copies and English rights have been bought. In July, when Daoud appeared on the radio station France Inter, the conversation was dominated by the jailing of the Algerian writer Sansal. The question about Arbane focused on Daoud’s feelings, rather than the substance of her allegations. “Between these legal trials, Boualem Sansal’s fate in prison, the pain of exile, but also the recognition you have achieved as a popular writer, how did you live through and cross this year full of headwinds?” (Sansal was released from prison in November 2025.)The legal case in France is still ongoing. Arbane’s French lawyers have focused on the question of privacy infringement. They seem to have precedent on their side. Thirteen years ago, William Bourdon, the lawyer for Arbane, won a case against a French author who was found to have used details about her husband’s former partner in a novel. She and her editor had topay €40,000 in compensation. Arbane’s case in Algeria appears to have stalled. Her lawyer there did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One source, a journalist, speculated that the Algerian authorities may be waiting for the outcome of the case in France.Daoud has built his career on his singularity: an Algerian man from a small town who ended up rewriting a Nobel laureate, a writer who can speak to both an Algerian audience and a French one. In a short book published last year, he described his pride at being “unfaithful to rigidity, to fixity … a proponent of plurality, multiplicity, variance and wandering”. The book’s title is Sometimes, One Must Betray.But pushing against an authoritarian regime, which requires a stubborn self-belief, can impose its own kind of rigidity. In our exchanges, Daoud presented himself as fighting against a larger Algerian machine. “I attempted to illustrate the long process of healing that ‘Aube’ courageously undertook, but which Algeria itself rejects; instead, it is the writer who is criminalised for his work, while those responsible for Algeria’s bloody decade enjoy pensions and total impunity.”Hourisis a novel about sacrifice. Aube describes herself as an unwitting sacrifice of both the terrorists of the civil war and the modern state. She compares herself and her injury to that of animals slaughtered during the religious festival of Eid. Daoud appears to be asking about the sacrifices that victims of the civil war have been asked to make in order for the Algerian state to move forward. What have modern Algerians been asked to conceal, to forget, to suppress for the sake of their country? In our exchanges, he suggested that he, too, had sacrificed. To write about the civil war, he said, was to expose himself to danger. “The period is taboo; whoever talks about it risks going to jail.”To write someone’s story, as Arbane alleges, is to demand a different kind of sacrifice. Over and over, in reading Daoud’s many responses to the legal cases, I noted how Arbane, her claims, her person, were absent from his view of the work he had done. For each specific point raised about Arbane, Daoud’s response would turn to the crisis in Algeria, or the forgotten civil war, deflecting questions about a single, living woman with comments about 200,000 dead.The real Scandi noir: how a film-maker and a crooked lawyer shattered Denmark’s self-imageRead moreTowards the end of Houris,Aube returns to Had Chekala, “to the heart of her own story”. The novel’s plot, until then tightly controlled, appears to unravel. The pace speeds, the characters take on the sheen of allegory. The village is filled with mysterious donkey heads. An imam in a mosque is also a butcher. It is implied that he and his twin brother participated in violent acts during the war. Aube is attacked and tied up in a shed. But before her throat is cut one last time, she is saved unexpectedly by Aïssa.In the midst of all this, Aube tries to speak but she cannot produce a sound. Her voice “rustles like crumpled leaves” and “scatters in handfuls of sand”. She begins to cry. Why did she come all of this way only to find herself locked away? Why is she the only survivor who seeks the truth about the war? She thinks to herself, “I was an offering wondering what the point of its sacrifice had been.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readAlgeriaEmmanuel MacronIslamAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The show, which has now been performed in 10 languages, has reduced men in their 70s to tearsTue 17 Feb 2026 10.02 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 12.44 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIt is the summer of 2024 and Haley McGee is performing Age Is a Feeling at a festival in Toronto. Her show is in good shape, having already raked in five-star reviewsat the Edinburgh fringe. But this performance is different. As she launches into her poignant monologue about life, death and the business of getting old, she hears a baby cry.The newborn sleeps through the rest of the show, but the performer, who is newly pregnant herself, feels as though she is speaking directly to this child and its young family. “It framed the whole show as a conversation with this baby,” McGee says: “This is my message for you about your adult life.”It calmed me down about the boring anxieties women my age faceNow preparing to revive the piece for a run in London, the Canadian-born playwright and actor has been imagining her one-year-old daughter as the target audience.Age Is a Feelingis written from the perspective of a 25-year-old speculating on her future, considering the choices, major and minor, that may or may not lead to a fulfilling life. Who can say how everything will play out: the feuds, affairs and health scares, the fragile friendships and creaking bones?“The show was a bomb to say life is long and the die isn’t cast,” she says. “And just because you don’t get X or Y, doesn’t mean your life isn’t going to be tremendously valuable. It calmed me down about some of the boring anxieties that women my age tend to face.”View image in fullscreenMoving for all age groups … McGee performing Age Is a Feeling at the Edinburgh fringe in 2022.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianNow approaching her 40s, McGee writes with the wisdom of someone decades older. Age Is a Feeling has been performed in 10 languages – in China, Chile, Turkey and beyond – by actors ranging from their mid-20s to mid-50s, and somehow it always connects. “When we did it in Edinburgh, I could see everybody’s faces and there would be men in their 70s wiping tears. For it to be moving people who weren’t in my age bracket was amazing.”She attributes this effect to what she calls her “anecdotal research”. Before writing, she spoke to all kinds of people by visiting hospices, mystics and cemeteries, and soliciting reflections on social media. “You will find a white pubic hair” is a line that comes directly from Facebook. It always gets a laugh. So too does the one about throwing your back out when doing something as innocuous as stepping out of the shower.She loves this kind of research. “It’s like being a psychologist or a therapist, getting to put myself inside the experience of other people. I cry so much when I’m writing – to the point I can’t write in a cafe.”The memory of the Toronto baby has stayed with her, but McGee is not the kind of actor to be fazed. Having studied improvisation with Second City in Chicago, shemoved to Londonand joinedthe Free Association improv troupe. She loves thinking on her feet. One of her teachers at drama school told her: “You know, Haley, you really do your best work when you don’t quite know what you’re going to do.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s like being a therapist’ … McGee.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianBecause of this, Age Is a Feeling has a built-in layer of uncertainty. Which stories she tells depends on choices made by the audience. Around her on stage are postcards with words on – Teeth, Bus, Oyster – each triggering a different story. There are 12 in total and the audience hear six. Like life, Age Is a Feeling is unpredictable. It has innumerable possible variations, ranging from the joyful to the bleak.“Sometimes it feels like there are a lot of highs and lows.

They’re only taking pictures of food.If only it were that simple. Legendary restaurateur Jeremy King says that influencers are now rocking up to his restaurants with suitcases full of outfit changes. It’s an “influenza-like outbreak”, he wrote inthe Standard.That cannot possibly be true.Apparently it is. His restaurant The Park in Bayswater, west London, has a beautiful set of toilets, which are now being clogged by obnoxious selfie-takers. He says that one group of women, who brought their own sound system, took so long in there that they blocked access for other diners.Scandalous. How does he plan to stop this?He’s put up a sign.That’ll do it.But the point is, Instagrammers are not just ruining the toilets in one restaurant. The legendary French bakery Poilâne has recently gone into receivership, after posting more than €2m in losses back in 2024.Too many people taking nice toilet photos?No, but the blame is, in part, being laid at the feet of influencers anyway.Why?Because, it says, it can’t compete with jazzy new bakeries, such as the popular chain The French Bastards, that have more social media pull. Poilâne is famed for its big, round sourdough loaves, but newer artisanal bakeries are able to offer the wider range of loaves and pastries that gen Z supposedly craves.Is that the only reason?Other reasons,according to the bakery’s director Apollonia Poilâne, include rising flour prices, rising labour costs and the fact that French people aren’t eating enough bread.And what’s the situation now?At the time of writing, Poilâne’s stores in Paris and London remain open. “We’re reworking all the basics to enable Poilâne to bounce back … There are very few bakeries like us, known throughout the world,” says Poilâne.And what’s to be done about the influencers?It depends who you are. If you want to attract influencers, you should probably invest in Instagrammable backdrops or nice toilets or whatever it is that attracts influencers these days.And if you’reJeremy King?Well, that’s the opposite problem. His toilets are clearly too nice. He’s really going to have to go in there heavy-handed if he’s going to fix that. Bust a few pipes maybe, flood a couple of cubicles. Miss the toilet by a couple of inches, if you know what I mean.Gross.Gross but necessary.Do say:“I’ll have the prawn cocktail.”Don’t say:“Send it straight to the toilet, please.”Explore more on these topicsFoodPass notesRestaurantsHospitality industryInstagramSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But who is right?Elle HuntTue 17 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 11.34 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAt nine o’clock on Saturday morning,Norwichmarket is only just stirring: shutters are still down and the aisles are quiet. In the nearby Memorial Gardens, however, a large crowd has already gathered: the market’s pigeons are waiting to be fed.Jenny Coupland arrives on the scene a little later than her usual hour, with a backpack brimming with seed. As she begins doling it out, the birds descend from their perches and cover the ground, pecking furiously. The sun catches their bobbing heads, sending iridescent shimmers across their brown and grey feathers.A few passersby stop to watch; one takes a photo. The sheer number of birds is a spectacle – not to mention startling, when they all abruptly take flight. “They’re a bit jumpy today,” says Coupland, 43. Judging by the wary glances she shoots at the onlookers, she’s not just referring to the birds.As the founder of the avian welfare groupPeck Savers, Coupland has been feeding pigeons around Norwich for 10 years, but in recent months, she says, it has become “a tinderbox situation”.View image in fullscreen‘I think they’re a damned nuisance’ … Eddie Graci.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianOver the past year, the flock here has swelled to about 300 pigeons, causing an increasing number of complaints from shoppers and traders. “I think they’re a damned nuisance, that’s my opinion,” says Eddie Graci from Horsford, who I find nursing a mug of tea at the picnic tables on the fringe of the market. He has seen the birds taking over these tables, trying to pinch chips, defecating on people’s clothing. And the Memorial Gardens, Graci adds, are a “damn mess. There’s bird droppings everywhere.”National media have described scenes here asHitchcockian. Norwich city council has come up with various solutions, including sending a Harris’s hawk over the market to scare the pigeons off andfeeding the flock contraceptives. But giving birds contraceptives, it turns out, isn’t actuallylicensed in the UKandthe four-week hawk pilotwas put on hold.Councillor Carli Harper, the Labour cabinet member for finance and major projects, accused some people of inflaming the issue with “industrial amounts of birdfeed” to save the pigeons. Though feeding birds is not against the law, Harperhas saidthe council is considering legal avenues to crack down on the “irresponsible … selfish few who do not see reason”.This is a local story, but a global issue. Norwich is far from the only place with a pigeon problem:Rome, Venice, New York, Singapore and London have restrictions – and penalties – for feeding pigeons in certain areas (breaking the ban in London’s Trafalgar Square incurs a £500 fine). After a citywide ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces wasintroduced in Mumbai in July, where pigeon feeding is a longstanding pastime for some communities, months of protests and clashes with police followed. There was even a failed attempt to create a political lobby with the formation of a“Pigeon party”. Activists have attempted torebrand the birds as “sky puppies”.View image in fullscreenA pigeon in the Memorial Gardens beside Norwich market.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianCoupland needs no persuading. Pigeons are “just perfect”, she says, describing their jewelled plumage and beady eyes.“If you’ve seen one robin, you’ve basically seen another one – but not with pigeons.” She accepts that not everyone feels the same. “Maybe you don’t like the way they flap their wings, or their coos, or something. But don’t not like them because you think they’re dirty, or spread disease – because it’s just not true.”Pigeons do carry parasites and bacteria that can be hazardous to humans, particularly in cases of overcrowding, but the risk tends to be greatly overstated, says Will Smith, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Nottingham, who specialises in the birds.Disease is typically transmitted through close contact with droppings. Infection is uncommon in the UK, though immunocompromised people are at greater risk. In 2019,an infection caused by pigeon droppings was a contributing factor in thedeath of a child at a Glasgow hospital, after excrement was found in a small break in the wall of the room, which was on the rooftop of the hospital.There are also respiratory illnesses, such as the flu-like psittacosis, and allergies caused by prolonged exposure to the dust accumulated in pigeon roosts. But again, “that’s not something most people will experience”, Smith says. “I wouldn’t advise anyone to go and touch any wild bird and not wash their hands, but there’s nothing specific about a pigeon that makes it more dirty than a robin.”View image in fullscreen‘Pigeons rely on us to help them to live’ ... Jenny Coupland.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianAs for avian influenza,now being actively managedacross the UK, pigeons are actually lower risk than ducks, geese, seabirdsand swans, having been shown to be unusually resistant to infection. Though the virus may evolve, “at the moment they don’t really get it”, Smith says.That’s not to say there aren’t legitimate concerns about population numbers, he adds. A single pair of pigeons can produce up to 12 squabs every year, meaning flocks can grow exponentially. And though they are capable of flying great distances, they tend to stay put in just one or two streets. Feral pigeons are the descendants of wild rock doves that were domesticated centuries ago, then escaped and formed self-sustaining populations. “They wouldn’t exist if not for us, and they’re completely dependent,” says Smith. Many discussions about management, as in Norwich, proceed under the assumption that problematic flocks can be pushed to “just go somewhere else and forage in the wild”, Smith continues. “But for a feral pigeon, ‘the wild’ is the concrete jungle … Their natural diet is McDonald’s.” The overcrowding risk means populations do sometimes need to be managed, for the pigeons’ health as much as people’s, Smith says. The question is how to go about it.View image in fullscreenGuardian writer Elle Hunt while reporting on the story at Norwich market.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianMoving or barring birds from one area tends to result in just shifting the issue elsewhere. The increase in birds at Norwich market, in fact, is believed to have been driven by development work on the former Anglia Square shopping complex a mile away, sending that flock in search of a new home. Banning people from feeding pigeons wouldn’t necessarily make a dent in the numbers, Smith says. But if the food supply were to be abruptly cut off, there would be “a lot of suffering”.Coupland argues that feeding the market flock is not just a private ritual, but a civic tradition and important for animal welfare. Along with providing nutritious seed, she and others in Norwich routinely remove entangled debris from pigeons’ feet (a common issue that can cause infection and even death) and facilitate veterinary care for sick birds. “They rely on us to help them, and to live.” She also says that without people like her feeding the birds, the result would be “hundreds of dead and dying pigeons on the street. Which is what Norwich city council is advocating for.”Harper declined an interview, but said in a statement that the council was continuing to explore “humane, legal and proportionate measures” to manage the pigeons and support traders. “Let me be absolutely clear: we are not anti-pigeon. We are pro-Norwich market.”Coupland, meanwhile, has designed stickers to drum up support for the pigeons’ cause stating: “Give Seeds a Chance”, “Your City Needs Coo” and “Norwich Shitty Council”. “The council has demonised us as these militant pigeon-feeders,” she says. “But people have been putting seeds down there for at least 10 years – it’s just that they’ve noticed now.”The most ethical way to thin a flock, says Smith, is to gradually reduce food over several months, slowing reproduction, but “it’s quite difficult to do”, and authorities often lack the will. Part of this may be because of “bad PR” rather than fact, he continues.First dubbed“rats with wings” in 1966, by a New York City official looking to clean up parks, today pigeons occupy an uneasy no man’s land: not quite pets, not quite wildlife – and lower status than both.View image in fullscreen‘They’re always going to be here.’Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianYet, for millennia, pigeons were cherished for sport, communication and companionship. Historically, doves (“basically white pigeons”, Smith points out) were symbolic stand-ins for gods. Messenger pigeons were used as far back as 950BC, and were bested only by the telegraph, invented in the 1830s. And pigeons informed Darwin’s theory of evolution. “They have given so much to us culturally … and we’ve kind of abandoned them,” Smith says.Worse, their reputation as vermin has made them a target. In Portsmouth last month, 29 pigeons werefound dead,believed to have been killed with aslingshot. And in 2021 in Norwich’s Memorial Gardens, aman allegedly decapitatedtwo pigeons. According to Coupland, who spoke to horrified witnesses, he said he thought he was doing everybody a favour. “You don’t have to love pigeons to think that’s wrong,” she says indignantly.Coupland says she has been verbally abused for feeding pigeons, which she considers proof of the impact of a decades-long “smear campaign”. “Trying to break all of that down is quite difficult.”But not everyone is resistant. For 19-year-old Summer Loh, who moved to Norwich from Singapore last September to study, the flock at the market helped the city feel like home. In Singapore, Loh worked at a wildlife reserve, handling birds of prey, but she’d largely overlooked pigeons because of the strident national position against them. In Norwich she began feeding the flock and de-stringing birds’ feet in order to feel connected to animals again.Loh has since been working with Coupland to stand up for pigeons. “They’re just little guys,” she enthuses. “They are genuinely so full of personality … They’re like dogs.”If you watch pigeons for a while, Loh suggests, “you realise that they’re actually pretty nice to be around, and don’t mean any harm”. Some people in Norwich have told her that they find the birds beneficial for their mental health. “To watch them, feed them, the sound they make – it’s quite calming.”If we can’t expect to eradicate pigeons from towns and cities, Loh and Coupland argue, one solution is to accommodate them better. They propose building a dovecote in nearby Chapelfield Gardens, drawing birds away from the busy market and enabling proactive management. For example, eggs can be removed from nests and replaced with dummies, effectively and ethically reducing numbers over time.View image in fullscreen‘If the food supply were to be abruptly cut off, there would be a lot of suffering.’Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian“It’s a win-win solution,” says Loh. HerChange.org petition, outlining the dovecote proposal, has received more than 4,000 signatures since December. Loh says that at a council meeting Harper dismissed it as a poor use of taxpayers’ money – yet, she says, “they spent £4,000 on a hawk”.In her statement, Harper said the council was exploring “more suitable locations … for pigeons to gather”, but declined to comment specifically on the Chapelfield dovecote. Proposals can be expected later this year.Smith says the dovecote is a good idea, and similar solutions have been successful overseas, but foresees it being a “tough sell” in the UK. “It seems like the sort of thing that, culturally, we’re not ready for.”Pigeons are routinely overlooked in science and conservation. Despite their global abundance, we understand “disproportionately little” about them, Smith says, reflecting researchers’ preference for more charismatic or threatened species. But, he argues, “If we want to understand what future ecosystems are going to look like, we have to learn about the things that are thriving.”View image in fullscreen‘Don’t dislike them because you think they spread disease – because it’s just not true’Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianThat is what is behind Smith’s own interest, he adds. “I think there’s something special about that: they are survivors.” Coupland agrees they’re “brilliant” – but says in the case of the row rumbling on in Norwich, whether pigeons are good or bad is besides the point. “They’re always going to be here.” And even local people agree there are bigger issues at the market.At the picnic tables, Andy Guy from Wymondham, Norfolk, doubts that there will ever be a “cure” for the pigeons: “They’re everywhere.” He’s more exercised by the council’splanned market revamp– a misuse of funds, he says. Until 2010, “the council used to be out here every night, washing, cleaning, picking up the rubbish … It just needs tidying up, but they don’t.”Long after Coupland is gone from the Memorial Gardens, 13-year-old Amelie turns up to spread some seed herself. “I’ve always adored them,” she says, as the birds crowd around her hand.Amelie has no intention of stopping. The council’s effort to shift pigeons from the war memorial is ironic given the part they played in the first world war, delivering coded messages, saving lives, she points out. And if they really did spread disease, “surely half of Norwich would be sick by now”, Amelie says. “I just think that it’s rather silly.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleBirdsWildlifeAnimalsNorwichfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.UK households use 13bn plastic bottles every year,which takeat least 450 years to decompose, while more than 212m toothbrush heads or manual toothbrushes arethrown away across the country annually.For this reason, I’ve been moving away from conventional, easy-to-pick-up-with-the-big-shop products for the past decade. Taking a more sustainable approach to washing and cleaning doesn’t have to be inconvenient, though, and it’s easier than it was when I first started doing it.If – like me – you’ve ever had to resort to buying “emergency” shampoo in a plastic bottle because you didn’t have time to go to the refill shop; can’t easily find a family friendly plastic-free toothpaste; or are on a mission to be green when you clean, then I have the answer for you: subscriptions.I’ve tried most of the sustainable subscriptions on this list (and where I haven’t, friends have, and have reported back). Most have plastic-free packaging, and many have the option to recycle empty vessels by sending them back in prepaid envelopes. Oh, and there’s the added advantage that many of these brands are B Corp certified and all use bags of natural ingredients, too. Whether you’re after a refillable deodorant that actually works or the moststylish tin of sustainable washing detergent, I’ve got you covered.Disclaimer: I love my localrefill shopsand use them alongside these subscriptions.But not everyone has easy access to one.The best eco-friendly cleaning and toiletries subscriptionsSustainable dishwasher tabletsView image in fullscreenSmol dishwasher tablets, pack of 30£6.50 at SmolThis is the first product I subscribed to, and these have been coming through my letterbox – because the plastic-free packaging is designed to be postable when you’re not in – for more than a decade. Once you get the subscription frequency right, it just arrives when you need it with the post. These effective lower-chemical tablets don’t require companion products such as salt, rinse aid or glass protector, and get everything as clean as regular tablets (even on short washes).Smol also does:laundry capsules,fabric conditioner,multi-purpose cleaner,washing-up liquidandhand soapEco-friendly shampooView image in fullscreenUpCircle shampoo creme, 100ml£16.99 on subscription at UpCircleI’ve used a lot of UpCircle products for many years, but my favourite is the shampoo creme. You need only the tiniest amount, so it lasts ages, and my hair likes it very much. The brand uses upcycled ingredients (hence the name), including coffee grounds collected from artisan cafes, oat husks from the oat milk industry, and, for this shampoo, leftover berries from the fragrance industry. It comes in a glass jar, which you can pop in with your kerbside recycling, or save to use for another product at your local refill shop.Upcircle also does:facial oils,cleansers,moisturisers,deodorant,lip balmVegan washing detergentView image in fullscreenEat Dirt laundry liquid£13.95 on subscription at Eat DirtI’ve just started using this new washing detergent, and I’ve been impressed so far.

It’s formulated specifically to work well at low temperatures (I can confirm that it does), and it smells divine, too.Recyclable toothbrush headsView image in fullscreenSuri replacement toothbrush heads, two every six months£8.98 at SuriI bought my aluminium sonic toothbrush from Suri a few years ago, and I absolutely love it. It not only looks great in the bathroom (I went for the sage green colour), but also the heads are an environmental win. Made from cornstarch with castor oil bristles, they don’t rely on the usual petroleum-based plastics and come with a compostable prepaid mini post bag so you can return your used heads to Suri for recycling.Suri also does:toothpasteFor more, read ourSuri 2.0 electric toothbrush reviewRefillable toothpasteView image in fullscreenLife Suppliessensitive toothpaste, three refill packs£21 at Life SuppliesToothpaste bottle£16 at Life SuppliesI tried a LOT of sustainable toothpastes before I settled on this one, which I really like. The refillable bottle is a handsome addition to the bathroom, while the toothpaste tastes great and is made using natural ingredients (papaya extract and pure mint oils). The refills come in compostable packets, three at a time, and my subscription frequency of every three months is more than enough for my family of two. NB it’s worth running the bottle empty and putting it through the dishwasher to get it totally clean before you refill it.Life Supplies also does:antiperspirant,handwashandbamboo toothbrushesSustainable loo rollView image in fullscreenBazoo sustainable bamboo toilet paper, 48 rolls£40 at BazooI was glad to already be a subscriber to Bazoo before the great Covid loo roll shortage of 2020, although I confess I still can’t quite manage to get the frequency right. This is fine though: you get a warning by email a few days before your next batch is due to be sent out, so you can skip one or delay it if you, like me, still have plenty of rolls on the go.

The deodorant itself is effective (my personal favourite scent is coconut milk), is made using natural ingredients such as sunflower seed wax and essential oils, and the refills come in plastic-free packaging. If you take a while to figure out your subscription frequency, you don’t need to panic-buy a plastic alternative: the refills are widely available in supermarkets.Fussy also does:body wash,hand washEco-friendly cleaning sprayView image in fullscreenHomethings cleaning spray, three refills£7 at HomethingsWhen the founders of Homethings realised that cleaning sprays are often made up of 95% water in single-use plastic bottles, they set about making dilutable refill products (a starter kit plan costs £19). As a result of their light weight, they have 90% less CO2 emissions than regular cleaning products. The concentrated eco scents are vegan and cruelty free. I’m a particular fan of the glass and mirror cleaner, which is a dab hand at removing my whippet’s muddy paw prints from our patio doors.Homethings also does:laundry sheets,dishwasher tablets,cleaning sprays,washing-up liquid,loo cleaner,plant-based sponges,toilet rollEssential oil loo dropsView image in fullscreenPurdy & Figg Oh!de Loo lime & lemongrass, every three months£13.56 at Purdy & FiggAfter staying with more than one friend who keeps this wonder product in the bathroom, I had to get some for myself.

Food styling assistant: Florence Blair.Kitchen aideChefsThe secret to perfect roast chickenBrines or rubs, spatchcocked or baked upside down, our expert panel picks apart the perfect birdAnna BerrillTue 17 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWhat’s the best way to roast a chicken?Nicola,by email“Fundamentally, people overcomplicate it,” says Ed Smith, who has, rather conveniently, written a new book all about chicken,Peckish. “Yes, you can cook it at a variety of temperatures, use different fats, wet brine or dry brine, etc etc, but, ultimately, if you put a good chicken in the oven and roast it, you will have a good meal.”To elaborate on Smith’s nonchalance, he has three key rules: “One, start with a good chicken: free-range, ideally slow-reared and under the 2kg mark – small birds just roast better, I think.” Second, it doesn’t need as long in the oven as you might think. “Whatever it says on the packet will be too long,” says Smith, who roasts his chicken for about 50 minutes in a 210C (190C fan) oven. And, last, give it a rest: “Your chicken will be better for sitting for 15-20 minutes, and will still be steaming hot when you cut into it.”The expansion on those rules is to salt the bird really well both inside and out, Smith adds: “And if you can leave it in the fridge for an hour to a day ahead, fantastic!” For Mike Davies, chef director ofThe Camberwell Armsin south London, submerging the bird overnight in a solution of water, salt, sugar and aromatics (lemon, bay, peppercorns being natural bedfellows) is essential: “Brining feels cheffy, but in reality it’s quite straightforward. You just need a big enough container.”Fat-wise, Anna Tobias, ofCafe Decoin London, covers her chicken in neutral vegetable oil (rapeseed or sunflower, say), seasons, then pops half a lemon and a sprig of rosemary in the cavity, before turning the bird upside down to roast. “That’s maybe a bit random, but Margot [Henderson] always did that when I worked for her, so that’s what I do.” The reason being it crisps the underside of the thighs. “For a 1.75-2kg chicken, roast it upside down for half an hour at 200C (180C fan), then flip it the right way up and give it another half-hour.” Tobias never rests it, mind – “the skin goes flabby.” Davies, meanwhile, was taught by his mum to put butter under the skin, which he does to this day. “It bastes the chicken through the cook, and if you rub the fat on the skin, it helps moisten it. The main thing that’s going to give you crisp skin, though, is the skin being dry in the first place.”A slight tweak would be to spatchcock the chicken. “It then cooks slightly faster, so there’s less likelihood of overcooking the breast, and a high likelihood of lovely crisp skin and succulent legs,” Smith says. It’s a simple thing to do, too: “If you’re dubious, scissors take it to a lower level of effort; you’re just cutting down both sides of the backbone and that’s it.”You could also mix up your marinade or rub. “Anything that you might think to put on a chicken thigh or leg would be delicious on a roast chicken,” Smith says, whether you head to the deep south, India or Thailand. He also repeatedly returns to the OG, but varies how it’s eaten: “On a Monday with salad, then more leftovers with pasta or potato wedges.” Essentially, roast chicken performs well with a whole bunch of things, although for Tobias roast potatoes are tops. “Anything else is negotiable.”Got a culinary dilemma?

This crisp, savoury pancake originates from Hue, the historic capital of Vietnam’s central region. Traditionally served with a rich hoisin dipping sauce, my take swaps that out for a lighternước chấmwith sesame seeds. It stays true to the spirit of the original, though, preserving its joyful texture and bold, satisfying flavours, while using more accessible ingredients.Bánh khoái (joy pancake)This is just as joyful without the prawns: swap them for smoked or marinated tofu, and serve with sweet soy sauce for dipping. Purple perilla (also known as shisho leaves) is available in most Asian food stores.Prep10 minCook25 minServes48 tbsp vegetable oil4 eggs, beaten280gcooked and peeled king prawns(jumbo shrimp), or ready-cooked prawns4 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped200gbeansprouts4 tsp crispy fried shallots, to garnishFor the batter100grice flour25gplainflour½ tsp salt1 tsp sugar½ tsp baking powder1 tsp ground turmeric300mlcoconut cream(notcoconut milk)For the sesame nước chấm2 tsp white sesame seeds400mlnước chấm(Vietnamese fish sauce)For the salad½ fresh pineapple, peeled and cored1 star fruit, or green (unripe) mango2 baby gem lettuce,leaves separated80gpea shoots120grocket25gThai basil25gpurple perillaIn a large bowl, whisk all the batter ingredients until smooth. In a small bowl, stir the sesame seeds into the nước chấm and set aside.Put a 20cm cast-iron skillet or nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, add two tablespoons of oil and, when it’s hot, pour in about 75ml (five tablespoons) of the batter, swirling the pan to coat the base evenly. Drizzle over a tablespoon of beaten egg, then sprinkle over some prawns, spring onion and beansprouts (if you like them softened; if not, save them for the salad), then leave to cook for about two minutes, until the base is crisp and golden.Fold the pancake in half to enclose the filling, and transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining oil, batter and filling to make four pancakes.Slice the pineapple and star fruit or mango, arrange them and the remaining salad ingredients on a platter and put in the centre of the table. Garnish with crispy fried shallots.To eat, wrap pieces of pancake in lettuce with the herbs and fruit, dip into the sesame nước chấm, and enjoy every joyful bite.This recipe is an edited extract from One Pan Vietnam, by Thuy Diem Pham, published by Quadrille at £22.Explore more on these topicsFoodVietnamese food and drinkShellfishSeafoodVegetablesMain courseFruitrecipesShareReuse this content"

McEwan and his ilk will be even more perplexed then that even those guzzling from their Stanley Cups throughout the day are being told they arestillnot sufficiently hydrating themselves.Influencers are telling their followers they“don’t understand what hydration is”if they’re not adding electrolytes such as sodium and chloride (salt) as well as magnesium and potassium to their water to help their cells “hold on to and use” it. Often spruiking thesachets wellness companies are selling, they claim these fancy salt formulations are essential to avoiding migraines and muscle cramps, anxiety and mood swings. Some TikTokers areadding sachetsalongside other ingredients such as coloured ice cubes, edible glitter and fruit into the aforementioned massive cup in a trend known as“loaded water”.But what do the experts say – is plain old water not good enough any more?What role do electrolytes play in hydration?Our bodies are mostly made of water, which can be found both inside and outside cells (including in our blood), and in the space between the two. Electrolytes play a biological role controlling the flow of where the water molecules get shifted in and out of cells within the body, explains Associate Prof Ricardo Costa, the director of research at Monash University’s department of nutrition dietetics and food.Breathwork has its uses – but when it comes to ‘unlocking your fullest human potential’, beware the puffery | AntiviralRead moreBut electrolytes such as sodium don’t play a big role in hydration status, Costa says. Studies have shown that only when people consume a large amount of salt does it help retain water in the blood for hydration purposes – but thatcarries the risk of adverse health implications for blood pressure, he says.Other nutrients, including carbohydrates and proteins are actually more important than electrolytes in keeping your body hydrated, Costa says. “Everyone is obsessed with electrolytes – that possibly comes from half a decade of potential misinformation.”Do you need more electrolytes?The average person does not need to be adding electrolytes to their water, says Associate Prof Kagan Ducker, who co-leads the thermal physiology laboratory at Curtin University. “Our diet tends to provide the vast majority of our electrolyte needs for the day.”Athletes are “one of the more extreme cases of changes in hydration status”, he says. They might use sports drinks and electrolyte solutions when sweating a lot while exercising for longer durations, and to recover quickly if they are training or competing again soon. “For most people (including many athletes) that won’t be an issue.”Dr Fiona Willer, the president of Dietitians Australia, says if someone is vomiting or has diarrhoea they can also benefit from a slight increase in speed of absorption of water into the system. But she agrees that “for the vast majority of Australians who are just living day-to-day without doing anything super extreme, they’re an example of another unnecessary product on our shelves”.Gut check: are at-home microbiome tests a way to ‘hack your health’ or simply a waste? | AntiviralRead moreThe body is very good at keeping a check on the salt concentration of the blood, Willer says. “It’s the kidneys that make sure that there is enough salt in the system and enough of those other solutes to keep your blood pressure adequate to keep you alive. If you’re eating regular foods you get more than enough sodium in order for your kidneys to do the rest of the work.”Electrolytes can be found in fruits and vegetables, grain food and meat, she says.The body regulates electrolytes in a controlled manner, Costa agrees. When he analysed the blood plasma of people consuming different levels of salt, the study found the array of electrolytes was constant but the sodium in urine and sweat increased proportionally. “If you take more electrolytes, the body’s going to get rid of it.”What if you want to improve your hydration?“Certainly we do need to remember to hydrate,” Willer says. In general, Australians are slightly under-hydrated, observational studies show.“The best gauge of whether you’re adequately hydrated is to have a look in the toilet bowl once you’ve done a wee. If it is apale straw colour, not terribly bright (unless you’ve had multivitamins) that is good,” Willer says. “If it’s quite dark or verging on orangey brown, you need to get a bit more fluid in.”Electrolytes won’t change the colour of your urine, Willer says.If someone is concerned about their hydration, Kagan recommends they can contact anaccredited practising dietitianor their GP, or aSports Dietitians Australiaaccredited professional if they engage in strenuous work or exercise.Natasha May is a health reporter for Guardian AustraliaAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It screamed Finland or Sweden, not a sheep and deer farm in the Scottish Borders. It was the sort of isolated location that would set Ben Fogle’s heart racing in New Lives in the Wild. Two swans bugled my arrival. I felt a little embarrassed that all of it was mine.Sometimes, we need to escape to a place where the phone coverage is bad enough to make you believe you’re somewhere truly wild. Tiny Home Borders, hidden in rippling foothills 10 miles east of Hawick, is such a place. Last August, owners David and Claire Mactaggart opened a second two-person cabin on their farmland (the first opened in 2022) and I jumped at the chance to stay, swim, soak, and – crucially – switch-off.View image in fullscreenRed deer frequent the hills around the cabin.Photograph: Alba Images/AlamyThat first night, on the windblown deck a metre above the lapping water, I fired up the outdoor wood oven and tried to relax. But there was too much to do. First, I had a sauna. Then, I braved a cold plunge in the lochan and a rewarding soak in the burbling hot tub, with the smell of wood smoke filling my nostrils. A pizza followed beside the cabin’s crackling log burner, and later I stargazed using the cabin’s fabulous telescope.Everything is as eco as possible, with hemp insulation, solar panels and batteries, and reclaimed wood from the farmAs farms seek new ways to make money, farm stays and agritourism are, unsurprisingly a growing sector. According toVisit Scotland, the combined value of agritourism and farm retail could reach £250m by 2030, a rise driven by growing consumer interest in sustainable tourism. Fittingly, the country is to host the inauguralGlobal Agritourism Conferencein June, and the big topic of discussion within farming is not only the increasing costs of food production but how to diversify and do so sustainably.The Mactaggarts built their first tiny hut out of an old bale trailer, as an experiment more than anything else. The dream was to create an eco home away from home, with a mezzanine sleeping space above the lounge and kitchen, and with drama to match the setting below Rubers Law, a mini Ben Nevis on the banks of the River Teviot. Then, quickly, one cabin became two, the second built far out of sight of the other. Plans are afoot for a third cabin in another glen on the farm. And everything is as eco as possible, with hemp insulation, solar panels and batteries, reclaimed wood from the farm – and no wifi.A 90-minute drive from Edinburgh, the location is a great base for exploring an undervisited part of the country. “The Borders is nothing more than a drive-through for many visitors coming north,” Claire said. “It’s a beautiful area, but it’s one so few know about,” David added.View image in fullscreenHawick’s main street.Photograph: Allan Wright/AlamyBeside the location, breakfast is one of the delights of a stay. Fresh bread. Salty butter. Homemade marmalade. Farm eggs, when the hens are laying. Coffee on the deck and a set of binoculars provided. On my first morning, the sky shone saltire blue.Wildlife adds to the picture. Red deer outnumber people in these hills, so with wellies on after breakfast, I headed up the gentle slopes of Rubers Law to look for the Borders’ Big Five: bellowing deer, plus sheep, fox, pheasant and red squirrel.This town of textile weavers is full of cosy cafes, craft shops and tweed retailers that are perfect for a hit of winter warmthI passed along a muddy single track where wildflowers and wild garlic starting to sprout below hawthorn. Ahead, I saw two vicar-collared male pheasants, then, farther up the brae, five enormous hind deer that had come down from the cold of the hill. In the distance, where the path ended, I could see ducks, sheep, cattle and horses. It was Old MacDonald Had a Farm sprung to life.Few parts of the Borders are lovelier than historic Hawick. This town of textile weavers is full of cosy cafes, craft shops and tweed retailers that are perfect for a hit of winter warmth, and the centre is stitched together by four bridges, but also by mills for some of the world’s best-known knitwear manufacturers, includingHawicoandLovat Mill.Perhaps most striking isJohnstons of Elgin, home to a visitor centre, cafe and showroom designed to showcase the appeal of Borders knitwear. Thanks to Hawick’s longstanding tradition, its cashmere, merino and tweed pieces are now coveted by the biggest names in haute couture: Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren.After lunch at nearbyDamascus Drum, a cafe-bookshop decorated with flat-weave rugs, I joined a guided tour of Johnstons of Elgin’s newly extended operation atEastfield Mill, which opened last August. The mill is labyrinthine and atmospheric, home to hundreds of knitters, needle-workers and machines, all hand-finishing, stitching and whirring. Next to this is a yarn library holding 18 tonnes of kaleidoscopic colour, from gorse yellow to heathery purple.View image in fullscreenMike MacEacheran found plenty to do around the cabin.Photograph: Mike MaceacheranMy last stop was theBorders Distilleryin the town’s former hydroelectric plant, a fitting place to finish on a winter’s day. With the rain pouring outside, the sky dark as slate, a glass of blended Scotch at the tour’s end from distiller David Shuttleworth felt like a blessing. The glass smelt of green apples and grass, and I was perfectly able to picture the Borders farms that grow the barley for the spirit’s malt.Hiking an unruly but beautiful new coast path in south-west ScotlandRead more“The whisky industry is about storytelling and ours is tied to Hawick’s landscape,” said David. “The Teviot brought us here and all our malt comes from 20 miles around the distillery.” That also translates to a low carbon footprint and a community-driven vision that, combined with a takeaway miniature dram, left me feeling heartened.Back at the cabin, it was late, and, out there in the darkness, I sat under the deck’s awning in the rain, my glass of whisky drained. What a great wee place Hawick is, I thought. What a place of rural community and inspiration. And hopefully many newcomers will agree with the Mactaggarts – that this is a place that’s been overlooked by too many for too long.The trip was provided byVisit ScotlandandTiny Home Borders.

Knowing that its contents could be in the hands of the Kenyan government made Mwangi – who has described harassment andeven torture– feel unsafe and “exposed”, he told the Guardian.Areport released on Tuesdayby Citizen Lab, which tracks digital threats against civil society, has found with “high confidence” that Kenyan authorities used Israeli technology to break into Mwangi’s phone while he was under arrest last year, when the device was in police custody.Authorities’ use of the technology, made by Cellebrite, “could have enabled the full extraction of all materials from Mwangi’s device, including messages, private materials, personal files, financial information, passwords, and other sensitive information”, Citizen Lab said.The findings, researchers claimed, add to the growing body of evidence that Cellebrite’s technology is being “abused by its government clients, and the company is failing to prevent those abuses from happening”.In a statement to the Guardian, Cellebrite said it maintained a “rigorous process for reviewing allegations of technology misuse” and that it took “decisive action”, including licence termination, when credible and substantiated evidence is presented to the company.“We do not respond to speculation and encourage any organisation with specific, evidence-based concerns to share them with us directly so we can act on them,” the company said.The Guardian reached out toKenya’s police spokesperson and the Kenyan embassy in Washington for comment but did not receive a response.Amnesty International said last July, after Mwangi’s arrest and charges thathe unlawfully possessed ammunitionin connection to his role in street protests, that the legal campaign against him appeared to be “part of a broader effort to intimidate lawful dissent and those committed to upholding the rule of law”. Mwangi was released on bond a few days after his arrest and is expected again in court on Wednesday.In an interview, Mwangi said he knew he operated in an environment of constant surveillance. By the time authorities came for him, he said, they had collected information about him from other people’s phones, and “knew my role in the movement”.“We know that I get spied on all the time. I know that my phone calls are monitored and my messages are read,” he said.Last year, aforensic analysis by Citizen Lab foundthat the FlexiSPY spyware had been installed on phones belonging to Kenyan film-makers Bryan Adagala and Nicholas Wambugu while the devices were in police possession. Police were investigating them in connection with a BBC documentary incriminating security forces in killings duringanti-government protests in 2024. The BBC denied the two men were involved in the production.The latest findings by Citizen Lab, Mwangi said, pointed to the role played by “non-state actors” in enabling the surveillance of pro-democracy activists by a government accused of abducting people.“By them giving the government the access to spy on me, they’re putting my life in jeopardy,” he said.Citizen Lab’s latest findings follow aseparate report released in January, in which the researchers said authorities in Jordan appeared to be using Cellebrite to extract information from the mobile phones of activists and protesters who had been critical ofIsraeland spoken out in support ofGaza.In response to the report, Cellebrite said at the time that its technology was used to “access private data only in accordance with legal due process or with appropriate consent to aid investigations legally after an event has occurred”.Cellebrite products have reportedly also been used to target members of civil society in other parts of the world, including in Myanmar and Botswana. There have also beenindications of its use in SerbiaandBelarus.John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said: “Your phone holds the keys to your life, and governments shouldn’t be able to help themselves to the contents just because they don’t like what you are saying … When Cellebrite sells their technology to a security service with a track record of abuses, journalists, activists, and people speaking their conscience are at risk.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaSurveillanceProtestAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There have been 42 known strikes in notorious drug-trafficking routes such as the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, according to the Associated Pressreported.US Southern Command postedvideoto social media, showing this week’s strikes. Authorities insisted the boats transported drug-trafficking criminals but the video does not appear to provide information confirming this claim.“Intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and were engaged in narco-trafficking operations,” US Southern Command said. Officials added that four men were killed on one boat in the eastern Pacific, four on another vessel in the eastern Pacific, and three on a vessel in the Caribbean.“NoUS militaryforces were harmed,” US Southern Command said.The US Southern Command carried outtwo deadly boat strikeslast week, similarly claiming those killed were suspected of drug trafficking.Many have questioned the legality of the US boat strike initiative. Some legal experts have said the attacks are tantamount to extrajudicial military killings without an imminent threat of violence.“Those being killed by US military strikes at sea are denied any due process whatsoever,” a recentanalysisby the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy organization, said. Trump’s administration, the office said, was “asserting and exercising an apparently unlimited license to kill people that the president deems to be terrorists”.The recent spate of strikes come weeks after US forces attacked Caracas, capturing the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, to face trial in New York on drugs, weapons and narco-terrorism charges.While the Trump administration has portrayed boat strikes and Maduro’s capture as part of a fight against narco-terrorism, there has not been abundant evidence of trafficking rings.The Pentagon had deployed more than a dozen warships to waters near Venezuela, to block drug trafficking and the illegal oil trade, the Washington Postreported. Several of those ships have since been dispatched eastward amid Trump’s military threats to Iran over its nuclear weapons program.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Jerí has denied wrongdoing and said the appointments were legal.The shake-up at the top of Peruvian politics comes amid a tit-for-tat row between the US Trump administration’s newly appointed ambassador to Peru,Bernardo Navarro, and China.Navarro, who began his diplomatic duties in Peru this month, lambasted “cheap Chinese money”in a post on X– adding that there was “no higher price to pay than losing sovereignty”, in what appeared to be a pointed reference to the port of Chancay, which is majority-owned by the Chinese firm Cosco Shipping Ports.The fully automated port is located about 50 miles north of Lima. Previously, US officials have suggested that the deepwater port could be used for naval activities, which Peru has denied.In response, China’s foreign ministry decried what it called the US’s “false accusations and disinformation against China’s cooperation with Peru” concerning Chancay port.Keen to deflect the US’s diplomatic broadside, Peru’s foreign ministry posted aphotograph on Xof its minister shaking hands with China’s ambassador to Peru, Song Yang, to mark the lunar new year and praising Chinese investments and bilateral trade relations.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasChinaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases. Macías’ asylum in the UK was first reported by Mexicannews outlet N+.Macías was first lady of Veracruz from December 2010 to October 2016, when her husband resigned amid allegations of organised crime and embezzlement. He was alleged to have siphoned away billions of pounds from state coffers.At the time, Duarte and Macías’ alleged crimes came to embody the graft that has plagued Mexico for years, and was particularly rampant during the government of then-president Enrique Peña Nieto. Mexico remains one of the most corrupt countries in the world, with Transparency Internationalrecently rankingit as 141 out of 182 countries.After his resignation, Duarte fled the country, but was arrestedsix months later in Guatemala. He was jailed in Mexico on money laundering and criminal conspiracy charges. Mexican prosecutors recently requested to extend his sentence on charges that he embezzled £215,000 from a state fund that was supposed to support children and the elderly.While serving as first lady, Macías reportedly enjoyed the use of a 15-acre, $9.7m ranch called El Faunito, where the walls were decorated with paintings by Latin American masters such as Rufino Tamayo and Fernando Botero.She was also head of the state welfare office, where she is alleged to have awarded contracts worth millions of pounds to shell companies. Authorities later found a warehouse filled with goods belonging to the couple, including Macías’ notebooks.On Tuesday, Sheinbaum displayed a page from one of those notebooks where Macías had written “I deserve abundance” over and over again.Macías disappeared from view shortly after her husband’s capture. In 2018, a Mexican judge issued an arrest warrant for Macías, accusing her of embezzlement. Days later, Duarte’s successor, Miguel Ángel Yunes,presented the findingsof a months-long surveillance effort, alleging she was living a life of luxury in London.According to Yunes’ investigation, Macías had a home in Belgravia, one of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods, less than a mile from Buckingham Palace. Macías reportedly spent at least £60,000 a month, and attended a “face gym” to strengthen her facial muscles.The day the findings were released, Interpol reportedly issued a red notice for Macías’ arrest, although she does not currently appear on the agency’s wanted list.Macías wasdetained by British authoritiesin October 2019 but she was released after paying £150,000 to face the extradition charges on bail. She also agreed to wear an ankle monitor.In 2022, Westminster magistrates court ruled in favour of her extradition to Mexico but Macías’ legal team filed several appeals to halt the process,according to local news reports, alleging that the case against her had expired, a fact that the Mexican foreign ministry had not shared with British authorities.Macías had also filed an asylum petition with the British government, alleging that she was the victim of political persecution by the Mexican government.According to news reports,the disgraced first lady was granted asylum in the UK last year.As well as condemning the British government’s ruling, President Sheinbaum also questioned how Macías was able to live in one of the world’s most expensive cities.“This person, who has been living in the UK for quite some time now, who knows where they got the money? Because having children there, living in a special place, where did they get it from?”Explore more on these topicsMexicoLondonAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Japan during the lunar new year holidays is expected to fall by up to 60% from the previous year.The dispute overTaiwanhas intensified since Takaichi told MPs in November that military involvement was an option if a crisis in the Taiwan Strait posed an “existential” threat to Japan.Her refusal to back down has invited more criticism from China, including its foreign minister, Wang Yi, who this week accused Takaichi of trying to revive Japan’s militarist past.Wang told the Munich Security Conference on Monday: “Japanese people should no longer allow themselves to be manipulated or deceived by those far-right forces, or by those who seek to revive militarism.“All peace-loving countries should send a clear warning to Japan: if it chooses to walk back on this path, it will only be heading toward self-destruction.”In response, Japan protested through diplomatic channels, while the foreign ministry in Tokyo condemned Wang’s claims as “factually incorrect and ungrounded”.“Japan’s efforts to strengthen its defence capabilities are in response to an increasingly severe security environment and are not directed against any specific third country,” the ministry said in a statement.It said there were “countries in the international community that have been rapidly increasing their military capabilities in a non-transparent manner”, but added that “Japan opposes such moves and distances itself from them”.Liu Xiaoming, China’s special representative on Korean peninsula affairs, upped the ante when he said Takaichi’s remarks were proof of Japan’s “unextinguished ambition to invade and colonise Taiwan once again, and the lingering ghost of revived militarism”.In apost on Xthat referenced Japan’s 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Liu added: “The lessons of history are not far away and must be heeded. If Japan refuses to repent and change its ways, it will inevitably repeat the same tragic mistakes.”Officials in Beijing have repeatedly warned travellers they face threats to their safety in Japan, although there have been no reports of incidents targeting tourists from China.On Sunday, the Chinese consulate general in Osaka again urged Chinese nationals to refrain from travelling to Japan after a fatal stabbing in the city. The incident, in which a teenager was stabbed to death and two others injured in a popular tourist area, did not involve Chinese nationals.Not all people have heeded the official travel advice. A Chinese man told the Kyodo news agency it was important to promote goodwill between ordinary people from both countries. Another, a woman from Shanghai, said she still planned to visit Japan with her parents. “The travel alert is aimed at promoting criticism of Japan,” she told Kyodo. “But my family has not been brainwashed.”With ReutersExplore more on these topicsJapanChinaLunar new yearAsia PacificSanae TakaichiTaiwannewsShareReuse this content"

The charge is formally the same. Last time, it took almost 17 years and a democratic transition to deliver a verdict. This time, it has taken 14 months. Chun’s death sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment on appeal, and he was eventually pardoned.Under the country’s criminal code, the charge of leading an insurrection carries three possible sentences: death, life imprisonment with labour, or life imprisonment without labour.South Koreahas not carried out an execution since 1997, so in practice a death sentence would mean permanent exclusion from society with no possibility of parole.But as the ruling approaches, there is a sense of exhaustion and division in South Korea as the months-long saga, in which 27 people have been indicted over the martial law crisis, continues.View image in fullscreenSoldiers try to enter the main hall of the National Assembly in Seoul on 3 December 2024 after the then president Yoon declared martial law.Photograph: YONHAP/AFP/Getty ImagesDowon Kim, a 32-year-old office worker in Seoul, no longer discusses politics with friends, some of whom still support Yoon. “Society is too exhausted,” he says, “and my energy feels wasted trying to persuade them.”South Korea has now impeached two presidents inunder a decade, and Kim says people simply want to move past the cycle: “Those who should be punished should be punished, and we need to move forward.”Song Ji-won, a 24-year-old student in Incheon, west of Seoul, says what happened was a national embarrassment. “I just want to stop hearing about it.”View image in fullscreenYoon’s supporters were vocal after his impeachment, pictured here shouting slogans in front of the ruling Democratic party headquarters on the first anniversary of the declaration of martial law.Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty ImagesTheK-pop light stick proteststhat once brought millions on to the streets have long subsided.Maga-inspiredpro-Yoon rallieshave dwindled to the fringes.At a recent gatheringwhere 2,300 registered supporters were expected, about 20 appeared. The political fallout has been devastating for the People Power party, which has been unable to divorce itself from Yoon’s legacy. It polled at just 22% last week,according to Gallup Korea, against 44% for the ruling Democratic party.From martial law to impeachment in 11 daysOn the night of 3 December 2024, prosecutors allege Yoon declared martial law and attempted to use military force toparalyse the legislature, arrest political opponents and seize control of the national election commission. Yoon said he was rooting out “anti-state forces” and allegedelection fraud.View image in fullscreenMembers of the then opposition Democratic party set up barricades at a entrance of the National Assembly building on 4 December 2024 after the martial law declaration.Photograph: YONHAP/AFP/Getty ImagesProsecutors allege he had plotted for more than a year, strategically placing loyalists in key military positions. It was the first emergency martial law declaration in the country in 44 years, shattering the assumption that military rule was a relic of South Korea’sauthoritarian past.The response to Yoon’s move was swift. Within hours, 190 lawmakers broke through military and police cordons around parliament to pass an emergency resolution lifting martial law. Parliament impeached Yoonwithin 11 days. The constitutional courtremoved him from officefour months later. Three separate special prosecutors were appointed, and across their investigations more than 120 people have been indicted, from the president himself to cabinet ministers, military commanders and intelligence chiefs.Despite the relative quiet in the build-up to this week’s court ruling, the weight of the moment is not lost on South Koreans. Over the past few weeks, they have watched as the courts established key legal findings through related cases.On 16 January, Yoonreceived five yearsforobstructing his own arrest. Days later, the former prime minister Han Duck-soowas given 23 yearsin a ruling that formally found the events of 3 December constituted insurrection, describing it as a “self-coup” by elected power more dangerous than traditional uprisings. The sentence far exceeded prosecutors’ 15-year demand, signalling judicial willingness to impose severe penalties.View image in fullscreenPeople protest outside the National Assembly in Seoul demanding the resignation of Yoon in December 2024.Photograph: Raphael Rashid/The GuardianOn 12 February, the former interior minister Lee Sang-minwas jailed for seven yearsfor his role in the insurrection, including relaying Yoon’s orders to cut power and water to media outlets.But Thursday’s verdict rests with a different presiding judge. The insurrection findings in the earlier cases, while significant, do not bind this panel. It will make its own determination on whether 3 December crossed the criminal threshold for insurrection.Sangchin Chun, a professor of sociology at Sogang university, said the final blow to Yoon’s movement may not be the verdict itself but whether people feel their daily lives improving under the president, Lee Jae Myung. “Ending the insurrection seems to have become less a legal matter than an everyday economic one,” he said.

Under South Korean sentencing principles, genuine repentance is a formal legal consideration.He faces further legal battles: six additional criminal trials, two of which stem from the martial law crisis, including a treason indictment for allegedly ordering drone incursions into North Korean airspace to provoke a confrontation that could justify military rule.For South Korea, the verdict will mark the culmination of one of the most extensive exercises in democratic accountability against a former head of state in its history, with the court also handing down judgmentsagainst seven co-defendants including senior military and police officials implicated in the plot.Many of those watching will havelived through the authoritarian eraof the 1980s that the 2024 martial law declaration so starkly echoed. The democratic guardrails they fought to build are being tested.

A man was also stabbed in the shop.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA security camera on the shop’s entry appears to show the same man fleeing the shop, walking along the footpath and stabbing another male.CCTV footage published by Nine shows a man running along a path next to the train tracks soon after the alleged attacks.

Are ‘influencers’ fostering hate in Australia?Read moreIt follows what Puglielli described as a “disturbing” and “terrifying” series of attacks targeting gay and bisexual men across several states and territories since 2024. In some instances, videos of the attacks have been recorded and posted on social media.As of October 2024, 35 people had been arrested in relation to such incidents, Victoria police confirmed in a statement to Guardian Australia.Police said the alleged offenders – most aged between 13 and 20 – hadused fake profiles on dating apps to lure their victims.“The victims are then allegedly assaulted, robbed, threatened and subjected to homophobic comments,” a police spokesperson said.“There is absolutely no place for this type of concerning behaviour in our society.”In the past year, Guardian Australia hasreported on attacks on men organised through dating apps, with Victoria police confirming that anti-LGBTQ+ influencers had been promoting “methods of attack” online.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailDuring the June 2025 sentencing of a 19-year-old Victorian manwho met and assaulted two people after speaking to them on the gay dating app Grindr, the court heard he admitted to police he had been inspired by vigilante-style videos he had seen on TikTok.Puglielli said the inquiry would examine how influencers sharing far-right, misogynistic and homophobic “alpha male” content operate online, and how to protect young people from their messaging.He alleged some perpetrators, often very young men, had been “groomed and radicalised by far-right manosphere influencers”.“This is dark-corner-of-the-internet stuff, largely going on in the shadows,” Puglielli said.“We really have to get to the bottom of these issues. How are people being radicalised? What type of content are they consuming that eventually leads them to commit these terrible acts?”Puglielli said such online networks were growing “quicker than our laws seem to be able to keep up”.“As a queer person and as a member of parliament, I don’t have all the answers,” he said. “But complexity can’t be an excuse to ignore the problem.”Puglielli said it was his expectation that dating apps would be called to appear before the inquiry, alongside policymakers and police.He added that the inquiry could make recommendations to the commonwealth if matters fall outside the state’s jurisdiction.The motion is expected to pass with support from MPs from the Legalise Cannabis and Animal Justice parties, as well as the Labor government. Guardian Australia understands negotiations were continuing between the Greens and Labor over the final wording of the inquiry’s terms of reference on Tuesday night.Under the Greens’ proposed terms of reference, the committee would be required to report by 1 September, giving the government enough time to respond before the caretaker period ahead of the November state election.The equality minister, Vicki Ward, said the government supported the inquiry and considered any violence or hatred towards LGBTQ+ people unacceptable.“Hate crimes cause real harm and fear. No one should ever be targeted for who they are or who they love,” Ward said.“We will continue to use every lever available to prevent and respond to this violence and ensure all Victorians can live safely, wholly and freely. I look forward to the learnings that come from this inquiry.”Ward said the government had strengthened anti-vilification and bail laws and had criminalised “posting and boasting”, while LGBTQ+ community members also met with the premier’s anti-hate taskforce last year.Police stressed that reporting incidents to a dating app was “not the same as reporting to police” and encouraged any victims to come forward.“We want victims to know it is never too late to make a report – so when you’re ready, please speak to us,” their spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsVictoriaLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

After meeting US allies at the Munich Security Conference during a particularly tense moment in transatlantic relations, the US secretary of state departed for Slovakia and Hungary – the two EU states most dependent on Russian energy and sceptical of the bloc’s support for Ukraine.In what bordered on an explicit political endorsement, Rubio told Orbán that relations betweenHungaryand the US had entered a “golden age” – and would stay like that for as long as Orban remains in power.“If you face financial struggles, if you face things that are impediments to growth, if you face things that threaten the stability of your country, I know that President Trump will be very interested … to finding ways to provide assistance if that moment ever were to arise, and obviously with regards to finances and the like,” Rubio said.The offer of financial support – and a nod toward extending Hungary’s exemption from sanctions on purchasing Russian oil and gas – came just two months before Orbán’s Fidesz party faces a punishing parliamentary election that marks the greatest threat to his control of Hungary in 16 years.1:17Trump is committed to Hungarian PM Orbán's success, says Rubio – videoIt also recalled offers made by the White House to other US rightwing allies abroad, including a $20bn bailout for Argentina’s Javier Milei that is credited with helping his party win crucial midterm elections by stabilising the country’s economy and currency.Hungarians have had enough of Viktor Orbán. But Trump’s tailwind could save his skin | András Bíró-NagyRead more“Especially as long as you’re the prime minister and the leader of this country, it’s in our national interest that Hungary be successful,” Rubio told Orbán.In Brussels, Rubio’s visit to Hungary was guaranteed to reinforce fears that the US was seeking to promote chaos and disunity among its allies as tensions grow over topics from Ukraine and Greenland to trade deals and defence spending. And his remarks looked a lot like an effort to sway an election in the heart ofEurope, said analysts.“It’s an ‘eff you’ to the EU,” said Theresa Fallon, the director of the Brussels-based Centre for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies. “It was really clear.”It has been a bruising few months in transatlantic relations, with Donald Trump demanding Denmark cede Greenland to the US on the grounds of national security. Adding insult to injury, Trump told reporters that Denmark was unable to protect the semiautonomous territory from an attack from Russia or China and that “their defence is two dog sleds”. He backed down on a threat to impose tariffs after Nato agreed to the framework of a future deal on the Arctic.And last year at the same conference last year,JD Vanceaccused European leaders of censoring their citizens using “ugly Soviet-era words like ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’” because they feared that voters might “express a different opinion, or – God forbid – vote a different way”. The EU’s top diplomat at the time said it seemed that the US was “trying to pick a fight with us”.Rightwing leaders endorse Viktor Orbán in Hungarian election campaign videoRead moreEuropean diplomats in Washington DC welcomed the dispatch of Rubio rather than Vance because he is seen as a more traditional Republican who had – until recently – backed a more conventional US foreign policy. In aTrump administrationwhere personalities so often dictate policy, Rubio’s continued presence has been seen as a rare bright spot. “He is much preferred to Vance, but they still both work for Trump,” said one European diplomat.Rubio’s speech in Munich was more restrained than the vice-president’s a year earlier, and was met with a standing ovation by many of the European officials present. He presented a case for revitalising, rather than scrapping, the Nato alliance, which was a key fear among European officials after Trump’s re-election.View image in fullscreenJD Vance and Marco Rubio at the Munich Security Conference in 2025. Rubio’s speech this year was more restrained than Vance’s last year.Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/AFP/Getty ImagesMatthew Kroenig, the vice-president and senior director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council, wrote that Rubio “did not repudiate anything in Vice President JD Vance’s more pugnacious speech last year, but he presented the same themes in a more positive light, focusing on shared challenges facing both Europe and the United States and how allies can work together to address them”.Fallon said: “Everybody wanted to hear something positive. And when they slept on it, they realised, oh my gosh, no, it’s the same thing, just packaged a little better.”But as one diplomat put it: “The message coming from both [Rubio and Vance] is clear: you are on your own.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMarco RubioTrump administrationJD VanceUS politicsEuropeHungaryanalysisShareReuse this content"

He said: “We cannot pretend this challenge doesn’t exist.”Thehermitage of Camaldoli, located in the middle of a national park and founded by Saint Romuald of Ravenna in the early 11th century, is home to nine monks. The main purpose of the retreat is for the monks to engage in prayer and sacred reading and, when in their individual rooms, to spend time in deep contemplation or meditation.“If the room is transformed into a cinema then where does our monastic and Romualdine spirituality end up?” Ferrari asked. He warned that real “cinephile addictions” exist, and could lead the monks to “becoming film experts rather than seekers of God”.He said it would be “much healthier” for monks to use their time alone “thinking about community moments”.In an interview withLa Nazione, Tuscany’s regional newspaper, Ferrari said his goal was not to reproach the monks but to invite them to “meditate on a theme that pervades everyone’s life and cannot be ignored”.In 2022, the late Pope Francis urged seminarians to use social media “to advance, to communicate”, while warning them about the dangers, particularly digital pornography.“I will not say ‘raise your hand if you have had at least one experience of this’,”Francis said. “But if each of you think you have had the experience or temptation … It is a vice that so many people have. So many laymen, so many laywomen, and also priests and nuns.”Explore more on these topicsCatholicismReligionItalyEuropeSocial mediaNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

It gave many teenagers in particular their first taste of freedom.Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the moped has increasingly become something of a cult lifestyle item in the former communist east, and has been taken advantage of by the AfD.The party’s Thuringia leader, Björn Höcke, is often to be found riding the Simson, accompanied by fans and followers, during activities to promote the party.Höcke has said the “Simson outings” help promote camaraderie among party members. He has teasingly touted it as an alternative form of transport to the cargo bike, often viewed as a mainstay of Green party supporters.At the height of its production during the GDR, up to 200,000 mopeds left the Ernst Thälmann factory in Suhl every year. In total, about 6m mopeds were produced. Today, secondhand models sell for between €2,000 and €4,500. The factory permanently closed in 2002.The AfD has integrated the moped into its election posters and general promotional material, saying it stands for “freedom, independence and individuality”. It has also pressed in several east German state parliaments for the motorcycle to be protected as “intangible cultural heritage”, submitting motions to back its campaign.A spokesperson for the Simson family, who now live in the US, has delivered a plea via German media for the appropriation to cease.“We find any connection with the AfD repulsive and an insult to our name,” Dennis Baum, a descendant speaking on behalf of the rest of the family, told the news agency DPA. “My family and I firmly reject extremist ideologies and will not accept the AfD’s appropriation of our name.”He said the family was offended by the fact that the moped’s name was increasingly viewed as synonymous with a party “which is overwhelmingly extremist”. “The name must not under any circumstances become a symbol of the AfD,” he added.The AfD was classified as “confirmed rightwing extremist” last year by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency (BfV). Höcke is described as one of its most extreme high-ranking members. He had actively disseminated far-right extremist ideology, in particular with his use of Nazi language, the agency said.Höcke, a former history teacher, has been repeatedly criticised by his political opponents for calling for a “180-degree turn in the politics of remembrance”, stressing his objection to the way in which Germans are told to remember the crimes of the Nazi era, and calling the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin a “monument of shame”.The Simson family was forced to flee Germany in 1936, escaping to the US after having to sell its business greatly under its value, in what was effectively a transfer to the state.The factory was initially established as a producer of charcoal steel for rifle barrels. It went on to become primarily a manufacturer of weapons, but also developed vehicles, including a racing car, the Simson Supra. During communism it became a state-owned enterprise, and produced mopeds, initially under contract to the Soviet military administration.The AfD has yet to comment.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightNazismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

However, the STW project waspaused in 2024amid concerns over costs.Government responses to freedom of information requests submitted by the thinktank TaxWatch, seen by the Financial Times, now suggest no money has been spent on the project since January last year, with the Treasury writing that the programme had been “brought to an early closure”.A series of delays have hindered post-Brexit border arrangements. The National Audit Office estimated that the government spent at least£4.7bn on post-Brexit border controls in 2024.The TaxWatch director, Mike Lewis, told the FT: “For all intents and purposes the single trade window has been cancelled without HMRC or Deloitte and IBM having delivered anything after spending over £110m on it. But neither HMRC nor ministers appear to wish to admit this.”The government said while the “delivery” of the STW had been paused for the 2025-26 financial year, “policy development” continued. There is still, however, no definitive timeframe for its implementation.While the STW was promised by the former Conservative government, Keir Starmer’s Labour government had also promised to deliver the project. A trade strategy policy document published last year said “it remains the government’s intention to deliver a single trade window”, and that it was “committed to minimising administrative burdens and frictions experienced by businesses trading internationally”.Starmer has promised closer alignment on trade with the EU as part of the“reset” deal announced last May, which is designed to remove the need for border checks and health certificates.However, any deal on food standards and animal welfare, known as a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement, iscurrently being negotiatedbetween the UK and the EU and may not be implemented until 2027.A government spokesperson said: “We remain committed to delivering a single trade window, recognising its potential benefits to trade, as set out in the trade strategy published in June last year. Policy development is ongoing and focused on designing a service that delivers genuine value to businesses and strengthens the UK’s border system.”The news comes almost a decade after the Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum. Under the agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson’s government, the UK has tariff-free trade with the EU. However, access is limited by rules and restrictions, and isstill far awayfrom the UK’s previous membership of the single market and customs union.Goods exports have been particularly affected, with volumes falling dramatically after the end of the Brexit transition period in January 2021. In 2024, goods exports from the UK to the EU were 18% below their 2019 level in real terms.Deloitte declined to comment. IBM was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEconomicsGlobal economyBrexitEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, he was released from the Nowshahr prison, along with two other signatories of the statement, Vida Rabbani and Abdollah Momeni.Khamenei regime will not be able to keep control of Iran, says dissenting film-makerRead moreNo further details on any charges against Mahmoudian were immediately available. All three were released on bail.Mahmoudian is nominated for best original screenplay at the Academy Awards , along with Nader Saeivar, Shadmehr Rastin and the film’s director,Jafar Panahi. The film, a revenge drama inspired by Panahi’s own time in jail, is also nominated for best international feature as a submission from France.“Mehdi Mahmoudian, Vida Rabbani, and Abdollah Momeni peacefully exercised their right to express their views, but the regime responded by accusing them of ‘insulting the supreme leader’ and ‘propaganda against the Islamic Republic’,” Panahi said in a statement on Tuesday.“For years, such charges have been used as tools to criminalize thought, silence criticism, and instill fear in society. Turning a civil and peaceful act into a national security case is a clear sign of intolerance toward the independent voices of citizens.”Mahmoudian, a writer and political activist, has previously been imprisoned multiple times, including a five-year term that ended in 2014 on charges of “mutiny against the regime”. Panahi, who has himself been jailed and put under house arrest by the Islamic Republic regime, and Mahmoudian met in prison.Thousands were killed in last month’s nationwide protests in Iran. International pressure has grown over the regime’s crackdown on demonstrators, including a mass protest held over the weekend in Munich. On Friday, the US president, Donald Trump, said that regime change in Iran“would be the best thing that could happen”.Explore more on these topicsFilmIranJafar PanahiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The actor was asked what she thought of the state of the US.Photograph: Action Press/Shutterstock“Artists are free to exercise their right of free speech in whatever way they choose,” Tuttle said. “Artists should not be expected to comment on all broader debates about a festival’s previous or current practices over which they have no control. Nor should they be expected to speak on every political issue raised to them unless they want to.”But on Tuesday, major figures in the industry accused the Berlinale of “censoring” artists who have spoken out,Variety reported.The signatories, which also include Angeliki Papoulia, Saleh Bakri, Tatiana Maslany, Peter Mullan and Tobias Menzies, as well as directors Mike Leigh, Lukas Dhont, Nan Goldin, Miguel Gomes and Avi Mograbi, said they “fervently disagree” with Wenders’ views on film-making and politics. “You cannot separate one from another,” they said, adding that the “tide is changing across the international film world”.They cited the refusal of more than 5,000 film workers, including several major Hollywood names,to work with “complicit Israeli film companies and institutions”. The letter also noted that the Berlinale had made “clear statements” in the past about other “atrocities” including in Ukraine.“We call on the Berlinale to fulfil its moral duty and clearly state its opposition to Israel’s genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes against Palestinians, and completely end its involvement in shielding Israel from criticism and calls for accountability,” they said.View image in fullscreenNeil Patrick Harris was asked if he thought cinema could fight fascism.Photograph: Reynaud Julien/APS-Medias/Abaca/ShutterstockPolitically oriented questions at the Berlinale have dominated headlines and social media over the past week. High-profile guests questioned on political topics, often with limited connection to the films they were promoting, include US actor Neil Patrick Harris – whowas asked whether cinema could fight fascism, UK star Rupert Grint – who wasalso asked about fascism, and Malaysian actor Michelle Yeoh – who wasasked for her thoughts on the current state of the US.Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who co-directed the music documentary The Ballad of Judas Priest, said: “What a time to be alive, where you can both make a documentary about one of your favourite bands and fight fascism at the same time” – to reported applause from the room of journalists.Tuttle said there were “many different kinds of art, and many different ways of being political”. Film-makers, she said, were being criticised “if they can not compress complex thoughts into a brief soundbite when a microphone is placed in front of them when they thought they were speaking about something else”.Explore more on these topicsFestivalsMiddle East and north AfricaGazaPalestineWim WendersnewsShareReuse this content"

They ended after three and a half hours.There was no immediate word from the US delegation, but the US was expected to continue its military buildup in the region before a further round of talks in about a fortnight designed to address the gaps between the two sides.The patience and the poker face: Iran’s wily diplomat set to face the US in nuclear talksRead moreThe talks took place against the backdrop of a now-familiar slew of contradictory messages from Donald Trump, in which the US president said he believed Iran wanted a deal but also highlighted the US naval military buildup in the region.In Iran, it was a day of high emotion as many people attended memorial ceremonials for the thousands killed in recent protests, which were held on the 40th day since the deaths, in line with Shia mourning tradition.Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, admitted that some passersby had been killed. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, while attending a ceremony in Mashhad, looked broken as he stared at a sea of photographs of Iranians killed in the protests.Iran has refused to allow a UN independent fact-finding committee to work in parallel with an internal inquiry into the killings. Politicians who have blamed the security services have been arrested.Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said after the talks that “agreement was reached on general guiding principles” and added: “The atmosphere in this round of negotiations was more constructive. Good progress had been made in comparison with the first meeting.“Both sides have positions that will take some time to get closer to each other. The path to an agreement has been started but that does not mean we can reach an agreement quickly.”He added that the aim was to exchange texts on a draft agreement and then set a date for a further meeting.Khamenei responded to the presence of US warships off the coast of Oman – across the Gulf from Iran – by saying the US could not destroy the Islamic Republic and appearing to threaten the vessels.Warships were dangerous, he said, but “more dangerous than a warship is a weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea”. He said Iran could not be involved in a “foolish” pre-determined negotiation in which the only outcome was that Iran was not allowed nuclear energy.Iran also announced that parts of the strait of Hormuz would be closed on Tuesday to allow the Iranian navy to carry out live-fire exercises. A full closure of this narrow waterway, controlled by Iran, would cause chaos for commercial shipping.Iran insisted throughout the talks – the first round of which were held on 6 February – that it would not discuss its ballistic missile programme or its support for so-called proxy forces in the region. In a speech to the UN, Araghchi said Iran did not seek nuclear weapons and stressed its willingness to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency not Authority (IAEA).Iran instead focused its offer on a plan to dilute its 40kg stockpile of 60% highly enriched uranium, and the access it would grant the IAEA – the UN’s nuclear inspectorate – to Iran’s bombed nuclear sites.Highly enriched uranium at 60% is nearly weapons-grade material, and is not needed for a civil nuclear programme.Discussions also continued on the length of time that Iran might suspend enrichment – in part because the US bombing of its nuclear sites would make it impossible to do for as long as three years – but Iran has not ceded its right to enrich uranium domestically, a central US demand.View image in fullscreenProtesters against the Iranian government line the area in front of the UN office in Geneva on Tuesday.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPAThe Iranian side was led by Araghchi, who on Monday met the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi. The US side met Grossi on Tuesday, underlining how verification of the nuclear industry was at the centre of Tuesday’s round of talks.Any deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear programme would require a full return of the IAEA inspectors to Iran’s nuclear weapons facilities.Previous talks in Cairo on the Iran-IAEA protocols that would allow the IAEA full access to three main nuclear bombed sites broke down. A small number of IAEA inspectors are still working in Iran, but they have no detailed knowledge of the damage caused by US bombing or how many of centrifuges could be quickly restarted. The process of “downblending” highly enriched uranium, downgrading it from weapons grade, is an acknowledged technology.View image in fullscreenA handout photo released on 16 February by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards website, Sepah News, was said to show a ship firing a missile during an exercise held in the Gulf by the Revolutionary Guards and navy.Photograph: Sepah News/AFP/Getty ImagesTehran also offered Trump sweeteners in the form of a prosperity package, and a non-aggression pact between Iran and the US – and possibly Israel.At times, Trump has said the best outcome would be for Khamenei to stand down, but the US does not seem to have a strategy to achieve this. The US president has not committed himself to supporting Reza Pahlavi, the former shah’s son, who has many supporters and is offering himself as a transitional figure to democracy.In Iran, an executive committee for the establishment of a national salvation front of Iran has been formed around the three principles set out by the former prime minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi, now entering his 16th year of house arrest. The principles are: non-interference by foreign powers; rejection of internal despotism; and a democratic and peaceful transition. In a formation statement, the group said it wanted to be “the connecting link” between Iranians who wanted a free, fair and impartial referendum to determine Iran’s future political system.In an attempt to stop this movement, the security services have arrested many leading reformist politicians, alongside thousands of mainly young demonstrators. A group previously close to President Pezeshkian, operating under the banner of the Reform front, were arrested last week but over the weekend most were released, largely on bail. Fars news agency reported that Pezeshkian had intervened to secure their release. They now do not appear politically active.Others were still in jail, such as Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was this week given a new 14-month sentence for propaganda against the regime. Another reformist, Ali Shakouri-Rad, has been charged with propaganda against the regime after claiming the security services may have run false-flag operations by attacking mosques. He was referencing an article written by an IRGC officer.The judiciary on Tuesday said 10,538 protesters had been summoned for trial so far, and there were widespread reports of the prosecution trying to extract confession under physical pressure. Protesters are also routinely being denied the right to choose their own lawyer. Hundreds of people were arrested in one raid in Hamadan province.Explore more on these topicsIranIran nuclear programmeUS foreign policyTrump administrationSwitzerlandOmanMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Provided with no reason for being blocked from entry, medics who spoke with the Guardian believed their refusals came after giving first-hand testimony from their time in Gaza. Others said their identity or prior experience in the territory may have influenced decisions to block them.Among those recently denied entry isJames Smith, an emergency doctor who has not returned to Gaza since June 2024. On two consecutive occasions in 2025 he was denied entry, with no explanation given.View image in fullscreenJames Smith, an emergency doctor, who was twice denied entry to Gaza in 2025.Photograph: Raphaël Neal“Not just had I spoken to media outlets but I had spoken in a particular way,” said Smith, mentioning Israel’s registration guidelines for NGOs and foreign staff, which includes considerations such as having called for or participated in a boycott of the state of Israel.“I can only assume that it was elements of my public profile, because I’m otherwise a white, middle-class, British man with no Palestinian heritage, no criminal convictions,” said Smith, who was travelling with the nonprofit MedicalAidfor Palestinians (MAP).“It’s the expression of my politics that must have rattled them,” he added.After the announcement of a ceasefire in October, thedeath toll in Gaza continues to grow, and humanitarian organisations have remained critical of barriers to aid and medical evacuations. In August, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the denial rates of international health professionals rose by nearly 50%, with 102 people barred from 18 March.Khaled Dawas, a consultant surgeon, told the Guardian it was clear those who had been outspoken had been denied entry.“I can’t think of anything else,” Dawas said from London. “I’m not military. I don’t carry anything. I’m no different to the colleagues who have gone in. The only difference is that they haven’t spoken up as much.”He was denied entry in August and November with two separate organisations, after travelling to Gaza in 2024.Thaer Ahmad, an emergency physician from Chicago, was denied entry four times, most recently in January. As a Palestinian-American born in the US, he believes his identity is one of the reasons behind his blocked entry, as well his advocacy since travelling to Gaza in 2024. The reason given by Israeli authorities were security concerns.Thaer Ahmad at Shifa hospital in 2022.“This idea of weaponising access and weaponising aid, it’s engrained in all of the decisions that we see are being made in Gaza,” said Ahmad, adding that respective governments should assist doctors in appealing against decisions.Fresh concerns over access into Gaza were raised after37 NGOs active in Gazawere told in December they must cease operations. Among those deregistered was the UK-based MAP (Medical Aid for Palestinians). For the past six months, MAP has not been able to get medical workers or aid into Gaza. For each blocked entry, no reason was given.Steve Cutts, MAP’s chief executive, called the denial of entry a “deliberate measure” taken by Israel authorities, with life-and-death consequences for Palestinians in Gaza.“Israel’s deregistration of international NGOs and restrictions on medical personnel are part of a wider pattern of measures that are cruelly blocking humanitarian assistance and obstructing independent medical witnesses,” said Cutts.It is understood humanitarian organisations share lists of volunteer medics with the WHO before they go to Gaza.Some medics and humanitarian organisations first discovered they had been denied entry close to 24 hours before their entry date after travelling to Jordan. In other cases, they received rejections days before leaving the UK ahead of Israeli holidays.Cogat, the Israeli military agency that controls access to Gaza, called the claims “false and unfounded”.“They stem from ulterior interests of organisations that refuse to operate transparently and to cooperate with Israel’s registration process, which is based on clear professional and security criteria designed to safeguard the integrity of the humanitarian system,” it said.Cogat added: “It should be underscored that Israel continues to act to strengthen the healthcare system in the Gaza Strip.”A UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) spokesperson said the foreign secretary late last year met with medical teams denied entry into Gaza.“Israel must immediately lift restrictions and allow food, medical supplies and fuel to reach those in desperate need, in line with international humanitarian law,” they added.A petition recently filed by lawyers to the Israeli supreme court cites seven cases of alleged illegal refusals of entry, including that ofGraeme Groom, an orthopaedic surgeon from London and co-founder of the charity Ideals, who has visited Gaza more than 40 times. Since 7 October, he has been four times, and denied entry on three occasions. Each time he was refused, no explanation was given.“We think it may be because we are bearing witness to what is happening in Gaza,” he said. “Denying us entry is an extension of the policy which has excluded international journalists, and kills Palestinian journalists.”View image in fullscreenDr Victoria Rose, a plastic surgeon who has worked in Gaza, addresses the Gaza tribunal in September 2025 in London.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesLondon-based consultant plastic surgeon Victoria Rose, who was denied entry alongside Groom in late 2025, does not necessarily believe that having been outspoken on the number of injuries or paediatric injuries of Gaza was the reason she was blocked from entering.“They don’t want anyone going that knows the system, is useful, that is effective, that’s where it seems to be. I don’t necessarily think they’ve got a handle of what I’ve done or said,” she said. “Maybe.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaAidnewsShareReuse this content"

For the country, it signalled what many Bangladeshis hope will be a turning point from repression and unrest and a chance to revive the economy.Outside parliament, the mood was hopeful. Kamal Mia, 38, who arrived early to join the crowd, called the day “a new start”.“I’m not saying everything will change overnight,” Mia said. “But today feels different. Now we want them to work, bring prices down, stop corruption and let people live without fear.”View image in fullscreenPeople watch the swearing-in ceremony of Tarique Rahman on a big screen in Dhaka.Photograph: Rubel Karmaker/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockRahman, 60, comes from a long political lineage. His mother was the late prime minister Khaleda Zia and his father, Ziaur Rahman, founded the nationalist centre-right BNP and was a central figure in Bangladesh’s 1971 independence struggle before being assassinated as president in 1981.The BNP swept to a commanding two-thirds majority in last week’s election, securing 212 seats in the 300-member Jatiya Sangsad. An alliance including the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami won 77 seats.In a departure from tradition, the swearing-in ceremony took place outside at parliament, rather than inside the president’s official residence. Alongside Rahman, 25 cabinet ministers and 24 junior ministers were sworn in.Rahman, who returned from self-imposed exile in London last year just before his mother’s death, said the government had “very serious challenges to face” in order to turn around the economy and clamp down on widespread corruption.Inflation, job creation, law and order and institutional reform are expected to dominate the early weeks of his administration. Bangladesh’s garment-dominated, export-led economy has slowed sharply under pressure from global shocks, currency strains and domestic upheaval.“The first challenge is institutional – we have to bring the system back into order,” said Amir Khasru, a senior BNP leader who was sworn into the cabinet.The political analyst Badiul Alam Majumdar said that demonstrating good governance would be critical. Patronage politics and corruption had become “monumental challenges”.On foreign policy, Rahman has described China as a “development friend”, indicating Dhaka will seek to maintain strong economic ties with Beijing, even as it aims to strengthen links with western nations and reset relations with close neighbour India after a rocky period. Bangladesh is crucial to India’s security, sharing a 2,500-mile (4,000km) border.India dispatched a high-level delegation to the ceremony, led by the lower house speaker, Om Birla, underscoring Delhi’s strategic interest in improving ties with its eastern neighbour; and Seema Malhotra, the UK’s minister for the Indo-Pacific, also attended.The election also ushered in new players. The youth-led National Citizen party, formed by activists who came to the fore during the uprising, won six seats. The party’s entry into parliament signals the gen Z demographic now has a foothold in the political system. Voters also approved changes introducing a two-term limit for prime ministers and strengthening judicial independence.As newly elected lawmakers filed into the parliament complex for the ceremony, crowds gathered along Manik Mia Avenue, waving red and green national flags. “Honestly, I came to just see it with my own eyes,” said Nila Begum, 33, clutching a small flag as motorcades swept past along the broad boulevard. “We’ve watched so much bad new for so long – today, people want to feel hopeful again. Let them bring some calm.”View image in fullscreenAerial view of the Bangladesh parliament in Dhaka.Photograph: Syed Mahabubul Kader/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe mass protests led by students and young activists led to the exile of Hasina, who had dominated Bangladeshi politics for more than 15 years. She fled to India, where her continued stay has strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka. A Bangladeshi tribunal sentenced her to death in absentia over her government’s deadly crackdown on the protests, accusing her of “crimes against humanity”.Hasina denied the charges, saying they were politically motivated, but her secular-leaning centre-left Awami League was barred from contesting the election.Voter turnout of 59.44% “was enough to blunt” the Awami League’s claims that the results were illegitimate, said Pearl Pandya, a senior south Asia analyst at the US-based global monitor, Armed Conflict Location & Event Data.But, she added, accommodating the party in the new political set-up would be “a delicate task”.Explore more on these topicsBangladeshSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

More than$1bnwas traded on Kalshi alone during Super Bowl Sunday, and Bloombergreportedthat Kalshi’s January trading volume reached nearly $10bn, most of it tied to sports. In recent months, established sportsbook operators, includingDraftKings,FanDuelandFanatics, have also launched their own prediction platforms.Prediction markets let users trade on the outcome of virtually anything, ranging from sports and elections to award shows, speeches and even what someone might wear. Unlike casinos or traditional sportsbooks, users in effect bet, or “trade”, against one another rather than against an established “house”, with platforms collecting transaction fees.Because they classify their offerings as “event derivatives” they fall under federal commodities law and are currently overseen by the CFTC rather than under state gaming regulators, making them available inall 50 statesto users 18 and older. By contrast, licensed sportsbooks can only operate where sports betting has been legalized.‘Another way to gamble money’: booming prediction markets prompt confusion and concernRead moreSince the supreme courtliftedthe federal sports betting ban in 2018, 39 states and Washington DC have legalized it and licensed operators in those states are taxed and must comply with consumer-protection rules, including age limits (typically 21 and older), responsible gaming mandates and integrity monitoring and audits.“If you’re a sportsbook operator in Nevada, for example, there’s a lot you have to do to comply with regulations here and minimum internal control standards,” Gregory Gemignani, a gaming law lawyer and professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said. “The prediction markets have none of that.”“What’s happened is the lines between gambling and investing have been blurred,” added John Holden, a business law professor at Indiana University who focuses on sports and gaming law. “Eventually this is going to come to a head.”Resistance from states has intensified as attorneys general, state gaming commissions andtribal regulatorsmove to curb prediction markets. They have issued cease-and-desist letters and filedlawsuitsarguing the platforms amount to unlicensed sports wagering that evades state gambling laws and taxes. With cases mounting nationwide, legal scholars say the dispute could ultimately reach the supreme court.Under federal law, event contracts involving “gaming” are prohibited. The companies maintain that their offerings are lawful “futures” traded on regulated financial trading exchanges. A Kalshi spokesperson said the company believes “consistent, national oversight is better for consumers than a patchwork of inconsistent state laws”.In October, New York’s gaming commissionorderedKalshi to stop “illegally operating, advertising, promoting, administering, managing” sports-related contracts. Kalshisuedwithin days, arguing that CFTC oversight pre-empts state authority, and has filed similar challenges inMaryland,New Jersey,ConnecticutandTennessee.Ahead of the Super Bowl, New York’s attorney general, Letitia James,issueda “consumer alert” warning of the “risks posed by prediction markets”, calling them “online platforms offering bets masquerading as ‘event contracts’”.As the legal battle escalates, the companies have embraced splashy promotions in the state. KalshiofferedNew York shoppers $50 toward groceries, while this week, Polymarketannounceda five-day “free grocery store” – widely seen as a nod to the New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani’s proposal forcity-run supermarkets.Mamdanirespondedwith ameme: “Heartbreaking: The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Great Point.”View image in fullscreenPeople lined up around the block in New York City’s West Village as Polymarket opened its free grocery store pop-up on 12 February.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesSo far, several states have secured courtroom wins. InMassachusetts, the attorney general obtained apreliminary injunctiontemporarily barring Kalshi from offering sports contracts without a state license. Polymarket thensuedthe state, arguing that only the CFTC can regulate contract markets.In November, a federal judge in NevadablockedKalshi’s sports offerings in the state. The company isappealingto the ninth circuit. Separately, a Nevada court hasalsotemporarily barred Polymarket from offering event-based betting there.Both companies insist they are futures exchanges,not gambling operators, and that only the CFTC can regulate contract markets.“As other courts have recognized, Kalshi is a regulated, nationwide exchange for real-world events, and it is subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction,” a Kalshi spokesperson said. “It’s very different from what state-regulated sportsbooks and casinos offer their customers. We are confident in our legal arguments.”On Friday, 23 Democratic US senatorswrote to the CFTCasking it to stay out of the state legal battles and to bar gaming contracts and those involving “war, terrorism, assassination, or other enumerated activities”.Several legal scholars, including Karl Lockhart, a law professor at DePaul University, said that the mounting litigation may push the issue to the supreme court.“Eventually there’s enough cases going on, the issue is nationwide, there’s going to be differences of opinion between the circuits, which is the ideal set-up for a supreme court decision,” said Lockhart. “If these cases make it to the supreme court, I don’t know what they’ll do. It’s an interesting case. It doesn’t fit neatly into political bubbles, one way or the other.”Meanwhile, some state lawmakers are advancing bills targeting these platforms. In Connecticut, the governor hasproposed banningparticipationby those under 21, and legislation has beenintroducedin Illinois that would prohibit sports-related offerings.In Hawaii, where gamblingremainsillegal, legislators areadvancinga measure to bar online platforms from offering contracts tied to real-world outcomes.Prediction market Kalshi reached $1bn in trading volume during Super BowlRead moreScot Matayoshi, the Hawaii state representative who introduced the measure, said the offerings were “basically gambling but with another name and through a loophole”.He also raisedinsider tradingconcerns, noting that theysawalmost half a million dollars in bets for what words the Hawaii governor would say in his state of the state address.“There were advanced copies circulated, so people knew exactly what he was going to say and could have placed bets,” he said. “This particular type of gambling really opens the door for insider trading.”Polymarket made headlines earlier this year, after bettors reportedlyprofitedby predicting the capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, before Donald Trump’s announcement.The platforms say they monitor for such risks. Ahead of this year’s Super Bowl, Kalshi said it expanded itssurveillance and enforcement effortsto detect and remove accounts engaging in insider trading and market manipulation. Its CEO, Tarek Mansour,saidthe company conducted more than 200 investigations in the past year, froze accounts and referred cases to law enforcement.“Our insider trading rules are adapted from the rules on NYSE and Nasdaq: if you have material non-public information on a market, you cannot trade it and if you do, you are committing a financial crime,” Mansour hassaid. “This applies to government employees, policymakers, executives, or anyone who holds information that is legally not meant to be public.”Under the Biden administration, the CFTC pursuedactionsagainst prediction market platforms, and sought tobarthem fromoffering electionevent contracts related to politics and sports.Since Trump’s return to office, the tone hasshifted. The CFTC’s new chair, Michael Selig, has signaled support for the “responsible development” of event contracts and withdrawn proposals that would have limited political and sports event offerings.And just last week, the CFTC unveiled a new “innovation advisory committee” composed of the CEOs from companies including prediction markets such as Kalshi and Polymarket, crypto firms such as Coinbase, and major gambling operators including FanDuel.On Tuesday, in a video announcement posted to social media, Selig announced that the CFTC had filed a friend-of-the-court brief to defend its jurisdiction over prediction market platforms inthe ninthcircuit court of appeals, supporting trading app Crypo.com.“Over the past year, American prediction markets have been hit with an onslaught of state-led litigation,” hesaid. “In response, the CFTC has today filed a friend-of-the-court brief to defend its exclusive jurisdiction over these derivative markets.’”In aop-ed in the Wall Street Journalon Monday, Selig added: “The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency’s exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products.”View image in fullscreenAdvertisements by Polymarket predict a victory for Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election on 4 November 2025.Photograph: Olga Fedorova/APBarron’s alsoreportedthat, asof last week, there were no enforcement attorneys remaining at the CFTC’s flagship office in Chicago.The debate around prediction markets has also reached Washington, where lawmakers have the authority to amend the Commodity Exchange Act.In September, Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democratic senator from Nevada, along with the Republican senatorJohn Curtisand several others,urged the CFTCto “not override state and tribal law” by “allowing sports betting in all 50 states by permitting some companies to categorize their sports betting activities as ‘event contracts’”.The New York representative Ritchie Torres hasintroduceddraft legislation designed to curb the risk of insider trading among federal officials and their staff. And earlier this week, the Nevada representative Dina Titusproposedamending the Commodity Exchange Act to bar registered entities from “engaging in transactions involving sporting event or casino-style gaming contracts”.“Prediction markets should not be able to circumvent state gaming laws,” Titussaid.A Kalshi spokesperson told the Guardian that they support Torres’s bill.Sports leaguesand gambling industry groups have also urged to the CFTC to impose a regulatory framework for these prediction markets, comparable to those imposed on state-licensed sportsbooks.The American Gaming Association (AGA), a gambling industry lobby group, and the Indian Gaming Association, recentlyurged Congressto address what they call “unregulated sports event contracts being offered by prediction markets”, which they argue “are indistinguishable from legal sports betting”.Chris Cylke, the senior vice-president for government relations at the AGA, told the Guardian: “This is fundamentally about state and tribal sovereignty and their ability to regulate their gambling marketplaces and to just oversee their own jurisdictions.”Polymarket did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, the CFTC said that while “complex interpretive questions about the classification of certain products may be better left to the courts”, Selig had “always stood by the CFTC’s exclusive authority to regulate the marketplace for those products”.On Polymarket, ‘privileged’ users made millions betting on war strikes and diplomatic strategy. What did they know beforehand?Read moreBeyond the legal fight, problem gambling advocates warn of broader risks. The National Council on Problem Gambling hasurgedthe CFTC to adopt rules that prioritize players’ health, arguing that sports-related event contracts pose similar risks to traditional wagering.Cole Wogoman, the council’s director of government affairs and league partnerships, said: “There are great legal minds who are going to debate whether this falls into a definition of legally gambling, but from our point of view, that doesn’t really matter. Folks are interacting and treating this as gambling.”The council, he said, was focused on trying to “get this space” to have “the same protections and regulations that you’d see at the state or with tribal gaming”, he said. On Monday, the councilcalledfor the platforms to display the national gamblinghelpline.A Kalshi spokesperson pointed the Guardian to theirnewly addedresponsible trading hub, which it said had “protections comparable to those that sportsbooks and casinos offer”.Clinicians are also watching closely. Timothy Fong, an addiction psychiatrist and gambling researcher at UCLA, said more patients were using the platforms, and were often describing themselves as “investors” rather than “gamblers”.“Ideally in my world, we would have these products regulated by the people that know how to handle gambling,” he said.The broader question, Fong said, was: “What does it mean to us as a society to speculate and put financial terms on every single human event?“It commoditizes everything,” he replied. “And when you do that, it dehumanizes things.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessGamblingSport bettingnewsShareReuse this content"

[However], we welcome the opportunity to engage with you and expeditiously determine whether Paramount Skydance can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value.”To start talks with Paramount, WBD’s board secured a special waiver from Netflix.Under its merger agreement,Warner Broscan engage with a rival bidder only if the board believes it could lead to a “reasonably superior offer”, making use of a legal loophole that allows limited negotiations despite restrictions on talks.“While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognise the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by Paramount Skydance’s antics,” said Netflix.If Paramount makes a superior offer, Netflix has the right to improve its own bid.Ross Benes, a senior analyst at the researcher firm Emarketer, said: “WBD wants to end the cat-and-mouse game Paramount has played in its quest to buy the company. Setting a final offer date will help the merger process move along and give Paramount a chance to make its strongest offer. The bids are already quite high; it would be surprising if they got much higher.”Under the $82.7bn Netflix deal, the streaming company is poised to take control of WBD’s prized assets including Warner Bros, the studio behind franchises including Harry Potter, Superman and Batman, as well as HBO, home to shows including Game of Thrones, The White Lotus and Succession.The global networks operation – which includes CNN, the Cartoon Network and the Discovery Channel – is not part of the Netflix deal and is to be spun off as a separate company in which WBD investors will receive shares.Last week, Paramount sweetened its offer for the entirety of WBD, saying it would cover a $2.8bn fee owed to Netflix if it pulled out of the deal, and is offering to backstop a multibillion-dollar refinancing to eliminate $1.5bn in costs.It has also added a “ticking fee” amounting to about $650m in cash each quarter if the deal is not closed by the end of the year.The company has also acted to bolster its political lobbying power by appointing Rene Augustine, a former attorney in the Trump administration, as its senior vice-president of global public policy.On Tuesday, WBD set a date of 20 March for shareholders to vote on the Netflix takeover deal.Paramount, which has backed its offer with a $40bn personal guarantee in equity from the Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount’s chief executive, David Ellison, has said it would nominate new members to WBD’s board to try to block the Netflix deal.Shares in WBD on Tuesday were up almost 2.5% to $28.64, while the bidding war has seen the company’s stock rise 177% over the last year.Paramount’s share price surged 7% to $11 as investors warmed to the prospect it may yet derail Netflix.Meanwhile, Netflix fell nearly 2%, with its stock down almost 29% over the last year as shareholders fretted over whether the streamer would be able to complete what would be by far the biggest acquisition in its history.Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosParamount PicturesFilm industryNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

The agency recentlyissued a guidancere-iterating that broadcast television networks need to abide by the equal time requirements that stem from the Communications Act of 1934, with daytime and late-night talkshows a particular focus of potential violations.On Tuesday afternoon,CBSsought to address Colbert’s allegations about a corporate mandate not to broadcast Talarico.“The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,” the network said in a statement. “The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”Colbert has accused theTrump administrationof censoring critics and has been particularly critical of FCC chairman Brendan Carr.“Let’s just call this what it is,” he said Monday. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV.”The episode comes amid a renewed crackdown on media freedoms by the Trump administration, which in recent weeks has included anFBI raidon the home of a Washington Post reporter, andthe arrestof Don Lemon, an independent journalist and former CNN host, covering a protest against immigration enforcement in Minnesota.Earlier Tuesday, Anna M Gomez, the lone Democrat on the FCC, criticized CBS for what she called “corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech.“The FCC is powerless to impose restrictions on protected speech, and any attempt to intimidate broadcasters into self-censorship undermines both press freedom and public trust,” she said. “I once again urge broadcasters and their parent companies to stand firm against these unlawful pressures and continue exercising their constitutional right to speak freely and without government interference.”Colbert’s popular show will end in May after CBS canceled it. The network is now under the control of David Ellison, the new owner and a Trump ally whoseactionshave raised questions about CBS’s independence. Earlier this month, the FCC, reportedly at Carr’s direction, opened aninvestigationinto the ABC show The View, which interviewed Talarico on 2 February, for a possible violation of the equal time regulations.The FCC has traditionally acknowledged a bona fide exemption for news interviews, but Carr decreed in January that the commission would no longer do so for talkshows, arguing that “broadcast television stations have an obligation to operate in the public interest – not in any narrow partisan, political interest”.Colbert took exception to that interpretation on Monday, telling his audience: “Sir, you’re chairman of the FCC, so FCC you. Because I think you are motivated by partisan purposes yourself.”Talarico, in the interview posted online, suggested the reported intervention by the FCC was prompted by Trump’s plunging popularity ratings, and the alleged subservience of CBS to the Republican president’s administration. The networkpaid Trumpa $16m defamation settlement last July.“I think that Donald Trump is worried that we’re about to flip Texas,” he said. “This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they’re trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read“Corporate media executives are selling out the first amendment to curry favor with corrupt politicians.”Talarico is ina tight racewith Jasmine Crockett, a fellow Texas representative, for the Democratic nomination to challenge Cornyn in the 3 November election.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertTrump administrationCensorshipCBSnewsShareReuse this content"

One of those includes a broad description of diversity, such as viewpoints, background and military service, in addition to “other demographics”. That “other demographics” category reportedly included race, gender identity, ethnicity and sexual orientation, but would be removed under the proposed change.Earlier this month, the NLPCannouncedit reached similar deals with American Express and John Deere to “eliminate DEI for Board candidates”. The groupsubmitted shareholderproposals to 11 Fortune 500 companies, includingGoldman, challenging their DEI initiatives.Both Goldman and the NLPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The shift follows other recent changes at the bank. Last year, Goldmanscrappeda policy meant to encourage diversity on the boards of companies it takes public.The move also reflects a broader pullback from DEI initiatives across corporate America sinceDonald Trumpreturned to office last January and launched a campaign against DEI practices in both the government and the private sector.Several days before Trump’s inauguration, Meta said it wasending its DEI programs, while Amazontold employeesthat it was “winding down outdated programs and materials” related to representation and inclusion.Shortly after taking office, Trumpsigned anexecutive orderdirecting federal agencies to dismantle DEI policies and efforts at federal agencies, and scrutinize such practices among contractors and corporations in the private sector.Several major companies have since continued to scale back their DEI efforts.Deloitte last yearinstructed employeesworking on federal government contracts to remove pronouns from their email signatures. Target also scaledback its DEI initiatives, and Alphabet’s Google saidit was scrapping its goalto hire more people from historically underrepresented groups and would also reviewing some of its DEI initiatives.In April, Barclaysremovedits gender and ethnicity targets for US staff, andLego cutdiversity-related terminology from its annual sustainability report.Explore more on these topicsBusinessGoldman SachsGenderRaceLGBTQ+ rightsDEI policiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Critics say this could lead to big losses for small investorsThe price we pay is supported byAbout this contentSusan AntillaTue 17 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 16.43 ESTShareOn a summer day in 2018, Cathy Shubert, then 58, hopped in her Toyota Rav 4 and drove to the Jacksonville, Florida, office of Mario Payne, an investment adviser at the financial services firm Raymond James. She had a lot on her mind. She was not happy with her job at a local bank branch and wanted to see if Payne thought she had saved enough to retire.“He said what I was retiring with would carry me and everything would be wonderful,” she remembered. “I went home and told my husband, ‘Oh my God, I want you to go meet him.’”After giving notice she would be leaving her job, Shubert said, she signed the back of her retirement check and handed more than $250,000 over to Payne, who over time put her 401(k) savings into “structured notes”, “leveraged ETFs” and other risky products usually intended for wealthy, sophisticated investors.By 2024, her attorney said, many of these investments had tanked. More than half of her money was gone.These are perilous times for small investors like Shubert. Wall Street firms seeking to boost their share of the$48tnin US retirement accounts are salivating at the prospect of selling even more high-risk “alternative investments” to so-called “mom and pop” investors. Retirement accounts are a “pot of gold that all sorts of industry players want to get their hands on”, said Barbara Roper, a former senior adviser at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The potential for big losses and the high fees associated with alternative products can wreck the financial hopes of inexperienced investors with modest amounts of money to put in play, according to former regulators, securities fraud lawyers and investors themselves.Gen Z in the US: how are you feeling about your finances?Read moreAnd a growing number of small investors may be at risk in the months and the years to come – thanks to a push by the financial industry, federal lawmakers and theTrump administrationto loosen protections for small investors.In August, Donald Trump issued anexecutive orderthat promised his administration will make it easier for Americans to stash cutting-edge investments in their retirement accounts. The order – titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors” – touts “the potential growth and diversification opportunities associated with alternative asset investments”. Americans had$13.9tnin 401(k)s and other employer-based retirement plans at the end of September 2025.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump signs an executive order at the Oval Office on 5 September 2025.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesThree months later, Trumpcommutedthe prison sentence of the former GPB Capital Holdings CEO David Gentile, who was found guilty in 2024 for his role in a years-long scheme that involved alternative investments. Investor advocates criticized Trump for freeing Gentile, who was at the center of the $1.6bn fraud that harmed thousands of teachers, nurses and other less experienced investors.“It’s a signal that it is not a priority to protect your mom and pop investors,” said Adam Gana, a lawyer at the Chicago firm Gana Weinstein who has represented hundreds of clients who lost money in private equity deals set up by GPB. “It’s unbelievable. People’s lives were ruined, ruined by their investments in GPB.”The White House did not provide detailed answers to questions from the Guardian about the Gentile case or Trump’s efforts to open up alternative investments to more Americans.In an emailed statement, a White House spokesperson said: “The Trump administration is committed to expanding optionality for retail investors. All Americans are, of course, encouraged to appropriately weigh the risks that come with any investment decision, including for traditional equity and debt securities.”All inThe weakening of protections for small investors and the push to sell them riskier products come at a time when many Americans are worried about inflation and the high cost of living. Buffeted by soaring prices for everything from groceries to electricity, 92% of US retirees fear their assets are being eaten away, according to asurveyby the asset manager Schroders. In a poll of 401(k) plan participants by the financial services giant Charles Schwab, 57%cited inflationas a top obstacle to reaching a comfortable retirement.These concerns can leave small investors vulnerable to come-ons for products that promise high yields and protection from inflation.“A new inflation hedge has arrived,”boastsMarketX Ventures, which describes itself on its website as a “one-stop shop” for high-growth private tech investment opportunities. It suggests investors diversify into private markets “like the super-rich do”. MarketX’s CEO, Cathryn Chen, said in an email that most of her firm’s clients were sophisticated, tech-savvy investors, and that less sophisticated investors were given “extra help” and “extra resources” to help them understand her firm’s investments and their risks.Alternative investments – often called “alts” in industry shorthand – include an array of products that don’t fall into the plain vanilla categories of stocks, bonds or money markets. Among the most aggressively marketed alts are private placements, which receive less scrutiny from securities regulators and lack the disclosure requirements about risks and financial results that are required for stocks and bonds. Other higher-risk alts include promissory notes, structured products and cryptocurrencies.At the SEC, officials are all-in on Trump’s executive order. In remarks to the agency’s investor advisory committee in September, the SEC chairman, Paul S Atkins, said he was “delighted” by Trump’s order to increase small investor access to alternative assets.Yet securities regulators know that rules meant to protect investors already are being broken when advisers pitch alts. In 2022, the SEC’s division of examinations issued arisk alertafter examining registered investment advisers that manage private funds, flagging problems that included misleading performance and marketing disclosures and failing to conduct reasonable investigations of the investments they were selling.A 2025studyby the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra) showed the public lacks basic understanding of markets – an ominous state of affairs at a time when risky alt products are proliferating. When Finra gave an 11-question financial knowledge quiz to 2,861 investors, the average score was 5.3 – just under 50%. To see if investors could recognize warning signs of a fraudulent investment, Finra asked if they would invest in a product “that promises a guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return every year for the next 5 years”. Half of the investors said they would.View image in fullscreenPaul Atkins, SEC chair, at a Senate committee hearing to examine the SEC’s proposed budget estimate for fiscal year 2026, on 3 June 2025.Photograph: Alex Wroblewski/AFP/Getty ImagesMichael Bixby, a Florida securities lawyer who represents Shubert and more than 100 other people in two lawsuits tied to Payne’s alleged misconduct, said the complexity and murkiness of alts makes it nearly impossible for small investors to understand what they’re getting into. When the Guardian asked the lawyer how many of his clients understood the investments they had purchased on Payne’s advice, Bixby answered with a precise number.“None,” he said. “On the structured products, I can barely understand it.”The Guardian reached Payne by phone, but he hung up after he was asked if he would discuss the questions about investor losses that a reporter had sent him. His regulatory records show that he continues to be licensed with the SEC as a registered investment adviser.Payne is not named as a defendant in Finra arbitration claims and lawsuits that Bixby has filed against Raymond James, the financial firm where Payne previously worked. But the lawsuits include descriptions of alleged misconduct by Payne during his time at Raymond James and after he was fired by the firm – claiming he misled small investors by telling them that high-risk investments were “safe” and “guaranteed”.The two suits, filed in state court in Florida, claim Raymond James failed to notify the SEC and Finra about Payne’s alleged misconduct, depriving Shubert and other investors of information that could have warned them away from working with him. Raymond James told regulators his termination was related to “failure to meet performance expectations” and not his sales practices, according to Finra records.Spokespeople and lawyers for Raymond James did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian. In court filings, Raymond James said it was “misleading” for the plaintiffs to say that it had not properly supervised Payne or that the investments he bought for them were not in their best interests. The company has asked that both cases be dismissed, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to file their suits in a timely manner and that many of them didn’t become Payne’s clients until after he was fired from Raymond James.Bixby said Shubert lost money in structured notes while Payne was at Raymond James, but most of her losses with Payne came after he left the firm.Shubert said she wasn’t familiar with the kinds of investments Payne put her in. She tried to read a prospectus associated with one of her investments, but didn’t make it through to the end. “There is a lot of stuff in those and, to be honest with you, I didn’t understand all that,” she recalled. “I thought ‘It’s his job – he knows what he’s doing.’”She is grateful to have another source of income from a family member, but said it was still a significant hit, financially and emotionally. Many nights, she said, she lay in bed asking herself: “Oh my God, I only have this much money left – how many years will this last me?”‘Perverse incentives’Along with the risks of slippery salesmanship and big losses, many alternative assets also carry high fees that can eat into even positive investment gains.And less regulated “alt” investment deals often carry greater risks for losses and fraud, according to studies led by Craig McCann, an economist and securities expert.In so-called “Regulation D” offerings, by private companies, hedge funds, private equity funds and others, investors typically pay upfront fees including sales commissions and acquisition costs, according to a2023 research paperby McCann’sconsulting firm, SLCG. These costs, the paper said, reduce returns and create “perverse incentives and conflicts of interest” between investors and the industry players who are creating, managing and selling investment deals.In a separatestudyin 2015, McCann’s firm looked at publicly traded REITs – real-estate investment trusts – and alternative REITs that are traded privately. This research found that annual investor returns from private REITs averaged 6.3%, compared with 11.6% in the Vanguard REIT Index Fund of traded REITs. More than half of non-traded REITs’ underperformance was due to upfront fees that are mostly pocketed by salespeople, the study said.Fees can also cut into the returns for private placements, which use financial advisers and others to market company shares directly to investors rather than through public offerings traded on stock exchanges.Kristian Kraszewski, a Massachusetts securities lawyer, filed an arbitration claim against the brokerage firm Concorde Investment Services in February 2025 alleging that his client was “promised steady returns” from Passco Palm Desert LLC, which offered private investments in residential apartment complexes. His client lost $125,000 of the $132,000 he put in, Kraszewski said in the claim, which he filed with Finra, but the broker made 6% on the sale.Concorde said in an emailed statement that it couldn’t comment on the arbitration, which is pending. But it said that its offering documents “clearly disclosed” that the investment, which was offered in 2019, “involved substantial risk”, adding that real estate projects nationwide were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, market disruptions and interest-rate increases.The company said it “conducts rigorous due diligence” and that it was continually enhancing its systems, training and oversight.According to a 2019 private placement document reviewed by the Guardian, 13.4% of Passco’s $25m offering was expected to go to brokerage fees and other expenses. Executives at Passco did not respond to emails and a phone message from the Guardian.‘Financial prison’These days, Kathleen McCauley won’t even indulge in a coffee at Dunkin’. At 69, she mows her own lawn and strains to come up with ideas for no-cost outings when she gets a day with her three grandsons. Her nightmare scenario: that social security might not exist in 10 years.“I feel like I’m in a financial prison,” she told the Guardian.It is not the life she had expected after squirreling away $600,000, which she had saved up in the jobs she had worked after finishing high school – delivering Pepperidge Farm cookies and Edy’s ice cream to stores and later doing retail sales for Verizon Wireless.In 2022, McCauley said, she started to think about “how old I was” and realized she needed to “beef up” her 401(k). So she entrusted $450,000 to Vincent Camarda, a financial adviser in Massapequa, New York.She said Camarda “made it seem like there was no risk” when he suggested she invest in a private equity fund called Windsor Capital Fund. She remembers the chilly fall day when she sat in his office going over her assets and expenses.“He said: ‘How would you feel if I told you that you could retire right now?’” she recalled. “I felt my eyes welling up with tears.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump issued an executive order that promised to make it easier for Americans to stash cutting-edge investments in their retirement accounts.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesTwo weeks later, she returned to sign the paperwork – a half-inch stack of documents sprinkled with “sign here” tabs. “I wasn’t really given an opportunity to read any of it,” she said.One of those tabs was attached to Windsor’s Private Placement Memorandum, which said she would qualify to invest only if she was an “accredited investor” – a term of art that describes the supposedly sophisticated investors who have a net worth of $1m or $200,000 in annual income. With $600,000 in savings and a modest income, she didn’t come close to qualifying, according to a lawsuit McCauley filed against Camarda and others in 2024 in federal court in Brooklyn.“I couldn’t even tell you what an accredited investor is,” McCauley said.The fund began to default on its monthly payments to her in early 2024, but when she demanded her money back, Camarda refused to return her savings, her lawsuit alleges. The suit accuses Camarda and other defendants of fraud, breach of contract and “unjust enrichment”. In an answer to McCauley’s suit, the defendants denied the allegations, including McCauley’s claim that Camarda said she had enough money to retire.Neither Camarda nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.McCauley and Shubert are not alone in finding their lives changed after being persuaded to invest retirement savings in alternative financial assets.One Florida retiree, 66, told the Guardian she started visiting local food banks after losing more than $200,000 at the hands of a broker who put her retirement money in structured notes. “It’s so hard,” she said. “Friends say ‘Let’s go out to eat.’ I say ‘I’m not hungry,’ or ‘I already ate.’ I’ve never lived like this.”An 85-year-old Long Island investor said she lost more than $500,000 in promissory notes that were supposed to yield 12% interest. Her money is gone. “I’m in debt over my head and I just signed up with National Debt Relief,” she said.A 64-year old Florida woman said she lost “almost everything” after investing more than $500,000 in leveraged ETFs and structured notes.“It’s very gut-wrenching,” she said. “We don’t go on trips, we don’t do anything. I should be enjoying this part of my life and I’m not.”In the GPB case, lawyers for the company’s CEO, Gentile, argued there was no proof investors lost money as a result of the frauds he was convicted of committing – and that shareholders in a private equity fund at the heart of the case were sophisticated investors.“You had to be rich to invest in this fund,” one of Gentile’s attorneyssaidduring the trial.The government’s attorneys pushed back.“The victims of the defendant’s crimes are hardworking everyday people,” prosecutors said in a sentencing memo. “They include small business owners, farmers, a retired electrician who served in the Vietnam war, teachers and nurses.”Among them is a married couple who said they raised three children and saved their retirement nest egg by sharecropping, waiting tables and running an auto repair and towing business. “All of the literal blood, sweat and tears we shed to work hard and be successful was taken from us,” one of the spouses wrote in a victim statement.Another investor wrote: “I was bilked out of $25,000, which may not seem like a lot to some, but at my age it will be very difficult to save up that sum of money again. My wife and I made many sacrifices to save $25,000.”View image in fullscreenPeople wait in line at a food bank distribution in Miami, Florida, in November 2025.Photograph: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Getty ImagesIn a separate lawsuit, New York state authorities alleged that investors’ funds were used to cover the costs of private jets, Gentile’s 50th birthday party and a $355,000 Ferrari FF driven by Gentile.Gentile denied the allegations against him. A Trump spokesperson blamed the executive’s conviction on the “weaponization of justice” by the Biden administration. Gentile’s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.Trump’s clemency order freed the executive from prison after he had served 12 days of a seven-year sentence – and wiped away any requirement that he pay restitution to the victims.On Thanksgiving, Trump’s pardon czar, Alice Marie Johnson, said on social media that she was “deeply gratefulto see David Gentile heading home to his young children”, calling his release an example of “the extraordinary power of second chances”.‘A dignified, comfortable retirement’There have been protections in place for nearly a century that seek to rein in abusive practices in the marketplace for private securities and other alternative investments.In the wake of the Wall Street crash of 1929, the federal government passed laws to establish new standards for companies that wished to sell securities to the public. Under the new laws, companies that had large numbers of shareholders and were traded on stock exchanges had to provide detailed information about their risks and finances and issue regular reports. Companies not traded on public stock exchanges were required to provide far less information.Over time, the SEC has offered more and more exemptions to allow companies to avoid disclosure requirements. In 1982, it issued Regulation D, which expanded the number of companies that could sell private securities and widened the universe of investors who could buy them, designating investors with a net worth of $1m or $200,000 in annual income as “accredited investors”.In 2012, the Jobs Act further loosened restrictions, increasing the number of shareholders a company had to have before being forced to go public and allowing issuers to pitch their private offerings to more investors.Roper, the former SEC adviser, said the idea that investors in this financial category don’t need protection of federal securities laws is a fiction. “Most accredited investors lack the market power to demand access to information” and “lack the financial sophistication to value those securities”, she said.Today’s deregulatory momentum seeks to tear down even more of the modest safeguards that limit advisers’ ability to sell alternative investments.In December, the House of Representatives passed the Invest Act, a sweeping document that would expand the number of companies that can offer shares without providing audited financial statements, reduce regulations and generally make alternative investments more available to the public.The proposed legislation complements Trump’s August executive order, which asserted that “regulatory overreach” and “lawsuits filed by opportunistic trial lawyers” had stifled innovation and prevented Americans’ 401(k) retirement accounts from “achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement”.Atkins, the SEC chair, said in anop-edin the Wall Street Journal in December that the market’s most fundamental purpose was “placing American might in the hands of citizens instead of the regulatory state”. While he endorses the idea of making private markets more accessible to everyday investors, Atkins has frequently said that protections are necessary.An SEC spokesperson did not respond to detailed questions, but referred the Guardian to a statement by Atkins in September that the markets would need “appropriate guardrails” that “address the important issues and potential pitfalls inherent to this genre of investments”.Amid these shifts, experts expect sales of alternative investments to the public will soar. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services has projected that retail investors’ allocations to private investments will grow from $80bn to $2.4tn by 2030.Investor advocates worry this growing wave of smaller investors will enjoy fewer of the upsides – and more of the downsides – from alternative investments than sophisticated players.“If you have a really good investment opportunity and need to raise money, you are probably not going to try to sell to every random truck driver,” said Benjamin Edwards, an associate dean at University of Nevada Las Vegas and expert on corporate governance and consumer protection. “So the firms that are offering these investments to retail investors probably can’t find anyone else to buy it.”Along with the challenges of understanding complex investments, experts say, mom and pop investors usually don’t have the background to evaluate the firms and advisers that are peddling these deals.McCauley’s lawsuit says she was not aware when she met her adviser, Camarda, that he had already beensuedby the SECfor sellingthe fraudulent securities of Par Funding, a lending company whose CEO wassentencedto 186 months in prison in March forsecurities fraud and other crimes. The SEC said in its complaint that, in exchange for Par paying down debt that Camarda’s company had taken on, Camarda would solicit investors to buy Par’s securities. In court papers, Camarda and his co-defendants denied that charge and denied that they had failed to disclose conflicts of interest to investors. The trial is scheduled for August.Timothy J Dennin, McCauley’s attorney, said everyday investors tend to trust persuasive salespeople who have the trappings of success. “They are either uninclined to investigate such a person or unaware of the tools out there that may raise red flags.”Seeking justiceFor investors like McCauley and Shubert, it has never been easy to seek justice – and the obstacles are likely to multiply in the months and years ahead.Financial firms will not open an account unless a customer agrees in writing to give up the right to sue, which means that investors who lose money in alts must seek justice through Finra arbitration, where hearings take place behind closed doors and litigation documents are not public.Small investors seeking restitution after losing $50,000 or less in alts often face significant hurdles, according to Nicholas J Guiliano, a lawyer who represents investors in arbitration. It is “exceedingly difficult” to find lawyers for small cases, he said, and investors who press a case in the Finra forum on their own “never fare well” compared with those who have lawyers. On its website, Finralistsarbitration clinics that sometimes are able to represent investors who can’t afford lawyers.Big investors with access to the best lawyers, though, have had recent success in holding financial firms to account – and Wall Street has fought back. Arbitrators at Finra awarded $132m last year to a wealthy family that said it lost $19.5m in alts at the hands of Chuck A Roberts, a former adviser at the financial services firm Stifel Nicolaus.During hearings in 2024, the investors’ lawyer presented a text in which Roberts assured one of the family members: “You send me the $15MM, I will double the whole ball of wax in less than 5 years.”In another text, the adviser boasted to a colleague that he had just pitched a different customer to buy structured notes. The customer “gladly did this round of notes”, he wrote, adding: “I’m calling and chiseling every motherf**ker.” Roberts’s lawyer, Susan Schroeder, declined to comment on his behalf.Roberts, who has 23 pending customer disputes on his Finra record, was barred from the securities industry in July, after telling Finra that he would not continue to testify in a review of the arbitration complaints against Stifel that revolved around his behavior. Stifel did not respond to a request for comment.View image in fullscreenFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra) headquarters in Washington.Photograph: Andrew Kelly/ReutersThe big award didn’t sit well with lawyers at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma), Wall Street’s lobbying group. Referring to “recent extreme outlier punitive damages awards”, Sifma has pressed Finra to make its arbitration process less friendly to investors – urging it to help rein in punitive damages awards, make it easier to dismiss investors’ arbitration claims and allow financial firms to take “high dollar” disputes to other arbitration forums, which lack Finra’s systems that police unpaid awards.Sifma did not respond to a request for comment.In an emailed statement, Richard Berry, an executive vice-president at Finra, said the organization “strives to provide a fair, efficient and effective arbitration forum for all participants”.In his executive order, Trump’s bid for putting more 401(k) money into alts is paired with a call to make it harder for investors to pursue compensation for wrongdoing by employers, advisers and other players that control those plans.Both Trump and Atkins, the SEC chair, have described their quests to open alternative investments to everyday investors as righting a wrong. In their view, retail investors have been denied the opportunity that wealthier people have to invest in these securities.This effort comes as the SEC’s strongest voice for investor protection has been sidelined. In December, the Senate banking committee declined to move forward with the reappointment of the SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw.With the departure of Crenshaw, the lone Democrat on the agency’s governing board, the commission now has a 3-0 Republican lineup – producing what the financial reform group Better Marketscalls“a one-party echo chamber” that “lacks a commissioner who is willing to stand up to the financial industry”.Crenshaw had railed against the latest deregulatory efforts – pointing out that private markets were specifically designed for wealthier, more knowledgeable investors because of their high risk, limited information and hidden fees.In December – in herlast speechas an SEC commissioner – Crenshaw said the financial regulatory environment now resembles “the period prior to the stock market crash in 1929”.Opening private markets to more mom and pop investors, she predicted, “will come back to bite regulators – but not before Main Street Americans’ savings have been looted”."

There was the one about the founder who hadn’t taken a weekend off in more than six months. The woman who joked that she’d given up her social life to work at a prestigious AI company. Or the employees who had started taking their shoes off in the office because, well, if you were going to be there for at least12 hoursa day,six daysa week, wouldn’t you rather bewearing slippers?“If you go to a cafe on a Sunday, everyone is working,” says Sanju Lokuhitige, the co-founder of Mythril, a pre-seed-stage AI startup, who moved toSan Franciscoin November to be closer to the action. Lokuhitige says he works seven days a week, 12 hours a day, minus a few carefully selected social events each week where he can network with other people at startups. “Sometimes I’m coding the whole day,” he says. “I do not have work-life balance.”Another startup employee, who came to San Francisco to work for an early-stage AI company, showed me dismal photos from his office: a two-bedroom apartment in the Dogpatch, a neighborhoodpopular with tech workers. His startup’s founders live and work in this apartment – from 9am until as late as 3am, breaking only to DoorDash meals or to sleep, and leaving the building only to take cigarette breaks. The employee (who asked not to use his name, since he still works for this company) described the situation as “horrendous”. “I’d heard about 996, but these guys don’t even do 996,” he says. “They’re working 16-hour days.”Startups have never been particularly glamorous. When I started reporting on the industry a decade ago, people were cashing in on the new mobile app economy, andcoders were chugging Soylentto stay at their desks longer. Startups then, too, were defined byhustle culture,high-octane energyand the pursuit ofgrowth at all costs– ideas that, to some extent, have remained in the bloodstream of the industry.But in the last year, as the magic dust of artificial intelligence has settled in San Francisco, the vibe among tech workers does seem different. The excitement about a new epoch in tech – and all the money that comes with it – is now tempered with anxieties about the industry, and the economy. Some workers are going all in on AI while also questioning whether all that AI is good for the world. Others are effectively training machines to do their jobs better than they can. And many of the same workers who are racing to build the future are now wondering if the future they’re building has a place for them in it.The rest of us may be ambiently aware of these anxieties, but they are already tangible and keenly felt inside the tech industry. Even the biggest tech companies, once known for coddling employees with on-site massages and barber shops, havescaled backperks as they have escalated the expectations of workers. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have each been candid about their predictions that AI will replace some junior and mid-level engineers at their companies, and have respectively called for their workforces to be more “efficient” and “extremely hard core” as waves of layoffs set employees on-edge. Tech companies laid off about a quarter of a million workers around the world in 2025, according to areportpublished byRationalFX. In many of those layoffs, AI wascited as a main factor, even if the full reason for layoffs is often more complex.“If you were a software engineer five years ago, you could kind of write your ticket,” says Mike Robbins, an executive coach who has worked with companies like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Airbnb. Now, the balance of power has shifted away from tech workers, many of whom are left feeling anxious about their work performance. “When companies become less scared about losing employees, then they can be a little more forthright in terms of what they want and be a little more demanding.”Robbins, who wrote the book Bring Your Whole Self to Work, used to be asked to speak to companies and their leaders about topics like employee burnout, wellbeing and belonging – top priorities in the years during and shortly after the pandemic. “Quite frankly, we’ve stopped talking about all that,” he says. Now, company leaders want advice on topics like change, disruption and uncertainty in the workplace.Those themes – change, disruption and uncertainty – are each part of the fuel that has driven tech workers to put in more hours, at a higher intensity. Investment in artificial intelligence companies reachedrecord highsin 2025, yet workers are feeling scarcity in ways they haven’t before.“It’s definitely something that’s on everyone’s mind,” says Kyle Finken, a software engineer at Mintlify, which makes an AI tool for developers. “I think a lot of people are concerned like, ‘Oh, am I going to have a job in three years?’”Despite his fears, Finken, like many other startup employees I spoke to, feels energized by the “extraordinary innovation” happening in artificial intelligence and believes that there will still be plenty of jobs for software engineers in the future, even if those jobs look different from the pure coding roles of today. He and other tech workers characterized the current moment as a particularly creative and productive time in tech, where people are devoting extra hours to work not because their employers demand it but out of genuine interest in the new tools and capabilities. For example, Garry Tan, the head of the famous startup accelerator Y Combinator, recently bragged that he “stayed up 19 hours” playing around with Claude Code.Even those who felt excited about the pace of change acknowledged that AI was rapidly augmenting their work, in ways that could have uncertain outcomes for the jobs of the future. “This is definitely not an era of complacency,” says Finken.One reason for working so many hours is to keep up with tools and technology that are changing nearly every day. If you take the weekend off, you can miss a major development, which makes it harder to keep up with what competitors are doing. Another reason is to have something to show future employers, especially as more junior-level jobs are replaced by AI.“No one hires junior developers any more,” says Lokuhitige, the Mythril co-founder. Landing a job now requires “doing something cool”, he says, like building a new product or solving a problem that gets recognized as useful by larger companies. Job postings for entry-level tech jobs have dropped by a third since 2022, according toIndeed’s Hiring Lab, while job postings requiring at least five years of experience have risen. If you’re not grinding at a startup, you’re missing the prerequisite to get hired in the future.What this means for the rest of usWhile economists are torn about whether AI will replace most jobs or just change them, they seem aligned in the idea that AI has already reshaped a great deal of entry-level work and will continue to do so. Apaperpublished by Stanford researchers in November found “substantial declines in employment for early-career workers” in industries exposed to AI and suggested that areas where change is already occurring could be like a “canary in the coalmine” for the rest of the economy. The Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei, has suggested AI could eliminateabout halfofallentry-level jobs in white-collar industries within the next five years.The head of the International Monetary Fund recentlypredictedthat 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence, “like a tsunami hitting the labour market”. In San Francisco, you can already see the early signs, as Uber drivers compete with self-driving Waymos, and baristas are replaced by robotic coffee bars. Professional business services that support the tech industry have also beennegatively affectedby the layoffs. The pressure to grind in the tech world could be an early signal – a harbinger for what many other industries will feel soon.Robbins, the executive coach, says that companies once looked to Silicon Valley as a model of how they should operate, down to emulating policies like unlimited vacation days or adopting perks like free lunch in the office.“There was an idealization of tech and Silicon Valley for a long time across the business world. Some of that has changed,” he says. “Now, people aren’t asking me to tell them what’s going on in the Valley so that they can adopt it, the same way they were a decade ago.”Rather than a model of how we should all work, the tech industry may be a premonition for the anxiety and attempts to compensate that are coming for all of us."

There is still a lot there so something is probably not working.”This is the second investigation launched into the addictive design of an online retail platform, after an inquirylaunched into Temuin late 2024.The EU also said that Shein’s recommender systems were opaque and might not meet the transparency requirements of the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA).Under the rules, the recommender must “provide one easily available alternative which is not based on profiling”. What the EU found in its preliminary investigation was that Shein only explained “in a very general manner” how its recommender system worked.Shein said it took its obligations under the DSA seriously, and has always cooperated fully with the European Commission and Coimisiún na Meán – the Irish regulator that will lead the investigation – and would continue to do so. It added it had taken steps to limit harms.“Over the last few months, we have continued to invest significantly in measures to strengthen our compliance with the DSA. These include comprehensive systemic-risk assessments and mitigation frameworks, enhanced protections for younger users, and ongoing work to design our services in ways that promote a safe and trusted user experience,” Shein said.The European investigation into Shein comes months after the French government backed off from a push for a three-month full suspension of Shein’s services after illegal products were found on the site.The French investigation is looking at the legality of the products on sale rather than the systemic approach of the sales platform.In a Paris court hearing in December, a lawyer for the state said Shein must put controls in place on its website, including age verification and filtering, to ensure minors cannot access pornographic content.The French government had in Novemberthreatened to suspendShein amid controversy over its sale of childlike sex dolls.The announcement came as Sheinopened its first bricks-and-mortar store, in Paris, amid a heavy police presence.EU officials said the investigation was completely separate to the inquiries in France and other appraisals under way by consumer protection authorities on products that breach trading standards rules nationally.“What happened in France is a piece of the puzzle but we are looking at the system at large. We are not focusing only on what happened in France,” said the senior official.The EU first opened its request for information on how the platform complies or does not comply with the DSA in April 2024. It has now concluded that Shein believes its services are at “low risk” of breaching EU law. However, the EU argues Shein is at “high risk” of selling products that breach EU laws.Last year the EU’s justice commissioner Michael McGrath said he was“shocked”by the toxicity and danger of some products on Shein.He said consumer authorities had found baby soothers that could cause choking, clothes with chemicals banned in the EU and items such as children’s sweat pants with waist ties were long enough to pose trip hazards.The EU said Shein was cooperating with the European Commission and the new investigation did not mean the service would ultimately be banned, but a block on it selling in Europe remained a “last resort” option if the company did not comply with EU laws.The Paris judicial court acknowledged a “serious harm to public order”, but found the sale of the items in question had been “sporadic”. It noted that Shein had removed the illegal products.The court nevertheless issued an “injunction” to Shein not to resume selling “sexual products that could constitute pornographic content, without implementing age-verification measures”.Explore more on these topicsSheinRetail industryEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Johnson, who has just finished a 10-hour shift on his boat, the Golden Shore, is concerned that plans for a new salmon farm will put fishers like him and his two sons out of business.“They say it’s just one farm,” says Johnson. “But it’s one farmmore. There’s only so much water and we’re at saturation point.”The Shetland Islands councilapproved plansfor the new farm last week. For decades, the Scottish archipelago’s fishing community has shared the nutrient-rich waters of Britain’s northernmost region with the fish farms clustered around its “voes”, or inlets.But by approving what will become the UK’s largest-ever salmon farm, the council has deepened the rift between the islanders who make their living from fishing and the farm owners, and drawn criticism from environmental groups, which fear lasting ecological damage.The site, next to Fish Holm, off Shetland’s east coast, is a place Johnson and others have long relied on as among Shetland’s most fruitful scallop beds. The scallop fleet, which itself is notwithout its critics, has 30 vessels, each crewed by between one and three people. The Shetland Fishermen’s Association (SFA), representing 450 members, says the company running the planned site, Scottish Sea Farms (SSF), has not considered the environmental impacts on fish and shellfish nursery grounds.View image in fullscreenSydney Johnson, who fishes for scallops near Fish Holm with his sons, is one of many locals who oppose the farm. ‘It’s a fine shame to all involved,’ he says.Photograph: Kirstie Clubb/The GuardianSSF, which says it has taken account of the fishing body’s demands by making the site smaller, employs almost 300 people, including 160 on 20 farms, making it the islands’ biggest employer after the council.The company, which is jointly owned by the giant Norwegian seafood companies SalMar and Lerøy, will build 12 pens, each 160 metres in circumference, which will together hold up to 6,000 tonnes of salmon.It’s hard to figure out why our own council are hell bent on destroying our living for the gain of a few big NorwegiansSydney JohnsonThe farm has been described by SSF as marking a “new era” of aquaculture, expanding some of its existing sites in the strait into one bigger farm atFishHolm. There would be more fish in fewer but larger pens located in deeper “high-energy” waters, where there are stronger tidal flows.This, the company says, will reduce problems with sea lice, disperse waste and keep fish healthier.Johnson is not convinced. “It’s hard to figure out why our own council are hellbent on destroying our living for the gain of a few big Norwegians,” he says. “It’s betrayal at the highest level and it’s a fine shame to all involved.”He dismissed as “laughable”claims submitted by SSF during the consultation, using its environmental impact assessment and data provided by the Shetland Fishermen’s Association, that the site was worth just £500 of scallops a year for each vessel.Johnson pointed to that day’s catch, worth about £400 alone he says, adding: “I’ve had four times that at Fish Holm in a day. They need to sack their accountant.”View image in fullscreenWith demand for salmon growing fast, SSF is giving up the Collafirth 3 site to expand at Fish Holm.Photograph: Scottish Sea FarmsThe SFA itself says the company misapplied the statistics and that it did not reflect the way the area was currently fished.Most of the island’s once family-run salmon farms are now controlled by big business, largely owned by Norwegian and Canadian multinationals. They produced38,000 tonnesof salmon, worth£174m, in 2024 – about afifth of Scotland’s output.Continuing mortalities means to me that the industry hasn’t done what it promised to do in 2018Edward Mountain, MSPShetland is seen as a new frontier by an aquaculture industry keen to expand but struggling with high fish mortality rates and rampant disease. In May, SSF expects to open another farm – the largest in Shetland so far, with production expected to reach 4,000 tonnes – and is assessing an additional seven sites. Last week, before Fish Holm was approved, the Canadian-owned company Cooke Scotland also filed anapplicationfor a farm off the island of Vementry in western Shetland.The approval of SSF’s huge site marks a crucial juncture for Scottish salmon farming, which is worth an estimated£950m to Scotland’s economy, according to a report commissioned by the industry.View image in fullscreenSSF’s Foraness farm. It wants to use deeper waters with stronger tidal flows to keep fish healthier by reducing sea lice and dispersing waste.Photograph: Shetland By DroneOn 25 February, the Scottish parliament’s rural affairs and islands committee is due to question salmon farming executives as part of a continuing inquiry. Last year, the Holyrood committeecriticised the Scottish governmentfor its “slow progress” on regulating the industry.It called for stricter rules and greater transparency of mortality rates at farms, amid concerns over persistently high numbers of salmon deaths. The industry has said that many of the problems are outside its control and that warming seas spur the growth of blooms ofplankton and micro-jellyfish, which sting, cut and block the gills of the fish, killing them or aggravating other problems. Campaigners blame welfare issues such as overcrowding.In January 2025,Finlay Carson, the committee’s convener, told the Guardian that if no progress was made to address its concerns within 12 months, the committee would begin to look at a moratorium on industry expansion.The peerie boats are heritage … For Shetland to be known for just producing millions of salmon would be sadWilliam CooperSince then, deaths in fish farms have got worse. The latest 2024 data, from the Scottish government’s figures across a whole production cycle to harvest, shows a survival rate of 61.8%, the lowest since the 1980s.In October,more than 250,000 salmon diedunexpectedly in Shetland’s farms alone, which one company blamed on plankton blooms and jellyfish in warm weather.Ariane Burgess, Green MSP for the Highlands and Islands, tells the Guardian: “A moratorium on new farms and expansions would allow regulators to ensure that existing rules are being properly enforced and to begin addressing the impact of salmon farming on our seas, our local economies and other marine-based jobs.”View image in fullscreenScottish farmed salmon production has soared by 23% in the past six years to 192,000 tonnes in 2024. There are applications for 20 new farms.Photograph: Karen Appleyard/AlamyEdward Mountain, a Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands who convened the first parliamentary inquiry into salmon farming in 2018, says he would now vote for a moratorium on salmon farm expansion. “I say that with great difficulty as I believe it is a really important industry toScotland. But continuing mortalities means to me that the industry hasn’t done what it promised to do in 2018, which was reduce mortalities and prevent problems,” he says.One larger farm can reduce overall seabed impact compared with several smaller farmsKaryn Lumsden, SSFSince then, Scottish farmed salmon production has soared by 23%,from 156, 025 tonnesin 2018 to192,000 tonnes in 2024. More than 58 planning applications have gone ahead (20 for new farms and 38 for reconfiguring existing farms, which includes extensions), according to data compiled by community campaigners and analysed by the environmental charityWildFish. Only three applications have been refused, one of which is being appealed, the charity says.Nick Underdown, Scotland director at WildFish, says the latest approval is an “unprecedented expansion of industrial salmon farming that carries significant environmental risk”.“Salmon farming is costing our marine environment, while foreign-owned salmon farm companies shift their profits to Norway, the Faroes and Canada,” he says.Back on Shetland, residents are weighing up the costs and benefits of the farm. SSF hasdonated more than £300,000 to local causes, from school laptops to Shetland’s girls’ football team.View image in fullscreenFish Holm seen from the Shetland mainland.Photograph: Kirstie Clubb/The GuardianView image in fullscreenWilliam Cooper, whose home overlooks Fish Holm, says the row over the new farm has changed his opinion of the industry.Photograph: Kirstie Clubb/The Guardian“It’s a big employer and it pays good wages,” says William Cooper, a retired engineer from Mossbank, which overlooks Fish Holm. While his wife, Denise, is put off by images of sea lice infestations, he is unbothered by the environmental arguments but admits the row has changed his mind about the industry, despite the jobs.‘The Vikings looked at this view – can’t they just leave it?’: island split over plans for salmon farmRead more“The peerie [small] boats are heritage – how it’s always been done,” he says. “For Shetland to be known for just producing millions of salmon would be quite sad really.”SSF has declined to comment on Fish Holm, but says in a statement that it is committed to “coexisting with other marine users while delivering long-term benefits for the islands”. Karyn Lumsden, SSF’s head of communications, says the Fish Holm plans include vacating one site and adds: “One larger farm can also reduce overall seabed impact compared with several smaller farms producing the same volume of fish.”A spokesperson for Salmon Scotland, which represents the salmon farming industry, saysit is looking forward to updating Holyrood’s rural affairs and islands committee with the sector’s progress, including “improved survival and continued investment in fish health and welfare”.Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansFishing industryScotlandFish (Environment)Fish (Food)FishingConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Vinícius immediately ran to the referee, François Letexier, who stopped the match and crossed his arms to signal that he was activating the anti-racism protocol.Vinícius Júnior takes aim at racist ‘cowards’ after Benfica’s defeat by Real MadridRead moreIn TV footage, it seemed that the word that Vinícius reported back to the referee was “mono” (monkey) and when that was put to Madrid’s coach, Álvaro Arbeloa, afterwards, he said: “You have to ask the Benfica player what he said … I have no reason not to believe what Vinícius says.” Vinícius later posted that racists are “cowards who have to cover their mouths”, while Kylian Mbappé later said that Prestianni had used the word five times.“I spoke to Vinícius and he said one thing and Prestianni said another,” José Mourinho said, although the Benfica manager also questioned why Vinícius celebrated as he had.“What happened tonight is a disgrace,” Trent Alexander-Arnold said. TheReal Madridcaptain, Federico Valverde, said: “If you cover your mouth to say something it’s because it’s not right. It’s lamentable. The insult is very serious and it has happened lots of times to Vinícius.”Vinícius had been shown a yellow card for the celebrations and all over the pitch there were more confrontations, some heated, others dejected. At one point Mbappé appeared to accuse Prestianni of being a “fucking racist”. “I am proud of my teammates for protecting Vinícius and Vinícius for carrying on,” Valverde said. Mourinho said afterwards that there was a moment in which the Brazilian did not want to continue. “There was a great game for 50 minutes and then it ended,” the Benfica coach said.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho talks to Vinícius Júnior before the game is restarted.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/ReutersIt had been competitive until then, and very different tothe last time they metjust 20 days ago. Mourinho had said that he began his analysis by watching that game back but soon turned off and threw his early prep in the bin. This Madrid is not that Madrid, he said, and that was quickly clear. Arbeloa has settled on a structure that gives a more muscular presence in the middle, offering a solidity that simply wasn’t there three weeks ago and ultimately this was a controlled, impressive away performance from Madrid, until the moment which sadly eclipsed everything.Benfica had started brightly again, the noise rising as Rafa Silva was almost slipped in after just three minutes and there was willingness to run through the middle from deep, particularly from Leandro Barreiro, while Thibaut Courtois made a superb stop from Fredrik Aursnes. But this time they would not find it so easy to tear into Madrid. Real, for their part, increased the tempo and might have led in a frantic spell before half-time.Champions League roundup: Galatasaray hammer Juventus to seize controlRead moreMbappé, Álvaro Carreras and a superb touch from Vinícius set up Mbappé for the first chance on 42 minutes, only for the Frenchman to fire over. On 43, after Eduardo Camavinga had been allowed to advance, Mbappé turned and drew a save from Anatoliy Trubin. On 44, Vinícius got into the area to find Mbappé, whose shot was blocked. And then on 45, Trubin made a fantastic save from Arda Guler. At that point, all Benfica wanted was for the whistle to blow, although they were annoyed when it finally did – just as they had a chance for a quick throw that might have released them.Those laments did not last long, but far worse ones replaced them. They had only been back out four minutes when Vinícius was released on the left, cut inside across the corner of the area and struck a fabulous shot into the far top corner. Although they did eventually continue, while Benfica came back at Madrid, Courtois saving from Andreas Schjelderup, Prestianni getting booked for diving in search of a penalty, Mourinho getting sent off for protesting, and a late Sidny Lopes Cabral free-kick looping on to the top of the net, something had been lost, a sadness left in its place. The game had long since ended Mourinho said, and in the way that no one wanted.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBenficaReal MadridVinícius Júniormatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Woods, who has not played competitively since the 2024 Open Championship, has also somewhat remarkably left the door open to teeing up in the Masters this year.With the USA still reeling from defeat by Europeat Bethpage in September, thoughts have turned towards attempts to reclaim the Ryder Cup in Ireland. Woods is the PGA of America’s first choice as captain. The 50-year-old will determine whether he believes he can commit sufficiently to the role.“They have asked me for my input on it and I haven’t made my ­decision yet,” Woods said. “I’m ­trying to ­figure out what we’re trying to do with our [PGA] tour. That’s been driving me hours upon hours every day and ­trying to figure out if I can actually do … our Team USA and our ­players and everyone that’s going to be involved in theRyder Cup, if I can do it justice with my time.“Serving on two boards and what I’m doing for the PGA Tour, I’m ­trying to figure out if I can actually do this and serve the people that are involved and serve them at an honourable level.”View image in fullscreenTiger Woods played for the US at eight Ryder Cups and could captain their attempt to reclaim the trophy in 2027.Photograph: Matt Dunham/APWoods has a longtime alliance with JP McManus, the owner of the Ryder Cup venue at Adare Manor. Europe are still to confirm captaincy plans for 2027 but the expectation is that Luke Donald will remain in position for a third Ryder Cup in succession. Needless to say, the PGA Tour will want to avoid any Woods decision‑making process turning into a saga.The 15-time major winner is part of a PGA Tour committee which will soon reshape the tournament ­schedule. “I thought I spent a lot of hours practising in my prime,” Woods said. “It doesn’t even compare to what we’ve done in the boardroom. It’s been challenging. We’re trying to do the right thing.”Woods was ­speaking in Los ­Angeles, where he is the tournament host at the ­Genesis Invitational. He underwent disc replacement surgery on his back last October. It was a surprise, then, to hear his answer when asked whether Augusta National and a Masters appearance in less than two months’ time is off the table. “No,” he said.“My body has been through a lot. It’s just one of those things where it’s each and every day, I keep trying, I keep progressing, I keep working on it, trying to get stronger, trying to get more endurance in this body and ­trying to get it at a level at which I can play at the highest level again.”Explore more on these topicsGolfTiger WoodsRyder CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is now in the process ofselling the agency.Scrutiny on Wasserman has escalated despite the LA Olympics board last week backing him to stay based on a review, which he cooperated with, by outside legal counsel of his contacts with Epstein and Maxwell.“I think that decision was unfortunate. I don’t support the decision. I do think that we need to look at the leadership,” Bass said. “However, my job as mayor of Los Angeles is to make sure that our city is completely prepared to have the best Olympics that has ever happened in Olympic history.”The mayor and California governor Gavin Newsom have key roles in the success of the LA Olympics and Paralympics by ensuring all layers of government support the complex logistical challenges that will take over the city in July and August of 2028.‘Casey should resign’: Abby Wambach leaves Wasserman after Epstein filesRead moreWasserman has been a driving force of the LA Olympics since the bid was launched in 2015.Questions about his statushave swirled since before he arrived in Milan two weeks ago to meet with IOC members and attend the Winter Games opening ceremony.The LA organizing team gave IOC members at their annual meeting an update of the hosting plan.Wasserman and other officials were quizzed on issues such as visa processing for global visitors to the US, though not on personal matters. They did not meet later with international media while officials from other future Olympic hosts did.Wasserman has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and Maxwell.In a statement issued before coming to Milan, Wasserman said “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell”, which was “long before her horrific crimes came to light”.Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on five counts of sex trafficking and abuse of minors, and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein’s death in a New York jail cell in 2019 was ruled a suicide and came a month after he was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges.Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesUS sportsLos AngelesInternational Olympic CommitteeWinter Olympics 2026West CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Weekdays were spent at school, avoiding homework, disrupting class and getting in trouble. Weekends at Alpine Meadows, a ski resort on the north-west shores of Lake Tahoe, were for jumping off cliffs and skiing powder with friends. Every Sunday he would have dinner at his grandad’s house, watch football and listen to jazz.“I’ve come to accept that I don’t always fit into the ski industry,” says Duncan, a professional skier, award-winning film-maker, entrepreneur and saxophonist. “I live in Portland and love the city life, music and the integration of art into my work. Being exposed to many different types of experiences helps me be more creative in everything I do.”To Duncan, jazz and skiing have been inextricably linked since he was young. He started playing the saxophone in third-grade band class, inspired by a Charlie Parker album cover he saw at his grandad’s house. “I could memorize a song and play it, but I couldn’t read music,” says the 33-year-old. “That’s largely still true today. I still can’t play sheet music well, but I loved playing the sax right away.”At the same time he was learning the sax, Duncan was progressing as a skier. He learned how to ski at just 18 months old, and his parents later would drop him off at the hill as a de facto daycare. When he was eight, a family friend recommended the Alpine Meadows development program and he began pursuing skiing on a more serious level. By the age of 13, he was the second-ranked skier in his division, leading to a scholarship at Sugar Bowl Academy, a private high school near Lake Tahoe focused on skiing.‘The most aesthetic line’: how Kilian Jornet climbed the 72 highest US mountains in 31 daysRead moreHad things worked out differently, Duncan might have been competing for an Olympic medal this month. “My ambition was to be one of the best in the country, to win a gold medal at the Olympics, even if that sounds bold now,” says Duncan. “There were around 10 kids in my class. We lived on campus and it was very regimented, which felt stifling at the time. But we got to ski almost every day, which kept me in line. For a decade, racing was my whole life.”Despite being comfortable on the slopes, Duncan didn’t always fit in at school. He was one of the few kids who listened to hip-hop, soul, funk, and jazz. He also dreamed of working as a producer at a record label. “I remember my dad listening to Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Kool & The Gang,” says Duncan, “and stealing my sister’s hip-hop CDs, but I didn’t develop my own taste until I moved away from home.”With a goal to race at the highest level with the US Ski Team, Duncan enrolled at the University of Vermont, home to one of the best collegiate programs in the country. But he didn’t make the team and decided to step away from the sport. A year later, friends brought him back to the slopes and it didn’t take long for Duncan to reconnect.“When I stopped racing, it was like relearning how to ski,” says Duncan, “Without gates, it felt like playing music from the soul, flowing with what felt natural. A friend later said to me that playing from sheet music is like learning to ski backwards. You first need to learn how to ski from your soul.”For the first time, Duncan felt an alignment between music and the way he wanted to ski: no one could tell him where he could go or what he could do. “It was all about exploring new areas, following your heart, being adaptable, and seeing what Mother Nature gave you, it didn’t have to be uniform [giant slalom] turns down the fall line,” says Duncan. “That’s just like jazz. You listen to what’s happening in order to keep that song moving forward.“Jazz is a disruptive genre that doesn’t always follow the rules, an improvisational thing. You don’t always play the right notes or stay in the same key as everyone else. Both give you endless opportunities to express yourself.”In 2019, Duncan signed his first ski sponsor, a major step in his career. The timing was nearly perfect, as backcountry skiing – his primary discipline – exploded in popularity during the pandemic, with many skiers looking for safe ways to get outside and feel a sense of freedom. He also launched his own creative agency, focused on sales, marketing and film projects.“Creativity isn’t just music and art, it’s the way you bring an idea to life,” says Duncan. “Entrepreneurship is one of the best ways I’ve found to be creative, finding new ways to create, form, and mould a business. It’s an expression of my creativity.”Duncan started turning heads with his fresh perspective on the industry. Despite being one of the very few Black pro skiers, he wanted his work to speak for him. “I like to be about things, not talk about them,” he says. “I live a Black experience, but being Black doesn’t define me as a skier.”His award-winning short film,Blackcountry Journal, premiered in the fall of 2023 and exemplified his ethos. It blends backcountry skiing with jazz in a way that had never been done before. It surprised much of the ski industry. “I wanted to show that Black people have a place in skiing, not tell people they do. Jazz is a historically Black discipline, but by not saying that explicitly opened the door for more people to connect with it.”This insight comes from years of bias he felt growing up, always trying to fit into a ski industry where he didn’t always feel that he fit in. “I didn’t always feel like a skier,” says Duncan. “I sometimes still don’t. When I’m in a space with a lot of people just talking just about skiing, I feel othered because that’s not why I got into it. I got into skiing for freedom, so I’m trying to expand what it means to be a skier so others can have that.”Duncan’s goals have evolved from traditional accolades and achievements to improvements in his personal style and new ways to be creative. He’s lost all desire to be the fastest or do the biggest tricks; instead he simply wants to finish a backcountry ski line and, “look up to see art”.Explore more on these topicsSkiingUS sportsJazzShareReuse this content"

The Olympic curling community is still all in a twist about everything that’s gone on in the sport since a row broke out between the Sweden and Canada sides on Friday. “The whole spirit of curling is dead,” Canada’s Marc Kennedy said on Monday night after his team’s 8-2 victory against Czech Republic, which felt like a bold take coming from the man who started this entire farrago by repeatedly telling his Swedish opponent Oskar Eriksson to “fuck off” after Eriksson accused him of making an illegal double‑touch.On Tuesday, the Canadians were outplaying the British. They beat them handily, 9-5, which means Bruce Mouat’s team have to beat the USA team and hope other results go their way if they’re going to make the semi-finals.Winter Olympics 2026: women’s figure skating, GB lose crunch men’s curling match, and more – liveRead more“Mouat gave us a couple of misses to work with,” Kennedy said. “Which isn’t something we’ve had from him before.” Then he left, grateful, he said, that he hadn’t had to face “a nuclear question”. There have been a lot of those in the past few days. On Tuesday morning there was talk that one of the Swedish journalists had new photographic evidence of the Canadian women’s skip making another double‑touch. There has never been a bonspiel quite like it.The way the Canadians play it, curling is a sport where a competitor is supposed to take his opponent’s word. “This whole trying to catch people in the act of an infraction sucks,” Kennedy said on Monday. “We don’t look for infractions at grand slams. We don’t look for that kind of stuff on tour. We just trust that the people around us aren’t trying to cheat. If somebody does something out of hand, it just gets dealt with in the moment, and you move on, you don’t need the officials to manage our game. That’s where the spirit of curling is in a little bit of trouble, and, honestly, that’s probably come from the quest for medals.”Curling, Kennedy says, is supposed to be a game for gentlemen. “It is what it is,” he said ruefully. “The sport is evolving.”And how. The row has turned out to be the biggest thing to happen to it since it was brought back into the Olympic programme in 1998. The slow-motion footage of Kennedy brushing the stone with his forefinger has gone viral, and the internet is overflowing with sloppy AI skits of Kennedy nudging ice hockey pucks and knocking over figure skaters at the ice rink. On TikTok someone put together a spoof of Kennedy and Eriksson in a whole Heated Rivalry situation, which has pulled in 2.5 million views. It’s fair to say the organisers were caught short by the speed and size of the reaction.View image in fullscreenGreat Britain need other results to go their way to reach the semi-finals.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAThey ended up bringing in two extra referees just to police the hog‑line, then took them away again after the curlers complained about it. “We’re not at some bonspiel in Saskatchewan, we’re at the Olympics,” the Canada team’s coach, Paul Webster, said. “We have untrained people doing things they’ve never done before. I have a lot of respect for people who are here and volunteering their time, but I think we really have to question if we’re doing new things at the Olympic Games.”Whatever has been lost, some of the curlers acknowledge that something has been gained too, though no one is sure whether it’s for the better or not. The sport couldn’t buy this publicity if it tried. The Curling Group are launching a new international franchise competition called The Rock League next April, Mouat and a bunch of the others have already signed up to play in it.“There’s been a lot of talk about the negativity of everything that’s going on,” the Canadian skip, Brad Jacobs, said. “But when you actually look at everything that’s gone on, and you consider how many eyeballs turned to curling over the last 72 hours, it’s probably the best thing ever for our sport.“What does the world feed off nowadays? Negativity. But that’s OK. Like I said, all of that negativity brought a lot of eyeballs to the sport of curling that maybe have never even considered looking at it before.” The pity is that unless Great Britain get lucky it won’t be Mouat they are watching, even though he is widely regarded as the best player in the sport today.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBCurlingWinter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She had competed with and against menon the World Cup tourandat the world championshipsto help force women’s monobob into the Winter Olympic program. She hadsurpassed the speed skater Shani Davisas the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Games history. She had stacked more Olympic medals than any female bobsledder ever, reaching the podium at Vancouver, Sochi, Pyeongchang and Beijing.But even at the age of 41, with a bad back and a concussion history, even with the added responsibility and time pressures of motherhood, even after five visits to an Olympic podium that would have been enough for a different athlete to call it a day, she had never let go of her dream of standing alone on the top step.That goal was achieved on Monday night in the quiet residential pocket of Località Gilardon where shefinally won gold in the monobobby 0.04sec over Germany’s Laura Nolte in the closest women’s bobsleigh finish in Olympic history. Meyers Taylor’s first gold came in her fifth Games – after three silver and two bronze medals over the previous four – andeclipsed Benjamin Karl’s recordas the oldest Winter Olympic gold medalist in an individual event.“The only thing missing from my resume at this point is an Olympic gold medal,” shetold NBClast year. “I’ve done everything else. I’ve accomplished a lot in this sport. But to have the opportunity, one last time, to go after it, you can’t pass that up.”View image in fullscreenElana Meyers Taylor celebrates after winning gold at the Cortina Sliding Centre on Monday night.Photograph: Erich Schlegel/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockMeyers Taylor was determined to squeeze every drop from her athletic gifts, not content with the Olympic near-misses, World Cup wins (21), world championships medals (10) and overall world titles (two, eight years apart) on her ledger. But the run-up to Monday’s cathartic gold had been the most difficult stretch of all. She didn’t reach the podium once in the World Cup season leading into her fifth Olympics, pushing through injuries, chronic pain, self-doubt, ahorrific crash last month in St Moritz, and the logistics of raising two young sons who travel the mostly European circuit with her and a nanny: Nico, five, who is deaf and has Down’s syndrome, and Noah, three, who is also deaf.“I don’t think I’m going to process this for a while,” she said of her gold medal. “There were so many moments during this entire season, during this past four years, that we just thought it was impossible – or I thought it was impossible.”The most challenging part of this Olympic cycle, she said, was rarely the sliding itself but the day-to-day balancing act of raising her sons while maintaining an elite career. That reality was made possible only by an unusually hands-on support network that stretched from coaching staff to federation officials to family including her husband, the former US bobsledder Nic Taylor, who works full-time back home and sometimes went six months at a time without seeing their boys.“The hardest mental battle is just the day to day with my kids and trying to figure out how to make this all work,” she said. “It took so many people just to get me to the starting line. And that was the biggest thing: I knew that if we could get to the starting line, that if we could get to this point, that we could make good things happen.”For anyone with even a passing connection to the Olympic movement in the United States, there was not a dry eye when Nolte’s heat-closing run came hundredths short and Meyers Taylor threw her fists skyward, wrapped herself in the American flag and dropped to her knees in tears with Nico and Noah beside her.“I can’t even explain what they saw,” she said. “We went over all the signs beforehand, we went overbobsled,bobsled race,champion. They know all the signs, they were well-briefed beforehand. But it didn’t even cross my mind that we would actually be using them.View image in fullscreenElana Meyers Taylor reached a top speed of 78.3mph (125.97kph) in her third heat, matching the track record.Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters“I hope they remember this visually, and I hope they were able to take it all in, that visual memory, because obviously they couldn’t hear everything that was going on. One day when they’re a little bit older they’ll see it and they’ll know that their mom was Olympic champion.”Meyers Taylor won the gold by being the most complete and consistent slider across all four runs. While her closest rivals were posting faster single splits or higher top speeds, Meyers Taylor carefully avoided mistakes. In a four-heat race decided by infinitesimal margins, that steadiness and composure was what ultimately secured her long-sought prize.“I just focused on what I needed to do, the points I needed to hit,” she said. “I had gone over the track again with my coach this morning, and he told me what I needed to do. We discussed it and we just went to work. I was super grateful to be able to put the pieces together and finally have a run that I could walk away very proud with.”Her gold also carries resonance far beyond sliding tracks. Meyers Taylor has become a visible figure for families raising children with disabilities, particularly within deaf and Down’s syndrome communities.View image in fullscreenElana Meyers Taylor celebrates with one of her sons after Monday’s win.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images“I had some really good people in my corner who believed in me,” she said. “And people from all over the world reaching out and telling me their stories, and how they had kids with Down’s syndrome, they had deaf kids, and how they believed in me, too. They’ve been encouraging me and telling me it doesn’t even matter if I win, I’ve done so much for the communities. I’m so excited to represent them. I’m so excited to represent my country. I’m so excited to have a gold medal, finally. It took long enough.”Her performance over nearly two decades has been surpassed only by her persistence, but her compassion, clarity of purpose and quiet moral authority extend far beyond self-interest. She’s interned with the International Olympic Committee in Switzerland, served as president of the Women’s Sports Foundation, advocated for gender equality andspoken forcefully about racial discriminationin her sport. Watch her long enough in an interview or at a press conference and it is easy to imagine a future IOC president.The Olympic title, in the end, was never the only goal. Meyers Taylor has been acutely aware of what her career has come to represent beyond results: to families raising deaf children, to parents navigating disability, to athletes trying to build full lives alongside their pursuit of their dreams. And at three minutes to 10pm on Monday night, deep in the jagged limestone peaks of the Dolomites on the edge of Cortina d’Ampezzo, Meyers Taylor’s wildest dream of all finally came to pass.“I don’t think I needed it. I wanted it,” she said. “And that’s what allowed me to keep going. If I’d needed it, I don’t think I’d have been able to have done it.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026BobsleighUSA Olympic teamWinter OlympicsInternational Olympic CommitteeUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Renna said in his commentary that Edelman defined himself as a Zionist, posted messages on social media in favour of what Renna referred to as the “genocide” in Gaza and had mocked a “Free Palestine” inscription he had seen on a wall on the sidelines of a World Cup race, among other things.“One can therefore question his presence in Cortina during these Games,” he said, citing IOC rules on athletes’ military connections and active support of war, including through their activities on social media.The American-born Edelman, who the Times of Israel said is the first Orthodox Jew to represent Israel at theWinter Olympics, posted on social media that he was aware of Renna’s commentary, which he described as a “diatribe”.“[We are] a team of six proud Israelis who’ve made it to the Olympic stage. No coach with us. No big program. Just a dream, grit, and an unyielding pride in who we represent,” he wrote. “I don’t think it’s possible to witness that and give any credence to the commentary.”IOC rules on active support of war relate only to Russian and Belarusian athletes who are allowed to compete at the Olympics as neutrals despite the ban on their countries, following Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Renna, who has been forbidden by RTS from discussing his commentary, also cited the case of Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who wasdisqualified from the Olympics last weekfor wearing a helmet depicting compatriot athletes killed since the Russian invasion.Edelman and Menachem are due to complete their third and fourth runs on Tuesday. They were in last place after their first two runs.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSwitzerlandIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The friendly competition will pit the US women against Argentina, Canada and Colombia in early March.This year marks the first time that teams can select 26 players for their SheBelieves squad, although each coach must determine 23 players who will be available for each game.“The SheBelieves Cup is a fantastic tournament which gives us the opportunity to replicate the group stage of a FIFA tournament,” Hayes said in the federation’s press release. “Three quality games in quick succession also allow us to replicate conditions that will prepare us for the World Cup qualifying campaign this fall. As always, we want to keep developing our player pool to be more and more prepared. As we gain more experience, I expect our standards to keep improving.”Four big predictions for the USWNT lineup after 2026’s first gamesRead moreThose who kept up with Hayes’s experimental squads throughout 2025 will recognize the bulk of the roster, which includes eight members of thegold-winning 2024 Olympic squad.Hayes opted for her three most-utilized goalkeepers following Alyssa Naeher’s international retirement. Phallon Tullis-Joyce, in top form with Manchester United, returns to the USWNT for the first time since October. Claudia Dickey and Mandy McGlynn got vital reps in the November and January camps to curtail the effects of the NWSL offseason.The defensive corps sees three well-established mainstays – Naomi Girma of Chelsea, Emily Fox of Arsenal and Emily Sonnett of Gotham – complemented by several up-and-comers. Jordyn Bugg (Seattle), Tara Rudd (Washington) and Kennedy Wesley (San Diego) will make their cases to partner Girma at center back. Gisele Thompson projects as Fox’s understudy on the right, while reigning US Young Player of the Year Lilly Reale (Gotham) and Kate Wiesner (Washington) will vie for starts at left back.There is similar balance in midfield, with Sam Coffey returning afterher move to Manchester Cityto anchor the midfield.Lindsey Heaps(OL Lyonnes, soon Denver) will again captain the team, and Rose Lavelle (Gotham) is fresh off a brilliant 2025 for club and country.The rest of the engine room features several of Hayes’s trusted young options. Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes) offers great facilitation and progression. Claire Hutton, with her all-around poise in defensive midfield, should reinforce whyBay FC spent big to pry her from Kansas Citylast week. Jaedyn Shaw will hope to harness momentum from her late-season transfer to Gotham, a move that ended in an NWSL Championship. Riley Jackson (North Carolina) is the least-tested selection, having debuted for the US in January but established herself as a regular starter for her club before turning 20 this offseason.Lindsey Heaps: ‘The Champions League is the baby you always want to win’Read moreMidfielder Catarina Macario is not in the US squad. The Chelsea star, who has been linked in recent weeks with a NWSL move, has not played for her club since 10 December. Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said last week that Macario was out with an injury.The forward line is a bit more prospective, withTrinity Rodman(Washington) and Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea) somehow the senior figures at ages 23 and 21, respectively. They’ll threaten from the wing, with Emma Sears (Louisville) offering danger to score from her dribble on the right and Maddie Dahlien (Seattle) proving savvy in the overlap with her pace and crossing chops as she alternates between left back and left wing. Ally Sentnor (Kansas City) projects to get her longest runout yet as Hayes’s striker, while Jameese Joseph (Chicago) scored her first USWNT goal in January.While these games are still nominally friendlies, they are viable tests from stronger opposition than many of the teams the US faced in 2025.

Inter’s coach Helenio Herrera – or “HH”, as he was known in the world of football – used the players on the youth team as “guinea pigs” for his drug experiments, according to Ferruccio Mazzola, who was on the books at Inter’s academy at the time (and a younger brother of Sandro Mazzola, one of the team’s star players).“I can describe the effects of those white tablets,” he wrote in a confessional memoir. He said he couldn’t sleep after taking HH’s pills. The hallucinations left him like a fish thrown up on the bank of a river. “I was shaking all over. I looked like an epileptic. I was scared. Also, the effect lasted for days and was followed by a sudden, tremendous tiredness.”He said a lot of players were reluctant to take them. Taking advice from senior players, they hid them under their tongues and spat them out in the toilet. But it was hard to dupe HH. “Herrera didn’t let himself be played so easily: he dissolved them into coffee, checking as much as possible in person that we took the medicine before the game.”It was almost impossible for a youth-team player to refuse the juice. It wasn’t the done thing to question HH’s authority. “Herrera encouraged us to take [amphetamines], to use sugar,” said Egidio Morbello, a first-team player. HH was the boss. It would have been fatal for a young player’s career prospects to go against him.“They were like bombs. They gave you a real kick,” said Pierluigi Gambogi, a youth-team player at the time. “We knocked them back. We wanted to get noticed – to get into the big leagues.”The side-effects from amphetamines can be brutal. Marcello Giusti was Gambogi’s best friend. He was small, a joker, who played as a centre-forward. Giusti was called up for a midweek reserve game in 1962 away to Como. He travelled with the team but didn’t play. Perhaps as a joke or by coercion, he took one of the white pills that was going around. After the final whistle, he freaked out, climbing the walls in the dressing room and drooling at the mouth like a rabid dog. He was so out of it that his teammates thought he was kidding around.When the players got on the team bus, Giusti was missing. HH didn’t care and nodded at the driver to leave: “He can catch up with us at the toll bridge.” It was 2km to the highway. Giusti took off running. Luckily, the bus was held up in traffic, so he caught up.View image in fullscreenInter’s Helenio Herrera with the European Cup after beating Real Madrid in Vienna.Photograph: FC Internazionale Archive/Inter/Getty ImagesThe Italian Football Federation introduced doping controls for the 1961-62 season, but they were easily overcome. “There were a thousand ways to get away with it,” said Franco Zaglio, one of Inter’s midfielders. For European competition, there were no doping controls. “Things changed in the international cups,” said Zaglio, “because you know when a game is worth three million in prize money, anyone can decide to take a risk.”For doping controls in Italy, vials of urine from a “clean” player – often a substitute – were given to a doped player going for a test. Or HH would put forward a player like Egidio Morbello because he knew he was clean. Teams inSerie Awent to elaborate lengths to hoodwink the testers.Carlo Petrini was a striker for Genoa and Milan in the 1960s. He gave some insight in his autobiography about one of the ploys used at Genoa: “Before the game, the ‘clean’ urine of some Genoa players who were on the bench was put inside five vials: the masseur then hid those vials in a double pocket inside our bathrobes, with a tip coming out of a slot protruding from inside the garment: it was enough to exert a slight pressure and the ‘clean’ urine came out of the spout, filling the anti-doping bottle. An easy, easy operation, also because there was no type of control in the anti-doping room.”View image in fullscreenDoping whistleblower Ferruccio Mazzola with Helenio Herrera in 1963.Photograph: Olycom Spa/ShutterstockIt seems most Serie A clubs did it. “It’s naive to think [Inter] was the only culprit, the only ‘white fly’ in the ointment, amongst the great teams of Italy, Europe and the world,” said Ferruccio Mazzola, who died in 2013. When he published his whistleblowing football memoir in 2004, detailing HH’s doping practices, it caused a feud with his brother Sandro Mazzola, and the club sued Ferruccio Mazzola for libel in 2005, claiming it was “desecration” to suggest HH’s team resorted to doping to achieve its glorious results.The case was a sensation, as details filtered out about the concoctions HH got his players to ingest, including altered coffee, sugar mixed with strange powders, and vitamins that weren’t vitamins. All the living greats from HH’sGrande Interwere hauled into court, one by one, to give testimony. In 2008, the judge ruled against Inter. The club couldn’t prove that the facts in Ferruccio Mazzola’s book were not true, and incurred the costs for the lawsuit. Mazzola’s old Inter teammates said he was a bitter man. That he bore a grudge because his time at the club was a failure. “If I wanted to hurt Inter in the book, I would have talked about match-fixing and the referees who were bribed, especially in the cups,” he said.When I asked his brother, Sandro, about HH’s doping programme, I discovered that his stance has softened since he first refused to accept his brother’s whistle-blowing campaign almost two decades earlier. He explained HH’s process, how his amphetamine pills were doled out. “There was a massage therapist in Herrera’s staff who was a close friend of mine. We grew up together in football. He told me everything. He recommended to me not to take those ‘tablets’, but I couldn’t be seen to be avoiding them by Herrera, so I would put the tablet under my tongue, faking it.View image in fullscreenRichard Fitzpatrick’s book about Helenio HerreraPhotograph: PR“The massage therapist was the one who gave you the tablets, but Herrera was also there to check everyone swallowed them down. I stood there, the tablet under my tongue, without doing anything – then, as soon as he went out of sight, I would put the tablet inside one of my boots. I always brought four pairs of boots with me, for every kind of pitch, rainy conditions, hard surface, and so on. I remember taking those tablets home. I used to see another massage therapist in Como – he was called Ferrario – because one year earlier I had had a muscle problem that was difficult to heal, but Ferrario fixed it.“So, I kept seeing him for massages and, once, I took the tablets with me and asked: ‘Can you check what’s inside them so that I know? Maybe it’s nothing.’ After a week, Ferrario wanted to speak to me: ‘Thank God, you didn’t take them – it’s Simpamina [the product name for amphetamines sold by a pharmaceutical company in Italy in the 1960s],’ he said. ‘You could’ve collapsed while running! It has very strong side-effects. It’s dangerous.’ Since then, I didn’t take anything else.”HH: Helenio Herrera – Football’s Original Master of the Dark Arts by Richard Fitzpatrick (Bloomsbury) is available to order in hardback, audiobook and ebook now.To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

However, the European champions were in all sorts of trouble after 56 seconds when Nuno Mendes had a stray crossfield pass cut out in midfield, handing Monaco a first attack with Golovin chipping for Balogun to head home from close range.Balogun outsprinted Marquinhos to double Monaco’s lead, before Wout Faes pulled back Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to give away a 22nd-minute penalty.

Galatasaray equalised just after the break when Lang slotted home a rebound from Baris Alper Yilmaz’s effort. The Turkish side then regained the lead on the hour mark as Davinson Sánchez turned in a precise Sara set piece.Juventus’s troubles mounted in the 67th minute when the substitute Juan Cabal was shown a second yellow card, for a reckless challenge, leaving his side to play the remainder of the match with 10 men.View image in fullscreenDanny Makkelie shows a red card to Juan Cabal (second right) of Juventus.Photograph: Erdem Şahin/EPAGalatasaray capitalised on the numerical advantage and increased their lead in the 75th minute.

Arsenal have preserved all concessionary ticketing categories and will continue to distribute 1,000 free tickets to the local community.The club said: “While were are making progress towards winning major trophies, we are still working towards financial sustainability. Our investment in our playing squads and infrastructure is dependent on the revenue we drive in the face of rising costs.”The Arsenal Supporters’ Trust said it was “disappointed” with the price rises. “We firmly believe that with the football sector benefiting from ever-increasing broadcast and commercial revenues it is time to stop squeezing match-going supporters so hard.” The trust observed that Arsenal reported a 10% increase in revenue last season.The club are close to announcing Bukayo Saka’s contract extension, worth about £300,000 a week. The 24-year-oldagreed a new deal until 2031 in January.Safe standing will be introduced first in the Clock End, then in the North Bank lower from 2027-28. In total 13,500 home and away supporters will eventually be able to stand while watching.Mikel Arteta has said he is looking at Arsenal’s warm-up routines “big time” as he seeks an explanation for why his players keep pulling up before matches. Riccardo Calafiori dropped out of the lineup for theFA Cup tie against Wiganlast Sunday after sustaining an injury in the warm-up, the second time it has happened to the player, and the fourth time in the season overall. Arteta said he was confident the Italian would be available against Wolves but said the club were “looking into” their pre-match habits.View image in fullscreenGabriel Martinelli (left) and Riccardo Calafiori of Arsenal warming up before the game against Wigan.Photograph: Dylan Hepworth/Every Second Media/Shutterstock“We are big time looking at it,” Arteta said. “The incidents were very different: the first time was Willy [Saliba] rolling his ankle against Liverpool, then we had two incidents with Ricky [Calafiori] in the warm-up in a very similar way, then one with Bukayo after he was rested in midweek – didn’t play against Kairat Almaty – then against Leeds he has an incident.“It’s very unusual. I think it’s only happened once or twice in the six [previous] years I’ve been here. But it’s happened four times this year. We are looking into it, but it is what it is. We have to learn.”Arteta added that he had learned to dread the opening of his office door as the clock ticks down to kick-off but said the spate of pre-match injuries had also led him to question the value of the process.“The warm-up is so that the players are activated to be absolutely at their best physically and mentally, to be connected with their teammates. It’s to tell the body the game is coming, the adrenaline is going to start to pick up, the testosterone has to be in the right spot and you’re ready to compete. To change that sometimes is tricky.“It’s a really good area to look at, though. What would happen if we didn’t do the warm-up? Because then at half-time we sit for almost for 15 minutes and then we go full guns again in the second half. So maybe it’s something to think about.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalFootball ticket pricesMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

The 47-year-old former Juventus manager,brought in last weekas the sacked Thomas Frank’s replacement until the end of the season, believes instilling the players with confidence is his most important task.“The team need, I believe, first of all, to get some confidence, to get some courage, but also, in same way, the concrete things in the pitch,” Tudor told Spursplay. “Of course, I’m coming here knowing that situation is not easy. There is no time to find excuses. What I said from the first day here, each of us need to give something more, something extra.”Frank was sackedafter eight months in the wake ofa 2-1 home defeat by Newcastle, which extended Spurs’ winless top-flight run to eight matches. The club are 16th, five points above the relegation zone, and Tudor faces a tough mission in his first game, at home to title-chasing Arsenal on Sunday.“The position of the club in this moment is one that nobody can accept,” Tudor said. “Every Tottenham fan cannot accept the situation. We are aware of that. But it’s not enough to just be aware of that.‘Ferryman’ Igor Tudor has the record to steer Tottenham to safetyRead more“The situation is not easy because we have a lot of injured players, so we need first to find the best system to suit the players that are available in this moment. Maybe this can sound strange, but I believe that the thing that we need to be focused on is the training. So the training from today, that’s the key.“The coach needs to show the path, where is the way we want to go, how we want to go, and the players need to accept this.”Tudor, sacked by Juventus in October last year after an eight-game winless run, said he was aware of the club’s culture and the fans’ demand for a stylish brand of winning football. He added: “I believe in the style. The style is more important than the system, of course. So every club has its particularity. That is first as a culture of the club, which kind of football they like.“So it’s always important to think about that, but in the same way, not forget who I am, what I want, what the team can achieve. So I need to be, with my staff, very intelligent to find the best possible way in a very short time.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

For the former Wolves manager, ­working for Evangelos Marinakis, Forest’s ­exacting owner, holds few fears.The 57-year-old Pereira, sacked by Wolves in November, worked pre­viously for Marinakis at ­Olympiakos. They celebrated a Greek league and cup double together in the 2014‑15 season, only to part that June. The very next day, he joined Fenerbahce, who ­Forest face in a Europa League playoff on Thursday in his first game.Are we all Evangelos Marinakis? Why there has never been less patience with managers | Jonathan WilsonRead more“He has the fire, he has the passion,” Pereira said of ­Marinakis at his first Forest press conference. “He has the ambition and he is not afraid to make decisions.“He trusts my work, I trust his personality because in football we need passion too,” Pereira said of an owner who sacked his predecessor, Sean Dyche, in the small hours after the goalless draw with Wolves last Wednesday. “He trusts my qualities, if not only the tactical qualities, the technical qualities, but human qualities also.”The latest Forest manager has signed an 18-month deal. He has remained on good terms with ­Marinakis despite the speedy departure from Olympiakos. “I was young. When we are young, we make ­mistakes, even now. Sometimes we decide with our heart and I made some bad choices but I didn’t have any problem with Olympiakos and they never sacked me.“I remember the energy and the fire that we created … When I worked with [Marinakis], he never interfered in my work. But he likes to speak, to have meetings, to speak about what happens, what’s up.”View image in fullscreenThe Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, has previous with Vítor Pereira.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockPereira rescued Wolves from rele­gation last season and is confident he can achieve the same ­objective. ­Forest have 12 league matches ­remaining, and are 17th, three points above West Ham. “I didn’t come toNottingham Forestexpecting that I will not succeed with my work. I came because I really believe that with our work, and the players that we have, we can do good things.”After jobs in Portugal, Saudi ­Arabia, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Brazil and now his second English assignment, Pereira does not fear the sack. “If you get results, you are in. If you don’t, you are out. And I accept that. Someone that wants to live in football needs to live with this kind of situation, needs to live with the passion, with the critics, with everything.“If you are looking for security, you cannot be a manager. But if I want to be secure, I was a school teacher, and, you know, they pay bad salaries, and it was a difficult life to live.”Pereira inherits an expensively assembled squad that failed for perform to last season’s heights for Nuno Espírito Santo, who lasted 24 days this season and did not win any of eight matches Ange Postecoglou presided over his 40-day stint. Forest had lately struggled under Dyche, whose tenure lasted 114 days. Pereira said: “I believe in leadership with honesty, with good communication, open communication. I believe in leadership with competence … I will not talk about Sean because I respect him a lot, I like his work.“It’s important that everybody must be ready to help the team. Because we cannot play every time with the same players, because to play with energy, to play with intensity, we need to have fresh legs and fresh minds to do it. They have to feel that they are important, everyone.”Pereira expects a “fantastic atmosphere” at Fenerbahce in the first leg of the Europa League playoff. On Wolves, where he was dismissed weeks after signing a new three-year contract, he said: “I’m not here to speak about Wolves, but I did make mistakes. What I want to say is it was a fantastic experience.”Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestOlympiakosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has learned that ESPN has agreed to extend its longstanding partnership until 2031, with the new deal understood to be worth about £450m.The Premier League told the clubs about the new deal at the shareholders’ meeting last Friday, when they were also updated about TV rights contracts in other regions that are due to go out to tender shortly.The 25% uplift in one of the Premier League’s biggest foreign markets demonstrates that the value of its TV rights overseas is still rising at a time when the domestic market is flat, or falling slightly.Match of the Day scores viewing figures success with BBC’s new digital strategyRead moreWhile the Premier League succeeded in gaining a slight rise inits UK deals with Sky Sports and TNT Sports, from £1.63bn a season to £1.67bn, in the new four-year deal which began last August, the growth was based on increasing the number of games available from 215 to 270.The per-game value of the rights fell by about 10%, which has led to the Premier League beginning discussions with the EFL about petitioning to have the 3pm Saturday blackout lifted in the next domestic broadcast cycle from 2029 onwards, which would enable it to sell all 380 of its matches each season.Every Premier League game is already available live in overseas markets, with the newESPNdeal indicating that demand remains strong.The Premier League’s overseas TV contracts are already more lucrative than its domestic deals, bringing in £2.1bn each year compared with that £1.67bn, and that income gap appears set to grow in subsequent years.The Premier League will hope to achieve a significant increase in the value of its US rights deal, which will go to market after this summer’s World Cup.NBC Sports is paying £378m a year for the rights in an exclusive six-year deal that expires in 2028, and is likely to face strong competition from other networks.The Premier League declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueESPNSports rightsTelevision industryUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He will go up against a raft of players and coaches with whom he rubbed shoulders on the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia last summer. Borthwick, however, has challenged the 21‑year‑old player to express himself in front of the Twickenham crowd.The Breakdown | France’s creative heart ‘Jalipont’ can easily join rugby’s great double-actsRead morePollock’s excitable nature and his penchant for try celebrations has regularly made him a target for opponents in the past, most notably for Northampton against Bordeaux, and he was involved in a post-match scuffle with the French prop Jefferson Poirot after the Champions Cup final last season. Bordeaux players rubbed salt into the wounds on social media after their victory and, when the two sides met again in the competition this season, Pollock came in for further targeted treatment. He also scored a wonder try down the left wing, pinching the ball from Damian Penaud’s hands in the process.Borthwick said: “He seems to thrive on that doesn’t he? It seems to just keep fuelling more of the energy that is within him. I find it incredible watching him – there are not many players like him. We want superstars in the game.“I don’t think he needs any motivation from anything external, which I love – he is so intrinsically driven, he is that character. What you see is exactly what you get. He gets people excited, he gets people jumping up and down with joy. He can bring a euphoria to people that not many players can.“I will challenge him to express himself, be himself and also bring the self-sacrifice that a team sport needs. He does [both] wonderfully well and I am looking forward to seeing him do it from the start.”View image in fullscreenNorthampton Saints’ Henry Pollock and Jefferson Poirot of Bordeaux are pulled apart by teammates.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersPollock comes into the team with Ben Earl shifting to openside flanker and Tom Curry recalled at blindside flanker. Guy Pepper and Sam Underhill drop to the bench as a result with Borthwick backing Pollock to spearhead a more dynamic back-row performance than in the disappointingdefeat against Scotland last weekend.“He’s a young man who is full of energy, full of character, full of beans all the time and he’s already achieved so much in a very short space of time,” Borthwick said. “Each new level you challenge him with, he seems to thrive. I want Henry to get the ball in his hands. I want him to find the ball as often as possible. Ben Earl had more than 20 carries last weekend, and I want Henry to have as many carries as possible as well. If we do that, it’s another string to the bow of this team.“We don’t have a huge pack, we have speed and athleticism in our back row, speed in our outside backs, beautiful decision-makers and talented players at 9 and 10. I want the crowd to be on their feet, to enjoy what we’re doing. Having players who bring the euphoria is wonderful.”Borthwick cited a key turnover won by Pollock when onChampions Cup duty against Munsterlast year as evidence of his “drive and character”, and reflected upon his first meeting with a teenage back-row who was “wonderfully different”.Quick GuideEngland team to face IrelandShow15Freddie Steward,14Tommy Freeman,13Ollie Lawrence,12Fraser Dingwall,11Henry Arundell,10George Ford,9Alex Mitchell;1Ellis Genge,2Luke Cowan-Dickie,3Joe Heyes,4Maro Itoje,5Ollie Chessum,6Tom Curry,7Ben Earl,8Henry Pollock.Replacements: 16Jamie George,17Bevan Rodd,18Trevor Davison,19Alex Coles,20Guy Pepper,21Sam Underhill,22Jack van Poortvliet,23Marcus SmithWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Henry was barely out of school but I was told when you’re up there, I should meet Henry Pollock, a young player, a huge future ahead of him, he’s not yet played for the first team but I should meet him,” Borthwick said. “I was stood in the car park and this bundle of energy just bounced up to me.“Typically when an 18-year-old meets the England head coach for the first time they are usually on the shy and retiring side. But this man is the complete opposite, gregarious, loud, the first thing he said was: ‘How are you, mate?’ I thought, right, you’re different. Wonderfully different and that’s the kind of character we’ve got in the squad. He’s larger than life, isn’t he? Just wants to do well, wants to express himself.”The suggestion on the Lions tour last summer was that Pollock was not selected for the Test series in part for his inability to get up to scratch with the finer details of Andy Farrell’s gameplan, but Borthwick has no such concerns. “There’s a larger-than-life character who definitely exists,” he said. “There is also the guy who sits and studies, watches and makes sure he delivers when he needs to deliver what is required for the team.”Henry Arundell has been retained in Borthwick’s side after escaping a suspension for his red card for two yellows against Scotland. The Bath wing faced a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday morning but the panel determined that his 47th‑minute dismissal at Murrayfield was sufficient punishment.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It was, as Ruby Walsh pointed out on the voiceover, a reminder of how the National has been revived and transformed.A glance back no further than the 2011 Grand National, however, also offers clear evidence of how much the great race has changed, even in the space of 15 years. The field, of course, is now down to a maximum of 34, rather than the 40 runners that we all grew up with, but it is the depth of quality in the names, ratings and weights that were published on Tuesday that stands out.The bottom weights in 2011 raced off a rating of 138. The 34th name on the list for 2026 – ie, the last horse guaranteed a run – is Jagwar, on 152, and while a rating of 144 might well get you an outing on 11 April it is far from guaranteed. Although Don’t Push It, the eventual top weight in 2011, raced off a mark of 160, the top dozen in this year’s handicap are all rated 160 or above.“This year’s race really stands out in terms of quality,” Martin Greenwood, the handicapper responsible for setting the weights, said on Tuesday. “Although entries are slightly down overall [to 78 from 90 in 2025], it’s at the bottom end, where trainers are now realising there is no point in entering as they have no chance of getting in.”From one year to the next, the depth of quality in the Grand National has been increasing, and that has been reflected in the results, with the best horses increasingly shrugging off burdens of 11st or more to come to the fore. Nick Rockett, wholed home a 1-2-3 for Willie Mullins12 months ago, carried 11st 8lb, while I Am Maximus, the 2024 winner, finished second under 11st 12lb, and Grangeclare West was next over the line with 11st 8lb.View image in fullscreenA triumphant Patrick Mullins on Nick Rockett in 2025.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSome will argue that the race has changed so thoroughly that it no longer bears comparison with the Grand National back in “the good old days”. They point out that the trip has been cut along with the numbers, and complain that the fences are too soft and the outcomes are all too predictable.On the latter point, though, the form book suggests otherwise, with winners at 50-1 and 33-1 in the last four years alone. And while there will always be those who feel that a race without a steady series of fallers is not a “proper” National, the easier fences have led to several runnings where as many as two dozen are still in with a chance as they cross the Melling Road for the final time. For a once-a-year TV audience keeping track of their sweepstake entries – and, perhaps, being introduced to racing for the first time – that can only add hugely to the excitement and spectacle.It is true that there is a certain uniformity about the names attached to many of the leading contenders. The biggest Irish stables now dominate the National entries, as they do at Cheltenham next month, and Mullins alone has 10 of the top 34 in the weights. However, there is still room too for the kind of windmill-tilting by the smaller yards that has always been the National’s stock in trade.Mr Vango, already among the most popular chasers in training, is guaranteed a run for Sara Bradstock’s stable having narrowly missed out last year. “We’ve got to get enough rain,” Bradstock said on Tuesday, “but otherwise we’re obviously very much looking forward to what he’s good at, which is jumping and stamina. He’s a great big horse to carry weight, so we’re delighted to get a chance if the ground comes.”Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowLudlow: 2.00Island Bridge2.33Hornica3.05Theonewedreamof3.35Petty Cash4.05Diamonds Galore4.35Count Adhemar5.05ManigodSouthwell: 2.20Bank On Frank2.55Disguisedlimit3.25Smokehouse3.55Zamek4.25Farmer Jimmy4.55AsaKempton: 5.30Silver State (nb)6.00Zoffandia6.30Crimson Rambler (nap)7.00Comic Hero7.30Silent Strike8.00Shallow8.30SolarizeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Oscars Brother, meanwhile, needs another run to qualify but is 24th on the list if he can and will bid to make 27-year-old Connor King, who has just two horses at his stable in County Kildare, the youngest winning trainer in National history.Oscars Brother attracted some early money in the betting on Tuesday, down to around 33-1 from an early 40-1, but Iroko, fourth when favourite as a seven-year-old 12 months ago, is again a clear market leader, at a top price of 7-1.Iroko is one of just three runners at 16-1 or shorter in the early betting, with I Am Maximus on offer at 12-1 to become the first top-weight to win since Red Rum in the 1970s and Haiti Couleurs,the Welsh Grand National winner, next at 16-1.Nick Rockett (25-1) is running out of time to get a qualifying run if he is to attempt to repeat last year’s win, but Grangeclare West (25-1) is on course to return toAintreewhile another runner from the Mullins yard, Spanish Harlem, is an interesting contender for his owner, Peter FitzGerald, the founder of Randox, the race sponsor for the last 10 years.View image in fullscreenSean Bowen rides Haiti Couleurs clear to win the Welsh Grand National last December.Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesThe eight-year-old looked the likely winner of the Thyestes Chase, often a significant Grand National trial, in January before unseating his inexperienced jockey at the last, and could offer some early value at around 40-1.“He was very disappointing for a long time, but extreme distances over fences has brought out the best in him,” Patrick Mullins, last year’s winning rider and his father’s assistant, said on Tuesday.“The profile is right in my book and I don’t see why he won’t take to the fences, he’s got plenty of experience and jumps well. I know he can throw in the odd clanger, but sometimes those horses can just have a little bit more respect for a new type of fence.”Explore more on these topicsGrand NationalTalking HorsesAintreeHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

ForGoogleand Microsoft, most claims lacked evidence.The analysis, released during the AI Impact Summit in Delhi this week, argues the tech industry has misleadingly presented climate solutions and carbon pollution as a package deal by “muddling” types of AI.Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead atHugging Face, an open-source AI platform and community,who was not involved in the report, said it added nuance to a debate that often lumped very different applications together.“When we talk aboutAI that’s relatively badfor the planet, it’s mostly generative AI and large language models,” said Luccioni, who has pushed the industry to be more transparent about its carbon footprint.“When we talk about AI that’s ‘good’ for the planet, it’s often predictive models, extractive models, or old-school AI models.”Why AI datacentres are draining our energy and water – Full Story podcastRead moreGreen claims even for traditional AI tended to rely on weak forms of evidence that had not been independently verified, the analysis found. Only 26% of the green claims that were studied cited published academic research, while 36% did not cite evidence at all.One of the earliest examples identified in the report was a widespread claim that AI could help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.The figure, which Google repeated as recently as April last year, came from a report it commissioned from BCG, a consulting firm, which cited a blogpost it wrote in 2021 that attributed the figure to its “experience with clients”.Datacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The IEA predicts they will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.While the energy consumption of a simple text query to a large language model such as ChatGPT may be as little as running a lightbulb for a minute, partial industry disclosures suggest, it rises considerably for complex functions such as video generation and deep research, and has troubled some energy researchers with the speed and scale of its growth.A spokesperson for Google said: “Our estimated emissions reductions are based on a robust substantiation process grounded in the best available science, and we have transparently shared the principles and methodology that guide it.”Microsoft declined to comment, while the IEA did not respond to requests for comment.Joshi said the discourse around AI’s climate benefits needed to be “brought back to reality”.“The false coupling of a big problem and a small solution serves as a distraction from the very preventable harms being done through unrestricted datacentre expansion,” he said.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

There was the one about the founder who hadn’t taken a weekend off in more than six months. The woman who joked that she’d given up her social life to work at a prestigious AI company. Or the employees who had started taking their shoes off in the office because, well, if you were going to be there for at least12 hoursa day,six daysa week, wouldn’t you rather bewearing slippers?“If you go to a cafe on a Sunday, everyone is working,” says Sanju Lokuhitige, the co-founder of Mythril, a pre-seed-stage AI startup, who moved toSan Franciscoin November to be closer to the action. Lokuhitige says he works seven days a week, 12 hours a day, minus a few carefully selected social events each week where he can network with other people at startups. “Sometimes I’m coding the whole day,” he says. “I do not have work-life balance.”Another startup employee, who came to San Francisco to work for an early-stage AI company, showed me dismal photos from his office: a two-bedroom apartment in the Dogpatch, a neighborhoodpopular with tech workers. His startup’s founders live and work in this apartment – from 9am until as late as 3am, breaking only to DoorDash meals or to sleep, and leaving the building only to take cigarette breaks. The employee (who asked not to use his name, since he still works for this company) described the situation as “horrendous”. “I’d heard about 996, but these guys don’t even do 996,” he says. “They’re working 16-hour days.”Startups have never been particularly glamorous. When I started reporting on the industry a decade ago, people were cashing in on the new mobile app economy, andcoders were chugging Soylentto stay at their desks longer. Startups then, too, were defined byhustle culture,high-octane energyand the pursuit ofgrowth at all costs– ideas that, to some extent, have remained in the bloodstream of the industry.But in the last year, as the magic dust of artificial intelligence has settled in San Francisco, the vibe among tech workers does seem different. The excitement about a new epoch in tech – and all the money that comes with it – is now tempered with anxieties about the industry, and the economy. Some workers are going all in on AI while also questioning whether all that AI is good for the world. Others are effectively training machines to do their jobs better than they can. And many of the same workers who are racing to build the future are now wondering if the future they’re building has a place for them in it.The rest of us may be ambiently aware of these anxieties, but they are already tangible and keenly felt inside the tech industry. Even the biggest tech companies, once known for coddling employees with on-site massages and barber shops, havescaled backperks as they have escalated the expectations of workers. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have each been candid about their predictions that AI will replace some junior and mid-level engineers at their companies, and have respectively called for their workforces to be more “efficient” and “extremely hard core” as waves of layoffs set employees on-edge. Tech companies laid off about a quarter of a million workers around the world in 2025, according to areportpublished byRationalFX. In many of those layoffs, AI wascited as a main factor, even if the full reason for layoffs is often more complex.“If you were a software engineer five years ago, you could kind of write your ticket,” says Mike Robbins, an executive coach who has worked with companies like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Airbnb. Now, the balance of power has shifted away from tech workers, many of whom are left feeling anxious about their work performance. “When companies become less scared about losing employees, then they can be a little more forthright in terms of what they want and be a little more demanding.”Robbins, who wrote the book Bring Your Whole Self to Work, used to be asked to speak to companies and their leaders about topics like employee burnout, wellbeing and belonging – top priorities in the years during and shortly after the pandemic. “Quite frankly, we’ve stopped talking about all that,” he says. Now, company leaders want advice on topics like change, disruption and uncertainty in the workplace.Those themes – change, disruption and uncertainty – are each part of the fuel that has driven tech workers to put in more hours, at a higher intensity. Investment in artificial intelligence companies reachedrecord highsin 2025, yet workers are feeling scarcity in ways they haven’t before.“It’s definitely something that’s on everyone’s mind,” says Kyle Finken, a software engineer at Mintlify, which makes an AI tool for developers. “I think a lot of people are concerned like, ‘Oh, am I going to have a job in three years?’”Despite his fears, Finken, like many other startup employees I spoke to, feels energized by the “extraordinary innovation” happening in artificial intelligence and believes that there will still be plenty of jobs for software engineers in the future, even if those jobs look different from the pure coding roles of today. He and other tech workers characterized the current moment as a particularly creative and productive time in tech, where people are devoting extra hours to work not because their employers demand it but out of genuine interest in the new tools and capabilities. For example, Garry Tan, the head of the famous startup accelerator Y Combinator, recently bragged that he “stayed up 19 hours” playing around with Claude Code.Even those who felt excited about the pace of change acknowledged that AI was rapidly augmenting their work, in ways that could have uncertain outcomes for the jobs of the future. “This is definitely not an era of complacency,” says Finken.One reason for working so many hours is to keep up with tools and technology that are changing nearly every day. If you take the weekend off, you can miss a major development, which makes it harder to keep up with what competitors are doing. Another reason is to have something to show future employers, especially as more junior-level jobs are replaced by AI.“No one hires junior developers any more,” says Lokuhitige, the Mythril co-founder. Landing a job now requires “doing something cool”, he says, like building a new product or solving a problem that gets recognized as useful by larger companies. Job postings for entry-level tech jobs have dropped by a third since 2022, according toIndeed’s Hiring Lab, while job postings requiring at least five years of experience have risen. If you’re not grinding at a startup, you’re missing the prerequisite to get hired in the future.What this means for the rest of usWhile economists are torn about whether AI will replace most jobs or just change them, they seem aligned in the idea that AI has already reshaped a great deal of entry-level work and will continue to do so. Apaperpublished by Stanford researchers in November found “substantial declines in employment for early-career workers” in industries exposed to AI and suggested that areas where change is already occurring could be like a “canary in the coalmine” for the rest of the economy. The Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei, has suggested AI could eliminateabout halfofallentry-level jobs in white-collar industries within the next five years.The head of the International Monetary Fund recentlypredictedthat 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence, “like a tsunami hitting the labour market”. In San Francisco, you can already see the early signs, as Uber drivers compete with self-driving Waymos, and baristas are replaced by robotic coffee bars. Professional business services that support the tech industry have also beennegatively affectedby the layoffs. The pressure to grind in the tech world could be an early signal – a harbinger for what many other industries will feel soon.Robbins, the executive coach, says that companies once looked to Silicon Valley as a model of how they should operate, down to emulating policies like unlimited vacation days or adopting perks like free lunch in the office.“There was an idealization of tech and Silicon Valley for a long time across the business world. Some of that has changed,” he says. “Now, people aren’t asking me to tell them what’s going on in the Valley so that they can adopt it, the same way they were a decade ago.”Rather than a model of how we should all work, the tech industry may be a premonition for the anxiety and attempts to compensate that are coming for all of us."

Welcome to Mega: Make Empire Great AgainMehdi HasanMarco Rubio arrived at the Munich security conference with a disturbing message for European governments: empire is greatTue 17 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 11.17 ESTShareFresh from toppling the president ofVenezuelaand taking control of the world’s largest oil reserves, theTrump administration’s top diplomat arrived at the Munich security conference on Saturday with a rather new and very disturbing message for European governments.Empire is great. Empire is back. Empire isAmerican.The US secretary of state delivered what can only be described as a22-minuteode to empire. A love letter to conquest and colonialism. A proud defense of the west’s territorial expansion.That secretary of state was, of course,Marco Rubio– the longtime foreign-policy hawk who is now one of the most influential voices in a Maga-dominated Republican party that once pretended it wanted to end “forever wars”.In his speech, Rubio went way beyond offering the typical defense of US “leadership” or a muscular foreign policy, as so many of his predecessors, both Republican and Democratic, have done before him. Rather, he issued a full-throated endorsement of empire – and he did it at exactly the moment the United States, under his bossDonald Trump, is openly engaging in the kind ofterritorial and extractive imperialismthat most western European governments spent the last 80 years renouncing.In Munich, inGermanyof all places, Rubio delivered an encomium to five centuries of the west’s “missionaries, its pilgrims, its soldiers, its explorers, pouring out from its shores to cross oceans, settle new continents, build vast empires extending out across the globe”. He lamented the “contracting” of the “great western empires” in the wake of the second world war. He decried the “godless communist revolutions” and “anti-colonial uprisings” which, for the record, helped free750 million peopleacross 80 former colonies since the founding of the United Nations in 1945.And the response to his remarks? Europe’s elites gave him a standing ovation, as if he’d just announced a cure for cancer rather than theliteralreturn of empire. And in doing so, they made themselves shamefully complicit in the Trump administration’s rewriting not just ofUS history, but European and world history too.Here are the facts that the US secretary of state chose to conveniently ignore as he extolled the “great western empires”. European colonization of the Americas isestimatedto have killed more than 50 million people – about 10% of the world’s population at the time – and even led to a period of global cooling. The British Raj in India may havecausedthe deaths of 100 million people in the space of just 40 years. The German and Spanish empires were responsible for genocides against theHerero, Namaand theTaino, respectively.Yet, today, the Trump administration wants all of this memory-holed. “We do not want our allies to be shackled by guilt and shame,” Rubio told his audience in Munich. “We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilization, and who, together with us, are willing and able to defend it.”The gaslighting from Rubio was a sight to behold: the son of Cuban immigrants, whose grandfather wasonce deportedfrom the United States, pushing far-right, white-nationalist talking points about“civilizational erasure”. The one-time Republican party presidential candidate, who used to denounce Trump as a“con artist”and a“lunatic”, now urging European governments to get behind the belligerent US president. A former US senator, who spent years pushingvotes and billsto undermine the United Nations, now chastising the UN for having failed to prevent the bloodbath in Gaza.Imagine if the Chinese foreign minister had given a speech attacking the UN and the “abstractions of international law”. Imagine if the Russian foreign minister had delivered an address defending imperial pillage and plunder. European elites would have gone into a meltdown. But when Rubio finished his prepared remarks, in which he also bragged about (illegally) bombing “radical Shia clerics” in Iran and (illegally) abducting a “narco-terrorist dictator” in Venezuela, more than half the room in Munich stood to applaud him.Did they not realize that they may have been clapping for their own demise? That despite Rubio’s gentler tone and polished language, despite all his talk of transatlantic comity and unity, he was advocating for a geopolitics of vicious authoritarianism. That Rubio may be good cop to Trump’s bad, but their goal is one and the same: to make empire great again.And it wasn’t just what Rubio said. It’s what he didn’t say. His3,000-word speechcontained not one word about Russia, not one word about China, and, perhaps crucially for his audience in western Europe, not one word about … Greenland.Yes,Greenland. The world’s largest island which, despite being a territory of the kingdom of Denmark, an EU member state, is coveted by the president of the United States. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said on Saturday that Trump is still intent on acquiring Greenland. “I think the desire from the US president is exactly the same,” Frederiksentold reportersin Munich, on the same day Rubio gave his speech at the conference. “He’s very serious about this.”Yes, he is. Astonishingly, Trump hasrefused to rule outthe use of military force against Denmark, a Nato ally. He hasdismissedconcerns about international borders and national sovereignty. And, this weekend, he sent his secretary of state to a conference in Europe that was supposed to be about collective security to deliver a speech that amounted to: America must dominate. Trump must lead. And Europe must get onboard –or else.Again, I cannot emphasize this enough: European officials actually stood up in Munich and applauded a US official praising empire, while serving a US administration whose stated foreign policy goals include the imperial seizure ofEuropean territory.Have they lost their minds?The Europeans in that audience may have told themselves that they were applauding a return to stability and even friendship with the United States.In reality, they were offering a standing ovation for the return of something much uglier, bloodier and more dangerous.Empire.And this time, it may not stop at Europe’s own borders.Mehdi Hasan is the editor-in-chief and CEO ofZeteoExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionMarco RubioUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The 1980 landslide election of Ronald Reagan, who clinched the presidency with a whopping 489 electoral college votes against Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, swiftly pulled the Democratic party to the right in the political and cultural wave of the “Reagan Revolution”.For those Democratic constituents left behind, however, a challenge was mounting, mostly within US industrial cities whose economies were ransacked by Reagan’s “trickle-down” economics. Recordtax cutsfor the wealthy had come at the expense of a contracted social safety net, thus exacerbating inequality and collapsing much of the working class into the poor. Grassroots resistance campaigns spawned across the country in response to this dire urban crisis that had disproportionately devastated African Americans, and between 1982 and 1984 they had registered 2 million new Black voters – the largest gain in registered Black voters since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader, dies aged 84Read moreThese hands-on voter registration drives were orchestrated much in part by RevJesse Jackson, the nationally known civil rights activist whodiedon Tuesday. Jackson had cut his teeth as one of Martin Luther King Jr’s youngest and most charismatic lieutenants in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and throughout thecivil rights movement. By the 1970s, in the wake of King’s assassination, Jackson had transferred the movement’s master-classes in strategic organizing into founding Operation Push, a populist leftist offshoot of the SCLC that coalesced progressive whites, LGBTQ+ communities, environmentalists, Asian Americans, Indigenous Nations, Latinos, anti-war activists and labor unions. Jackson led discussions with leadership across the country about the prospect for a national Black-backed progressive movement that could map a viable path to a Democratic nomination for president.Like many African Americans, Jackson felt utterly betrayed by much of the Democratic party’s abandonment of socially progressive issues, democratic socialist economics and capitulation to Reagan’s unchecked far-right neocon policies, which openly set out to undo the social and legislative gains of the civil rights movement. With a bloc of 2 million new voters, however, Jackson, who earned a reputation as Washington DC’s “shadow senator”, also knew that Black communities held the margin of victory for democratic primaries in their hands. He knew that that power could not be given away to white Democratic candidates who often made an about-face into center-right politics in their general races.View image in fullscreenJesse Jackson during his second campaign for US president in 1988.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianJackson gathered a group of Black political strategists including Walter Fauntroy, a DC congressman and founding member of the Congressional Black caucus; Rev Joseph Lowery, famed civil rights leader and SCLC co-founder; and professor Ron Walters, the noted University of Maryland political scientist to assemble the “People’s Platform”, a bulleted mandate of reforms that called for increased corporate taxes, decreased military spending, single-payer universal healthcare and fair wage policies.The People’s Platform did more than identify the vision for Jackson’s National Rainbow Coalition of leftist populists. For Walters, who would go on to serve as Jackson’s chief campaign adviser, it was a tactical political yardstick by which Democratic candidates could be measured in order to garner Black support. The platform strategy, which Walters explained as “dependent leverage”, set out to force white liberals into picking up the Black-backed political platform instead of putting Black support behind whiteDemocratsand hoping to get Black demands heard.By the fall of 1983, however, Jackson knew that dependent leverage fell short of the more immediate political force ofindependentleverage, which didn’t rely on awaiting concessions, but rather withheld Black support by running Black candidates who challenged white Democrats’ strongholds in the primaries. It was Jackson’s acute insight into the efficacy of independent leverage as a movement strategy that birthed his historic 1984 presidential bid.On 3 November 1983, he gathered his “rainbow” of diverse supporters into a Washington DC convention center and announced his run, becoming the first major Black candidate for president and only the second since the small, grassroots run in 1972 of Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who joined him on stage. The announcement was riding a lightning rod of Black political momentum.That same month, as a result of the Voting Rights Act of 1982, which protected the rights of racial and ethnic minorities to draw “majority-minority congressional districts”, the largest US cities elected a full suite of Black mayors including Chicago’s Harold Washington, Philadelphia’s Wilson Goode, Birmingham’s Richard Arrington, and Charlotte’s Harvey Gantt. Many of these party newcomers were alumni student activists of the Freedom movement who, by the 1990s, would expand Black mayoral power into Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland and Newark, eliciting the rallying cry from Jackson that“our time has come.”Jesse Jackson: ‘The gated community does not protect you from the pandemic’Read moreJackson envisioned his run with its electrifying “Run Jesse Run!” slogan as a front and center means to“confront liberals with liberators”and steer mainstream politics toward “the moral center of racial justice, gender equality, and peace”. He successfully shifted Black politics and leftist coalition building from the sidecar of the Democratic party and into the driver’s seat. It was Jackson’s intention to convert electoral politics into a spotlight for larger issues of Black families, inequality and economics. His flame for unapologetic progressivism was fueled by Black dissatisfaction with both Reagan and the mainstream Democrats who chased his constituents by dismissing low-income urbanites and communities of color as “special interests”.For the Black managerial and professional class, Reagan’s opposition to affirmative action presented a direct threat to the anti-discriminatory private sector policies that had more than doubled their ranks since the 1970s. For the Black working class and unemployed, Reagan’scorrupt usheringof the crack-cocaine and mass incarceration epidemics into inner cities proved devastating alongside the obliteration of government spending on healthcare, education and job creation. Jackson took the private sphere mumblings of Black dissent from barbershops and church basements to the public podium of campaign stops and convention arenas. He shined the flashlight on party practices that sought to suppress Black votes and dilute the Black voting bloc rather than answer to it.Confronted with Jackson’s formidable challenge, white candidates on the campaign trail downplayed their dependence on the Black vote, even when post-election analyses revealed that many white Democrats, especially in the south, had depended on as much as 90% of the Black vote in their victories. Newspaper columnists labeled Jackson an extremist, while even Black centrists like the then Atlanta mayor, Andrew Young, warned he would spoil the race for Democratic frontrunner and former vice-president Walter Mondale who desperately needed Black primary voters in the south to defeat Senator John Glenn. These outraged reactions were only confirmation for what Jackson defiantly proclaimed in a 1984 speech: “We [Black voters] can win without the Democratic party, but the Democratic party cannot win without us.”View image in fullscreenJesse Jackson campaigning in Winterset, Iowa, on 3 February 1988.Photograph: jean-Louis Atlan/Jean-Louis AtlanIn a run that was far more of a moral crusade than bid for office, Jackson 84 is often misunderstood as a power grab by a charismatic camera-ready activist, or a Hillary Clinton-esque glass ceiling moment meant to put Black firsts on to the major party tickets. From the outset, however, Jackson’s chief political aspiration was to hold the party accountable to those he called “the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised”, who Reaganomics and the white liberals enriched by it had left to rot.Jackson always intended to dovetail massive Black voter turnout for his run into down-ballot races for Black and leftist candidates. Cooperation up and down the ballot accomplished Jackson’s goal of exposing Democratic primary suppression of Black votes and boosted the power of Black votes in states that have held such longstanding Black blocs in congressional districts that the current Republican party cannot map a path to midterm victorieswithout redrawing them.The momentum continued into Jackson’s second bid in 1988 (he nabbed an endorsement byBernie Sanders, whose own presidential run would beinspiredby Jackson’s model), a year after which David Dinkins was elected the first Black mayor of New York and Douglas Wilder seized the first Black gubernatorial victory in Virginia.Mondale, who ignored adopting even the most minimal issues concerning Black voters, and did not campaign in Black communities until his last week, lost to Reagan in a landslide. Disillusioned by how Mondale had taken Black communities for granted as a “captured vote”, Walters, Jackson’s campaign manager, authored adetailed manualfor the steps a Black candidate would have to take to reach the White House – 21 years before Barack Obama’s historic win, where Jackson was among thousands gathered in Grant Park, Chicago, his face flooded with tears.When the Baptist minister strode to the Democratic national convention podium, head high, on 17 July 1984, no one expected him to be brief. After a drag-out defeat in the primaries, Jackson’s one-hour speech proved to be the high note for an otherwise uninspired convention. From the podium, the rousing orator addressed gay rights, Islamophobia and Native sovereignty, all threaded into his explanation for centering Black voting power in a fight for the party from within. “What does this large Black vote mean? Why do I fight to win second primaries and fight gerrymandering and annexation and at-large [elections],”he belted. “Why do we fight over that? Because I tell you, you cannot hold someone in the ditch unless you linger there with them.”Jesse Jackson – a life in picturesRead moreIt is an ethos for coalition building that reverberates into today’s leftist frustrations with a Democratic party that has also been pulled center by a hard-right administration. Many on today’s left are wondering what is to be made of the recent lightning-rod momentum churned up by the democratic socialist populist campaign of the New York City mayor,Zohran Mamdani, and gubernatorial Democratic wins inNew JerseyandVirginia. They are wondering how to hold a party accountable when it abandons its most downtrodden, expands militarism while contracting social services, and readily offers socialist policies to corporations while spurning calls for free and shared public resources from the masses.Jackson’s strategic legacy was that no vote is captive to a party that has not earned it, and that marginalized and overlooked voters are best heard when coalitions that prioritize their common social and economic stakes challenge the party where their electoral margins for victory are the most vulnerable. Jackson’s campaign was audacious because it was never really about him as a candidate but, rather for taking the reins back on an electoral process that wanted Black votes without including Black people.It was a rebellion masked as a campaign. As the Harvard political theorist Brandon Terry wrote, “Jackson’s campaigns were, at bottom, a remarkable attempt to merge symbolic and structural politics … His campaign helped refound a Democratic party whose internal corruptions and hierarchies had been the target of civil rights activism. That blend of charisma and concrete party reform is all-too-rare in American history. ” Forty-one years later, “Run Jesse Run” hasn’t run out of relevance for how those who have been historically deprived of the most power can move swiftly to reclaim it.Explore more on these topicsJesse JacksonDemocratsUS politicsCivil rights movementcommentShareReuse this content"

But lately, you’re likely to also find a half-done newspaper crossword, a ton of stationery, the book I’ve restarted three times, and whatever scraps and trinkets I’ve picked up throughout the day to put in my scrapbook.Analog is back, and it feels like we need it more than ever. In a world where getting just aboutanythingdone means being sucked into a digital black hole of apps, sign-up forms, harrowing social media feeds and carnivorous advertisers, it’s no surprise that we keep reaching back for the comfort of the physical: Polaroids, vinyl records, real birthday cards. It all helps us slow down and appreciate a world where not everything is online.This most recent return to analog has been marked by asurge in popularityof physical media and “grandma hobbies” like crosswords, knitting and crafting. Meanwhile, companies are also seeing a shift; the arts and crafts company Michael’ssaid thatsearches for “analog hobbies” on its site have gone up 136% in the last six months, while Google Trends suggests a 160% increase in searches for the same term.In an era of frictionless digital experiences, there’s something magical about obsolete technology | Tansy GardamRead moreMy own return to analog finds itself manifested in major scrapbooking projects, taking my notes by hand, converting my digital journal into a physical one, and carving out dedicated time during which my cellphone functions “like a landline” – meaning I have nothing but calls coming through that bad boy.And while I hate to prove my mother’s generation right in affirming that “life would be better if it wasn’t for all those damn screens!”, I fear they were on to something. Leaning into analog has helped me stay off my phone, forced me to be present in my activities and helped me embrace the sensory joy of it all. From rifling through my purse for a pen or taking in the smell of an old book, to seeing my own handwriting and spending time rewinding cassette tapes, interacting so intimately with the things we enjoy just feels good.The uniqueness of physical media – defects and all – adds to the thrill of experiencing things you can actually touchThe uniqueness of physical media – defects and all – adds to the thrill of experiencing things you can actually touch. I love when a vinyl has a scratch that no other one has, when an old photograph has a message written on the back, or when my crossword pages bear the markings of my failed guesses. These are the pieces that add real texture to our experiences and color to our memories.And I feel lucky that the analog life is are-discovery for me. I’ve lived long enough to have my own library of analog things, and seen how they become a time capsule – a monument to times past and the things we loved.In that way, I think one of the best parts of the analog experience is we actually get tokeepthe stuff we use. Book’s gone out of print? I still have my own signed copy. Putting on some music? Well, let me tell you the story about how I found this record at an old store that doesn’t exist any more.Yes, the digital world means less clutter and less physical waste (yay paperless!), but for all its promises of efficiency, productivity and just making life easier, the digital world leaves much to be desired. An email doesn’t hold the same emotional and tactile quality as a handwritten note from a loved one, and not even the best filters can re-create the feeling of looking at a good Polaroid. As I rebuild my own personal archive of old things, I focus on gathering stuff that I really need, and thinking carefully about how to make my new hobbies and systems as sustainable as possible.Analog media adds a layer of ownership and intimacy over our experiences of the world that is simply impossible to replicate when those experiences are mediated by a screen and via tech companies. And while we’re nowhere near a post-screen era, the appeal of analog tells me we haven’t completely lost touch with the world around us.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Now it’s turning warehouses into campsMoira DoneganThe Trump administration has bought warehouses across the US that could hold thousands. But resistance is growingTue 17 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 06.05 ESTShareThere is a vast building, reportedly the size of seven football fields, inSurprise, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix; ICE bought it for $70m. Another building, along the southern border in San Antonio, Texas, was valued at $37m; it’s 640,000 sq ft. In January, ICE bought a warehouse inUpper Bern Township, Pennsylvania, not far outside of Philadelphia, for $87.4m. InWilliamsport, Maryland, outside Hagerstown, the cost of a facility on a nearly 54-acre plot was $102m.These are massive, industrial spaces, built for holding goods to be shipped elsewhere. Warehouses are drafty and difficult to heat, hard-floored and high-ceilinged, not meant for human habitation. But the Trump administration is aiming to convert them into vast detention camps for immigrants. Some of the buildings could house as many as9,000 peopleat a time. The rapid slew of new warehouse purchases by deportation agencies brings to mind the words of the ICE director,Todd Lyons, who told a conference last year that he wanted the effort to operate “like Amazon Prime, for human beings”.ICE currently incarcerates about70,000 peopleon any given night, holding them across 224 detention facilities. The number has nearlydoubledover the past year. But in recent weeks, as the Trump administration looks to accelerate its mass deportation agenda, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have been scouting and purchasing huge facilities. With the$45bn in ICE fundingthat Congress appropriated in the “big, beautiful bill”, the agency now aims to use these new warehouses to capture and imprison vastly greater numbers of men, women and children.ICE-free zones and blocked liquor licenses: US cities fight back against immigration raidsRead moreThe new warehouse strategy represents an apparent shift in immigrant concentration and detention practices by the Trump administration, which has previously relied on smaller facilities. But the administration has already come under fire for the conditions in which it is housing the migrants it has captured – including those at asprawling tent facility in Fort Bliss, Texas, and in the hastily assembled “Alligator Alcatraz” tent camp in theEverglades– as well as for the unsafe, unsanitary,diseased conditions reportedin prisons like theKromedetention center in Miami and theinfamous facilityin Dilley, Texas, one ofseveralthat houseschildren. “These kids are very traumatized, many of them despondent and depressed,”said the US representative Joaquin Castroafter visiting Dilley.Still, the extent of the abuses inside ICE’s detention camps is not well understood, in part because the Department of Homeland Security has taken steps to limit oversight. ICE hasrepeatedly refusedmembers of Congress access to the facilities, in defiance of the law, and has gone to court to prevent House members from visiting the camps as they are entitled to do. It is worth asking what the DHS is trying to hide.Reporters, too, have managed only partial, sporadic and limited access to information about what is happening in the camps, though some immigrants imprisoned there have tried to make their suffering known: in California, one captive inside the Otay Mesa detention facility wrote a note detailing allegations of widespread illness and inadequate food inside. “It’s cold here, the food is very poor, for 290 [days] we haven’t eaten a single piece of fruit,” they wrote. “We’re in one big room with no doors or windows. We can’t see any grass or trees. We’re constantly sick.” To smuggle their account of life in the detention center to the outside world, the prisoner tied their note toa lotion bottleand threw it over the camp fence.The Trump administration is seeking to expand and intensify its archipelago of tortureMerriam-Websterdefines a concentration camp as “a place where large numbers of people (such as prisoners of war, political prisoners, refugees, or the members of an ethnic or religious minority) are detained or confined under armed guard”. By that definition, ICE already operates a sprawling network of concentration camps where captured immigrants, the largest group of whom havecommitted no crime, are housed in what countless accounts describe as inhumane conditions, designed to degrade, hurt, sicken and punish them, despite Trump administrationclaims that ICE facilitiesare held to “national detention standards”. With its new warehouse purchases, the Trump administration is seeking to expand and intensify this archipelago of torture. Mass illness, abuse, immiseration and death will be the inevitable result. How will we live with the shame?To their credit, many local communities in areas surrounding the newly purchased warehouses are organizing swiftly and powerfullyagainst the camps, objecting to them on moral grounds. Protests have erupted, with locals packing municipal government meetings and picketing in the streets, expressing outrage at the building purchases and pressuring local officials to try to block the facilities. They have had some help from Democratic elected officials. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Marylandjoined a large protestagainst the proposed Hagerstown camp, andsaidthe facility would “further fuel the Trump administration’s cruel and inhumane immigration agenda”.Erin Mendenhall, the Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, sent a letter to the owners of a warehouse ICE was considering on the outskirts of her town to warn them that any use by ICE would violate local ordinances; she has called ICE’s aggressive and violent enforcement operations in other cities “utterly deplorable”.In Kansas City, a Democratic county legislator, Manny Abarca, uploadeda videoonline that showed federal officers harassing him in his car when he went to inspect a local facility that was being considered as a potential ICE camp. After the video went viral, the local city council overwhelmingly passed a six-year moratorium on approvals for detention facilities. “They need to understand that you are not going to sell out our community for short-term profit,” one council membersaid.Increasingly, the camps are being opposed even by Republicans, and even by those who do not seem to hold a principled opposition to the Trump administration’s mass ethnic cleansing agenda. David Holt, the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City, met with the owners of a warehouse close to a largely Latino school district that had been targeted for acquisition by ICE, and succeeded in getting the property holders to back out of a deal with the DHS. “I commend the owners for their decision and thank them on behalf of the people of Oklahoma City,” Holtsaid in a statement. “As Mayor, I ask that every single property owner in Oklahoma City exhibit the same concern for our community in the days ahead.” Even Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi – hardly a softhearted immigration dove concerned with human rights –wrote to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, to ask the agency to back off plans to open a camp in his state. “I support the enforcement of immigration law,” he emphasized, but said that the detention center would strain the local economy and infrastructure.He is not opposing the detention center out of the goodness of his heart: he is opposing it because of the vast opposition, both locally and nationwide, to the network of camps that theTrump administrationis building. Those who want to spend taxpayer money and insult American values to pursue this project of mass concentration and ethnic cleansing are relying on non-immigrant Americans to be deferential, quiet and scared in the face of what is being done to their migrant friends and neighbors. This is one small ember of hope for this country: it is not working.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionUS immigrationTrump administrationUS prisonsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

In his first term as president, hewithdrew the USfrom the World Health Organization (WHO) on 6 July 2020, giving the necessary one-year notice period. Soon after, Joe Biden was elected, and he reversed this executive order within days of being in office, reinstating the US support for the agency on 20 January 2021. While many hoped this would be the end of the story, Trump came back with a vengeance in his second term and immediatelysigned an executive orderwithdrawing on 20 January 2025.This means that – buried under news of other Trump-related chaos – the US formally left the WHO at the end of last month. It is just the second time in the agency’s history a major power has left. In 1949, during the cold war, theUSSR withdrewciting unhappiness with the US influence over the organisation. In 1956, with concerns over disease surveillance and spread, the USSR re-engaged with the UN system.Trump’s justifications for leaving the WHO are similar toNigel Farage’s attackson the agency. First, that the WHO forced countries into lockdowns during Covid-19. This makes no sense. The WHO is a member-state body which has no legal authority to impose lockdowns, domestic public-health measures or really make countries do anything they don’t want to. Lockdowns were decisions taken by national governments, and them alone.Another Trump claim is that the WHO is not independent. I would suggest the WHO istooindependent, which is why it’s being punished. A senior WHO staff member told me that it had been pressed to align with the Maga talking points on the links between vaccines and autism, and paracetamol in pregnancy and autism, as well as climate-change denialism. When the agency pushed back that this wasn’t scientifically accurate, it was reprimanded. The WHO has alsopushed back against pressurefrom Israel to stay quiet on the Gaza genocide and destruction of hospitals, and from Russia on the Ukraine war. To maintain credibility beyond short political cycles, the WHO must remain scientifically independent even if it costs it favour with certain leaders.New York City and Illinois join WHO network after Trump pulls US out of global health bodyRead moreHaving studied the WHO (andcowritten a bookon it), it is bizarre to watch the US government attacking the very agency it has been the architect and champion of for years. The entire UN system was premised on the idea that cooperation across countries could prevent collective catastrophes like the second world war. US leadership has been central to global campaigns against smallpox, polio, HIV/Aids and reducing child mortality. Financially, too, the US has been thesingle largest contributorto the WHO, through assessed contributions and voluntary funding tied to specific programmes.Prior to Trump, US leadership in global health had been bipartisan and supported by the public, from the Global Fund to Fight HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (championed by Bill Clinton) and thePresident’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief(championed by George W Bush) to Barack Obama’s response to the west AfricaEbola outbreak. Compare this with today: when I contacted several US academics about this topic, none wanted to speak on the record out of fear of losing their research funding or jobs.Where does this leave us? Fortunately, the WHO embarked on financial reforms that mean it is less dependent on US funding and able to maintain core functions. The agency has secured85% of the fundingit needs for the 2026/27 budget, and is confident it can raise the remaining 15%. This still leaves a leadership vacuum in global health, which the EU and key countries such as Germany are trying to fill in the hope of keeping multilateralism alive. We have China and Russia increasing their bilateral ties to low-income countries, tying together global health aid with their influence. And we have health threats such as the H5N1 variant of bird flu, antimicrobial resistance and continual disease outbreaks requiring rapid information-sharing and coordinated response.The US government knows this. I am told that in all practical ways, Trump’s leadership team is still engaging with the agency privately, while lambasting it publicly. This plays to his Maga base who need a foreign enemy to attack, while also ensuring the US has the necessary global intel on health risks that the WHO holds. Yet again, Trump says one thing publicly while doing the opposite privately. In another “emperor has no clothes” moment, the real story is that the US government is more dependent on the WHO than vice versa. That’s a wise lesson for the British public to learn before following Farage down a self-destructive anti-WHO path.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsWorld Health OrganizationOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet Europe’s digital sovereignty is an achievable goalTue 17 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 12.06 ESTShareThe French judgeNicolas Guillouknows exactly how deep Europe’s dependence on US tech is. Guillou and hiscolleaguesat the international criminal court are under US sanctions. They can no longer use e-commerce, book hotels online or hire a car. Their home smart devices ignore them. Credit cards from European banks no longer function, because Europe hasstill not developedits own EU-wide payments system, so most electronic purchases go through Visa and Mastercard. Converting euros to foreign currencies is extraordinarily difficult because everything passes through dollars. Living in Europe is no protection against Donald Trumpbrickingyour digital life.This dependence is not limited to mod-cons. Last year, the chairman of the Danish parliament’s defence committeesaid that he regrettedhis part in Denmark’s decision to buy US-made F-35 fighter jets: “I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse. Buying American weapons is a security risk that we can not run.” He is not alone. Spain hasabandonedplans to buy F-35s.Perhaps the danger should have been clear a decade ago when it wasrevealedthat US spies routinely record the phone calls of millions of Europeans andbug the phones of European leaders. But across Europe, governments, militaries, businesses, doctors, professors and teenagers alike continued to trust US technology. Sensitive state policies are drafted in Microsoft software. Health and tax records live on Amazon’s servers. Important decisions are made over video systems run by Microsoft, Cisco or Zoom. Young Europeans view the world through a lens distorted by Snapchat filters and YouTubealgorithms. Europe’s news organisations rely on Google ad auctions.Despite all this, Europe possesses a path to digital sovereignty. Loosening the US grip on the word processing, video conferencing and “enterprise software” that companies rely upon is not technically difficult. As veteran tech investor Roger McNamee told me, most of this tech was perfected in the 1990s and 2000s and has since become “enshittified” due to monopoly effects. Investorsare selling softwarestocks because they fear these products can be too easily built by new coding large language models. Now is a good time for Europe to build better.Austria’s military has alreadydumpedMicrosoft and moved to open-source services hosted in Europe, and some German regional governments have done the same. Danish schools were told toabandon Googlelaptopsby the Danish data protection authority in 2024. The new Dutch government saysdigital sovereigntywill be a national priority. France has moved its 5.7 million public sector workers toVisio, an alternative to Zoom developed by the government, running on French infrastructure. And the European Commissionis buildinga system based on Matrix, a European open-source technology that enables communication across different apps and servers, without surrendering control of conversations to a single company.But Europe’s real tech challenges lie deeper. First, each of the 27 countries in the EU has its own ways of doing business and its own particular legal requirements. Even though the European market is huge (450 million consumers), startups never reach critical mass because it is too difficult for them to operate across Europe. TheIMF estimatesthat cross-border friction inside the EU is equivalent to a 110% tariff. This, as areportby the former Italian prime minister, Enrico Letta, details, kills everything from consumer tech to cloud infrastructure in the cradle.Despite identifying this problem decades ago, EU countrieshave been unwillingto sacrifice national practices and disappoint domestic lobbies that benefit from the status quo.That may now finally change after thepotentially momentous agreementby EU leaders last week to make Europe “one market”,and to “buy European”in strategically important sectors such as defence, space, clean tech and AI.A second challenge is that European startups cannot get the kind of investment and initial public offerings enjoyed in the US because Europe’s capital market is also an untidy mess of national markets. This may change soon, too, with a union-wide financingsystemin the works, to unlock€10tnsitting in savings accounts for investment.The final challenge is that Europe’s governments may not have the necessary political resolve to defend the continent. When faced with the threat to seize Greenland, did they finally take a tough line with Trump at Davos in January? It is at least as likely that it was his own treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, fearing the damage to the dollar from a retaliatory trade war, who convinced the US president to back down.Butpollingafter the Greenland crisis shows that most western Europeans (including people in the UK) don’t want more US influence. They want more Europe. They want more powers and decision-making at EU level, too.Some leaders, such asFriedrich Merz and Giorgia Meloniwant to achieve economic transformation bycutting regulationand watering down EU standards across the board. Butrather than dilute its data laws, Europe should start to enforce them rigorously, to finally break the chokehold that Google, Microsoft and Amazon have over the European market.The US tech sector looks like an asset now, but it is also a potential liability, because of its sheer dominance of the US economy, and because Trump’s voters do not share his love for it. Europe canattackthat vulnerability, and in doing so shatter Trump’s support.For now, though, Europe still outsources the machinery and plumbing of its democracy, commerce and military to US tech firms. This has, in effect, handed Trump a kill switch that Europeans should fear.Before the US president makes his next demand, before his agents further undermine Europe’s democracy, the leaders of Europe should make clear that they will not fall on their knees. They will rise. And build.Johnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil LibertiesExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionEuropean UnionComputingDonald TrumpInternetE-commerceGooglecommentShareReuse this content"

McEwan and his ilk will be even more perplexed then that even those guzzling from their Stanley Cups throughout the day are being told they arestillnot sufficiently hydrating themselves.Influencers are telling their followers they“don’t understand what hydration is”if they’re not adding electrolytes such as sodium and chloride (salt) as well as magnesium and potassium to their water to help their cells “hold on to and use” it. Often spruiking thesachets wellness companies are selling, they claim these fancy salt formulations are essential to avoiding migraines and muscle cramps, anxiety and mood swings. Some TikTokers areadding sachetsalongside other ingredients such as coloured ice cubes, edible glitter and fruit into the aforementioned massive cup in a trend known as“loaded water”.But what do the experts say – is plain old water not good enough any more?What role do electrolytes play in hydration?Our bodies are mostly made of water, which can be found both inside and outside cells (including in our blood), and in the space between the two. Electrolytes play a biological role controlling the flow of where the water molecules get shifted in and out of cells within the body, explains Associate Prof Ricardo Costa, the director of research at Monash University’s department of nutrition dietetics and food.Breathwork has its uses – but when it comes to ‘unlocking your fullest human potential’, beware the puffery | AntiviralRead moreBut electrolytes such as sodium don’t play a big role in hydration status, Costa says. Studies have shown that only when people consume a large amount of salt does it help retain water in the blood for hydration purposes – but thatcarries the risk of adverse health implications for blood pressure, he says.Other nutrients, including carbohydrates and proteins are actually more important than electrolytes in keeping your body hydrated, Costa says. “Everyone is obsessed with electrolytes – that possibly comes from half a decade of potential misinformation.”Do you need more electrolytes?The average person does not need to be adding electrolytes to their water, says Associate Prof Kagan Ducker, who co-leads the thermal physiology laboratory at Curtin University. “Our diet tends to provide the vast majority of our electrolyte needs for the day.”Athletes are “one of the more extreme cases of changes in hydration status”, he says. They might use sports drinks and electrolyte solutions when sweating a lot while exercising for longer durations, and to recover quickly if they are training or competing again soon. “For most people (including many athletes) that won’t be an issue.”Dr Fiona Willer, the president of Dietitians Australia, says if someone is vomiting or has diarrhoea they can also benefit from a slight increase in speed of absorption of water into the system. But she agrees that “for the vast majority of Australians who are just living day-to-day without doing anything super extreme, they’re an example of another unnecessary product on our shelves”.Gut check: are at-home microbiome tests a way to ‘hack your health’ or simply a waste? | AntiviralRead moreThe body is very good at keeping a check on the salt concentration of the blood, Willer says. “It’s the kidneys that make sure that there is enough salt in the system and enough of those other solutes to keep your blood pressure adequate to keep you alive. If you’re eating regular foods you get more than enough sodium in order for your kidneys to do the rest of the work.”Electrolytes can be found in fruits and vegetables, grain food and meat, she says.The body regulates electrolytes in a controlled manner, Costa agrees. When he analysed the blood plasma of people consuming different levels of salt, the study found the array of electrolytes was constant but the sodium in urine and sweat increased proportionally. “If you take more electrolytes, the body’s going to get rid of it.”What if you want to improve your hydration?“Certainly we do need to remember to hydrate,” Willer says. In general, Australians are slightly under-hydrated, observational studies show.“The best gauge of whether you’re adequately hydrated is to have a look in the toilet bowl once you’ve done a wee. If it is apale straw colour, not terribly bright (unless you’ve had multivitamins) that is good,” Willer says. “If it’s quite dark or verging on orangey brown, you need to get a bit more fluid in.”Electrolytes won’t change the colour of your urine, Willer says.If someone is concerned about their hydration, Kagan recommends they can contact anaccredited practising dietitianor their GP, or aSports Dietitians Australiaaccredited professional if they engage in strenuous work or exercise.Natasha May is a health reporter for Guardian AustraliaAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Under Keir Starmer, the group’s anointed torchbearer, Labour had a double-digit lead in the polls. Morgan McSweeney, the man who built Labour Together, was preparing Starmer for government with great hopes ofcleaning up politics. Now McSweeney is out of a job, Labour Together ismired in controversyand Starmer faces urgent questions about what he knew and when.Stories began appearing about Labour Together’s funding around November 2023. The most damaging, in a detailed report by Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, showed how, between 2017 and 2020, McSweeney hadfailed to declare £730,000in political donations to the organisation. The group attributed this to administrative error.But the story didn’t end there. Earlier this month Khadija Sharife and Irevealed on Democracy for Salethat Labour Together, when it was led by now government minister Josh Simons in 2023, hired a PR firm calledAPCO Worldwideto investigate the “sourcing, funding and origins” of the story and to dig dirt on journalists at the Sunday Times and elsewhere who were reporting its undeclared funding. APCO was paid £36,000 to dig up this dirt. The work was led by former Sunday Times journalist Tom Harper, who suggested, without evidence, that the journalists’ reporting may have originated in a leak orchestrated by Russia or China. Labour Together did not keep these insinuations to itself. It passed some of APCO’s material to the security services, raising serious questions about whether public authorities were drawn into an effort to discredit legitimate journalism.After closing ranks and apparently hoping that the story would go away, now Labour has been forced to respond. Starmer says that APCO’s work for Labour Together “absolutely needs to be looked into”. Simons, meanwhile,has said: “I was surprised and shocked to read the report extended beyond the contract by including unnecessary information on Gabriel Pogrund. I asked for this information to be removed before passing the report to GCHQ.” The Cabinet Office has reportedly launched aninformal inquiry. Excuse my scepticism, but this all looks a lot like marking your own homework. How can the Cabinet Office investigate Labour Together hiring a PR firm to smear journalists when the person who commissioned the work, Simons, is himself a Cabinet Office minister in Starmer’s government?When pressed, science secretary Liz Kendall pointed out that the “relevant regulatory body” – the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) – was also looking into the issue. But this is a nonsense. The PRCA will be looking into APCO, notLabourTogether – and it is a voluntary industry association, not a statutory regulator. When it comes to PR firms and private intelligence contractors, meaningful oversight barely exists.This scandal cuts to the heart of No 10. As we revealed on Democracy for Sale at the weekend, when APCO was hired, its London office was run by Kate Forrester, a Labour Together adviser whose husband was Starmer’s head of communications at the time. (Paul Ovenden was later forced to resignfrom government after offensive messages he had sent about Diane Abbott emerged.)We know that Starmer’s right-hand man McSweeneywas awareof APCO’s work; and that Starmer himself took a keen interest in journalists and media coverage during his ascent to power. Given all this, the prime minister’s claims on Monday that he “didn’t know anything” seem increasingly hard to square with the public record.The journalists targeted by APCO were not simply writing negative stories. They were uncovering a crucial and largely unnoticed fact about Starmer’s rise: that his leadership campaign had benefited from hundreds of thousands of pounds in undeclared funding. This money mattered. It paid for detailed polling and analysis of Labour members during the final years of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. McSweeney used this data to construct Starmer as the candidate best positioned to win. Had Labour Together’s funders – including businessman Trevor Chinn and hedge fund manager Martin Taylor – been publicly known at the time, the campaign’s carefully cultivated image of Labour unity could easily have fractured.Senior figures now in government, including cabinet ministers such as Steve Reed and Lisa Nandy, were involved in Labour Together at the time. The Electoral Commission eventuallyfined the organisation £14,250for multiple breaches of election law. But, in part because of APCO’s well-paid efforts to smear and discredit journalists, the story never fully broke through. Labour Together used the firm’s material to suggest it had been the victim of a Kremlin hack, successfully shifting attention away from its own conduct.This episode raises broader questions. London is the global centre of the private intelligence industry, worth areported £15bn a year. Its activities remain almost entirely opaque. APCO’s work for Labour Together only became public because of a rare leak. Without it, we would know nothing.How many other journalists have been targeted like this? How many political organisations have quietly hired private intelligence and PR firms to dig dirt on critics, identify sources and shape narratives? As Jon Cruddas, a co-founder of Labour Together,put it to me: “This is dark shit.”WhenStarmer came to power promising to clean up politics, he wrote in the Guardian that journalism is “the lifeblood of democracy”. But we now know that the vehicle that powered his rise, populated by his key people, ran an orchestrated campaign to smear journalists. Simons – the person who commissioned APCO – is still a minister in Starmer’s government.Simons’ position is surely untenable now. But Starmer needs to go further than just dismissing a single minister. Either he commissions an independent inquiry now – and answers urgent questions about what he himself knew, and when, about this tawdry affair – or he too becomes implicated in what will be seen as a continued, and increasingly unsustainable, cover-up. So everyone – and particularly all of us journalists – will learn much from what he decides to do next.Peter Geoghegan runs the investigative websiteDemocracy for SaleDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Speak to angry voters in Gorton and Denton and it all becomes clearOwen JonesI had so many conversations with people fed up with all the chaos, deceit and U-turns. Politics must respond to this disenchantmentTue 17 Feb 2026 05.03 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 08.08 ESTShareYou can feel Labour’s electoral coalition fraying in the cold, rain-soaked streets of south-east Manchester. With nine days to go now until the historicbyelection in Gorton and Denton, one thing unites these otherwise diverse communities: a visceral contempt for the prime minister.Mention Keir Starmer’s name and people laugh: not with affection but disbelief, as though it’s faintly absurd to treat him as a serious topic of conversation. “He just doesn’t stick to his word,” says a middle-aged woman walking her dog, stressing that her real feelings would be impolite to print.And it is hard to argue with her, not least as Starmer’s government reels again afteryet another head-spinning, chaotic U-turn– this time forced upon him by Nigel Farage and Reform. A plan to delay local elections abandoned in humiliating fashion, not because the PM realised it was the wrong thing to do, but because Farage raised a legal challenge and Starmer knew he would lose it.“He says he’s going to do something and then doesn’t,” the dog walker says. Her view is widely shared:according to YouGov, six in 10 Britons believe Starmer is untrustworthy, with just two in 10 believing the opposite.These are the fruits of a political project crafted by Morgan McSweeney,Starmer’s recently departed chief of staff. It was smart politics, he clearly believed, to mislead the Labour membership into voting for him six years ago by offering leftwing policy pledges and then abandoning them. But the founding sin became the defining trait: voters routinely perceive this government to be innately deceitful and duplicitous.Walk the streets of Gorton and Denton now and the resulting draining of trust is easily discernible. Labourtook half the votehere in 2024. Now its coalition is splintering in two directions at once: towards Zack Polanski’s Greens on the populist left, and Nigel Farage’s Reform UK on the Trumpian nationalist right.Commentators like to divide the constituency neatly in two: younger, more diverse Gorton; older, whiter, more working-class Denton. There are certainly an astonishing number ofGreen partyposters and garden stakes in Gorton, while union jacks are more visible in Denton.People don’t always fit into neat boxes, though. An older woman in Denton voices her grievances about “illegal migrants” taking jobs and then tells me she’s voting for the Green candidate,local plumber Hannah Spencer. A white man in his 70s uses his thick Mancunian accent to denounce Rachel Reeves for what he sees as a vendetta against pensioners – and says he too will back the leftwing insurgents.View image in fullscreenReform UK’s byelection candidate, Matt Goodwin, speaks at hustings at St Peter’s church in Levenshulme, 12 February 2026.Photograph: Mark Waugh/The GuardianSpencer is bullish about Denton. Reform tend to “assume that white working-class communities all think and act in one and the same way,” she says, “and that we don’t care about each other. I think they’ve really, really underestimated how much people actually do care about having a place for everyone to live.”Yet while the constituency is saturated with anger and disillusionment, that anger expresses itself in very different ways. For those drifting to Reform’s candidate,Matt Goodwin, immigration is almost always the first grievance voiced. A middle-aged woman is voting for Reform because “Britain seems full with immigrants at the moment, and there’s not enough houses”. Her three sons, she complains, cannot even get on the council-house waiting list.Here is how rightwing populism feeds on the wreckage of a broken economic model. People are left feeling trapped in a zero-sum game: if only there were fewer foreigners, there would be more homes, more jobs, more security for them. But tens of thousands are trapped on council-house waiting lists because thestock has been flogged offand not replaced. She notes, entirely reasonably, that flats are going up “everywhere you look in Manchester”, but assumes they are for refugees – when the real problem is that expensive flats are being built that local people cannot afford.Whether the Greens can defeat the rightwing populist answer to popular grievances depends on a mostly youthful army of activists. The party claims it knocked on 11,000 doors on Saturday alone – roughly a quarter of households here. But its rise has been sudden; it has little historic infrastructure in the seat and is building from nearly scratch. “The main thing is that nobody is voting Labour,” says longtime resident and activistAlly Fogg. “It’s become almost impossible to find a Labour voter anywhere.”It is certainly a struggle to findLabourvoters here. I do find one party loyalist, who argues the media hold Starmer to a harsher standard than they did his Conservative predecessors. Even he, however, is wavering: he will decide on polling day which candidate is best placed to stop Reform.Labour remains bullish about its prospects, although this byelection upends normal expectations management. Normally, you do down your chances to motivate your voters, but if you’re competing with another progressive party, a different calculation applies. If its vote has not collapsed, then it will be down to a new “shy Labour voter” – that is, like Tory supporters before them, a reluctance to admit your voting intentions because of the stigma attached.What is undeniable is that even the party’s remaining grassroots struggles to articulate a coherent purpose. A cheerful canvasser from Bradford tells me “equality” is a core Labour value. When I ask which policies embody that, she falters.Party briefings insist support is holding among local Muslim voters, despite fury over British complicity in Israel’s war in Gaza. Leftwing activist Farrukh Haroon dismisses that claim out of hand. “Their vote has tanked,” he says. Labour treated Muslim communities as “voting fodder” and “colonial subjects” – but, he argues, “that has been broken.”What should really frighten anyone invested in the future of democracy is the level of angry disengagement on display here. Some of those I spoke to made clear they had given up on voting: that they now had a solidified contempt towards any politicians. These are citizens that the Greens’ brand of populism has yet to convince.After so many years of living standards and public services in crisis, the hope that sustained so many people has shrivelled. There is frustration, some apathy, but most obviously despair – and if that despair hardens, it could carry this country into far darker territory. Once trust has been eroded, as is evident here, no one can be sure what happens next.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsByelectionsOpinionLocal politicsManchesterLabourReform UKGreen partyGreater ManchestercommentShareReuse this content"

Emerald Fennell has got it all wrongRhiannon Lucy CosslettBy turning the novel into just a corset-heaving love story, the director has stripped it of what made it so boundary-pushingTue 17 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 05.30 ESTShareIt’s difficult, when watching Emerald Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights”, not to imagine what Emily Brontë would have made of it. Before I get into it, I feel obliged to state that although I love the book I am not a purist. I often relish creative reinterpretations of classics. Admittedly, this one came with a fair few red flags, from the casting of Margot Robbie (simply too old, Cathy is a teenager) and Jacob Elordi (simply too white, Heathcliff, while his origins are uncertain, is described as darker skinned) to the unhinged marketing and crassbrand tie-ins.Nevertheless, I was still excited to see it. So why did I leave the cinema not only bored, but feeling a little bit sad? Fennell said she wanted to make the film she imagined at 14, the age at which many of us read the novel in English class. Fennell focuses almost entirely on the “love story” at the expense of almost all of the novel’s other themes. Of course, if you’re a teenager in love, the doomed connection between Cathy and Heathcliff does captivate, although as an abuser who hangs a dog, Heathcliff is not exactly fanciable. I do understand the impulse behind Fennell’s fan-fictiony desire to have them consummate their love, when Brontë, who probably never touched a man her entire life, left all that desire unrealised. Horniness at the expense of all else, however, can feel terribly hollow.Even at 14, most students understand that the novel is not really a love story, let alone “the greatest love story of all time”, and is about far more besides. Namely: revenge, class struggle, power, whiteness, the violence of a system that worships it and generational trauma. Heathcliff is a child, likely of foreign origin, who is plucked from the streets of Liverpool by Cathy’s father, only to be horribly neglected and abused and, he thinks, rejected by Cathy – because of his poverty and his brownness. He spends the second half of the novel exacting his revenge on the next generation of Earnshaws and Lintons. Whatever Heathcliff’s origins,Wuthering Heightsis a novel about racism, power, abuse and its legacy.When asked about thecasting of a white actor, Fennell said: “You can only make the movie that you sort of imagined yourself when you read it.” It felt telling to me that she couldn’t imagine a dark-skinned actor even though he is described as a “gypsy” and a “lascar” in the book. That Fennell, at 14, was living a life of privilege cannot go unmentioned. I think it’s part of why I left the cinema feeling so downcast. I am tired of consuming art by people whose understanding of class struggle is limited to the paranoid notion that the rest of us are all plotting to topple them. Fennell showcased this worldviewfirst in Saltburnand now with her version of Nelly Dean, whose machinations destroy Cathy and Heathcliff’s love, and whose cruel inaction causes Cathy’s death. The director’s nod in the film to Romeo and Juliet and how its tragic outcome is essentially caused by servants feels almost like a tacit acknowledgment of this idea. You just can’t get the staff.There’s something outrageous about the stripping away of the politics of Wuthering Heights, but not in the rage-baiting way that I think the director intended. Class and racial inequality aren’t just themes you learn about in English class, something to be dispensed with in favour of zeitgeisty BDSM, fish fingering and boarding-school pranks with eggs. They are the mood music of life, a barrier many teenagers are already wrestling with. As for the violent abuse of Isabella, Fennell makes her complicit in a game of BDSM and plays her for laughs. In the novel, a pregnant Isabella escapes Healthcliff’s abuse, throwing her wedding ring in the fire – a groundbreaking decision by Brontë at a time when women were the legal property of their husbands.Every generation gets the Wuthering Heights it deserves. And Emerald Fennell’s is for the always-online | Nadia KhomamiRead moreFourteen is a formative age, one at which we feel things deeply, which is why all this feels personal. To me, studying it under a brilliant English teacher in a rough comprehensive, the class and racial dynamics of the novel were simply impossible to ignore. Reading that book is partly why I became a novelist interested in how class struggle can exist in the body, and the violence that that feeling can provoke.The real takeaway from this film, for me, is about who gets to make art, whose voice matters, and what they choose to disregard, in this creative climate. For all its attempts to be shocking, Fennell’s film has stripped away all that is radical about Wuthering Heights, and even aesthetically her attempt to out-weird a Brontë falls flat, feeling to me like a two-hour-16-minute-long perfume advertisement for watered-down eau de Tim Burton. The novel’s stranger, more gothic aspects – the ghost, the digging up of Cathy’s grave – the products of the mind of a young writer whose life had been tragically marred by consumption, were also abandoned.Ultimately, the film was an act of cynical co-option by someone who didn’t understand the molten core of this novel and its groundbreaking approach to class, race and gender, or chose not to. And that’s why it made me feel so bored, and sad.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Is that OK now?Lucy Pasha-RobinsonMany women reading this will have experienced something similar: a warning that sharing public space isn’t a man’s job, it’s a woman’sTue 17 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 17.52 ESTShareWhat motivates a stranger to push a woman in public? That’s a question I’ve been stuck on this week after a man shoved me out of his way on an empty pedestrian street. I didn’t even see him coming – well, I wouldn’t have, as he came up from behind me.I had walked in his path, he barked at me. “What path?” I thought, baffled, as I took in the huge expanse of empty pavement around us. I was so stupefied by the encounter that I found myself frozen to the spot, watching him walk away in his blue anorak and technical rucksack. He could have been any man from anywhere on his way to work.As far as street harassment goes, many will have suffered far, far worse. But what made the incident uniquely disturbing was that it was the third similar encounter in as many months. In December, a man verbally harassed me on the tube as I went down an escalator – for walking “too slowly” this time.Last week, I was peering into a restaurant when I collided head-first with a man walking towards me. The pavement was empty and four metres wide. Why hadn’themoved out of the way? I asked him. Because I should have been looking where I was going, he told me.Perhaps I am a slow meanderer of the worst type and the story here is how unaware we have become in public spaces. Who doesn’t find other people annoying? Especially oblivious ones. “Am I oblivious?” I asked my husband. “No,” he told me, “but so what if you were?” He was right. Why, when someone bumps into me, is my reaction to say sorry, or move aside? Why was it the reaction of three men to shout or walk into me, to push me?I spoke to some women in my life about what had happened, and many shared similar experiences. A colleague tells me a story that is eerily similar to mine. A man barged past her from behind on an empty street – only she had the chutzpah to chase after him in a rage.Another colleaguewon’t run any moreafter a man tried to hit her with his lorry.Another was told she needed to “shut the fuck up” because she was supposedly talking too loudly in a pub with friends.Female black and brown friends describe experiencing casual racism on a scale they’ve never encountered before.A tall friend says she gets shouted at all the time. A small friend says she has never been harassed as much in her life as she was this summer.A man screamed “CUNT” in the face of an older friend.And I can bet almost every woman reading this will have had a similar experience. Of men wanting to teach them a lesson – that sharing public space isn’t a man’s job, it’s a woman’s.Somewhere along the way, the handbrake has come off. Feelings that were once contained now seem to be spilling over. After each encounter, I was left with a gnawing feeling disproportionate to the event itself, an overwhelming sense that something deeply sinister had happened. What thoughts do these men have about women if this is the stuff they are saying out loud? How do they treat the women in their lives if they are so angry they are capable of pushing a woman at 10.30am on a Friday?“Don’t let that prick ruin your day,” a woman said, after the incident. She appeared – and it is always a woman – like an angel to offer support and solidarity. But it did ruin my day. I walked around feeling heavy, ruminating on how anyone could behave like that, how he could break the social contract so completely.And the next time I go out alone, on a weekday morning, I assume the brace position. I feel the threat of violence just under the surface. I carry suspicion with me. I wonder what my next encounter with a stranger will look like.Lucy Pasha-Robinson is a Guardian assistant Opinion editorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Labour must look to its roots to find a replyTue 17 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 06.23 ESTShareIn the mid-1980s, a remarkable German television series became appointment viewing in my house each Thursday evening.Heimat, an epic portrait of the life and times of a fictional Rhineland village, tracked the inhabitants of Schabbach as they navigated the tumultuous 20th century. Across the course of 15 hours, Edgar Reitz’s drama conveyed a romantic, almost religious, sense of rootedness and love of place. As the aged local gravedigger liked to tell outsiders: “Down on earth as you all know, there’s high and low German, but in heaven – as you’d expect – they speak the Hunsrück dialect.”Half-playful, half-serious, those words express something both mysterious and beautiful about belonging. But on the political spectrum, where does such a vision sit?James Orr, recently recruited as anintellectual outrider for Nigel Farage, would have a ready and confident answer to that question. A professor of the philosophy of religion at Cambridge, Orr has been trying to lend some highbrow lustre to Faragism. In a recent piecefor the Times, he argued: “Reform is beginning to articulate what is routinely dismissed and demonised as rightwing populism, but which is much better understood as a vision animated by the politics of home.” Other parties, his column continued, have governed Britain as if it were “nowhere in particular”, managing a zone rather than cherishing and protecting a place.Similar observations have long been circulating in the far-right salons of Europe. I remember listening almost a decade ago to Marine Le Pen’s niece,Marion Maréchal, speaking at a rally in the historic city of Sens: “For Macron, our country is not a nation, it’s a space,” Maréchal told a predominantly working-class audience. “Me, I gaze in wonder at the gothic cathedral you have here in Sens, the most splendid in France, and marvel at the majesty of Racine’s verse. But all that doesn’t exist [for Macron]. The only thing that counts is productivity, the economy, benefits.”By this point, the hackles of many readers will be rising. In a nativist vision, home is by definition not for everyone. Reitz’s masterpiece – which was certainly not that – was criticised for playing down the horrors of Nazi antisemitism, which only rarely intrude on the lives of its characters. And notwithstanding the prominence of figures such asZia YusufandSuella Braverman, Reform’s love of place carries a logic of exclusion. Orr’s intervention was written in celebration ofRobert Jenrick’s defectionfrom the Conservatives, not long after Jenrick had notoriously lamented anabsence of white facesin Handsworth. The party’s candidate in this month’s seismic byelection in Gorton and Denton isMatthew Goodwin, a former politics professor turned online activist, who has implied that UK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds might not be, so to speak,echt-British.View image in fullscreenA still from the German TV series Heimat. ‘A remarkable [show that] became appointment viewing in my house each Thursday evening.’Photograph: YoutubeThese are repellent perspectives. Last week’s long-distance intervention by the billionaire tax exile Jim Ratcliffe, who lamented that Britain was in the process of being “colonised”, illustrated the extent to which they are gaining political traction. But moral excoriation, and edifying homilies in praise of diversity, do not cut it as a response. Watching a recent edition ofQuestion Time, I despaired as the secretary of state for Scotland, Douglas Alexander, challenged a Reform-friendly podcaster on the panel by quotingThis Is the Place, by the Manchester poet Tony Walsh. “Some are born here, some are drawn here, but we all call it home” is undoubtedly an uplifting line, but on sensitive subjects the left too often prefers preaching to analysis.Reform is hoping to eat the lunch of both the left and right by embodying a sentimental politics of patriotic resistance, posing as a nationalist middle way between free-marketeering Thatcherism and the dead hand of a remote state that is indifferent to the struggles of real communities. Orr and Reform’s other intellectual luminary,Danny Kruger, believe this “new right” will create a new centre ground; one that unites traditional Toryism, middle England and a terminally disillusioned post-industrial working class. The coming pitch is for a deglobalised British capitalism, likely to include the taking of public stakes in key industries, accompanied by a cultural drumbeat of ethnocentrism.The level of chutzpah is enormous. Farage identified with Liz Truss’s laissez-faire zealotry so much that he praised her government’s first and only budget as the best Tory economics “since 1986”. Orr’s new Centre for a Better Britain – the thinktank charged with policy development for a future Reform government – was founded with the help of commodity traders who drank with Farage during the “big bang” days of the 80s and 90s. These were the years when the world was made fit for global finance to plunder the planet according to its own priorities, and nobody then was talking about the politics of home.But opportunists could not flourish without being handed opportunities. Reform is simply exploiting mainstream parties’ long complicity with a Davos-style worldview that genuflects to the markets, while remaining indifferent to the places whose fate they decide.Labourcan point out the hypocrisy of Farage’s position. But in what one might call the party’s post-Mandelson era, its future relevance depends on its ability to make enemies in the right places. After all, the left can draw upon a rich tradition in which the need to resist and tame the uprooting power of capital was always well understood. Ideas of fraternity, solidarity and mutual dependence used to constitute the political atmosphere in which it breathed.In Gorton and Denton, I found a long-festering sense of fury that Labour has no idea how to tackle | John HarrisRead moreOrr’s contempt for a bloodless economic order, careless of human realities, strikingly echoes theCommunist Manifesto’s description of a capitalist modernity in which “all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned”. Karl Marx was sanguine about the ruthlessness that overturned habit and custom in search of profit, believing that the industrial working class would eventually take back control and build a new Jerusalem. But “utopian socialists” such as thephilanthropic factory owner Robert Owen, inaugurated an ethical tradition (co-ops, guilds and the postwar welfare state) which fought to insulate, protect and empower workers and families menaced by the economic forces beyond their control.A couple of centuries on, a modern sense ofheimatis threatened by a dysfunctional housing market that drives a sense of rootlessness and precarity. Town centres and high streets have been hollowed out by unmanaged post-industrial decline, and now by the digital rerouting of our everyday lives. AI threatens not only to take over traditional areas of employment; its future development will oblige us to defend the specificity and value of the human per se. Concerns over immigration are only part of this wider sense of social anxiety, which Farage has surfed to such political effect since the early days of Ukip.Attacking Goodwin ahead of the Gorton and Denton byelection,Keir Starmerlast week urged voters to choose “true patriotism” over the “plastic” version offered by Reform. Let’s hope they do. But the language is weak and banal. Unless Labour rediscovers its ethical ambition in dealing with the economic challenges of the age, and relearns a language of belonging that goes beyond virtuous assertion, such appeals risk being buried under a “unite the kingdom” St George’s flag.Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a simple statement – yet it encapsulates everything about the Japanese architect’s work. He takes materials others might overlook or discard – from cardboard tubes to beer crates, styrofoam to shipping containers – and subjects them to a kind of alchemy, refining rough edges and transforming fragility into sturdiness.The outcome is a perpetually ingenious and curiously poetic scavenger architecture that finds beauty and purpose in the everyday. From high-end boutiques to housing for refugees, Ban’s buildings blur the lines between eastern and western design traditions, between the luxurious and the ordinary, and between what constitutes a temporary building and permanent one.The strength of a building has little to do with the strength of its materialsBut then Ban considers all buildings to be inherently temporary. “In a big city like Los Angeles or Tokyo,” he says, “large buildings can just disappear, especially in the commercial sector – torn down to make way for new ones that will make more money for developers. Whereas a building made of paper can be permanent, as long as people cherish it.”Recently awarded the 2026 American Institute of Architects Gold Medal, and due to give a lecture at the Royal Geographical Society in London this week, Ban is a globetrotter on the architectural circuit. But he is still consumed by his core mission to improve people’s lives, especially in areas of disaster and conflict. He is building a new hospital in Lviv, in the less war-ravaged west of Ukraine, using cross-laminated timber. “Ukraine has one of the biggest laminated timber factories in eastern Europe,” he says. “They used to export it to Canada and the US but now they can’t. So they’re looking for an opportunity to deploy it within Ukraine.”View image in fullscreenEmergency relief … cardboard tube housing with beer-crate foundations for the displaced population of Kobe after the 1995 earthquake.Photograph: Hiroyuki HiraiFor Ban, architecture is a set of flexible systems rather than fixed structures. It should be mobile and responsive. He knows buildings are exposed not only to human vicissitudes but also the cataclysmic impact of geology and weather. Japan is subject to natural disasters that can reshape cities in seconds. Its Meteorological Agency records earthquake activity: mostly low-level rumbles, but as ubiquitous as a spot of rain in the UK. And although its modern buildings are required to conform to the world’s most rigorous standards of seismic design, larger earthquakes can still be catastrophic.In the aftermath of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, which killed more than 5,000 people, Ban designed the Paper Dome, an ostensibly temporary structure to replace the city’s destroyed Takatori Catholic Church. Constructed in five weeks by volunteers working with donated materials, and featuring recycled cardboard tubes as columns, its elliptical shape was based on Bernini’s baroque church of Sant’Andrea al Quirinale in Rome. Over time it became a symbol of the city’s reconstruction, evolving into a community centre that hosted weddings, concerts, meetings and film shows. After 10 years, it was dismantled and shipped to the village of Taomi in Taiwan, which itself had endured an earthquake in 1999. “It’s still there,” says Ban.The idea that you might construct a building out of cardboard tubes invariably precipitates Proustian remembrances of Blue Peters past, where presenters wrestled with the insides of toilet rolls to contrive all manner of creations, from advent calendars toThunderbirds’ Tracy Island. Yet where others have a signature style, Ban has a signature material. The term “paper architect” is often disparagingly applied to architects given to theorising and proposing fanciful schemes but never actually building anything. In Ban’s case, it literally means he builds with paper.View image in fullscreen‘The government didn’t care about privacy’ … Shigeru Ban.Photograph: Hiroyuki Hirai“I started developing structures out of recycled paper in 1985, long before people started talking about environmental issues,” says Ban. Traditional Japanese buildings employ slidingshojiscreens, made from translucent rice paper stretched across timber frames. And Japan has a heritage of exquisite paper-making. But it’s quite a leap from that to something robust enough to hold up a roof.Ban started looking at the cardboard tubes that are a staple of the textile industry as cores for bolts of fabric. Rather like the insides of toilet rolls, you never see the tubes until the fabric has been exhausted, and then they are quickly discarded. “They were stronger than I expected so I started testing them more seriously,” he says. “I knew that the strength of a building has little to do with the strength of its materials. Concrete buildings can easily be destroyed by an earthquake while many centuries-old timber buildings survive.”The Christchurch authorities emailed saying: ‘Are you the architect who can design a temporary church free of charge?’Ban collaborated with renowned Japanese structural engineer Gengo Matsui, an expert in traditional materials such as bamboo, and their experimentation with cardboard tubes fed into the development of a new type of building system – one that was eventually approved by the Japanese Ministry of Construction. “Essentially,” says Ban, “I developed a new way of using an existing yet disregarded material.”As well as the Paper Dome, Ban devised simple, modular houses for Kobe’s Vietnamese community displaced by the 1995 earthquake. Walls fabricated from cardboard tubes were supported on foundations made of sandbag-filled beer crates, enclosed by a light roof of tent sheeting.He also designed lightweight partitioning made of cardboard tubes and fabric screens, for use in large halls where displaced citizens might take refuge. “People had to sleep on the floor without any privacy,” says Ban. “I believe privacy is the most basic human right, but the government didn’t care.” Now his partitioning system is officially employed all over Japan in evacuation or disaster relief scenarios. It was even used after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine when refugees started fleeing into neighbouring countries.View image in fullscreenThe stuff of drams … how Ban’s timber distillery in Speyside will look.Illustration: Shigeru Ban ArchitectsThe experience led Ban to establish the Voluntary Architects’ Network, an NGO that develops temporary housing and other buildings for victims of natural disasters and conflicts, from Pakistan to Altadena. Employing low-cost, recyclable local materials and local labour, it aims to bridge the gap between immediate disaster relief and the construction of more permanent structures. Sometimes Ban is directly commissioned, other times he just goes where he thinks he is needed.Larger-scale buildings have included a temporary concert hall for L’Aquila in central Italy, to supportthe post-earthquake reconstructionof a city famous for its classical music scene. The project was jointly announced by the Italian and Japanese governments at the2009 G8 summit, relocated to L’Aquila, where a bemused Silvio Berlusconi brandished a section of one of Ban’s cardboard tubes.You could almost say that cardboard has an affinity with the divine. The now famousCardboard Cathedralin Christchurch, New Zealand, was constructed in the wake of the 2011 earthquake, which badly damaged the city’s 19th-century cathedral designed by English gothic revivalist George Gilbert Scott. “I got an email from the Christchurch authorities,” Ban recalls. “They said, ‘You must be the architect who can design a temporary church free of charge.’” An array of cardboard tubes 60cm in diameter, reinforced with laminated timber, make up the cathedral’s soaring A-frame. Above the altar, there’s even a tubular cardboard cross.View image in fullscreenMeringue peaked roof … Centre Pompidou-Metz, France.Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty ImagesIt’s not all hair-shirt pragmatism, though. Ban is equally at home in Ginza, Tokyo’s insanely glamorous shopping district, contriving luxury boutiques for fashion houses – or in Speyside in the Scottish Highlands, the holy land of whisky, where he is currently working on a distillery with an elaborately arboreal structure that would not look out of place in The Lord of the Rings. He has also designed an art museum with a distinctive basket-weave facade in the Colorado ski resort of Aspen, and an outpost of Paris’s Pompidou Centre in the eastern French city of Metz, topped by a meringue peaked roof that seems to have more in common with the extravagances of Frank Gehry.But Ban’s outlook is not that of a typical starchitect. “Architects work mainly for people with wealth and power,” he says. “And because wealth and power are invisible, we’re hired to create monuments to them. I want to use my experience not only for the privileged, but also for the person who has seen their home destroyed.”Ban is currently working on the reconstruction of houses on Japan’s Noto Peninsula, which were destroyed by an earthquake on New Year’s Day 2024 that killed more than 700 people. It will incorporate timber recycled from a vast ring-shaped installation designed for last year’sOsaka Expoby fellow Japanese architectSou Fujimoto. The original official plan was to dismantle and burn what was billed as the world’s largest timber structure. “But I thought that was such a waste,” says Ban. “So I proposed some of the timber be used in post-earthquake reconstruction. We’re also salvaging roof tiles and other material from ruined houses.” As ever, waste not, want not.Shigeru Ban Complete Works 1985-Todayis published by Taschen.

The show, which has now been performed in 10 languages, has reduced men in their 70s to tearsTue 17 Feb 2026 10.02 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 12.44 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIt is the summer of 2024 and Haley McGee is performing Age Is a Feeling at a festival in Toronto. Her show is in good shape, having already raked in five-star reviewsat the Edinburgh fringe. But this performance is different. As she launches into her poignant monologue about life, death and the business of getting old, she hears a baby cry.The newborn sleeps through the rest of the show, but the performer, who is newly pregnant herself, feels as though she is speaking directly to this child and its young family. “It framed the whole show as a conversation with this baby,” McGee says: “This is my message for you about your adult life.”It calmed me down about the boring anxieties women my age faceNow preparing to revive the piece for a run in London, the Canadian-born playwright and actor has been imagining her one-year-old daughter as the target audience.Age Is a Feelingis written from the perspective of a 25-year-old speculating on her future, considering the choices, major and minor, that may or may not lead to a fulfilling life. Who can say how everything will play out: the feuds, affairs and health scares, the fragile friendships and creaking bones?“The show was a bomb to say life is long and the die isn’t cast,” she says. “And just because you don’t get X or Y, doesn’t mean your life isn’t going to be tremendously valuable. It calmed me down about some of the boring anxieties that women my age tend to face.”View image in fullscreenMoving for all age groups … McGee performing Age Is a Feeling at the Edinburgh fringe in 2022.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianNow approaching her 40s, McGee writes with the wisdom of someone decades older. Age Is a Feeling has been performed in 10 languages – in China, Chile, Turkey and beyond – by actors ranging from their mid-20s to mid-50s, and somehow it always connects. “When we did it in Edinburgh, I could see everybody’s faces and there would be men in their 70s wiping tears. For it to be moving people who weren’t in my age bracket was amazing.”She attributes this effect to what she calls her “anecdotal research”. Before writing, she spoke to all kinds of people by visiting hospices, mystics and cemeteries, and soliciting reflections on social media. “You will find a white pubic hair” is a line that comes directly from Facebook. It always gets a laugh. So too does the one about throwing your back out when doing something as innocuous as stepping out of the shower.She loves this kind of research. “It’s like being a psychologist or a therapist, getting to put myself inside the experience of other people. I cry so much when I’m writing – to the point I can’t write in a cafe.”The memory of the Toronto baby has stayed with her, but McGee is not the kind of actor to be fazed. Having studied improvisation with Second City in Chicago, shemoved to Londonand joinedthe Free Association improv troupe. She loves thinking on her feet. One of her teachers at drama school told her: “You know, Haley, you really do your best work when you don’t quite know what you’re going to do.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s like being a therapist’ … McGee.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianBecause of this, Age Is a Feeling has a built-in layer of uncertainty. Which stories she tells depends on choices made by the audience. Around her on stage are postcards with words on – Teeth, Bus, Oyster – each triggering a different story. There are 12 in total and the audience hear six. Like life, Age Is a Feeling is unpredictable. It has innumerable possible variations, ranging from the joyful to the bleak.“Sometimes it feels like there are a lot of highs and lows. Other times it feels like, ‘Oh, my God, what a brutal existence!’ Two of my good friends from school happened to see one of the most depressing versions. There was not one story chosen that had a sense of uplift or joy. I had to reassure them it wasn’t always like that!”‘This show is starting to live under my fingernails’: the road to Edinburgh fringeRead moreConsequently, the show hits different people in different ways. As she gets older, McGee has found own perspective shifting, whether influenced by the regular business of being alive or the tragically early death at 43 of her director,Adam Brace, in 2023.Before her run in Toronto, Brace came to her in a dream. “We were on the top of a double-decker bus and he was giving me notes. I looked at him and said, ‘Adam, we’ve all been missing you so much, but you’re right here.’ I don’t know if that is a mystical thing or a sense that he lives in this piece of work, but I found it very comforting. Adam and I talked a lot about art consoling people and maybe that’s one of the big functions of this show. You come into this room and it’s, ‘Hey, you’re going to die and I’m going to die!’”Age Is a Feeling is atSoho Theatre Walthamstow, London, 5–7 MarchExplore more on these topicsComedyTheatreSoho theatreOlder peopleinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Bram Stoker’s classic story of elemental evil knows the answer to that question. Dracula, the Ur-vampire and ultimate outsider of the literary canon, is played by Erivo, along with every other character in this deliciously wicked tale of the blood-sucking count.Except it’s not deliciously wicked in adapter-director Kip Williams’ stage reinvention. Williams has proven himself a Midas-touched spinner of old stories to new. His one-woman version of The Picture of Dorian Gray was deliriously original. His take on Jean Genet’s The Maids was punk inspired. What has happened here?In look, Erivo makes a magnificent modern Dracula with her piercings and tattoos, first appearing on stage in vest and trousers, all sharp angles and sinews. She has the long, pointed nails for it too, reminiscent of the thin, knife-like fingers ofFW Murnau’s Nosferatu.View image in fullscreenNails like Nosferatu … Erivo in Dracula.Photograph: Daniel BoudA team of camera operators transpose what is happening on stage to a gigantic screen. The live images are merged with pre-recorded footage. This use of technology has been utilised innumerable times on the West End stage, by Williams as well as others, but seems ill-suited to the horror genre, distancing us from the dread.Erivo appears ever smaller and more vulnerable on stage and your eye is drawn away from her, to the screen closeups. Sometimes images are superimposed on each other and look hallucinatory. It shows off what technology can do but the action itself is overwhelmingly static.That is because the story is narrated by Erivo, with only snippets in dialogue, which gives the sense of an audiobook accompanied by screen illustrations. It comprises mostly diary entries from journals and preserves the epistolary form of the book. Why, when it serves no dramatic purpose other than to remind us of the story’s original form?Erivo narrates swiftly, with accents differentiating characters along with a quick changing of wigs and clothes. So a pink-red wig and African inflected accent for count Dracula, a pin-striped shirt and clipped British accent for Jonathan Harker, the solicitor who becomes imprisoned in his castle, a high innocent voice for Harker’s fiancee, Mina, a blond wig for her friend Lucy, who falls victim to Dracula. But despite the speed, the atmosphere stays sedate, with none of the fever required, and no peril whatsoever. And characters seem so simplistic that they verge on the comical. Most ludicrous of all is vampire-slayer, Van Helsing, who looks like a gothic version of Gandalf with long white locks and weird goatee. Erivo’s feat of narration also seems to distract her from the actual acting, too neutral in her physical and facial expressions.View image in fullscreenChocolate box seduction … Erivo in Dracula.Photograph: Daniel BoudThe production seeks to focus on the battle between fear and desire in the story but there is neither chill nor heat here. Dracula brings no threat, even as he begins his blood-sucking in Whitby. There is no diabolicism or dark charisma in the repeated flashes of Dracula’s fangs. His three sharp-toothed vampire-women do not bring a sense of seduction either. A giant love heart appears on stage at one point, more chocolate-box than sexually suggestive. A snow scene is more atmospheric, but there is an abounding sterility in the storytelling which undercuts the building of emotional or atmospheric momentum.This is, for many, seen as a cautionary tale of the dangerous outsider-immigrant. Dracula travels to British shores and is likened to plague-like vermin by Stoker. This is not unpicked at all here, despite its current, real-world relevance.Erivo gives us a tantalising taste of her singing voice towards the end and it raises your hopes but is aborted into a few – exquisitely sung – lines rather than a song. It’s sad that the production plays so little of Erivo’s strengths, which might better have been reconceived as Dracula the Musical.AtNoël Coward theatre, London, until 30 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreCynthia ErivoBram StokerreviewsShareReuse this content"

The victim’s last words were: “Film it!”Mehraneh Salimian graduated from art school the same day, and that final wish guided her and her partner, Amin Pakparvar, to make their documentary short premiering at theBerlin film festivalon Tuesday. Memories of a Window is dedicated to the slain woman,Shirin Alizadeh, and the role of amateur videos in recording and emboldening dissent in Iran.View image in fullscreenA man paints Freedom on a wall.Photograph: Anonymous archival footageNow film students in Chicago, Salimian and Pakparvar worked from a large trove of anonymous smartphone videos – they estimate they viewed about 2,000 clips – as well as their own footage gathered in Tehran during the 2022-23“Woman, Life, Freedom”uprising.“We’re hoping that we can isolate this period of time in Iranian history. Although there has since been even more brutality happening, more violence, that period was important too,” says Salimian, 26.In their film, they highlight the unique perspective of people filming from the purported safety behind car or home windows to hold authorities to account and challenge official narratives of violent incidents – a technique also used recently duringanti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.“It was a great tension between the lies or false information the state media was presenting of the movement and what we were experiencing,” says Salimian.“Protesters started filming the events and they anonymously uploaded them online. It was like a movement happening from behind windows.”Salimian describes that space as “like a threshold, a site that was not in the street, but did not have the safety of the home”.View image in fullscreenUnable to attend … the directors Amin Pakparvar, left, and Mehraneh Salimian.Composite: Courtesy: Berlin Film Festival“Shirin was one of the people who was shooting the events from behind her window when she was shot and killed,” on 22 September 2022, she says. “I was very, very moved. It shook me to the core.”Alizadeh was in a car driven by her husband, with two other travel companions, when they saw protesters being shot dead in the street in the north-eastern town of Salman Shahr as they sought to drive back to their home city of Isfahan. Her smartphone footage of the throng of demonstrators as security forces opened fire features prominently in the film, along with her command to one of the fellow passengers, “Film it!” as a woman appeared to lie on the roadside shot dead.Seconds later, at least one bullet pierced the rear window of the car and hit 36-year-old Alizadeh in the neck and head, according to Amnesty International. She died in hospital.Those distressing images are intercut with rousing scenes shot by Salimian and Pakparvar, 28, from their flat during the same period, in which neighbours join a chorus of anti-regime protest songs from their own apartments.It’s their courage that is contagious and although they have been suppressed, they see the value of uprising again and again“For decades Iranians have been protesting and every time their voices have been suppressed and censored. But a couple of years after that, they protested again in higher numbers,” says Pakparvar. “It’s their courage that is contagious and although they have been suppressed, they see the value of uprising again and again.”The protests evolved from a focus on restrictions of women’s rights, including the compulsory hijab, toward the more broad-based movement that erupted in recent months. With it came aninternet blackoutby the authorities to prevent the sharing of such videos, says Pakparvar, as well ashorrific violence against demonstratorsin which thousands died.“This is a strategy of state and it’s kind of working but not fully. There wereStarlink satellitesthat people managed to use” to distribute images, he says. “Every day we see more and more videos of the massacre. It’s heartbreaking.”The film-makers say they will be unable to attend the premiere in Berlin because they are in the US on student visas, and would be barred from returning under thetravel banreimposed by President Trump in 2025. But they will join the presentation by video link.Watch a clip from Memories of a WindowThe feedback in Chicago has already confirmed the film’s resonance, they say, with fellow students comparing it toChina under the Covid lockdownand US activism during theBlack Lives Mattermovement. “It shows that we are living in a very vulnerable moment internationally and people are looking for freedom in various contexts,” says Pakparvar.Both are optimistic they will one day return to a free and democratic Iran. “We are pretty hopeful to be honest. They can’t control it any more,”Pakparvar says of the regime.“Maybe if you had asked us 10 years ago, we would have had no general sense of what kind of freedom we want. But now it’s crystal clear. We know our rights, we know the goal, and we know the values that we want in our life and in our home country. You see millions of people are aware of that and we’re moving toward it.”The Berlin festival haslong championed Iran’s dissident film-makers. On opening night on Thursday, Iranian creatives walked the red carpet holding “Free Iran” signs. The next day, Iranian independent film-makers staged a performance with volunteers lying on the ground to symbolise those killed during the January protests.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festival 2026ProtestIranDocumentary filmsMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsActivismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brit Ben Chaplin is a delightfully incompetent owner of a large dog who mistakes Uma Thurman’s producer for Janeane Garofalo’s radio presenter of a pet advice radio phone-in. Garofalo and Chaplin completely steal the film – I do wish people had given her more roles after it – and it’s touching, silly and (I’ve discovered over the years) a film for people like me who don’t really like romcoms or romantic films in particular.Rothko06Two for the RoadIt’s a bittersweet dramedy on a 12-year marriage that jumps back-and-forth in time. Funny and sad, trusting and betrayal, indifferent and loving … in other words a realistic take on marriage. If you’ve never seen it, see it. If you’ve seen it, see it again.

Also it’s pleasingly self-aware that we all know how the basic Groundhog Day idea works, so it gets all the “wait – this all happened yesterday!” stuff out of the way with admirable efficiency.JebedeeWhat IfA romcom with Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan that is both romantic and funny, something that so many “romcoms” don’t actually manage … what a lovely film it is.KevcoeLonely HeartsEven though it was an AFI best picture winner, Paul Cox’s Lonely Hearts seems sadly forgotten these days, but it still keeps this heart warm as the years roll on. That it captures a Melbourne completely gone in all but memory just adds to its wonder, as does the incandescently beautiful Wendy Hughes, playing the impossible role of a plain-Jane. A film filled with gentleness … a rare quality.BobbskiWhite PalaceI’ve always had a soft spot for the 1990 film White Palace with Susan Sarandon and James Spader, justifying that opposites do attract. The final scene in the restaurant, is just single minded loveliness.Aubrey26The Russia HouseView image in fullscreenMichelle Pfeiffer and Sean Connery in The Russia House.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyOne of my favourites is the romance in The Russia House between Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, which was grounded, refreshing and human – his disheveled, boozy, and vulnerable middle-aged publisher begs the affection of Pfeiffer’s cautious Soviet mother – the world-weary nature of their characters mean the age gap wasn’t so significant. The film score is Jerry Goldsmith’s masterpiece – smoky and bittersweet with Slavic textures.shakercoolaThe Bitter Tea of General YenI’d nominate Frank Capra’s The Bitter Tea of General Yen with Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther. Despite casting a Swede as a Chinese man, it says a lot about racism as well as being as bittersweet as the title.bystrouskyRab Ne Bana Di JodiRab Ne Bana Di Jodi is a great romantic film.To set the scene: he, somewhat socially awkward, is the professor’s favourite pupil, she the professor’s daughter. On the day of her marriage, the groom and his family are killed in a tragic off-screen accident as they make their way to the wedding. She is devastated because it is a love marriage not an arranged one. Her father is so stressed by it all he has a heart attack and before he dies he asks his star pupil to marry his daughter so that she won’t be left fending for herself after he has died. Reluctantly they agree to marry.What follows is the story of how their relationship grows and develops, as they learn to understand each other.d33pf1xOnly YouOnly You, has a young Robert Downey Jr opposite the always fabulous Marisa Tomei having a start-stop a romance in Italy.

It’s interesting how a French film can have themes of subtle suggestion, class and unrequited love which bring to mind Jane Austen novels.hubbahubbaExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsAudrey HepburnSean ConneryRobert Downey JrMichelle PfeifferFrank CapraMarisa TomeifeaturesShareReuse this content"

A campaign by activists, or a sign of our politically disparate times?Tue 17 Feb 2026 07.37 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 07.39 ESTShareIf you’ve started to feel like you’re living in an entirely different reality from most of the world, there’s a good chance that it’s because you’ve been looking at theRotten Tomatoes page for the Melania Trump documentary. There you will find two diametrically opposed numbers. First is the official Rotten Tomatoes score – the one aggregated across published reviews by professional critics – which sits at a minuscule 11%. But then there is the audience rating, which is based on scores from members of the general public. That score, incredibly, is 98%. (Admittedly, this is a score confined to “verified ticket buyers” –Rotten Tomatoes has another section it calls “All Audience”where the reaction is more … mixed.)Melania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreOf course, there has long been a chasm between public and critical opinion, which is why the film that won the most Oscars last year was a small character study about a disenfranchised stripper and the film that brought in the most money was about Minecraft. Even so, the disparity between the brutal reviews thatMelaniareceived (“The most depressing experience I have ever had in the cinema” – Mark Kermode) and the glowing public reviews (“Every red blooded American needs to see this movie to recognise the grace, sophistication and power of Flotius [sic]” – Jackie) is enough to give you whiplash.Who could be wrong here? Is it the liberal press, relishing an opportunity to land a hit on an unpopular president by trashing his wife’s expensive vanity project? Or perhaps it’s the public reviewers who (and this is just wild speculation) have decided to flood the site with fake reviews in a coordinated attempt to undermine dissenting voices. Who could possibly say?View image in fullscreenDivisive … Five Nights At Freddy’s 2.Photograph: Ryan Green/APEither way, with an 87% difference between critics and the public, Melania will now go down in history as the film with the biggest gap between critical and popular scores. Nobody will be sadder about this than the people behind Five Nights at Freddy’s 2, which held the title until recently. Professional critics gave that film a lowly score of 16%, while its audience loved it enough to score it 84%. Prior to that, according to research by digital entertainment platformJB.com, the film with the biggest gap was 2024’s Emilia Pérez. Despite winning the jury prize at Cannes and gaining a 70% critical score, the film’s audience gave it just 17%. There are others. The 2021 Dwayne Johnson-starring Red Notice scored 37% with critics and 92% with the public. Saw sequel Jigsaw scored 32% with critics but 88% with the public. Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin scored 83% with critics and 55% with the public.Clearly, there are two biases going on here. The films that do better with audiences tend to be formulaic crowd-pleasers like Red Notice and Jigsaw. They exist to be familiar and unchallenging, qualities that critics historically dismiss. And who can blame them, since literally all they do is watch films. All they want to see is something to break the monotony of passable entertainment. A terrifying arthouse film about a sexy alien getting burned alive in Scotland is much more likely to do that than a Ryan Reynolds buddy comedy.The other bias is that the films that did badly with the public – Emilia Pérez and Under the Skin – both have female leads. Which isn’t to say that the public hates women, but it is to say that an aggressively obnoxious quadrant of the public gets a bit weird when a film deals with women, or Black people, or transgenderism in any form.Emilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón got in hot waterfor a variety of reasons, but look at the films that have been review bombed in the past. Female superhero movies such as Captain Marvel. Female-oriented remakes like Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters. The Last Jedi, with its non-white female characters. The Little Mermaid with its non-ginger mermaid. There is a pattern to these things, and the pattern suggests that a lot of these public reviews – maybe, possibly, even Melania’s – are ideologically motivated.You need to take both scores with a pinch of salt. On one hand, critics tend to lean highbrow, which means they’re likely to underestimate something designed to sit solidly with audiences. Conversely, people who leave reviews online for free are absolute weirdos.But the gap is here to stay. You might have noticed that the gap between critics and the public is growing every year. Emilia Perez’s 53% gap in 2024 became Five Nights at Freddy’s 2’s 68% gap in 2025, which is now an 87% gap thanks to Melania. It’s impossible to imagine that this will ever be beaten – surely Melania was released in the perfect conditions for a percentage gap – but then again we’ve said that before. Perhaps one day something will come along to top it. A film made by someone genuinely contentious, dealing with a ferociously touchy subject that has caused people to lose their minds for thousands of years. A film that will start a legitimately tedious, all-encompassing, multi-stranded debate that will roll on for months and months until everybody loses the will to live. In other words: Mel Gibson’s The Resurrection of the Christ, this is your time to shine.Explore more on these topicsFilmMelaniaFilm criticismRotten TomatoesEmilia PérezUnder The SkincommentShareReuse this content"

Five countries – Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain –are boycotting the contestover the continued inclusion of Israel. Additionally, and perhaps not coincidentally, television viewership is falling through the floor. In 2024, the BBC’s coveragelost a quarter of its viewersyear on year, and last year another million deserted it.But there is good news on the horizon. The UK has just announced its entry for this year, and it seems like we’ve reacted to all this existential uncertainty by going weird. This, it turns out, isgoing to be the year of Look Mum No Computer.Described by the BBC as “a multitalented solo artist, experimental singer/songwriter, live electronics performer and composer, inventor of unique musical machines, and self-proclaimed Eurovision fan”, Look Mum No Computer is the alias of former Zibra frontman Sam Battle. He has built a dedicated army of subscribers on his YouTube channel, which includes videos featuring himrestoring a 1929 carand composing an instrumental track for abandoned synthesisers, AKAThe Binmen’s Lament.Now, depending on how you look at things, this is either a very smart move by the UK or a clear demonstration of everything that’s wrong with the world. To those in the latter group, theEurovisionsong contest is still the respectably mainstream music competition, the home of Cliff Richards, Lulu and Brotherhood of Man. I suspect that one reaction to the Look Mum No Computer announcement will be along the lines of: “Why don’t we just enter Oasis and smash it?”Which would be missing the point a bit. For starters, the last thing Oasis want is to come 15th in a European singing competition (which they would, because European mistrust of the British runs deeper than any love of nostalgic 1990s indie music). Also, Oasis would stick out like a sore thumb at Eurovision, much more than Look Mum No Computer.Just look at some of the acts that other countries have announced this year. Greece has entered an 8-bit techno song performed by someone who looks as ifhis day job is entertaining children dressed as Elmo. Denmark hasput a goth in a fish tank. Moldova has entered a song thatis literally called Viva, Moldova!, a move that will only feasibly resonate with Moldovans.The point is that Eurovision is no longer the home of Abba. It is now the home of entries such as Latvia’s 2022 song Eat Your Salad, the original version of which featured the lyrics “Instead of meat, I eat veggies and pussy” and, quite frankly, it’s about time we tried to keep up.In the last 15 years, the UK has cracked Eurovision’s top 10 just once, with Sam Ryder in 2022. Aside from that, none of our strategies have worked. We tried nostalgia, only to watch Bonnie Tyler come 19th and Engelbert Humperdinck come 25th. We tried entering reality television acts, and watched as Lucie Jones came 15th and Michael Rice came last. Even lining things up perfectly with the current mood of Eurovision, as we did with Olly Alexander in 2024, couldn’t get us any higher than 18th.So, quite frankly, we have nothing to lose. And if that means entering aguy who runs a museumfor “experimental and obsolete scientific and musical technology” in Ramsgate and whose name makes me die a little bit every time I have to type it out, then so be it. We’re going to lose anyway, so what the hell.That said, let’s retain some hope. All we know is that Look Mum No Computer has entered Eurovision. We haven’t heard a song yet. It may be a banger. It may go on to redefine what Eurovision is. It will, I predict, certainly be singular.The most recent video on Look Mum No Computer’s YouTube channel is a clip from a concert, where heattempts to piece together a Blur song on the fly, all by himself, on a bank of ancient electronic instruments. It’s fascinating to watch, it’s as if Ed Sheeran had accidentally joined the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Plus, it has to be said, the (German) audience went nuts for it. That has to be worth a shot, right?Explore more on these topicsEurovision 2026TelevisionEurovisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This Bradford-born actor objectsAngelika MayTue 17 Feb 2026 04.03 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 06.42 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleEmerald Fennell’s casting choices for her new version of Wuthering Heights have already been much scrutinised. As well as the apparent“whitewashing” of Heathcliffby casting Jacob Elordi in the part, there’s the fact 35-year-old Margot Robbie is playing a woman 20 years her junior.Plus, of course, they’re both Australian, not British – and certainly not fromYorkshire. Fennell has offered a defence of her casting choices as a “personal fantasy” – but amid all the scoff and chatter surrounding the film and its myriad deviations from the book, the erasure of regional authenticity risks going under-discussed.Wuthering Heights, one of the world’s most revered novels, is inseparable from the capricious landscape of the Yorkshire moors. Yet screen adaptations have consistently neglected the local identity of its central character. Across every major adaptation, from Merle Oberon in 1939 to Kaya Scodelario in 2011, not one Cathy has been portrayed by a Yorkshirewoman, let alone an actor from Bradford, the cultural heartland of the novel’s setting and the city in which it was written.View image in fullscreenLaurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in the 1939 version of Wuthering Heights.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarFennell’s latest version perpetuates this pattern, sidelining northern talent at a moment that could have been pivotal in elevating underrepresented talent. The film’s sole Bradford-born actor, Jessica Knappett, plays Mrs Burton, a servant role.Casting choices such as Fennell’s preserve a system that undervalues northern womenCasting Wuthering Heights without regard for regional specificity is not a neutral creative decision. While Robbie may be“so beautiful, and interesting and surprising”, according to Fennell, such star-driven considerations constitute a frustrating dismissal of the environment that fabricated Cathy’s temperament. Cathy is not merely situated within a landscape, she is symbiotically shaped by it.Amber Barry, a PhD researcher in Victorian literature at King’s College London, says: “The Yorkshire moors illuminate Cathy and Heathcliff’s story particularly within the context of working-class demonstrations at the time. Can we call this Wuthering Heights if such a crucial setting is reduced to a flat, vaguely gothic backdrop?”As a Bradford-born actor, I have experienced barriers in the arts first-hand, and I believe casting choices such as Fennell’s preserve a system that undervalues northern women. Of course, acting is a transformational craft – performers are expected to inhabit lives far removed from their own, myself included. But the issue is not that actors shouldn’t extend beyond their lived experience. The question is far broader: when a major production depicts a didactic novel steeped in landscape, dialect and cultural identity, why should those from that region be denied such life-changing opportunities? It’s not about choosing between A-listers and regionally authentic actors, it’s about asking why so few actors from Bradford have ever reached the visibility necessary to be considered at all.View image in fullscreenBradford-born Jessica Knappett, who plays Mrs Burton in the new Wuthering Heights, at its UK premiere.Photograph: Fred Duval/Sopa Images/ShutterstockStructural biases in training, access, industry networks and commissioning maintain this inequality; for example, research shows thatalmost a third of Bafta-nominated actorshave been privately educated. Of course, star power brings in audiences and financing, but there is space for emerging regional talent to platform alongside established actors.Bradford’s socioeconomic contextonly intensifies this inequality. The district ranks as the 12th most deprived in England, fourth for income deprivation, and fifth for employment, with 19.8% of households in fuel poverty, 40% of children living below the poverty line, and 12% of working-age residents lacking formal qualifications. Roles such as Cathy Earnshaw, intrinsically tied to Yorkshire, could have offered a rare rejection of the marginalisation of northern actors, and a career-defining moment for talent from an underrepresented background.Hollywood’s focus on star power over geographic authenticity reflects a broader industry bias, with women making up only about30% of UK film cast roles, and northern women disproportionately pigeonholed into stereotypical or comedic parts, rather than complex, upper-middle-class characters like Cathy. Northern stereotypes in film and television fall within a narrow range of familiar tropes, casually reinforcing prejudices rather than attempting nuance.While such portrayals may seem harmless in isolation, collectively they establish a pattern in which northern characters, particularly women, are coded as working class, comic, chaotic or intellectually limited, and rarely cast as romantic heroines. AChannel 4 report found that northern accentswere twice as likely to be coded as working class, and were significantly less likely to be used in advertisements promoting aspirational products such as luxury goods.The report concludedthat representation of working-class people in advertising was both low and poor, undermining advertising’s ostensible aim of promoting aspiration and reinforcing the association between prestige and non-northern identities.Wuthering Heights is not the only problem, but it represents yet another blow to people perennially constrained by society’s expectations. When Cathy says: “I’m sure I should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills,” she articulates a truth that resonates with me deeply; that this particular landscape has shaped my sense of self, as it has for many others, and it is precisely for this reason that continued underrepresentation feels so profoundly ostracising.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsYorkshireWomenFilm industryFilm adaptationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Austrian media identified the suspect as Beran A and said he had been arrested in August 2024.Taylor Swift becomes second-youngest ever named to Songwriters Hall of FameRead moreProsecutors said the defendant had declared allegiance to Islamic State, sharing propaganda material and videos via various messaging services.They accused him of having “obtained instructions on the internet for the construction of a shrapnel bomb based on the explosive triacetone triperoxide” typically used by IS, and of having produced a small amount of the explosive.The defendant had made “several attempts” to buy weapons illegally outside the country and to bring them to Austria, prosecutors said.They plan to proceed with a criminal case against the unnamed suspect in Wiener Neustadt, a town near the Austrian capital.He is also alleged to have been involved in planning other attacks abroad, including in Dubai and Istanbul, though those attacks never materialised.If found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison.After the shows were cancelled,Swift wrote on social media: “The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many had planned on coming to those shows.”The US provided intelligence that fed into the cancellation decision.“The United States has an enduring focus on our counter-terrorism mission,” the then White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said in August 2024. “We work closely with partners all over the world to monitor and disrupt threats.“And so as part of that work, the United States did share information with Austrian partners to enable the disruption of a threat to Taylor Swift’s concerts there in Vienna.”Last yeara Berlin court convicted a Syrian teenagerof contributing to the plot.

He has been depressed, intoxicated, suicidal and horny in equal measure, all of which was topped off in the most recent episode with a sweaty bunk-up with a guy in a club.How do we know he’s fully going off the rails? That’s easy: the club scene was directly preceded by a shot of Muck in the shower, singing For He is an Englishman from HMS Pinafore. And he hasn’t been the only one lately. InThe Night Manager,Hugh Laurie burst into a rousing verse of the song. You probably don’t need reminding that his character Richard Roper is, to put it mildly, a bit of a bad egg.Perhaps this is to be expected. Although the works ofGilbert and Sullivanhave gained a reputation for being chummy, collegiate and a little pompous, For He is an Englishman is in fact a bitingly satirical piece of faux-patriotism. Although it sounds like something to be bellowed by tipsy Last Night of the Proms poshos, the song speaks to the kind of blind nationalism that bases exceptionalism purely on the location of one’s birth. “For he might have been a Roosian, a French, or Turk or Proosian,” it goes, “But in spite of all temptations to belong to other nations, he remains an Englishman.”No wonder the song has become the rallying cry of the rich and horrible. Both Muck and Roper’s sense of superiority by birthright drips out of them. There aren’t many songs that can nail this precise feeling with the sheer accuracy of For He is an Englishman.What’s interesting, though, is how its use has evolved over time. Prior to this year’s sudden burst, the song has been used here and there on television, and not always to denote villainy. Perhaps the best-known example is the episode ofThe West Wingthat paraphrases the song in its title, season two’s And It’s Surely to their Credit. Here, a couple of characters bicker about the song, unable to decide whether it is from HMS Pinafore or The Pirates of Penzance, before the episode concludes with most of the main cast singing it togetherIn all honesty it’s a little empty. The song is performed without any real thematic cohesion; it is simply a reference that allows some vaguely insufferable people to show everyone how well versed in musicals they are.View image in fullscreenSideshow Bob’s rendition to Bart Simpson is the gold standard performance of the tune.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarAnother show to feature the song without much meaning is House; in the opening episode of season six Dr House sings the song to mask the noise of him faking a urine sample. The wink here, of course, is that the actor who played House was actually an Englishman, Hugh Laurie, who clearly likes this song more than anything else on Earth. In fact, it is highly possible that Laurie is now the only actor to have performed this song twice on two different shows. He is almost certainly the only actor who has performed it in two different accents; in his native English inThe Night Manager, and in the chewy, geographically nonspecific American accent he had to adopt for House.However, despite this rush of new renditions, the gold standard for televisual For He is an Englishman usage remains The Simpsons’s Cape Feare, arguably the best episode of the best series ever made. After the rake joke, and the tattoo joke, and the “Bart, you want some brownie?” joke comes the moment where Bart Simpson stalls for time by flattering Sideshow Bob’s ego, asking him to perform HMS Pinafore in its entirety. He obliges, and his performance ends with a rousing blast of For He is an Englishman, concluding with a round of applause and a drop-down union jack.It’s perfect because it hits every aspect of the song with total ease. It has the pomposity ofThe West Wing, and exposes Sideshow Bob’s anglophile pretensions. Also, let’s not forget that Sideshow Bob is an utter bastard, so it covers the villain quadrant too.Obviously the fact that so many baddies are singing the song in 2026 speaks to how the UK is perceived at the moment – isolated, stuck in the past and out of touch, yet still oddly full of itself – but we still have some way to go before we can top The Simpsons. Perhaps let’s make Hugh Laurie stand on a rake when The Night Manager returns.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionKit HaringtonThe Night ManagerGilbert and SullivanThe West WingThe SimpsonsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But one woman has accused Kamel Daoud of having stolen her story – and the ensuing legal battle has become about much more than literary ethicsByMadeleine SchwartzTue 17 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 17 Feb 2026 09.58 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleEvery November, leading figures of French literature gather in the upstairs room of an old-fashioned Paris restaurant and decide on the best novel of the year. The ceremony is staid, traditional, down to the restaurant’s menu, full of classic dishes such as vol-au-vents and foie gras on toast. In pictures of the judging ceremony, the judges wear dark suits; each has four glasses of wine at hand.The winner of the Goncourt, as the prize is called, is likely to enter the pantheon of world literature, joining a lineage of writers that includes Marcel Proust and Simone de Beauvoir. The prize is also a financial boon for authors. As the biggest award in French literature, the Goncourt means a prime spot in storefronts, foreign rights, prestige. By one estimate, winning the Goncourt means nearly €1m of sales in the weeks that follow.In November 2024, the Académie Goncourt gave the prize to a novel by Kamel Daoud, a celebrated Algerian writer living in France. His victory came at a tense moment for France and its former colony. The relationship, never an easy one, had been strained by the Algerian state’s increasing political repression of its people and French involvement in the dispute betweenAlgeriaand Morocco over Western Sahara. (France has sided with Morocco, which claims sovereignty over the territory; Algeria has supported independence movements there.)Daoud’s own career has been shaped by this troubled relationship. Though he has long been a literary star in both countries, he moved to France in 2023, claiming he could neither “write nor breathe” in Algeria. Daoud’s French publisher, Gallimard, one of France’s largest, was prevented fromparticipating in the 2024 book fair in Algiers. No explanation was given but many suspected it was because Gallimard had published Daoud’s latest novel, Houris.Houris took on a subject that had long been controversial: Algeria’s civil war or “black decade”, a conflict between the government and armed Islamist groups over the course of the 1990s. Estimates of the number of dead vary; somego as high as 200,000. Massacres of civilians occurred across the country, many of them later claimed by Islamist groups.The period remains delicate to discuss. In 1999, a law was introduced that provided legal clemency to Islamist fighters who put down their weapons. In 2005, Algeria passed a reconciliation law that widened the amnesty. But unlike some such laws, which require some form of justice to be served to the perpetrators, this law “allows for official forgetting, without any reflection on the actions of either side”, as one historian told me. “The executioners just went home.”The reconciliation law isvery broadly worded, making it illegal “to use or exploit the wounds of the national tragedy to undermine the institutions of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, weaken the state, damage the reputation of all its officials who have served it with dignity, or tarnish Algeria’s image internationally”. The black decade is still not taught in Algerian schools. In interviews for the novel, Daoud dwelled on the law’s wide reach. The civil war, he said, is “a taboo subject that you can’t even think about”.Houris,whichwas not published in Algeria, tells the story of the war through a 26-year-old woman, Fajr or Aube (Dawn), who, as a child, survived a massacre at Had Chekala, a village where a real massacre took place in January 1998. In the novel, terrorists killed Aube’s family and cut her throat with a knife. The attack gave her a large scar across her neck: her “smile”, as she calls it. To breathe, Aube has undergone a tracheostomy, a procedure through which the neck is opened to access the windpipe. She wears a cannula, which she sometimes hides with a scarf. “I always choose a rare and expensive fabric,” she says. But the injuries from the attack mean that, two decades on, her voice is barely audible. For her, the scar is a sign of a history that many want to forget. “I am the true trace, the most solid of signs of everything we lived through for 10 years in Algeria,” she says.As the book opens in 2018, Aube finds herself pregnant with a girl whom she calls herhouri,the name of a virgin of paradise in the Muslim tradition. As she contemplates an abortion, she returns to the site of the massacre. The novel takes the form of an interior monologue between Aube and her unborn child. This is punctured by the introduction of Aïssa, a man who has collected stories of the civil war, which he rattles off like a human encyclopedia. He talks at length about the Algerian civil war and the reasons that it remains a controversial part of the country’s heritage. As he says, “there are no books, no films, no witnesses for 200,000 deaths. Silence!” The Goncourt judges praised Daoud for giving “voice to the suffering associated with a dark period in Algeria’s history, particularly that of women”.Eleven days after the Goncourt ceremony,a woman appeared on an Algerian news show. She wore a blue-and-white-striped shirt; her long hair was tied into a bun. This left her neck visible, and attached to it, some breathing apparatus with a cannula. She introduced herself as Saâda Arbane, 30. Daoud, she claimed, had stolen her personal details to make his bestseller. “It’s my personal life, it’s my story. I’m the only one who should determine how it should be made public.” For 25 years, she said, “I’ve hidden my story, I’ve hidden my face. I don’t want people pointing at me.” But, Arbane said, she had confided in her psychiatrist. “I had no filter, no taboos. I told her everything.” Her psychiatrist was Kamel Daoud’s wife.Arbane is now suing Daoud in Algeria and in France, through different cases that present her position from two different angles. In Algeria, her case centres on her medical records which, she claims, were stolen from a hospital in Oran and used as research material for Daoud’s book. In France, she is suing Daoud and his publisher Gallimard for invasion of privacy and libel.Daoud argues there is no basis for such claims, and that his work is based on many stories from the Algerian black decade. He has argued that it is not Arbane herself who is ultimately behind these cases, but that they are part of a wider attempt by the Algerian government to bring down prominent critics of the ruling regime.In France, where news about Algeria is closely followed, the cases have become caught up in larger questions about history, colonialism and international relations. “Kamel Daoud, from ‘invasion of privacy’ to the Franco-Algerian diplomatic battle,”read a headlineabout his case. The legal battle brings in a wide cast of political players. Arbane is represented by famous human rights lawyer William Bourdon and his associate Lily Ravon; Daoud’s lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont-Haïk, recently defended former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.The case against Daoud touches upon so many questions that haunt the literary world. To whom does a story belong? Is it acceptable to use another person’s tale for one’s own gain? Does the answer change when one person is a man, the other a woman; one person famous, the other the victim of an event that left her almost literally voiceless?But the more I tried to drill down on what really happened, the question seemed an even larger one. Daoud’s defence has hinged on his persecution by the Algerian state. But what kind of behaviour can persecution justify?Daoud is Algeria’s best-known writer. His work has been translated into 35 languages, and he regularly writes for French outlets about Algeria and contemporary affairs. “A brilliant, indeed dazzling, thinker,” is how one critic described him.Daoud was raised by his grandparents in a small Algerian town called Mesra, while his father, a policeman, worked in different parts of the country. As a teenager, he was attracted to Islamism but quit the movement at 18. “At a certain point, I no longer felt anything,” he later told the New York Times.In his early 20s, he turned to journalism, covering the Algerian civil war. In 1998, he reported on the massacre at Had Chekala, one of a number of villages where hundreds of people were killed during Ramadan by Islamist forces. Two years later, he started his own column in Le Quotidien d’Oran,the French-language paper in the coastal city of Oran. It was called “Raïna raïkoum”, meaning, roughly, “My opinion, your opinion”. He began to write short fiction, and in the 00s won acclaim for his short books and story collections. “He was very famous,” says Sofiane Hadjadj, his former editor at the Algerian publishing house Barzakh.View image in fullscreenKamel Daoud in 2024 after being announced as the winner of the Goncourt prize.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPAIn 2010, Daoud wrote a column for Le Mondein which he reimagined the story of the unnamed Arab man murdered in Albert Camus’s existentialist novelThe Stranger. He wrote from the perspective of the dead man’s brother, calling back the story told by the novel’s protagonist, a French man named Meursault.The column caught the attention of Hadjadj and his colleagues, who encouraged him to turn it into a novel which they published in Algeria in 2013.When the novel, The Meursault Investigation,was republished in France in 2014,it became a sensation. With Daoud’s clever conceit, the novel enabled the colonised to talk back to the colonisers through a rebuttal of one of France’s most cherished literary works, itself written by a white Frenchman born in Algeria. The novel, too, offered a complex critique of Algeria’s postcolonial development. “Kamel Daoud’s novel The Meursault Investigation may have attracted more international attention than any other debut in recent years,” wrote Claire Messud in the New York Review of Books.Daoud was welcomed with coverage across the English-speaking media. The Guardiancalled the book an “instant classic”, and the New York Times profiled him at length. In Oran, Daoud was already a star. But after the publication of Meursault, Hadjadj says, “There was an explosion.”The novel’s success brought Daoud unusual visibility for a writer. In Algeria, an imam accused Daoud of apostasy after one of his media appearances in which he questioned the role of religion in the Arab world.He also took a prominent place in French culture, writing a column from Algeria for Le Point,a conservative weekly, where he opined on everything from immigration to #MeToo. His writing was lyrical, sometimes impressionistic, and often returned to the dangers of fundamentalism of all kinds. “All my work,” he wrote in an introduction to a collection of the last decade’s columns, “insists on one point. ‘Be careful! A country can be lost in a minute!’”A frequent guest on TV and radio, Daoud was a notable Algerian voice in a culture that remains often dismissive, and sometimes vindictive, towards its former colony. When President Macron made a state visit to Algeria in 2022, he took the time to have dinner with Daoud.While Kamel Daoud’s star was rising, Saâda Arbane was figuring out the best way to move past a terrible tragedy. She was born in 1993 in a small town in Algeria to a family of shepherds. In 2000, Islamist terrorists murdered her parents and five siblings. No one knows if there was any motivation for the attack on their town; it’s likely that, as with many in the period, there was none. The terrorists cut Arbane’s throat and left her for dead. She was six years old.Arbane was first brought to a local hospital, then transferred to Oran, where she spent five months in a paediatric intensive care unit. From there, she was transferred to France, where she received a tracheostomy operation and was fitted with a cannula. After such an ordeal, “I don’t know that many would be still standing,” her aunt told me.One of the paediatricians in the Algerian health service, Zahia Mentouri, decided to adopt Arbane. Her adoptive family came from a distinguished lineage: Mentouri had led paediatric intensive care units across the country and briefly been minister of health and social affairs. Her adoptive father, Tayeb Chenntouf, was a well-known historian of Algeria who belonged to a Unesco committee on African history. Together, they lived in Oran.For some time, Arbane could only consume liquid. Although her family held out hope that surgery might allow her to speak more clearly, it was not possible to reconstruct her vocal cords. The attack left psychological scars as well. A medical report from 2001, after her transfer to France, describes how, at the beginning of a hospital stay in France, her only drawings showed plants surrounded by thorns. When she started drawing people, the same report states, they had all visible tracheostomies, covered up with scarves. (The report is included in Arbane’s evidence for her French trial.)Arbane had trouble in school in Oran. Few people could understand her. At first, she could not even whisper. “Everyone would stare at her cannula,” said one relative. Classmates called her “Donald Duck” because of her fractured voice. Even today, Arbane’s words are not always clear to those who don’t know her well. For this article, I spoke to her twice via Zoom, with her husband acting as a kind of interpreter, repeating what she had said.View image in fullscreenSaâda Arbane, right, with her lawyer Fatma Benbraham, during a press conference in Algiers in November 2024.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesGrowing up, Arbane almost never discussed what had happened to her. She did not bring it up with her family, several relatives told me, nor did they ask questions. “To be a child with a tracheostomy, to speak with a whisper, coughing through one’s neck, secreting and wiping snot from one’s neck: I was a freak show to kids and to many adults,” she told me.Her relatives describe Arbane as someone with unusual determination. “She completes every task she starts,” said one family friend. She spent the last year of high school in France. In 2016, she married and had a son, whom she credits with saving her life. She opened a beauty salon in Oran in her late 20s. “She has fairy fingers,” the family friend said.Arbane found comfort in riding, something that reminds her of her biological family, who kept horses. As a teenager, she competed internationally. An article in L’Écho d’Oran about the 2009 horse riding championship of the Maghreb, a high-level event, describes how “Saâda Arbane ‘knows the obstacles’; she jumps over them in silence, with determination and elegance”.In 2015, Arbane started to see Dr Aïcha Dahdouh, a respected psychiatrist in Oran, who was close to Arbane’s adoptive family. In Arbane’s recollection, she initially went to talk about issues she was having with her mother. Arbane met with Dahdouh in an office in the University hospital of Oran, sometimes with her mother, sometimes one on one. She found Dahdouh easy to talk to, and soon they “talked about everything”. Dahdouh, Arbane recalled, took notes during the sessions on pieces of paper which she put in a folder. (I attempted to reach Dahdouh via two email addresses and her telephone number, as well as through her husband, but she did not respond to these inquiries, nor to a detailed list of the claims made in this article.)The relationship between Arbane and Dahdouh, Arbane’s lawyers contend, was far closer than is normal between a patient and therapist. They became friends. In texts, Dahdouh wrote to Arbane in the informal “tu” rather than the more formal “vous”. “You’re an angel,” Dahdouh wrote in one message; another she signed “big kisses”. They had sons of a similar age, for whom they discussed organising outings such as pyjama parties. “The relationship started with the children,” Arbane said when we talked. In messages, Dahdouh referred to Arbane’s son as “min [sic] petit cheri” – my little darling. Dahdouh sent a picture of herself at the beach with their sons. Another picture shows them together standing by the water. Dahdouh solicited Arbane’s help renting out an apartment she owned with Daoud.Around the end of the Covid pandemic, in 2021 Arbane believes, she met up with Dahdouh along with their children. Dahdouh brought her husband. Despite his fame, Arbane didn’t know much about Daoud. “Reading isn’t my thing,” she told me. She sensed that he was surprised by her appearance. Dahdouh told her that she hadn’t shared any details about her background or the attack.In Arbane’s telling, a few weeks later, during Ramadan, Dahdouh and Daoud invited her over for coffee. Daoud told her that he wanted to write a book about her story. After she refused, he said that he would respect her decision and that there were many stories like her own. He gave her a book about the Emir Abd el-Kader, a 19th-century Algerian leader, renowned for his equestrian prowess, who fought against the French colonial invader.A short time later, according to the lawsuit, Dahdouh invited Arbane’s adoptive mother to her office and made the same offer on Daoud’s behalf. She said no and told Arbane. Her adoptive parents, Arbane says, had warned her to be careful. But they died in quick succession in 2022 and 2023. When Arbane brought up the book in a later session, Dahdouh told her, “I’m here to protect you.”The two continued their sessions until Dahdouh and her husband left for France in 2023. Afterwards, they stayed in touch. Though the situation was uncomfortable, Arbane said, she had made clear that she did not want her life to be the basis of anything Daoud was writing. Besides, she was confident that her most personal details were protected by patient-doctor confidentiality.Houriswas published in France in August 2024. Over the next few weeks, Arbane and her family began to receive calls and texts about the book. “I’m with a guy and his wife. They’re talking about Algeria,” a childhood friend texted Arbane in September. “He talked about a writer who published a book. And the story sounds like your life. 😱”Arbane forwarded it to Dahdouh. “Congratulations on the book,” she wrote.Dahdouh replied that she would bring her a copy. “The heroine has a daughter that she calls ‘ma houri’. The story sounds a bit like yours.”Arbane continued to ask Dahdouh for an explanation. A few weeks later, Arbane wrote to her again, “Hi Aïcha, I hope you’re doing well. I got a call today from a woman saying that there’s a book that talks about [my] story by Kamel.”The next day she received a response, much more formally written.“Dear Saâda, I hope you’re doing well. Kamel’s writing generally provokes a lot of reactions. Some people are saying the same thing about other characters … I’ll bring you the book and you’ll read it yourself. The thing that annoys [those people] is that the character named ‘Aube’ who sounds like you is a heroine.” Dahdouh added, “I hope the story doesn’t bother you too much.”Arbane recalls, “I had more and more questions in my head after each sentence.”Arbane says that Dahdouh gave her a copy of the book while visiting Algeria in October 2024. The copy was dedicated with a note from Daoud. “Our country has often been saved by courageous women. You are one of them. With my admiration, Kamel.” Still, Dahdouh warned her not to read the book as it might be too emotionally heavy for her.Arbane didn’t read it right away, and she continued her friendship with Dahdouh. A few days later, Arbane recalls, Dahdouh left her son at her house. When she came to pick him up, they began again to talk about the book. Dahdouh suggested that Daoud might give Arbane’s information to a film-maker for a possible adaptation. Arbane, she said, might benefit from money from the film and that it would allow her to buy an apartment in Spain, where her husband had family.“This confirmed my fears,” Arbane told me. Finally, she started to read the book. She says she didn’t sleep for the next three nights. “I felt betrayed, naked,” she told me. “The entire world was reading something that was mine.” Arbane’s relatives told me that her mental health deteriorated after the book came out. Daoud “slit her throat a second time”, a relative said.After reading the book, Arbane contacted a cousin of her adoptive father’s, who was a lawyer. On her advice, she went to the hospital in Oran where she had seen Dahdouh and requested her file. The hospital did not hand it over. She lodged a complaint on 18 November, according to her French lawyers. The judge asked for the file, she says, but the hospital said they had not found it.In total, Arbane’s lawyers count approximately 30 similarities between Arbane and “Aube” in the novel. Both Arbane and Aube are rare survivors of a terrorist attack in which their throats were slit. Both lost the ability to speak after the attack and could only whisper. Both received tracheostomies. Arbane’s biological parents were shepherds; Aube’s parents raised sheep. Just like Arbane, Aube describes being compared to Donald Duck and recalls how, for a time, she could only eat liquid food.Like Arbane, Aube lives in Oran; one of the apartments she lived in (including the neighbourhood, building letter and floor) is described in passing in the book. Arbane was adopted by a former minister of health, herself an adoptee; Aube was adopted by a famous lawyer, herself an adoptee. Arbane’s adoptive mother never celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid, during which sheep are traditionally slaughtered. The same is true of Aube’s adoptive mother. Both Arbane and Aube attended a high school called the Lycée Colonel Lotfi, owned a hair salon, and love perfume and horses.Arbane’s aunt, Fadhela Chenntouf, told me that although she and her niece were very close, when she read the novel, she discovered things about Arbane that she had never known. In the book, Aube’s tattoos recall her murdered family. Arbane also has a number of tattoos, including one that recalls her biological mother. “She never said that the tattoo had a meaning for her, but she told Aïcha Dahdouh,” said Chenntouf.Arbane’s lawyers claim that she confided in her therapist about the difficulties she’d had when she discovered she was pregnant, as Aube does in the novel. Like Aube, Arbane had acquired three pills for a possible abortion, though abortion is illegal in Algeria. Like Aube, Arbane did not take the pills and gave birth to a child. Even the scar across their neck is the same length: 17cm.Daoud’s response to the Arbane case shifted in the months after the publication of his novel. At first, in a 3 September interview with the French magazine Le Nouvel Obs,he said he hadbeen inspired by a “woman with a breathing tube, though she was not the only mutilated one”. This was some weeks before Arbane’s appearance on Algerian TV, in which she accused Daoud of having used her life story for the novel. The week after that, on 21 November 2024, Arbane’s Algerian lawyer, Fatima Benbraham, held a dramatic press conference, in which she announced that Arbane was suing Daoud and held up pictures of her scars. “He built his success on Saâda’s misery. For a second time, he strangled my client’s voice,” she said. “He stole her life, her story and her pain and he leaves her without any life at all.” The lawyer appeared on a TV talkshow to launch a highly personal attack on Daoud, his new life in France and his family. (Benbraham did not reply to a request for comment. Arbane changed lawyers in July 2025.)Benbraham also filed a separate case against Daoud and Dahdouh on behalf of an association of victims of terrorism, on the ground that the book violated the 2005 reconciliation law which restricts discussion of the black decade. The law has only been invoked three times before, always in connection to political statements and never against a novelist.After these developments, Daoud began to speak about Arbane in a different way. On 3 December 2024,almost two weeks after Benbraham’s press conference in Algiers,Daoud wrote an article in Le Point in whichhe referred to Arbane as a puppet of the Algerian government. “This victim of the civil war is being manipulated to achieve a goal: to kill a writer, defame his family and save the deal between this regime and these killers.” He continued: “Apart from the visible injury, there is no common ground between this woman’s unbearable tragedy and the character Aube.” In the same article, he claimed that Arbane’s story was well known in Oran, citing an article in a Dutch paper published two years before his book, though this article had only the barest outlines of her story. He did not acknowledge that he knew Arbane personally, nor that his wife had been her psychiatrist.In February 2025, further evidence emerged that seemed to support Arbane’s claims. The French investigative outlet Mediapart revealed that the novel’s working title had been “Joie” or joy, a translation of the name Saâda. According to Mediapart, an earlier version of the text carried the following dedication: “To an extraordinary woman, the real heroine of this story.” (Daoud did not respond toMediapart.Gallimard did not respond to several requests for comment.)Last summer, I contacted Daoud over email. He responded almost immediately, thanking me for my interest. Over the next few months, we exchanged a few more brief emails. He declined to meet. The case that had been launched against him, he wrote, could not be fully understood without investigating “the abuses, mass arrests, the regime of terror, the suppression of the press and multiple imprisonments in Algeria”.View image in fullscreenKamel Daoud in Strasbourg, France, in April 2025.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyIn recent years, Algeria has become increasingly repressive. In 2019, a popular uprising called the Hirak movement fought against the possible fifth term of president Abdelaziz Bouteflika. It was a broad movement: “Men and women, all classes, all political backgrounds as well,” according to Mouloud Boumghar, a law professor who has worked extensively on human rights in Algeria. But it was crushed with the beginning of the Covid lockdowns.Bouteflika resigned in 2019 and died in 2021. Since 2019, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who had served in various roles in Bouteflika’s cabinet, has been president. Today, Boumghar says, no one can stand out, no voice can speak up without risking prison. “The regime once clamped down more intelligently,” he says. Now, “it’s brutal”. Since President Tebboune came to power, Daoud wrote to me, almost “no press conference, no debate, no media or partisan campaign has been allowed outside official communications”. Dozens, even hundreds of people have been arrested. “Influencers, activists, publishers, singers, military personnel, opponents.” In France, the persecution of the French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal has attracted particular attention. In 2025, Sansal, a critic of the Algerian regime, wassentenced to five years in prisonfor “attacking national unity”. President Macron stated that that Algeria was “dishonouring” itself in imprisoning the writer.Daoud was not always such an outspoken critic of the Algerian government. For much of his career, according to his former editor Hadjadj, Daoud “wasn’t an ally of power, but he wasn’t an opponent”. He pointed out that President Tebboune had chosen to grant a rare interview to Daoud and a colleague at Le Pointin 2021. But in the years that followed, as the government became increasingly repressive, Daoud intensified his writings against the regime, and the regime seemed to turn on him. In Le Point,Daoud described how, after he hosted Macron in Oran in 2022, guests at their dinner were “subjected to legal harassment” and the restaurant owner was forced to close his establishment for some time. “I myself faced online harassment, troll farms and surveillance.” As Franco-Algerian relations deteriorated, he felt that “the machine was about to close in on me. I am a writer, French-speaking, Arabic-speaking, independent and unique. I was called a ‘traitor’.”In August 2023, Daoud received a phone call from the head of the secret service in Oran. He asked whether Daoud could stop by his office for coffee. “The invitation ‘to come have a coffee’ is always the prelude to an arrest in Algeria,” Daoud later wrote. Shortly thereafter, he and his family left Algeria for Paris. “When we arrived in Paris at 6am, in summer, I immediately started writing Houris,as though it were a sacred dictation.”Since Arbane launched her legal action, Algeria has issued two international arrest warrants for Daoud; in June, he cancelled a trip to Italy out of fear of extradition. Daoud told me that, unable to return to Algeria, he has recently missed his mother’s funeral. He has pointed to the virulence of the Algerian state’s response as an explanation for the current affair. In his email to me, Daoud noted that many of the individuals who had propagated and backed the case against him had ties to the regime, suggesting that this was further evidence of a state-led campaign against him.(Arbane’s lawyers in France have filed another suit, for libel, against Daoud and the newspaper Le Figaro for a statement in which he dismissed the idea that Arbane had a case of her own and suggested that she was a tool of the Algerian state. Arbane says that she does not follow politics.)In his emails, Daoud did not address Arbane’s specific accusations, but stated that “the character Aube is imagined, a pure fiction”. In December, I sent him a detailed list of questions relating to specific claims in this article. In response, I received an email from his lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont-Haïk, who said she and her colleagues had provided long and detailed legal submissions to the court, as well as evidence showing that “Madame Arbane’s story goes against reality”. She did not offer anything specific. When I wrote again in February to ask whether she would share this evidence, she did not reply.Among the literary community in Algeria, the Arbane-Daoud legal battle has been viewed with a certain ambivalence. Daoud is a polarising figure in his home country, and as he has gained readers in France, he has lost admirers in Algeria. Faris Lounis, an Algerian literary critic who has written extensively about Daoud, believes he is successful because he tells French conservatives what they want to hear. “The Algerian writer has to be useful,” he told me. (Lounis cited a column where Daoud accused French Muslims of being “useful idiots” for the French left.) In his columns in Le Point, Daoud often criticises Algeria – a fact that is interpreted differently, several people told me, coming from a writer who now lives in France. Another Algerian reader described Daoud’s columns to me in this way: “It’s Arabs, Muslims, Arabs, Muslims, morning, noon and night – that’s only a slight caricature.”And although Houriswas well received in France, its reception among Algerian readers and scholars of the country has been more complicated. Tristan Leperlier, a scholar of novels of the black decade, has described Hourisas a “heavily political novel, bogged down in cliched images, caricaturing oppressed yet heroic women and violent imams”. Leperlier and others point out that numerous books and films in Algeria have been made about the civil war, many of them by women, something Daoud has largely passed over in interviews.Yet no one disputes that the Algerian state really has made life impossible for Daoud. According to Lounis, “There’s the use of Saâda Arbane’s story [by Daoud] … That’s one fact. And there’s another: the instrumentalisation of the case by the Algerian state.” “He’s living through something absolutely terrible,” says Hadjadj, who described the Algerian media campaign against Daoud as a “lynching”. But, he notes, it has ended up “overshadowing Saâda’s story”.In France, the Daoud case almost immediately got mixed up with that of Sansal, said Elisabeth Philippe, a prominent literary critic and an editor at Le Nouvel Observateur. “Very quickly, we made it into a political issue,” she told me. From that point on, it was inevitable that the story would be swirled together with the rancorous public conversation about the Franco-Algerian relationship, which, in France today, almost always ends up becoming a conversation about Islam and immigration. To take one example of many: on French TV in June, during a discussion about Boualem Sansal, the contrarian writer Pascal Bruckner called Algerians a “brainless people”. “They kicked us out,” he said, “and now they want to come here.”Amid the furore, Hourishas sold over 450,000 copies and English rights have been bought. In July, when Daoud appeared on the radio station France Inter, the conversation was dominated by the jailing of the Algerian writer Sansal. The question about Arbane focused on Daoud’s feelings, rather than the substance of her allegations. “Between these legal trials, Boualem Sansal’s fate in prison, the pain of exile, but also the recognition you have achieved as a popular writer, how did you live through and cross this year full of headwinds?” (Sansal was released from prison in November 2025.)The legal case in France is still ongoing. Arbane’s French lawyers have focused on the question of privacy infringement. They seem to have precedent on their side. Thirteen years ago, William Bourdon, the lawyer for Arbane, won a case against a French author who was found to have used details about her husband’s former partner in a novel. She and her editor had topay €40,000 in compensation. Arbane’s case in Algeria appears to have stalled. Her lawyer there did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One source, a journalist, speculated that the Algerian authorities may be waiting for the outcome of the case in France.Daoud has built his career on his singularity: an Algerian man from a small town who ended up rewriting a Nobel laureate, a writer who can speak to both an Algerian audience and a French one. In a short book published last year, he described his pride at being “unfaithful to rigidity, to fixity … a proponent of plurality, multiplicity, variance and wandering”. The book’s title is Sometimes, One Must Betray.But pushing against an authoritarian regime, which requires a stubborn self-belief, can impose its own kind of rigidity. In our exchanges, Daoud presented himself as fighting against a larger Algerian machine. “I attempted to illustrate the long process of healing that ‘Aube’ courageously undertook, but which Algeria itself rejects; instead, it is the writer who is criminalised for his work, while those responsible for Algeria’s bloody decade enjoy pensions and total impunity.”Hourisis a novel about sacrifice. Aube describes herself as an unwitting sacrifice of both the terrorists of the civil war and the modern state. She compares herself and her injury to that of animals slaughtered during the religious festival of Eid. Daoud appears to be asking about the sacrifices that victims of the civil war have been asked to make in order for the Algerian state to move forward. What have modern Algerians been asked to conceal, to forget, to suppress for the sake of their country? In our exchanges, he suggested that he, too, had sacrificed. To write about the civil war, he said, was to expose himself to danger. “The period is taboo; whoever talks about it risks going to jail.”To write someone’s story, as Arbane alleges, is to demand a different kind of sacrifice. Over and over, in reading Daoud’s many responses to the legal cases, I noted how Arbane, her claims, her person, were absent from his view of the work he had done. For each specific point raised about Arbane, Daoud’s response would turn to the crisis in Algeria, or the forgotten civil war, deflecting questions about a single, living woman with comments about 200,000 dead.The real Scandi noir: how a film-maker and a crooked lawyer shattered Denmark’s self-imageRead moreTowards the end of Houris,Aube returns to Had Chekala, “to the heart of her own story”. The novel’s plot, until then tightly controlled, appears to unravel. The pace speeds, the characters take on the sheen of allegory. The village is filled with mysterious donkey heads. An imam in a mosque is also a butcher. It is implied that he and his twin brother participated in violent acts during the war. Aube is attacked and tied up in a shed. But before her throat is cut one last time, she is saved unexpectedly by Aïssa.In the midst of all this, Aube tries to speak but she cannot produce a sound. Her voice “rustles like crumpled leaves” and “scatters in handfuls of sand”. She begins to cry. Why did she come all of this way only to find herself locked away? Why is she the only survivor who seeks the truth about the war? She thinks to herself, “I was an offering wondering what the point of its sacrifice had been.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readAlgeriaEmmanuel MacronIslamAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her ex-husband, Dominique, who will almost certainly be in jail for the rest of his life for drugging and raping his wife and recruiting 50 men over the internet to do likewise, takes his place among the monsters of our age. In his absence, the reader may experience a version of what happened in Gisèle Pelicot’s own family – namely, the misdirection of anger towards her.I have read enough books by female survivors of male sexual violence to say with confidence that Hymn to Life is unique. Pelicot – she decided to keep her married name in the interests of giving those of her grandchildren who share it a way to be proud rather than ashamed – was 67 when her husband of almost 50 years was arrested in 2020 for upskirting women in a supermarket in Carpentras, a small town in the south-east ofFrancenear the couple’s retirement home in the village of Mazan. When the police investigation uncovered a cache of videos and photos in which an unconscious Pelicot was shown being sexually assaulted by scores of men, she entered a nightmare.A Hymn to Life is alive with the kind of detail that wouldn’t look out of place in a good novel, but it’s the expression it gives to something glimpsed at during the trial that makes it so singular; namely, the transformation of Gisèle Pelicot from a self-avowedly ordinary woman, “content with my little life”, into a figure of astonishing power. After her husband’s arrest, she moved from Mazan to the Île de Ré, where in an effort to share her state of mind with new friends she told them she’d “been struck head-on by a high speed train”. (In a moment of grim humour, one neighbour took her literally and remarked, “the surgeon who had rebuilt my face had done an excellent job”.) Detailing what it took to emerge from this state to become a national – if not global – icon is the unsparing mission of the book.Part of Pelicot’s renewal entailed confronting a question that lurked in the minds of millions of observers during her husband’s trial: how could she not have known? She writes wretchedly of “the shame of having understood nothing – of feeling like an idiot in the eyes of others, and in my own.”. To that end, the book is a detective story in which the reader accompanies Pelicot back through her memories in search of clues overlooked. Was it significant that her husband came from a violent, sexually abusive family governed by a father who brutalised them? Was his behaviour linked to “our patriarchal, sexist society” – words, she writes, “I would never have uttered before”? Had her own beloved mother not died of cancer when Gisèle was nine, might she have been less quick to marry this person?The worst thing about being a victim, she writes, is being lectured – by her children, by court psychologists, by the pressBoth Pelicot and her husband are from rural backgrounds two generations removed from poverty. But while Dominique struggled to stay employed, Pelicot thrived, rising from an entry level job as a secretary at an energy company to a management position. She wonders if her success fuelled her husband’s resentment. And then there was the couple’s sex life. Sifting for evidence, she puts before us Dominique’s decades-old request for anal sex and to film them in bed. If she had indulged him, she wonders, might his offences have been forestalled?This last thought experiment will be recognised by anyone who has been involved with an abuser and pursued the logic that by acting differently, they might’ve altered the outcome. Or as Pelicot puts it: “I might have prevented it all, I might have saved us.” In the days and weeks after her husband’s crimes were revealed, she sought refuge in memories of the happy times, urging her three children to remember that Dominique had been a good dad, a form of denial that upset them so violently that for a while, of her three kids, two weren’t speaking to her. (They have since reconciled).The most serious rift was with her daughter, Caroline, who has written her own memoir and with whom Pelicot was at loggerheads for months. Whereas Caroline “broke down”, growing so distraught she spent a night in a psychiatric unit, her mother returned home from the police station and did her husband’s laundry. “Putting on a brave face was all I knew how to do,” writes Pelicot, but it went further than that. When the weather took a turn for the worse, she worried that Dominique would be cold in jail and dropped off a sweater. “What is left for a woman my age,” she laments, “when she doesn’t have a husband any more, just her children and grandchildren?”I’ll confess, this is where I lost it; the abject thrust of a sentiment in which Pelicot seems to register the loss of a husband – any husband – more forcefully than the violence her actual husband had done to her. She explains that she is of a generation of women for whom, “the principal axis of our lives was the man we had married”, and that this conditioning can’t be undone overnight. If we’re angry with Pelicot, she’s angry right back. The worst thing about being a victim, she writes, is being lectured – by her children, by court psychologists, by the press – that there’s a right and wrong way to do it. How dare we, she implies, and of course she is right.The trial took place in 2024 and occupies only the last fifth of the book; “It was those bastards I wanted in the spotlight, not me,” she writes of her decision to open proceedings to the public, giving rise to her famous statement and the subtitle of the book, “shame has to change sides”. She wrestles with the word “dignified”, often used to describe her in that period and which she finds coded and judgmental – another incitement to silence. While the horrific rape videos play in court, Pelicot stares fixedly at her phone, scrolling through happy photos of her grandkids. Her courage, she writes, comes from the memory of love from her mother and from the women who gather outside the court every day to support her. “This crowd saved me.”By the end of the book, by feeling her “way forward at my own pace”, she reaches a place where she is able “slowly and painfully” to let her husband go. He is “a pathetic creep”, she writes, but she won’t be bullied into arriving at someone else’s conclusion. “I know my story has fuelled disgust for men, but it has not done that for me.” The memoir ends not only in defiance of her abusers, but of those observers who would bend her story to a different, more strident conclusion. Instead, this: she meets a man, Jean-Loup, falls in love and moves in with him. What can one possibly say but bravo? “The feeling persists: love is not dead.”A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides by Gisèle Pelicot, translated by Natasha Lehrer and Ruth Diver, is published by Bodley Head (£22).

The actor turned writer Sophie Ward likes to fuel her novels with philosophical conundrums and set herself complex writerly challenges. Her ingenious, Booker-longlistedLove and Other Thought Experimentswas structured around philosophical thought experiments, from Pascal’s Wager to Descartes’ Demon, with a chapter narrated by an ant living inside a character’s brain.The Schoolhouseexplored the ethics of self-directed schooling and of policing in a complicated cross-period procedural. Now she turns her attention to questions of justice, freedom and power in the 1970s United States, with a tripartite structure bringing together three women – two real and one imagined.It’s 1971: the Manson Family have just been found guilty and hundreds of thousands are marching against the Vietnam war. In the Netherlands, 25-year-old Andrea Dworkin escapes her abusive husband and attends a debate between Chomsky and Foucault on justice and power. Back in the US, the poet Muriel Rukeyser throws herself into protesting once again, though her lover, the literary agent Monica McCall, tells her rightly that her health won’t stand it. The third character is loosely based on the family history of Ward’s own Korean-American wife.Phyllis Patterson welcomes her son home to rural Illinois from the army base in South Korea, and attempts to build a relationship with her new Korean daughter-in-law and grandchildren. All three women are testing their own capacity for justice in an unjust world.It’s a clever idea for a novel, using the connections between the women as hinge points. Andrea goes on to become Muriel’s assistant, though their relationship never quite takes off on the page. And in the background is the imprisoned South Korean poet Kim Chi-ha. Muriel campaigns for his release and discovers a connection between him and Phyllis’s daughter-in-law, June, that enables Ward to draw Phyllis and Muriel’s stories together in the rather brilliant but also chaotically accelerated denouement.The tripartite structure generates problems for Ward to solve. The shifting perspectives mean that the individual sections can sometimes have the unsatisfactoriness of annual catchups with friends, rather than the intimacy of shared daily lives, especially as the years pass and we end up in 1975. It becomes harder to care about Andrea in particular, as she’s glimpsed publishing book after book, and fighting for revolution. It’s also a challenge combining real and imagined people. Ward does an impressive job at making Andrea Dworkin talk, animating her into speech, but when she writes out her thoughts as stark declarative sentences I found it awkwardly fake in ways I might not have with a made-up character. “She thought, This is it. This is my time. I am alive and I have work to do. I must start now.”The gain of the structure is the sense of a world unfolding in parallel across continents, as these women grapple with the shared dilemma of how to rise to the challenge of tolerance and fellowship. The real triumph of the book is Phyllis: a generous but querulous housewife who came into her own in the war, and now shares her bedroom with a chicken called Dolly. When Phyllis’s husband Boyd dies through an act of sacrifice on June’s behalf, Phyllis becomes aware of “anger like a stone in your stomach”, making it hard to forgive June.Phyllis’s achievement is finally to see her own cornfield in rural Illinois through June’s eyes, understanding that June stares at this field with such intensity because she misses her home landscape. This is movingly conveyed by Ward, as she shows Phyllis finally ridding herself of her stone, coming to understand that her daughter-in-law is as bright and free-spirited and quixotically determined as she is. It’s Soozie, Phyllis’s granddaughter, who brings them together, and who will take on the mantle of both women in the next generation. And the generosity required to sit back, and to let the next generation do it better, is shown in Muriel’s story too, as she accepts that she may fail the world and the world may fail her, but the work will be done regardless.There’s not much hope for justice in the wider world in this novel, any more than there is in ours now, and Ward seems quite consciously to be writing from one world to another. Andrea Dworkin learns here from Foucault and Chomsky between them that justice is always an instrument of power. Did Dworkin and Rukeyser and their circles succeed in making the world a little bit more just and a little bit more free, by placing a little bit more power in the right hands? Ward seems to be dramatising her own ambivalence about whether to rage against the loss of revolutionary activism and try to revive it, or to accept that loss and focus on justice in our personal lives. Certainly, the reverberations of revolution are felt by Phyllis, as she sees “how her life was part of these lives, that she existed in all these moments”, and learns to be both more powerful and more just. And, insofar as the revelation of the strength of sympathetic engagement is what the novel has always done best, Ward movingly demonstrates the need to use this to keep freeing ourselves, day after day.Lara Feigel is the author of Custody: The Secret History of Mothers (William Collins).

The McManus brothers’ Redux Redux is a decently handled example from the low-budget end. It traps a bereaved mother and a bratty tearaway in a Sisyphean revenge cycle, playing like an intimate version of Terminator where the credibility of 12-step grief recovery, rather than the future of humanity, is what’s at stake.Actually, Redux Redux is technically a multiverse film. Hailing from the only universe where multiverse travel has become possible, Irene (played by the directors’ sister Michaela McManus) uses what looks like a banged-up gas boiler to skip between different timelines. But there is one constant: she always ends up murdering Neville (Jeremy Holm), the short-order cook and child-killer who abducted her daughter. She hopes to find the one multiverse where her daughter is still alive. Instead, on her umpteenth payback, she interrupts Neville with 15-year-old Mia (Stella Marcus) cable-tied in his backroom.The loop functions nicely as a metaphor for the repetition-compulsion of trauma, with Irene locked into hatred, and her new ward showing unsettling enthusiasm for their business. Despite the temporal trimmings and some early jinks with the fellow grief survivor Jonathan (Jim Cummings) Irene serially picks up, the McManuses settle into a linear affair that doesn’t overly dally with the kinks and paradoxes of time/multiverse travel. It’s essentially centred on Mia’s attempts to give Irene the slip, as well as fleshing out (arguably not enough) the “underground railway” infrastructure for multiverse travel.The upside of this straightforwardness is a certain fleet-footed confidence as the McManuses imbue the road runs and shootouts, echoing through eternity, with aChristopher Nolan-esque inexorability. But if it has the style, the substance isn’t fully present until the closing act, which finally starts to make the timeline convolutions collide fully with the protagonist’s broken psyche. If it’s not quite devious enough overall, Redux Redux still opens up a punchy murder-revenge side alley for the genre.Redux Redux is on digital platforms from 23 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A corporate takeover suddenly means his ex-wife Dame V (Cantopop diva Sammi Cheng) is in charge and intent on replacing the regular hostesses there to schmooze clients with her “fighter jet” upgrades.No sooner do Foon and V start sparring about how the joint should be run, then they discover there’s a takeover within the takeover: playboy Prince Fung (Chun Yip Lo), V’s partner on the original deal, does the dirty on her and pulls out. As the contract’s guarantor, either V stumps up the $80m needed to buy EJ, or she is liable for the cancellation fee – when Fung plans to swoop in for a pittance. So the perennial soft touch Foon agrees to team up with his no-nonsense ex, all for the sake of saving nostalgic razzle-dazzle.Directed by Jack Ng – also responsible for2023’s smash legal drama A Guilty Conscience– Night King feels unfortunately retrograde in its parading of what the tabloids once called a “bevy of beauties”; they are only slightly individuated and mostly foils for catty comedy served up by Foon and his right-hand man Turf (Yeung Wai Lun). Compared to the likes of Hustlers, it’s also strangely coy and sanitised about what this courtesan work entails. The absence of rawness and chemistry carries over into V (the only truly proactive woman here) and Foon’s rekindled relationship; their spats about past disappointments and sharing “woes, not wealth” are nearly as contrived as the hostesses’ chat-up patter.The film juggles a number of plotlines – the race for Foon and the girls to up their numbers, a love triangle between him, V and a spare-wheel hostess (Fish Liew), and a late-breaking Ocean’s 11-style scam that is a foregone conclusion – without satisfactorily closing any. There’s the odd sharp line: “Bring them there and back again, like hobbits,” says Foon of the punters. But in terms of getting into the nitty-gritty of the hospitality and sex trades, this lounge-lizard glass-tip to bygone Kowloon feels behind the times.Night King is in UK and Irish cinemas from 20 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsHong KongDrama filmsAsia PacificComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Another week, anotherUkrainian filmabout the terrible toll of the war. This documentary from film-makerJuri Rechinskyfollows two evacuation missions in Ukraine: teams of volunteers transporting the elderly and frail from their homes to safety away from the front; and the operation to return the remains of fallen soldiers to their families. It’s a painful film, haunted by death, but also tender and moving, with a powerful message that compassion, love and resilience can be acts of defiance.It opens with the evacuation of the elderly from their homes to a processing centre in a former hospital (where one volunteer addresses them “comrade grannies”). From here they will be relocated to more permanent housing. As she prepares to leave her flat, one woman frets: “My hair is a mess.” An English volunteer called Elizabeth is all gentleness, smiles and patience as she clasps the woman’s hands in her own. Rechinsky also films women and children getting on to trains leavingUkraine, tugging along wheelie cases, babies bundled into their warmest onesies.The second focus of the film is the work done by forensics teams and the military to recover and identify the remains of soldiers killed in battle. A man built like a wardrobe called Oleksandr (the credits give his nickname as “Bulldozer”) does the difficult, exhausting and risky job of driving bodies around the country back to their families. His white Transit van has soldiers with angel wings painted on the side. As it passes through one town, people line the streets kneeling on the kerb to honour the dead.

Like a black sock that has infiltrated a wash-load of white bedsheets, the story has come out a dreary dull grey. The movie is stubbornly unintriguing despite a fine cast of actors doing their utmost. Even the almighty twist ending fails to pick up the pace.Jenny Seagrove plays Kate Rafter, a hardened correspondent haunted by PTSD. She’s back from a stint in Aleppo for her mum’s funeral and staying in her childhood home. Seagrove plays it imperiously, eyes flashing; Kate has witnessed terrible atrocities, and seems irritated by the smallness of the lives in her home town. But she is raw and damaged; there are flashbacks to Iraq where she befriended a young boy, and some unconvincing scenes of sessions with a psychologist trying to unpick the trauma of her childhood in a home terrorised by a violent alcoholic father. When Kate starts hearing a child crying in the next door house, no one believes her.Anna Friel gives a brilliantly messy and real performance as Kate’s alcoholic sister Sally, whose daughter has moved to Australia to get away from her. Sally’s husband Paul (Ben Miles) seems to be the sensible one, holding the family together. Back in Kate’s childhood home the creeping horror-movie shots and jangly clanging music tell us this is a place of darkness, but there is not much scope in the film to explore the idea that awful things can happen behind the closed doors of nice semi-detached houses as well as in war zones – and just not enough heat for the plot to thicken.My Sister’s Bones is on digital platforms from 23 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m at least 2% conscious’Read moreOften associated with the direct cinema and vérité movements, he never conducted interviews or staged events for his documentaries and used only natural lighting and diegetic sound, without voiceovers or scores. He did no research before embarking on each project, and turned up with a sense of curiosity, eager to learn.“Making a movie is always an adventure,” Wiseman said when accepting his Academy Award in 2016. “I usually know nothing about the subject before I start … I never start with a point of view about the subject, or a thesis that I want to prove. I also don’t do any research in advance of the shooting. I usually don’t know in advance what’s going to be shot, or what I’m going to stumble across in any day or any moment of any day.”He documented hundreds of hours of footage of his subjects, sifting through it in an intensive editing process that could last up to 10 months.Even though he was associated with the vérité mode of documentary making, he described his films as closer to “visual novels” than journalistic accounts.View image in fullscreenFrederick Wiseman at his editing desk, c.1978.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBorn in Boston, Wiseman attended Williams College then Yale law school. After graduating in 1954, he was drafted into the US army, where he served for two years as a court reporter, before studying law in Paris under the GI Bill. Returning to the US, he took up a teaching post at the Boston University Institute of Law and Medicine.It was during this time that Wiseman became interested in documentary film-making, producing the 1963 semi-documentary The Cool World, adapted from Warren Miller’s novel about life in a Harlem gang. Four years later, he made his directorial debut with Titicut Follies, which documented life at Massachusetts’ Bridgewater state hospital for the criminally insane.It was almost his last film: his harrowing account of the dehumanising treatment of the hospital’s residents was banned from public screening by the Massachusetts supreme court, and until 1991 it could only be screened privately to medical professionals. But Wiseman forged ahead, turning out three films in the following three years.Wiseman had a longstanding passion for theatre and dance, as shown in films such as La Danse (2009), which offered a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the Paris Opera Ballet, and Crazy Horse (2011) about the notorious Paris cabaret club.Menus-Plaisirs: Les Troisgros review – Frederick Wiseman’s mammoth feast for the eyesRead moreHis progressive political views were evident in his work, including films such asWelfare(1975) about the New York benefits system, though Wiseman said he had no interest in ideological film-making and resisted the notion that documentaries were forces for political or social change. Writing for Dox: Documentary Quarterly in 1994, he said: “Documentaries, like plays, novels, poems – are fictional in form and have no measurable social utility.”His most recent film, 2023’sMenus-Plaisirs – Les Troisgros, went behind the scenes at a renowned Michelin triple-starred restaurant in France.Talking about his approach to choosing subject matter, Wisemansaid in 2016: “Each film is also an opportunity, an opportunity to learn something about a new subject. I’ve been involved in a 50-year course in adult education where I’m the alleged adult who studies a new subject every year.“The variety and complexity of the human behaviour observed in making one of the films, and cumulatively, all of the films is staggering, and I think it is important to document kindness, civility and generosity of spirit as it is to show cruelty, banality and indifference.”Wiseman is survived by two sons, David and Eric, and three grandchildren, as well as Karen Konicek, his friend and collaborator, who worked with him for 45 years. His wife of 65 years, Zipporah Batshaw Wiseman, died in 2021.Explore more on these topicsFrederick WisemanDocumentary filmsDocumentarynewsShareReuse this content"

The resulting tragedy has a snarling, pent-up energy. Patrick Marber’s 1995 version, originally written for TV, unfolds in a similarly compact 75 minutes – but turns less on sex than a very British class warfare.We’re on the country estate of a Labour peer, on the night of the party’s 1945 election landslide. As the staff celebrate offstage – Chattanooga Choo Choo and In the Mood – John the chauffeur (Tom Varey) sinks a glass of his master’s best burgundy. Like Churchill, he says, it’s “robust, full-bodied – and finished”.View image in fullscreenPsychological pile-up … Liz Francis and Tom Varey in After Miss Julie.Photograph: Teddy CavendishSwaying in her full-skirted black frock, the peer’s daughter comes below stairs like a wheedling kitten, demanding attention in a voice of thin-beaten silver. Liz Francis’s Julie provokes, drinks (“Do you think I’m a dreadful lush?”), flirts. “Do I shock you?” she purrs. “Not as much as you’d like to,” retorts John.John is engaged to Christine the cook (an excellent Charlene Boyd, dog-tired but diligent) – but he and Julie fall into a combustible night and bleak morning after. Marber’s text shares a rebarbative gleam with his first plays, Dealer’s Choice and Closer. Steeped in spite, the writing is at its sharpest when at its meanest. “You’d shame a two-bit tart in Piccadilly,” sneers John, while Julie derides his beer swilling and “demob disaster” of a suit.Dadiow Lin’s intimate, assured production has a malicious clarity. Handsomely designed by Eleanour Wintour, her in-the-round staging reveals John’s fingermarks red on Julie’s shoulder. Marber delineates the psychological pile-up of Julie’s upbringing (“You don’t know what it’s like to be daddy’s special girl”) but the show doesn’t thrum with Strindberg’s unhinged, poisonous desire. The heroine might be “off her rocker”, but tragedy doesn’t land with inevitable force.It’s class that animates the disaster here – the election might promise a new dawn, but the characters can’t discard long-ingrained habits of deference or command. The country might seem on the cusp of change, but Varey’s eyes narrow with mortification, and he jumps to it with shoe polish and coffee grinder when his master calls.AtPark theatre, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrePatrick MarberreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not having any cash. ENO knows all too well how that particular predicament feels. Somehow, though, Jamie Manton’s new production of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s opera manages to make a virtue of thriftiness, yet still feels substantial.For a start, it’s big. In Brechtian style, the whole breadth and depth of the Coliseum stage is open: it feels almost as if this should be an immersive production, with the audience up there in the performers’ midst. Milla Clarke’s set, centred on a huge container, reuses elements that ENO regulars will recognise from productions long past, and the costumes look like the spoils from a charity-shop sweep – which fits the trashy aesthetic.View image in fullscreen‘Costumes like the spoils from a charity-shop sweep’… the ENO chorus nailing it at London Coliseum.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAnd it’s uneven – but then, so is the opera itself. There are longueurs in this story of exploitation and greed, set in a US desert dystopia. It first reached the stage in Berlin in 1930, and you might say that the feeling in the world now is not so very different, but Manton doesn’t give us obvious parallels or references to Trump and Vance. The joke is more on us. Those sucker tourists, initially in office wear, making their first appearance like extra audience members, lined up in the aisles and stood in the boxes.There are sparky touches, including the human megaphone that arrives to announce each scene, looking like a white-clad alien wearing the kind of conical collar your cat gets wrangled into after an operation. A tap-dancing hurricane limbers up passive-aggressively before threatening the townspeople with his belligerent fancy footwork.View image in fullscreen‘The tart with less of a heart than you think’ … Danielle de Niese, centre, with Zwakele Tshabalala, Alex Otterburn and Mark Le Brocq.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLizzi Gee’s choreography is also on show in some neat numbers involving treadmills as the characters trudge towards Mahagonny – including the Alabama Song, made famous outside the opera house byDavid Bowieandthe Doors, here delivered by Danielle de Niese. Benefiting more than most from the subtle amplification, she brings star quality to Jenny, the tart with less of a heart than you initially think. Simon O’Neill makes all Jimmy MacIntyre’s lines sound like Wagner, and Elgan Llŷr Thomas sings elegantly as Jack, even as he’s eating himself to death. Rosie Aldridge is a formidable Widow Begbick, cutting the whisky with liquid siphoned off from the tank next to the urinal. Jeremy Sams’ English translation is, characteristically, razor-sharp.In his first appearance as ENO’s music director designate – he takes up the post next year –André de Ridderkeeps the orchestra energised, but the stars are the chorus, onstage most of the time, who nail Weill’s tricky ensemble writing with a conviction that few opera company choruses worldwide could match. They deserve greater job security than they currently have.At the London Coliseum until 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsEnglish National Opera (ENO)OperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It screamed Finland or Sweden, not a sheep and deer farm in the Scottish Borders. It was the sort of isolated location that would set Ben Fogle’s heart racing in New Lives in the Wild. Two swans bugled my arrival. I felt a little embarrassed that all of it was mine.Sometimes, we need to escape to a place where the phone coverage is bad enough to make you believe you’re somewhere truly wild. Tiny Home Borders, hidden in rippling foothills 10 miles east of Hawick, is such a place. Last August, owners David and Claire Mactaggart opened a second two-person cabin on their farmland (the first opened in 2022) and I jumped at the chance to stay, swim, soak, and – crucially – switch-off.View image in fullscreenRed deer frequent the hills around the cabin.Photograph: Alba Images/AlamyThat first night, on the windblown deck a metre above the lapping water, I fired up the outdoor wood oven and tried to relax. But there was too much to do. First, I had a sauna. Then, I braved a cold plunge in the lochan and a rewarding soak in the burbling hot tub, with the smell of wood smoke filling my nostrils. A pizza followed beside the cabin’s crackling log burner, and later I stargazed using the cabin’s fabulous telescope.Everything is as eco as possible, with hemp insulation, solar panels and batteries, and reclaimed wood from the farmAs farms seek new ways to make money, farm stays and agritourism are, unsurprisingly a growing sector. According toVisit Scotland, the combined value of agritourism and farm retail could reach £250m by 2030, a rise driven by growing consumer interest in sustainable tourism. Fittingly, the country is to host the inauguralGlobal Agritourism Conferencein June, and the big topic of discussion within farming is not only the increasing costs of food production but how to diversify and do so sustainably.The Mactaggarts built their first tiny hut out of an old bale trailer, as an experiment more than anything else. The dream was to create an eco home away from home, with a mezzanine sleeping space above the lounge and kitchen, and with drama to match the setting below Rubers Law, a mini Ben Nevis on the banks of the River Teviot. Then, quickly, one cabin became two, the second built far out of sight of the other. Plans are afoot for a third cabin in another glen on the farm. And everything is as eco as possible, with hemp insulation, solar panels and batteries, reclaimed wood from the farm – and no wifi.A 90-minute drive from Edinburgh, the location is a great base for exploring an undervisited part of the country. “The Borders is nothing more than a drive-through for many visitors coming north,” Claire said. “It’s a beautiful area, but it’s one so few know about,” David added.View image in fullscreenHawick’s main street.Photograph: Allan Wright/AlamyBeside the location, breakfast is one of the delights of a stay. Fresh bread. Salty butter. Homemade marmalade. Farm eggs, when the hens are laying. Coffee on the deck and a set of binoculars provided. On my first morning, the sky shone saltire blue.Wildlife adds to the picture. Red deer outnumber people in these hills, so with wellies on after breakfast, I headed up the gentle slopes of Rubers Law to look for the Borders’ Big Five: bellowing deer, plus sheep, fox, pheasant and red squirrel.This town of textile weavers is full of cosy cafes, craft shops and tweed retailers that are perfect for a hit of winter warmthI passed along a muddy single track where wildflowers and wild garlic starting to sprout below hawthorn. Ahead, I saw two vicar-collared male pheasants, then, farther up the brae, five enormous hind deer that had come down from the cold of the hill. In the distance, where the path ended, I could see ducks, sheep, cattle and horses. It was Old MacDonald Had a Farm sprung to life.Few parts of the Borders are lovelier than historic Hawick. This town of textile weavers is full of cosy cafes, craft shops and tweed retailers that are perfect for a hit of winter warmth, and the centre is stitched together by four bridges, but also by mills for some of the world’s best-known knitwear manufacturers, includingHawicoandLovat Mill.Perhaps most striking isJohnstons of Elgin, home to a visitor centre, cafe and showroom designed to showcase the appeal of Borders knitwear. Thanks to Hawick’s longstanding tradition, its cashmere, merino and tweed pieces are now coveted by the biggest names in haute couture: Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren.After lunch at nearbyDamascus Drum, a cafe-bookshop decorated with flat-weave rugs, I joined a guided tour of Johnstons of Elgin’s newly extended operation atEastfield Mill, which opened last August. The mill is labyrinthine and atmospheric, home to hundreds of knitters, needle-workers and machines, all hand-finishing, stitching and whirring. Next to this is a yarn library holding 18 tonnes of kaleidoscopic colour, from gorse yellow to heathery purple.View image in fullscreenMike MacEacheran found plenty to do around the cabin.Photograph: Mike MaceacheranMy last stop was theBorders Distilleryin the town’s former hydroelectric plant, a fitting place to finish on a winter’s day. With the rain pouring outside, the sky dark as slate, a glass of blended Scotch at the tour’s end from distiller David Shuttleworth felt like a blessing. The glass smelt of green apples and grass, and I was perfectly able to picture the Borders farms that grow the barley for the spirit’s malt.Hiking an unruly but beautiful new coast path in south-west ScotlandRead more“The whisky industry is about storytelling and ours is tied to Hawick’s landscape,” said David. “The Teviot brought us here and all our malt comes from 20 miles around the distillery.” That also translates to a low carbon footprint and a community-driven vision that, combined with a takeaway miniature dram, left me feeling heartened.Back at the cabin, it was late, and, out there in the darkness, I sat under the deck’s awning in the rain, my glass of whisky drained. What a great wee place Hawick is, I thought. What a place of rural community and inspiration. And hopefully many newcomers will agree with the Mactaggarts – that this is a place that’s been overlooked by too many for too long.The trip was provided byVisit ScotlandandTiny Home Borders.

And, last, give it a rest: “Your chicken will be better for sitting for 15-20 minutes, and will still be steaming hot when you cut into it.”The expansion on those rules is to salt the bird really well both inside and out, Smith adds: “And if you can leave it in the fridge for an hour to a day ahead, fantastic!” For Mike Davies, chef director ofThe Camberwell Armsin south London, submerging the bird overnight in a solution of water, salt, sugar and aromatics (lemon, bay, peppercorns being natural bedfellows) is essential: “Brining feels cheffy, but in reality it’s quite straightforward. You just need a big enough container.”Fat-wise, Anna Tobias, ofCafe Decoin London, covers her chicken in neutral vegetable oil (rapeseed or sunflower, say), seasons, then pops half a lemon and a sprig of rosemary in the cavity, before turning the bird upside down to roast. “That’s maybe a bit random, but Margot [Henderson] always did that when I worked for her, so that’s what I do.” The reason being it crisps the underside of the thighs. “For a 1.75-2kg chicken, roast it upside down for half an hour at 200C (180C fan), then flip it the right way up and give it another half-hour.” Tobias never rests it, mind – “the skin goes flabby.” Davies, meanwhile, was taught by his mum to put butter under the skin, which he does to this day. “It bastes the chicken through the cook, and if you rub the fat on the skin, it helps moisten it. The main thing that’s going to give you crisp skin, though, is the skin being dry in the first place.”A slight tweak would be to spatchcock the chicken. “It then cooks slightly faster, so there’s less likelihood of overcooking the breast, and a high likelihood of lovely crisp skin and succulent legs,” Smith says. It’s a simple thing to do, too: “If you’re dubious, scissors take it to a lower level of effort; you’re just cutting down both sides of the backbone and that’s it.”You could also mix up your marinade or rub. “Anything that you might think to put on a chicken thigh or leg would be delicious on a roast chicken,” Smith says, whether you head to the deep south, India or Thailand. He also repeatedly returns to the OG, but varies how it’s eaten: “On a Monday with salad, then more leftovers with pasta or potato wedges.” Essentially, roast chicken performs well with a whole bunch of things, although for Tobias roast potatoes are tops. “Anything else is negotiable.”Got a culinary dilemma?

This crisp, savoury pancake originates from Hue, the historic capital of Vietnam’s central region. Traditionally served with a rich hoisin dipping sauce, my take swaps that out for a lighternước chấmwith sesame seeds. It stays true to the spirit of the original, though, preserving its joyful texture and bold, satisfying flavours, while using more accessible ingredients.Bánh khoái (joy pancake)This is just as joyful without the prawns: swap them for smoked or marinated tofu, and serve with sweet soy sauce for dipping. Purple perilla (also known as shisho leaves) is available in most Asian food stores.Prep10 minCook25 minServes48 tbsp vegetable oil4 eggs, beaten280gcooked and peeled king prawns(jumbo shrimp), or ready-cooked prawns4 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped200gbeansprouts4 tsp crispy fried shallots, to garnishFor the batter100grice flour25gplainflour½ tsp salt1 tsp sugar½ tsp baking powder1 tsp ground turmeric300mlcoconut cream(notcoconut milk)For the sesame nước chấm2 tsp white sesame seeds400mlnước chấm(Vietnamese fish sauce)For the salad½ fresh pineapple, peeled and cored1 star fruit, or green (unripe) mango2 baby gem lettuce,leaves separated80gpea shoots120grocket25gThai basil25gpurple perillaIn a large bowl, whisk all the batter ingredients until smooth. In a small bowl, stir the sesame seeds into the nước chấm and set aside.Put a 20cm cast-iron skillet or nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, add two tablespoons of oil and, when it’s hot, pour in about 75ml (five tablespoons) of the batter, swirling the pan to coat the base evenly. Drizzle over a tablespoon of beaten egg, then sprinkle over some prawns, spring onion and beansprouts (if you like them softened; if not, save them for the salad), then leave to cook for about two minutes, until the base is crisp and golden.Fold the pancake in half to enclose the filling, and transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining oil, batter and filling to make four pancakes.Slice the pineapple and star fruit or mango, arrange them and the remaining salad ingredients on a platter and put in the centre of the table. Garnish with crispy fried shallots.To eat, wrap pieces of pancake in lettuce with the herbs and fruit, dip into the sesame nước chấm, and enjoy every joyful bite.This recipe is an edited extract from One Pan Vietnam, by Thuy Diem Pham, published by Quadrille at £22.Explore more on these topicsFoodVietnamese food and drinkShellfishSeafoodVegetablesMain courseFruitrecipesShareReuse this content"
