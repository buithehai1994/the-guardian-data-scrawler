He should urge Trump to force an end to the Palestinians’ agonyFri 25 Jul 2025 11.31 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareSo great is the despair, so intense the desperation, that the hopes of the Palestinians of Gaza now rest on a man who covets their land and wants to see them gone. The man in question isDonald Trump– and this weekend, there is a rare chance to push him to do the right thing.There should be no mystery as to what that right thing is. Ideally, it would mean the US president using his leverage to force the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, into ending the nearly 22-month war in Gaza. But if that’s too much to ask, there is an even more pressing demand that Trump should be making right now: that Israel lift all restrictions, remove all bureaucratic impediments, and flood Gaza with the food and medicine the people thereso urgently need– and that it happen immediately.This is a case that should not even need to be made. It is so starkly obvious, most plainly in the images that this week shocked the world. The woman holdinga skeletal childon the front page of the Guardian, the emaciated baby on the front of the Daily Express, haunt anyone who glimpses them. Once seen, they cannot be unseen.Similarly, you cannot unhear thevoice of the Gazan motherwhose greatest pain is not her own hunger, but her inability to feed her daughter. You cannot unlearn that doctors in Gaza’s few remaining emergency rooms are themselvesfainting from lack of food. Or that the BBC, AP, AFP and Reuters news agencies havejoined togetherto warn that the reporters on the ground on whom they rely – because Israel continues to deny journalists free access to Gaza – are unable to work because they are starving. Or that aid workers themselves, like the people they want to help, are now “wasting away”, in the words of ajoint statementfrom more than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups, including Médecins Sans Frontières, Save the Children and Oxfam.Israel trying to deflect blame for widespread starvation in GazaRead moreIsrael insists that plenty of aid gets into Gaza; it posts videos showinghundreds of containersinside the strip, which it says are just waiting to be picked up and distributed by the UN and other agencies. It’s this “collection bottleneck” that is the problem, it says. The UN counters that it cannot get from Israel first,the authorisation it needs to transport aidthrough areas declared by Israel to be military zones, and second, a commitment that Palestinians who approach aid convoys won’t come under fire.You can see why the latter is essential, given thatmore than a thousand Palestinians, guilty of nothing more than being hungry and desperate, have been, according to the UN, gunned down at or close to food distribution points run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the joint US-Israeli body that puts the work previously done by the UN and others into thetrigger-happy handsof US private contractors and the IDF. Handing out food at just four – as opposed to hundreds – of sites, which are sometimes open for as little as11 minutes, the GHF operation was this week branded “a sadistic death trap” by one UN official.It’s no use Israel complaining of bottlenecks and the like. This is a country with the technical knowhow and ingenuity tohit nuclear and other targetsin distant Iran and toeliminate Hezbollah fightersby means of their own pagers. If they wanted to ensure the starving of Gaza received food, water and medicine, if they had the will, they could make it happen right now. (Note Friday’s decision, doubtless in response to the current international outcry, to allowairdrops of aidfrom Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.) It is a political choice Netanyahu is making, an unconscionable one, using the flow of aid as a bargaining chip in his ongoing and so far fruitless ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, just as it is a political choice by Hamas to refuse to make the concessions that might ease the horror being visited on their own people.If Netanyahu and Hamas lack the will to end this nightmare, that leaves the one man who can surely force an end to it: Trump. The US arms and sustains Israel. It is largely US-supplied weapons that, according to the Haaretz newspaper, allow Israel to rain “more than 1,000 bombs and missiles down onGazaevery week”, even now, when so much of the territory has been reduced to rubble. If Trump insists this war must end, it will surely end. If he insists that the children of Gaza must eat, they will eat. That is the power of his office, and of his particular hold on Netanyahu: unlike Joe Biden, this US president has no Donald Trump over his shoulder. There is no one else for Netanyahu to turn to.Gaza is starving. So are its journalists | Jodie GinsbergRead moreWould Trump issue that directive, telling the Israeli prime minister that enough is finally enough? We’re told that he cannot bear to see images of suffering on TV, that his aversion to US military entanglements partly stems from that revulsion. It’s also clear that his ego longs for the one trophy that has eluded him, and which, to his undying fury, was handed to his first predecessor. He wants to be like Barack Obama and win a Nobel peace prize.And yet, this is also the man whose plan for Gaza is toempty it of its people– “temporarily or could be long term” – and turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East”, boasting plenty of what his son-in-law memorably referred to as “waterfront property.” If that remains his goal, he will be in no hurry to rescue those he wants out of the way.What’s more, in his several days of White House meetings with Netanyahu this month, Trump placed no visible pressure on the PM to do a deal with Hamas, apparently preferring to engage in mutual backslapping over their joint military action against Iran a fortnight or so earlier. Gone was the Trump who enforced an end to that episode by instructing Netanyahu to stop bombing Iran and to turn Israeli aircraft around and return them to base, which the Israeli leader duly did.In the coming days, there is a chance to urge the dove within Trump to prevail over the hawk, and that chance falls to none other than Keir Starmer. The US president is visiting his golf courses in Scotland, but he will see the British prime minister. Starmer could be tempted to use that meeting to plead for mercy on tariffs, given that Trump has spoken ominously of wanting to “refine”the US-UK trade deal. He might want to talk about Ukraine or Nato. All of that is important. But Starmer should use his moment, and whatever trust and goodwill he has built up with Trump, to press him on Gaza.He might mention the Nobel; he might use flattery, telling Trump he is the only man in the world powerful enough to make a difference, which happens to be true. However he does it, Starmer should make that move. This is a crisis that can wait no longer.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionDonald TrumpKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahucommentShareReuse this content"

The reason I ran at tough times was because I wanted to score 10,000 Test runs.”It took him a decade to get there, at 31 the youngest to do it, the first Englishman to the mark, prompting a look at what would come next. With time on his side and a healthy Test calendar for England, could he overtake Sachin Tendulkar, clear at the top with 15,921 runs? “There is no reason he couldn’t if his heart is still in it,” said Trevor Bayliss, Cook’s head coach at the time. But 10,000 wasthefigure, the early morning wake-up call. “I scored 10,000 runs and something just changed a little bit. I didn’t have another goal to get.” Cook retired from international cricket two years later.England v India: Root becomes second-highest run scorer ever, fourth cricket Test, day three – liveRead moreThat something withinJoe Rootis still going. It’s three years now since Root reached his 10,000 mark, at the same age as Cook, right to the number of days. Again came the discussion of the Tendulkar record, and it popped up last year when he overtook Cook as England’s leading run-scorer. An article in the Telegraph predicted when he would get there, placing its bet on the summer of 2028. But the game often makes promises it can’t keep, form and desire capable of disappearing at any moment.Root has both at the moment. Form came at Lord’s with his 37th Test hundred, and desire was present when he restarted his innings in Manchester on Friday, 11 runs to his name. Mohammed Siraj was on from Jimmy Anderson’s end, Jasprit Bumrah at the other. Siraj had the ball scuttling and leaping, while Bumrah had the match-up on his side. No bowler has removed Root more times in Test cricket.View image in fullscreenJoe Root hit his stride after a challenging start on day three.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersRun through the quick’s 11 dismissals of the batter and you mostly find the ball outside off, jagging both ways to entice the prod or slap the pad. The main outlier is Root’s down-with-the-kids reverse scoop in Rajkot last year, straight to Yashasvi Jaiswal at second slip. This being Root, he hit a hundred in the next Test.At Old Trafford, while Bumrah prompted leaves outside off, Siraj threatened with a leg-before shout, a wild play-and-miss, and a glove-rattler that caused confusion between Root and Ollie Pope, the running mix-up nearly accounting for the former. But the release brought history. With a punch for four off Bumrah, Root went level with Rahul Dravid in the leading Test run-scorers’ list. Three deliveries and two singles later, he was beyond Jacques Kallis, up to third. The numbers hit the big screen in the ground and the crowd clocked on. Root, leaning on his bat and looking a bit shy, offered a quick raised hand in acknowledgment.Ricky Ponting, No 2, was still another 88 runs away. Go back five years and you would have guessed it to be something for another day, Root’s consistency not translating to centuries. But a flick down the leg side in the afternoon brought him his 21st Test hundred since the start of 2021, a tally that equals the career record of Andrew Strauss.Do the milestones mean anything? These things can be dirty to discuss when it is the group that matters, “happy to help the team” the common refrain. Root is very much about the collective, with his words and demeanour. “I’m sure he knew what the number was [to go to No 2], but he’s not a guy who wants to shout about those things,” said Pope after play.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From modest beginnings in the pubs and dancehalls of austerity Britain in the 1950s, the diminutive singer with the majestic and agile contralto voice went on to achieve international fame in a career that also embraced acting and writing.Laine could travel easily in almost any idiom, from jazzy standards-singing to the frontiers of classical music and opera, and she was the only female singer to receiveGrammy nominationsin the jazz, popular and classical categories. When she became the first British artist to win a Grammy as best female jazz vocalist (for the third of her live Carnegie Hall albums) in 1985, she received two dozen roses from Ella Fitzgerald and a card inscribed: “Congratulations, gal – it’s about time!”Even late in her career, Laine’s remarkable range, theatrical awareness of contrast and drama, sensitivity to melody and mood, and astute choice of high-class songs, prevented her from ever sounding remotely dated. Whether in coolly countermelodic duets with her husbandJohn Dankworth, the alto saxophonist, in flat-out exercises in zigzagging scat or stomping swing, or in spacey moods of poignant reflectiveness, Laine was never less than the classiest of acts.In 1997, she and Dankworth were, fittingly, given aRoyal Albert Hall Prom concertin honour of their joint 70th birthdays. As long-time stars of a usually low-profile British jazz scene, they brought together the worlds of dinner-jacket arts and unruly jazz. They helped put British jazz on the map, encouraged music education, smuggled jazz into the sensibilities of listeners who had thought they loathed it, and generally added a splash of style and confidence to a sometimes shadowy and defensive subculture.Laine’s onstage glamour would give way to a far more worldly and down-to-earth magnetism as soon as the spotlight was off. A candid and personable woman, she impressed those who met her with her easygoing alertness, unexpectedly small stature for those who had previously only encountered her on a concert stage, and penetrating green eyes framed by dark curls.View image in fullscreenLaine singing with the John Dankworth Group at the Jacksonville jazz festival, Florida, in 1997.Photograph: Will Dickey/AP/The Florida Times-UnionShe was also – in the age of the ubiquitous psychotherapist – mock-guilty about her lightness of spirit, saying simply: “I’m not a very neurotic person.” This realism allowed her to consider both her talents and her shortcomings with neither self-importance nor guilt. She would occasionally ponder whether two parents spending a lifetime on the road was not textbook childcare by some standards, but pointed out the independence and self-reliance of her children with Dankworth – their son, Alec, became a successful double-bassist and bandleader, and daughter, Jacqui, a vocalist, actor and songwriter with much of her mother’s canny timing, emotional subtlety, and inclusiveness of taste.Laine was born in Southall, west London, one of three children of a Jamaican father, Alexander Campbell, and an English mother, Minnie Bullock, who took in lodgers. Raised as Clementina Campbell (the fact that her birth had been registered under her mother’s name, before her parents married, did not emerge until she applied for a passport at 26, by which time she was performing as Cleo Laine), she showed early singing talent and was encouraged by her mother to take singing and dancing lessons.After leaving school at 14, she found work in a hairdresser’s, milliner’s, pawnshop, cobbler’s and library, and married for the first time, to George Langridge, in 1947, while still in her teens. But she was restless and the example of her father – who sang, and loved music, but made his living selling goods door-to-door – had also given her an inkling that a life in music might provide an escape.Modelling herself on the black singers she heard in American musicals such as Cabin in the Sky, she unintentionally developed a sound that was conspicuously different to that of most popular female singers of the 40s and early 50s. Choosing black artists seemed obvious to her, and the threatening implications of being in a racial minority in Britain were not as evident as they were to become later in the 50s. Laine recalled, however, that as a child during the second world war she had speculated on where children like herself might hide if nazism won.In her mid-20s Laine began seriously to apply herself to singing. She had started out in pubs (“useful training for improvisation” she would ruefully recall) and eventually auditioned for the successful British modern jazz band led by Dankworth. Though she was a raw unknown, Dankworth and his musicians recognised her promise.“I was amazed they liked me,” Laine told the Guardian in 1997. “I had begun to think auditions were my hobby, I’d been rejected on dozens of them, and talent competitions too.” But Dankworth was after somebody different, and Laine was unusual as a rich-toned contralto. She listened closely to Billie Holiday for her presence and sense of drama, Fitzgerald for the thought processes and technique that allowed her to improvise so exuberantly, and Sarah Vaughan for her operatic range. The mature Laine was to exhibit all these qualities.She toured the UK extensively with the Dankworth band in the mid-50s. She divorced Langridge in 1957 and the following year married Dankworth, and shared the care of her first son, Stuart – by then 13 and sometimes a traveller with her on the road – with her mother and sister. She accompanied Dankworth to the US in 1959 for his appearance at the Newport jazz festival, and sang with the band at Birdland in New York on the same trip. She also began to read widely, and developed an enthusiasm for poetry – particularly that of ee cummings, one of whose pieces she was to record as a song.View image in fullscreenLaine with Pearl Prescott in Flesh to a Tiger at the Royal Court, London, 1958.Photograph: David SimShe also started to act and was initially confined to Caribbean roles, but her skill bloomed, and she was to regard her appearances at the Edinburgh festival in the 60s and in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, 1967, as high points. But there were many others: Flesh to a Tiger, directed by Tony Richardson at the Royal Court theatre in 1958, the English musical Valmouth, the title role in Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, plus musical appearances in Show Boat, Colette, The Seven Deadly Sins, A Little Night Music and The Merry Widow.She also originated the role of Princess Puffer (and won several awards and nominations for it) in the Broadway hit musical The Mystery of Edwin Drood in 1985. She took on parts as diverse as the voice of God in the BBC Proms’ production of Benjamin Britten’s Noye’s Fludde (1990) and the Witch in Stephen Sondheim’s Los Angeles production of Into the Woods (1988).She recorded prolifically in the 60s, on show-song and soundtrack projects (Dankworth was an in-demand movie composer at the time) and straight jazz albums with guests including the British sax virtuoso Tubby Hayes and her vocalist contemporaryAnnie Ross, and in that decade she was also a frequent guest on the British TV satireThat Was the Week That Was.Dankworth, meanwhile, had begun exploring jazz variations on non-jazz traditions in his own music, and broke through to a new public with arrangements of Shakespeare sonnets – Shakespeare and All That Jazz (1964), which won widespread acclaim and a five-star accolade in the US magazine DownBeat. Laine took to them eagerly – on slow pieces such asO Mistress MineandShall I Compare Thee to a Summer’s Day, she showed a remarkable ability to make the quietest sounds ring like tiny bells, and then be enveloped in a wash of resonant low notes.Classical audiences, too, were now beginning to wake up to Laine’s skilful control, rich tones and spontaneous jazz sensibility. She was Julie in the spectacularly successful 1971 London production of Jerome Kern’s Show Boat, made an acclaimed New York debut in 1972 and the first of her Carnegie Hall appearances (her Live at Carnegie Hall album from 1974 brought her a first Grammy nomination), and further expanded her palette in recording Arnold Schoenberg’s poetry-cyclePierrot Lunaire, which was nominated for a classical Grammy. Despite an increasingly frenetic working life, she and Dankworth also oversaw the development of their Buckinghamshire home at Wavendon asa working theatre.View image in fullscreenLaine and Dankworth at their home in Wavendon, Buckinghamshire, in 2009.Photograph: Richard Saker/The GuardianOver the next decades, Laine collaborated with the flautist James Galway (1980) and classical guitarist John Williams (1984), contributed to Michael Tilson Thomas’s LSO series The Gershwin Years (1987), and a tribute to female songwriters including Joni Mitchell and Holiday (Woman to Woman, 1989). Her bluesily soulful encounter withRay Charles(Porgy and Bess, 1976) was a highlight, as was a hip and swinging meeting withMel Tormé(Nothing Without You, 1992). Laine also appeared alongsideFrank Sinatraduring a week of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 1992.Following her autobiography, Cleo (1994), Laine also published You Can Sing If You Want To (1997) – an informal guide to learning to use the voice freely and confidently as an instrument.The Dankworths slowed down only marginally in their 70s – their concerts worldwide still continued to sell out – and when Laine hit 80 in 2007 (Dankworth’s 80th having preceded hers by a month), she performed a series of UK shows, including a reunion of the John Dankworth Sextet that had set her stardom in motion. A four-disc box set,I Hear Music, was released documenting the pair’s work from 1944 to 2005.Dankworth’s health declined late in 2009, on a US tour that had to be curtailed. He died on the morning of 10 February 2010. He and Laine, plus a glitzy cast of guests, had been due to play at Wavendon that night, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Stables theatre. Impelled by the conviction that Dankworth would have wanted the celebration to go on, Laine went home from the hospital, played the gig, andbroke the newsof his death to a stunned audience only at the close.She continued to perform for some years, frequently with a Dankworth rhythm section including Alec on bass and the pianist John Horler, thus demonstrating, as at the Cheltenham jazz festival in 2011, that Laine could still deliver a classic jazz song such as Duke Ellington’s Creole Love Call with a freshness not far away from Adelaide Hall’s 1920s version of the original.Laine and Dankworth foresaw the contemporary developments that have led to the growing embrace of jazz innovation by audiences coming from the European art-music tradition, from western pop, or from cultures unrelated to either. Laine would readily agree that grand opera at its best was “glorious … but Louis Armstrong is glorious, too, and operatic in his own way”.For her musicianship, and for that breadth of view, she acquired a raft of accolades and prizes, and in 1997 she was made a dame. Her achievements were a rich blend of the creative journey and the crusade, qualities of a musical life that she and Dankworth conducted with the lightest of touches. Despite all the globetrotting, the jet-lag and the impossible schedules, it seemed more fun to them than working.Stuart died in 2019. Laine is survived by Alec and Jacqui.Cleo Laine (Clementine Dinah Bullock), singer and actor, born 27 October 1927; died 24 July 2025Explore more on these topicsJazzPromsTheatreWilliam ShakespeareFestivalsobituariesShareReuse this content"

There’s no other word for it, though she winces a little when she says it. But she is an influencer, and an extremely successful one. The fitness maven has been on the covers of magazines such as Women’s Health, modeled as part of lucrative brand deals and launched her own fitness app, Train With Joan. OnInstagram, where she has more than 2 million followers, she shares pictures of herself posing in bikinis in picturesque locales and training at the gym in color-coordinated workout sets.But there’s one small difference between MacDonald and many other social media starlets. She is 79.“I was 70 when I started [working out],” MacDonald says on a video call from her home in Ontario, white hair elegantly coiffed. “I keep thinking I’m in my 30s.”MacDonald’s workouts are intense, whether you’re 30 or 70. She does deadlifts, weighted planks and kettlebell swings, and casually lifts dumbbells the size of fire extinguishers over her head. Her arm muscles could put professional rugby players to shame.She is arguably the most famous older woman lifting heavy, but she’s far from the only one. There’s Ernestine Shepherd, 89, who has more than 101,000Instagramfollowers and calls herself “the world’s oldest living female competitive bodybuilder”. Nora Langdon, in her 80s, recently shared avideoof herself deadlifting 225 pounds. And earlier this year, theNew Yorkerpublished a documentary about Catherine Kuehn, who brokemultipleworld records for deadlifting in her 90s.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

[Women] are told that so much that we believe it.”Women who avoid strength training are robbed of its benefits, many of which are especially helpful for ageing bodies. In addition to building muscle – which one can do at any age, Manolis notes – strength training has a significant impact on bone health and cognitive function. The former is especially important for women, who have a much higher risk of developing conditions that weaken the bones, like osteopenia andosteoporosis.And it’s fun. Shepherd says that as soon as she started strength training, her favorite thing about it was “the joy and the way that you felt”. She and her sister started lifting when they were in their mid-50s, and soon they were training others and building a community. “I would wear what my trainer would call my ‘costumes’,” she says – shorts, crop tops, leopard-print leggings.MacDonald says she faced some criticism from people in her life when she first started working out and posting about it on Instagram. “I got some really awful remarks from people I thought were my friends,” she says. They commented on how she dressed – “because I wear form-fitting clothing”, MacDonald says – and her growing public profile.“They said I didn’t have to prance around and keep telling people what I was doing,” she says. “That’s not what old women are supposed to do.

Manolis says she has lots of patients coming to her saying: “I know I should start [lifting], I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.” And this is the first year the National Senior Games – an Olympic-style, multi-sport competition event for adults over 50 that takes place biennially in the US – will include a powerlifting competition.“Over the last three or four years, more and more people have been asking me when we’re going to add [powerlifting],” says Sue Hlavaseck, president and CEO of the National Senior Games Association (NSGA).Roughly 12,400 athletes are expected to participate in this year’s National Senior Games, which are taking place in Des Moines, Iowa, at the end of July. Of those, 187 will be participating in the powerlifting competition – 99 men, aged 54 to 95, and 88 women, aged 50 to 82.The oldest female competitor, 82-year-old Faith O’Reilly, says a friend took her to a powerlifting meet in her late 30s. “I was watching everybody and I thought, ‘Well, I can do that,’” she says.View image in fullscreenA friend took 82-year-old Faith O’Reilly to a powerlifting meet in her late 30s. ‘I was watching everybody and I thought, “Well, I can do that,”’ she says.Photograph: Faith O’ReillyO’Reilly has been lifting ever since. “It suits me,” she says. She likes setting goals for herself, and enjoys the camaraderie of gyms and meets. And she appreciates the independence and confidence it has brought her. “I’ve always liked being able to do things,” she says. “And that’s what powerlifting can do for you – you can handle your grandchildren, and your sacks of groceries.”Regardless of age, if you’ve never picked up weights before, it’s best to start by working with a trainer or physical therapist who can help with form and individual needs. “In most gyms that I’ve been in, people are happy to help,” says O’Reilly.Total beginners can see significant improvements in strength fairly quickly, says Manolis. She’s had patients say that after four to six weeks of training they were able to get out of a chair without using their hands, walk up a full flight of stairs, vacuum the whole house or load a dishwasher for the first time in years.“As we age, what we really want to do is to keep our independence and remain functional,” Manolis says. Strength training facilitates both of these things.That doesn’t mean it’s a cure-all.“Being healthy and living life to the best of your ability doesn’t mean you’re going to be happy every day, or that you’re going to be without pain or accidents,” MacDonald says. “These things happen, but that’s life. You’ve got to keep pushing forward.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe joys of ageingWeightliftingFitnessAgeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He considers stepping back from the game as his years and wealth stack up, but keeps going at the encouragement of his dear Virginia (Julie Bowen). But when Happy accidentally kills her with a shanked tee shot, a shock that comes in the first two minutes, his world is even more upended than it was when we met him as an orphan in 1996.This time, instead of having to abandon his first love (hockey) to chase down a couple hundred grand in cardboard checks to save grandma’s house, he abruptly retires to be more present for his kids and assumes the bills are covered until the feds circle back to take grandma’s house – and the Ferrari. With his four boys old enough to fend for themselves, sort of, he moves into a ramshackle triplex on the sketchy side of town with his young daughter, Vienna (played by Sunny Sandler, Adam Sandler’s youngest daughter), and falls into alcoholism. It isn’t until Vienna’s ballet instructor (played by Jackie Sandler, Adam Sandler’s wife) tells Happy that Vienna has the talent to study at a prestigious company in Paris that he becomes motivated to pick up his club bag and try to raise the tuition money. But the comeback gets complicated when Happy picks up a DUI in a municipal course karting accident and an energy drink hustle bro offers him pride of place in an upstart golf tour that’s purpose-built to take down the establishment. (Sound familiar?)The Fantastic Four: First Steps review – Marvel regains buoyancy with wacky superhero family sitcomRead moreLike most sequels, Happy Gilmore 2 doesn’t quite live up to its predecessor, the spiritual successor to Caddyshack. But it won’t matter to diehard fans who never stopped quoting lines from the original. I still can’t let a limousine pass without reflexively muttering “must be Burt Reynolds”, the line that introduced McGavin. That’s not to say the yarn Sandler and co-writer Tim Herlihy stitched together is no fun. They still manage to get in their share of recurring gags (Happy making flasks out of anything that comes to hand: a club brush, a TV remote) while divvying up those other comedy moments among their SNL pals (Kevin Nealon, Jon Lovitz) and cherished Sandler company regulars (Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi). They even manage to pay tribute to the actors who died between films – not least the late great Carl Weathers, AKA Chubbs the one-handed golf pro – by staging a fight between Happy and McGavin in a cemetery, itself a tribute to the gameshow host Bob Barker’s iconic original cameo.But where the first Happy Gilmore was the story of a rank outsider’s takeover of the game, in this installment it’s the other way around. Happy isn’t just a king of the long ball, but a peer to rival Tiger Woods and other greats. Lee Trevino, the only pro golfer who appeared in the 1996 film, finds himself in the sequel surrounded by greats of today (Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele) and yesteryear (Jack Nicklaus, Fred Couples). John Daly, whose actual rollercoaster life no doubt inspired Happy’s second act, lives in Happy’s garage. Scottie Scheffler sends up his bizarre arrest at the 2024 PGA Championship and Will Zalatoris finally gets to dine out on his uncanny resemblance to Happy’s very first caddie. If the original Happy Gilmore was intended as a love letter to the game, it’s clear 30 years on that the professional golf community got the message.The most interesting thing about the sequel is its commitment to defending the game and its traditions – a cause Happy eventually takes in addition to helping Vienna realize her ballet dream, while reckoning with the fact that everyone can smash the long ball now. All the while, the scenes of Happy teeing off on a pro shop simulator and weekend warriors busting chops speak to the franchise’s contribution to making the game more approachable. Now, the unwavering focus on this theme doesn’t completely redeem the film’s woolier elements – the endless sports cameos (from Travis Kelce to the WNBA’s Kelsey Plum), the rampant nepotism (again: every member of Sandler’s immediate family is featured), the forced integration of Call Her Daddy and other digital media platforms, and a batshit third act that draws out the film’s two-hour runtime. But it does make them chafe a bit less. All the while, Bad Bunny provides more salve in the role as Happy’s busboy turned caddie, Oscar, and proves to be a surprising and delightful laugh riot.For those who aren’t into golf or weren’t around for SNL at the turn of the century, Happy Gilmore 2 could well sail overhead like a drive from the man himself. But for the generations who still quote summer comedies from eons ago (ahem), Sandler’s second round offers a refreshing trip down memory lane – to see what new hijinks the assisted living orderly (Ben Stiller) and the IRS agent (Robert Smigel) are up to, and if McGavin, the greatest villain in sports movie history, ever gets his revenge. Everything else – relics of a simpler, less serious time perhaps – is par for the course.Happy Gilmore 2 is out now on NetflixThis article was amended on 25 July 2025.

This is the way to ensure it is a tool of maximum utility to improve the lives of those who are suffering, which, of course, will always be our ultimate goal.”World map showing which countries have recognised Palestinian statehood and in what year they recognisedThe statement came as Donald Trump flew into Scotland for a four-day visit, which includes a visit from Starmer on Monday. Macron upped the pressure on Starmer this week byannouncing that France would recognise a Palestinian stateat the UN general assembly in September.Trump on Friday dismissed Macron’s move by saying it “doesn’t carry weight” and is “not going to change anything”.The UK government’s policy is that it will formally acknowledge Palestine as part of a peace process, but only in conjunction with other western countries and “at the point of maximum impact”.Cooper and Rayner are among more than half a dozen cabinet ministers pressing for urgent action. The Guardian revealed this week that Wes Streeting, the health secretary, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, and Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary,have all pushed for recognition of Palestineat recent cabinet meetings.Ian Murray, the Scotland secretary, and Jo Stevens, the Wales secretary, have also raised the issue in cabinet, according to a cabinet source. Murray and Stevens declined to comment.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, is also said to have called for action, and Lammy is said by colleagues to be pushing Downing Street to take a stronger stance. A government source said it was increasingly “everybody v No 10”.“Too many people in No 10 just see this as a ‘left’ issue and actually don’t get how widespread public anger is,” aLaboursource said.Rayner said last month that the west needed to avoid repeating past mistakes when it came to Gaza. Addressing a service at St Paul’s Cathedral to mark the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, in which more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed by Serbian forces in 1995, she said: “The west took too long to act in the 1990s and we should have acted sooner. Now we must learn the lessons of history and the consequences of inaction.”On Friday, 221 MPs from nine parties signed a letter to Lammy calling for British recognition of Palestine to be announced next week at a UN conference in New York.“Whilst we appreciate the UK does not have it in its power to bring about a free and independent Palestine, UK recognition would have a significant impact due to our historic connections and our membership on the UN security council,” the MPs wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since 1980 we have backed a two-state solution. Such a recognition would give that position substance as well as living up to a historic responsibility we have to the people under that mandate.”The letter’s signatories included several Labour select committee chairs, including Emily Thornberry, of foreign affairs, Sarah Champion, of international development, and Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, of defence.Other signatories included the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, the Green party co-leaders, Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, and the Conservative MPs Kit Malthouse and Edward Leigh.The true number of backbench Labour MPs who support recognition is even higher. Several said they were in favour of the move but did not put their names to the letter. “We need to do more. Israel is committing terrible war crimes,” one Labour MP said. Nearly 60 Labour MPs signed a similar letter to Lammyearlier this month.There is a dangerous disconnect: on Gaza, politics no longer speaks for the people | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said that cases of severe malnutrition among children under five at its Gaza City clinic had tripled in the last two weeks and the UN World Food Programme said nearly a third of people in Gaza were not eating for days, with the hunger crisis having reached “new and astonishing levels of desperation”.Israel said it would allow foreign countries to resume aid drops into Gaza from Friday.In an article for the Daily Mirror, Starmer said ministers were working with Jordanian authorities to get British aid on to planes and into Gaza.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, accused the international community of sticking its head in the sand as Palestinians starved in Gaza, lambasting what he called a “lack of humanity”. “This is not just a humanitarian crisis. It is a moral crisis that challenges the global conscience,” he said on Friday.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyLabourMiddle East and north AfricaGazaPalestinian territoriesKeir StarmerAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

He said he was also planning to meet the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, on Saturday.TheEuropean Commissionsaid von der Leyen’s visit would be at Trump’s invitation. Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said on Friday a deal would “hopefully be signed off before the weekend is over”.After getting off Air Force One, Trump described von der Leyen as a “highly respected woman”, said there was a “good 50-50 chance” for a deal, and said the “sticking points have to do with maybe 20 different things”. He said it “would be the biggest deal of them all if we make it”.Trump heaped praise on Starmer and Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, and said the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was “a team player” but thatFrance’s planned recognition of Palestine as a statewould not “carry any weight”.Trump said he was looking forward to meeting Swinney. Before boarding the presidential plane, he told journalists: “The Scottish leader is a good man, so I look forward to meeting him.”He said he had a “lot of love” for Scotland.Trump hinted he was looking for more concessions from the EU, saying Japan had had a worse chance than Brussels of getting a deal but succeeded after offering more to the US.He also criticised what he called “the windmills” – windfarms – which he claimed were “ruining your beautiful fields and killing your birds”, and hit out at the level of immigration in the EU, saying it was an “invasion” which was “killing Europe”.Von der Leyen said she “had a good call” with Trump before he landed in Scotland and they had “agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong”.Trump would not meet von der Leyen unless a deal was ready to be signed, sources have said.He also hinted he was ready to widen the deal he had already agreed with the UK, fuelling speculation he could finally eliminate the 25% tariff he imposed on steel. “This week we want to talk about certain aspects [of the trade deal] which are going to be good for both countries; more fine tuning. We are also going to be doing a little celebrating together because, you know, we get along very well,” he said.“We are going to have a good time, I think. The prime minister and I get along very well; the Scottish leader too, we have a lot of things, my mother was born in Scotland, and he’s a good man, the Scottish leader … so I’m looking forward to meeting him.”Asked about a trade deal with the EU, he said: “I would say that we have a 50/50 chance, maybe less than that … I would have said we had a 25% chance with Japan, and they kept coming back and we made a deal.”The EU is resigned to an agreement in principle on 15% baseline tariffs, including on cars, which will make brands from Volvo to Volkswagen more costly for US traders to import than Range Rovers from Britain, which carved out a deal allowing 100,000 cars a year to be imported to the US at a 10% tariff.On Friday, Volkswagen laid bare the cost of Trump’s import tariffs saying it hadtaken a £1bn hitin the first half of the year as a direct result.Trump struck a deal with Starmer in May, reducing tariffs on cars from 27.5% to 10% in exchange for increases in UK imports of beef and ethanol. While it is being seen as a clever move by Starmer, the ethanol industry says it isfighting for survivalagainst US ethanol, which is used in E10 biofuel in filling stations around the UK.The president of the National Farmers’ Union, Tom Bradshaw, said his “biggest worry” was that Starmer would sell farmers out by allowing in US dairy products. “We understand the US is pushing very, very hard for dairy access, and for us that is a real red line as they use hormones that we stopped using in dairy production 30 years ago.”He said the farming sector could not “give any more” and warned Starmer not to sacrifice agriculture.Before boarding Air Force One, Trump claimed he would have sealed deals with nearly all of the 60 countries he threatened with punitive tariffs by next Friday, his self-imposed deadline for agreements.He said he had not “really had a lot of luck with Canada” but he was not focused on it, and rather was “working very diligently with Europe, the EU” to get a deal.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropean CommissionDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The public have been urged to keep coming forward forNHScare during this period, and NHS England has urged hospital chief executives to keep routine operations and appointments and only reschedule if there is a risk to patient safety.The NHS chief executive, Jim Mackey, told broadcasters on Friday that the NHS was taking a new approach after learning from previous strikes that “harm to patients and disruption to patients was much broader than the original definitions”.“Colleagues in the service have tried to keep as much going as humanly possible as well, and the early signs are that that’s been achieved so far, but it is early doors,” he said. “The thing that colleagues won’t compromise is safety in the actual delivery. But it does look like people have really heard that. They’re really pulling together to maximise the range of services possible.”Mackey noted that further strikes were “possible” given the BMA has a six-month mandate.View image in fullscreenWes Streeting, the health secretary, said the BMA’s decision to hold the strike was a ‘reckless and unnecessary action’.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PASpeaking shortly after the start of the strike on Friday morning at the NHS England headquarters in London, where officials are monitoring its impact, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, praised NHS staff whom, he said, were trying to limit its effects.This included, he said, “many resident doctors who have ignored their union and are turning up for work”.Streeting said, however, that patients would feel the impact, saying: “We know that there have been operations, appointments and procedures already cancelled, and we know that there will be real challenges over the next five days.”Calling the BMA’s decision to hold the strike a “reckless and unnecessary action”, he added: “We won’t let the BMA hold this country to ransom.”The BMA has agreed to requests for doctors to come off picket lines and work in hospitals experiencing the most pressure. One doctor was told to return to work at Nottingham City hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit over the weekend, and a request from Lewisham hospital in south London for two anaesthetists to work on Saturday was also accepted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of 48,000 members, 55% voted, of whom 90% supported industrial action – representing less than half of members – compared with a turnout of 71.25% in 2023’s expanded electorate, of whom 43,440 (98.37%) voted to go on strike.During the last round of 12 strikes in 2023 and 2024, nearly 1.5m appointments were rescheduled. In the final industrial action from 7am on Thursday 27 June to 7am on Tuesday 2 July, 23,001 staff were absent from work at the peak of the action.The BMA is asking for a rise of 29% over the next few years in order to achieve what it considers to be full pay restoration to pre-2008 levels, after the 2023 industrial action resulted in a pay bump of 22% to cover 2023-24 and 2024-25. At present, ministers have offered a 5.4% pay rise for 2025-26.View image in fullscreenDr Tom Dolphin,the newly electedBMA council chair, told the BBC that a ‘clear, guaranteed pathway’ to pay restoration would be required for resident doctors to return to work.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianThe BMA council chair,Dr Tom Dolphin, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that a “clear, guaranteed pathway” to pay restoration would be required for resident doctors to return to workHe said: “So you’ve got last year’s pay offer which did indeed move us towards [pay restoration], but Wes Streeting himself said that pay restoration is a journey, not an event, implying that there would be further pay restoration to come, and we were expecting our pay to be restored in full – that’s our campaign’s goal. We got partway there, but then that came to a halt this year.”Keir Starmer made a last-minute appeal to resident doctors, saying the strikes would “cause real damage”.“Most people do not support these strikes. They know they will cause real damage … These strikes threaten to turn back the clock on progress we have made in rebuilding the NHS over the last year, choking off the recovery,” the prime minister said.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsNHSIndustrial actionEnglandTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The role is separate to the No 10 director of communications.The Telegraph reported thatKeir Starmerinterviewed the candidates who made the final shortlist and is said to have been impressed with Dinsmore’s understanding of modern communication challenges.The role is a new position called the permanent secretary for communications, created after the prime minister voiced concerns about government communications late last year.Dinsmore started his career in journalism as a reporter for the Scottish Sun in 1990 and rose to become its editor in 2006. He has held a number of senior roles at the Sun including managing editor and helped to oversee the launch of the Sunday edition.Dinsmore currently works at News UK, which publishes the Sun, the Times and Sunday Times, where he has been chief operating officer for the past decade.While editor of the Sun in 2014, Dinsmore was named “sexist of the year” after a poll run by a feminist campaigning coalition called End Violence Against Women.The Sunwas at the time still publishing photographs of topless women each day on page three of the newspaper – it stopped in 2015.Dinsmore is not the first senior tabloid journalist to transition into a communications role at Downing Street.Andy Coulson, the former editor of the now defunct News of the World, worked for David Cameron in opposition and then in Downing Street, before resigning as director of communications in 2011 over the phone-hacking scandal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said it had written to the friends with an offer of mediation.“We have nothing to hide. There are no secrets, no special agenda,” she said.The Freud Museum has itself filed a “serious incident” report with the Charity Commission – effectively asking the regulator to check the board is compliant with its legal duties and assess its handling of the row.Charity trustees are required to file “full and frank”serious incident reportsto the regulator where they have concerns that an adverse event risks significant harm to the charity’s staff and beneficiaries, finances or reputation.Sigmund Freud lived in the house in Maresfield Gardens for the final year of his life after fleeing the Nazis in Austria in 1938. The house, which has been largely preserved as it was then, contains hisfamous consulting couch, voluminous library, and collection of antiquities.View image in fullscreenThe letter from the friends group cites ‘the importance of the house and its collections’.Photograph: Rasid Necati Aslim/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThe house became a museum in 1982 and holds regular exhibitions, tours, seminars and conferences, as well as running educational outreach programmes with the aim of bringing ‘“psychoanalytic ideas to life” for the wider public.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The museum did not cancel the event, saying it had simply rented out the space.The friends group claims that a planned lecture at the museum by the philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler – noted for her trenchant views on the Israel-Gaza conflict – had been delayed at the behest of the board.Abse confirmed this, adding that in common with many institutions it had to respond to pressure from both sides of the debate.“It is not the business of a museum to promulgate any one view and we have to manage that,” Abse said. She said the museum had been “caught between a rock and a hard place” on the issue.Other signatories to the letter include the philosopher Slavoj Žižek, the novelist and academic Jacqueline Rose, the psychoanalyst and writer Adam Phillips, Butler, and two former directors of the museum, Carol Seigel and Michael Molnar.Current honorary fellows of the museum who have put their names to the letter include the psychoanalyst and academic Darian Leader – also a former trustee – and the writer Lisa Appignanesi. Orbach is also a honorary fellow.The museum is recruiting a new director after thedeparture of Giuseppe Albanoin May. The friends group said that “in this current unhappy climate” the board’s governance issues should be addressed before a successor was appointed.A Charity Commission spokesperson said: “We can confirm that, in line with our guidance, the Freud Museum has filed a serious incident report relating to a dispute with an external group. We are assessing information to determine if there is a role for the commission.”Explore more on these topicsMuseumsCharitiesLondonSigmund FreudEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The offences relate to one woman and are alleged to have taken place in January 2023.Det Supt Scott Ware, whose team is leading the Met’s investigation, said: “Our specialist officers continue to support the woman who has come forward – we know investigations of this nature can have significant impact on those who make reports.”Ward will appear at Thames magistrates court in east London on 28 August.In a statement issued after the charges were announced on Friday, the actor said: “I deny the charges against me entirely. I have cooperated fully with the police throughout their investigation and will continue to cooperate.“I recognise that proceedings are now ongoing, and I have full faith that they will lead to my name being cleared. Given those proceedings, I am unable to comment further.”Catherine Baccas, the deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS London South, said: “Having carefully reviewed a file of evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service has authorised the Metropolitan police to charge Micheal Ward, 27, with two counts of rape, two counts of assault by penetration, and one count of sexual assault against a woman in January 2023.“We remind all concerned that proceedings against the suspect are active and he has a right to a fair trial. It is vital that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”Ward first came on to screens in the TV series Brotherhood but is best known for his role as Jamie in Top Boy from 2013 until 2022.The Jamaican-born actor was awarded the Bafta rising star honour in 2020 and was nominated for the best supporting actor Bafta for his role as Franklyn Cooper in Lovers Rock, part of the BBC series Small Axe, the following year.He also starred in the 2022 film Empire of Light and was cast in the forthcoming US pandemic-era western movie Eddington, due to be released in the UK next month.Explore more on these topicsUK newsTelevisionTop BoyRape and sexual assaultnewsShareReuse this content"

The police have operational primacy over these matters.”Det Supt Jon Bancroft, with Devon and Cornwall police, said: “We currently have three separate murder investigations being conducted in the Cornwall area.“I have oversight of all of these investigations at this time, and can confirm they are being carried out independently of each other and are not believed to be linked.“I can categorically state that we have recovered remains believed to be those of Daniel Coleman only from an area of woodland in Sticker.”Police are also investigating the discovery of the body of Lee Hockey, 50, who was found in separate woodland between Truro and Probus on 1 July.A third murder inquiry is under way after a fatal fire at a residential property in Newquay on 22 July.The body of a man in his 30s was found in the property, with a 33-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.Explore more on these topicsPolice and crime commissionersPoliceCornwallnewsShareReuse this content"

He denied the charge at Chelmsford magistrates court and will stand trial next month.With tensions high, the government said it was clamping down on “abuse” of hotels housing those seeking asylum with its new “failure to travel guidance”.This will deny single men the right to stay in hotels if they have turned down suitable accommodation elsewhere without a valid reason. It will also lead to the withdrawal of financial support.However, sources in refugee charities said the policy was not new and those terms were already largely applied to asylum seekers who turned down other accommodation without a reason.They said previous guidance had been put under review and was now replaced with the new rules, but that little would change, and that most cases where people decline to move involved failures in communication or problems in the system.A further demonstration at the Bell hotel in Epping is planned for Sunday by those opposed to it being used for asylum seekers, with counter-protesters also expected to gather.View image in fullscreenProtesters march from outside the Bell hotel to Epping civic centre on Thursday.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThe Guardianreported on Thursdaythat James Regan, one of a number of Epping Reform UK councillors attending the protests last week, claimed in an interview outside the hotel that “they’re trying to dilute the Englishness out of us”. Another Reform official shared a stage with Callum Barker, of the far-right party Homeland, and gave a speech in which she said: “[If] I’ve got to wear a far-right title then so be it.”Both Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leaderwho is now launching his own party, and Diane Abbott, who is suspended as a Labour MP, have come out in support of anti-racism protesters holding a demonstration on Sunday.While Corbyn will not be attending the counter-demonstration, a message of support from him will be read out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The problems are caused by a rigged economic system that enriches billionaires and impoverishes working-class communities.“We are a movement made up of all backgrounds and faiths – and we speak with one united voice when we say: refugees are welcome here.”On Thursday, Epping Forest district council unanimously voted to support a motion calling for the immediate closure of the Bell hotel for the purpose of asylum processing and for the “managed closure” of the Phoenix hotel. The vote was nonbinding and purely symbolic.During the meeting, Chris Whitbread, the leader of the council, reiterated that the local authority had no say on the use of the hotels and the decision was up to the Home Office, who he accused of “not being overly cooperative” when safeguarding concerns were raised.On Friday, dozens of protesters demonstrated outside a hotel in Canary Wharf that is reportedly to be used to offer temporary accommodation for asylum seekers. The demonstration, organised by Stand Up to Racism, took place outside the Britannia International hotel, with a group of anti-migrant protesters also present.More than 25 officers were in the vicinity to separate the two sides, with police vans carrying additional staff also patrolling Canary Wharf.In Nottinghamshire, anti-racism campaigners said there were about 100 protesters who gathered in the centre of Sutton-in-Ashfield late in the afternoon.Stand Up to Racism, about 20 of whose members attended a hastily arranged counter-protest, have accused the local MP – Reform UK’s Lee Anderson – of stoking tensions with a lengthy social media post in which he made the false claim police were bussing in anti-fascist campaigners to counter far-right protests.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFar rightEssexReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

He also asked his wife for help to end his life.The coroner, Jonathan Stevens, said the last time Thorpe was seen in person by healthcare professionals was on 26 March 2024. “In my judgment there were shortcomings in the care that should have been provided to Graham in the last four months or so of his life,” he said.Stevens added that “there were failings in the provision of his care”, but said that, on the evidence, he could not conclude those failings were gross and that, without them, Thorpe would not have died. He said healthcare appointments were offered to Thorpe, but he “found it hard to attend these” because of his mental health.Stevens found that “someone should have gone to see him to properly monitor and assess him, to do a face-to-face risk assessment and understand and address his care needs as required by the care plan”.The inquest heard that healthcare professionals did not consider Thorpe to be in a “crisis situation” after he missed an appointment with the community mental health team on 28 June. At the time, Thorpe’s wife, Amanda, told his care coordinator over the phone that her husband had been asking her “for help to end his life”.During the same phone consultation, Thorpe said he “hadn’t been out for a while” and “didn’t see the point of being here”, but had no immediate plans to act on his suicidal thoughts.The coroner said: “I don’t accept that when Graham was constantly asking his wife to help him end his life, which was a new presentation … that he was not at that point in crisis.“It’s clear there were shortcomings in his care. If he had been seen in those last four months, particularly after that incident on 28 June, I cannot say whether it would or would not have made any difference.”In May 2023, Thorpe had suicidal thoughts and was given inpatient treatment. Stevens said that “some similar protective measures should have been considered in June 2024”.Ex-cricketer Graham Thorpe ‘spiralled into depression’ after losing job, inquest hearsRead moreAn investigation was carried out by Surrey and Borders PartnershipNHStrust after his death.Thorpe was a mainstay of the England men’s cricket team for many years, as a batter between 1993 and 2005, and then as a coach for 12 years.During his international career, he struck 16 Test hundreds for England, including a debut century against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1993. In all formats, he represented his country 182 times.Amanda Thorpe told the inquest the termination of his employment with the England and WalesCricketBoard was a “real shock to Graham”, which was the “start of the decline of his mental health”.Speaking outside the coroner’s court, she said: “We will never get over the tragic loss of Graham, and we miss him every day. He was my best friend, my soulmate, and he was just a joy. And he loved life – but he got very ill.”Mark McGhee, the family’s legal representative, said the coroner had found “significant shortcomings” in the care provided. He said Thorpe’s family “hope that the coroner will address these concerns” so that such a loss “never happens again”.Jo Lynch, the chief nursing officer for the Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS trust, said: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Graham Thorpe and our thoughts are with Graham’s family and loved ones.“We will reflect on the coroner’s findings and our role in Graham’s care with a view to continuous improvement and learning.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Now, a government census notice is stirring debate about whether attempts should be made to count them at all.“Trying to do a census of the Sentinelese is pointless,” says Manish Chandi, a former member of the research advisory board of the Andaman and Nicobar Tribal Research and Training Institute. “It’s far more important to protect the island’s reef, marine resources and the tribe’s isolation than to come up with a number,” he told the Hindustan Times.Sentinel Island’s ‘peace-loving’ tribe had centuries of reasons to fear missionaryRead moreThe last time India conducted acensus was in 2011. Since then, officials have enforced a 5km exclusion zone around North Sentinel Island. This “eyes-on, hands-off” policy is aimed at shielding the tribe from diseases to which they have no immunity and protecting their autonomy.The most isolated tribe in the worldEarlier censuses weren’t invasive. Officials would travel by boat, circling the shores of North Sentinel Island, close enough to glimpse the inhabitants but far enough to avoid being struck by arrows. RF Lowe, who supervised the census in 1921, wrote that with the Sentinelese “being uniformly hostile, no attempt was made at direct enumeration”.The 2001 census listed 39 individuals seen on the beach. The 2011 census put the number at 15. Both figures are seen as “guesstimates” based on offshore observations. London-based Survival International, which advocates for Indigenous peoples’ rights, says the population is estimated to be anywhere from 50 to 150.View image in fullscreenA Sentinelese man aims his bow and arrow at an Indian coast guard helicopter as it flies over North Sentinel Island after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesBelieved to have migrated from Africa more than 50,000 years ago, the Sentinelese hunt, fish and forage using bows, arrows, spears and stone tools. Some anthropologists believe them to be the most isolated tribe in the world.When the British established a penal colony in the Andamans in 1858, the islands were home to an estimated 5,000 people from various tribes. Within decades, many had died, either killed or wiped out by measles, influenza, syphilis and other diseases brought in by settlersNo Indian official has set foot on the 59 sq km island since 2014, not even to retrieve the bodies of four intruders killed by the Sentinelese,including US missionary John Allen Chau, 26. He landed on the island illegally in 2018 and, according to the fishers who ferried him, was shot dead with arrows.‘A virus could wipe them out’Despite the tribe’s hostility to outsiders, North Sentinel Island still attracts adventurers. In March, a 24-year-old Arizona YouTuber, Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov,was arrestedafter filming himself sailing to the island and bringing a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as offerings, and blowing a whistle to draw attention to himself.“The government used to land coconut-laden boats on the beach until the late 1990s,” says M Sasikumar, joint director of the Anthropological Survey of India. “But that was stopped because of the risk of disease. A virus could wipe them out.”With the 2027 census looming, officials have been considering using drones and satellite imagery to estimate the Sentinelese population, but experts warn this could do more harm than good.“It’s hard to imagine that such populations could be accurately assessed using drones, as both the Sentinelese and Shompen live in dense rainforest,” says Jonathan Mazower of Survival International. Using drones “would just feel intrusive”, he adds.Flying drones could also cause panic among the islanders, experts warn. After the 2004 tsunami, the Sentinelese famously fired arrows at helicopters sent to check on their welfare.View image in fullscreenShompen people on Great Nicobar Island. The Shompen live deep in the forests and are hard to reach.Photograph: Anthropological Survey of IndiaThe Sentinelese are not the only people who defy easy enumeration. Others, such as theShompen of Great Nicobarand the Jarawa of Middle and South Andaman, have varying levels of contact with outsiders. Some accept medical help or provisions; others live near settled areas and are increasingly exposed to tourism and development.“The Shompen live very deep inside the forests on the west coast,” says Barnabas Manju, chair of the Little and Great Nicobar Tribal Council. The 2011 census counted 229 Shompen – 141 males and 88 females – but that figure too is seen as unreliable.Access to the Shompen is logistically difficult. Roads were damaged by the tsunami, which means that reaching the Shompen requires days of trekking while many avoid outsiders.Explore more on these topicsIndiaUncontacted peopleSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Campaigners have called on the British government to intervene to ensure their safe passage. Here are some of the students’ stories.‘I am driven by desperation and hope’Abdallah, 27, has been awarded a Chevening scholarship, part of a UK government-funded global scholarship programme, and has a place to study for an MSc in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) at Queen Mary University of London.View image in fullscreenAbdallah hopes to take up his place at Queen Mary University of London to study data science and artificial intelligence.“Just two weeks after earning my medical licence in 2023, the war broke out. I chose not to flee. Instead, I volunteered in local hospitals, treating the wounded while my own family suffered nearby.“I soon realised that bandages and medicine cannot heal a nation so deeply traumatised. We need more than emergency care – we need innovation. That is why I applied to study data science and AI in the UK.“I am driven by desperation and hope.Gazais facing an unprecedented mental health catastrophe. Nearly every child and adult has been exposed to intense trauma, displacement or loss. Yet Gaza’s mental health infrastructure has been completely shattered.“To fight a crisis this massive, I need world-class training. Once I complete my degree, I will return to Gaza to lead the creation of data-driven health systems that prioritise mental wellbeing.”‘My work, my voice and my life matter’Israa, 31, is a Palestinian doctor who has been awarded a Medical Research Council doctoral training partnership to do a PhD in sexual and reproductive health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, where she previously completed a master’s in international public health.View image in fullscreenIsraa, a doctor, previously completed a master’s degree in the UK before returning to Gaza.She said: “[Studying in the UK was] a transformative experience that gave me a global perspective and strengthened my resolve to serve the most vulnerable people. I returned to Gaza by choice to serve, to heal and to uplift. A few months later, the brutal war started.“I now work supporting women, girls, adolescents and displaced communities. I was supposed to start my [PhD] studies in October 2024, but the award was deferred to this October. I am calling for immediate action to evacuate UK scholars and professionals from Gaza, not only for my safety but for the future I represent.“My work, my voice and my life matter. I am not only a doctor or a student, but I am also a survivor, a woman, a wife and a human being who has dedicated her life to health equity and justice.”Israa added: “It is not easy to guarantee we will be alive next week. The more we accelerate the efforts [to evacuate the students] the better for us.”‘Losing this scholarship would be devastating’Khulud, 28, is another Chevening scholar with a place at University College London to study for a master’s degree in dental health. After completing her dental degree at the University of Palestine in 2020, she worked in clinical dentistry while training others.View image in fullscreenKhulud opened a clinic with her brother, offering free dentistry to displaced people.When the war began, Khulud opened a clinic with her brother, offering free dentistry, general medicine, paediatrics, nutrition, and psycho-social care to more than 20,000 displaced people.“These experiences didn’t just shape me – they saved me,” she said. “Even in the darkest moments, there is light in service, and hope in community.“The situation in Gaza is catastrophic. There are continuous attacks, mass displacement and severe shortages of food and medical supplies. Thousands have died and many more are at risk. I cannot say with certainty that I’ll still be alive in 2026.“Losing this scholarship and the resources I’ve secured would be devastating. Emotionally, it would extinguish one of the few hopes that keep me resilient. Academically, the programme might not be available again. Most importantly, it would deny Gaza a health professional determined to return and help rebuild.”‘We are not asking for special treatment’Majd, 24, a mechanical engineer from Gaza, has a full scholarship to pursue a master’s degree in advanced manufacturing systems and technology at the University of Liverpool.View image in fullscreenMajd: ‘International experience is vital for me to develop the skills needed to contribute meaningfully to Gaza’s future reconstruction.’He said: “Life during the war has been extremely difficult. I’ve been displaced, with no stable electricity, internet or basic services. Every day is full of uncertainty and worry.“Most industrial facilities in Gaza have been destroyed, which means there’s almost no equipment or resources left to work with. The lack of electricity, fuel and basic infrastructure has made it nearly impossible to continue any kind of engineering work.“The UK offers world-class education with excellent research and teaching. Studying there will give me access to resources that will improve my knowledge in advanced technologies. This international experience is vital for me to develop the skills needed to contribute meaningfully to Gaza’s future reconstruction.“I want to use what I learn to create job opportunities, empower youth and help rebuild infrastructure that supports long-term stability and growth in Gaza after the war.“I fully understand that the UK has visa systems in place for important reasons, and we are not asking for special treatment. However, this is an extraordinary situation. We ask for consideration and support to enable us to continue our studies as education will be key to rebuilding Gaza.”‘I have seen the need for better healthcare’Abeer, 28, has a place to study for an MA in data and health science at the University of St Andrews. “After our home was destroyed in the winter of 2023 we moved into an Unrwa school. After three days there the school was heavily shelled.View image in fullscreenAbeer says studying at the University of St Andrews would offer the knowledge she needs to make a real impact on healthcare in Gaza.“The bombing was violent and horrific. My brother Mohamed was badly injured, his feet caught underneath the falling rubble. He could not walk or move. We had to carry him south to Khan Younis, where we lived in a tent.“It was here that we lost Mohamed. He never recovered from the injury at the Unrwa school. His loss caused our whole family to collapse. I felt my heart had stopped pumping. I lost my will to live, life lost its meaning.“It was not long after that my older brother reached out, and reminded me that I had wanted to apply for a scholarship at St Andrews. ‘Hardship should not stop you,’ he told me. ‘This is what you wanted before, you must persist.’“Coming from Gaza I have seen the need for better healthcare solutions, and this programme and its modules offer the knowledge I need to make a real impact on healthcare.”‘This is a mission to bring hope and healing’Samah, 25, a medical laboratory specialist at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, has been accepted to study for an MSc in genomic medicine at the University of Oxford. She did not wish to share any photos of herself.“From the first day of the ongoing war in Gaza, I have been on the frontline, working under extremely difficult and life-threatening conditions. Our hospital, like many others, faced mass casualties on a daily basis. We lost most of our laboratory equipment due to targeted attacks and destruction, yet we continued to serve patients.“As the war progressed, I witnessed families resorting to burning hazardous materials just to cook food for their children. This prolonged exposure to potentially carcinogenic agents made me realise the urgent need to understand the long-term biological and genetic impacts of such conditions.“Motivated by this experience, I decided to pursue advanced study in the field of medical genetics and cancer research.“This opportunity is not just an academic pursuit for me, it is a mission to bring hope and healing back to a devastated community.”A government spokesperson said: “We are aware of the students and are considering the request for support. Clearly the situation on the ground in Gaza makes this challenging.”These accounts were compiled with the help of the UK Coalition for Students in GazaExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesUniversitiesMiddle East and north AfricaHigher educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For all its even-handedness, there are numerous details that fail to ring true. It crawls alongLucy ManganFri 25 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 17.01 EDTShareOccasionally, mean girls turn murderous – very occasionally, though, this rarity offers no comfort to the victims’ devastated families. Such was the case in 1997, in Saanich, British Columbia, when 14-year-old Reena Virk was beaten by six teenage girls and killed by another and a teenage boy. Under the Bridge is an eight-part dramatised version of this true story, based on the 2005 non-fiction book about it by journalist Rebecca Godfrey, (played here by Daisy Jones and the Six’s Riley Keough, showcasing her flinty strengths).Reena (a fine performance by Vritika Gupta, comprising all the overconfidence and insecurities that make adolescents so vulnerable even when they have no other aggravating circumstances to contend with) is a troubled teen. She is banished to all sorts of peripheries by her race (her father Manjit, played by Ezra Faroque Khan, is an immigrant from India, her mother Suman, played by Archie Panjabi, Indo-Canadian) and her religion (Suman is Jehovah’s Witness among a primarily Sikh community within an overwhelmingly white area). So the allure of the tight-knit gang of girls from the local group home is strong.View image in fullscreenAlmost incredible truth … Under the Bridge.Photograph: Darko Sikman/HuluThe gang is led by Jo (a fantastically chilling, dead-eyed Chloe Guidry) and her second in command Kelly (Izzy G), who are fascinated by the mafia generally and John Gotti in particular. For those of you who have never been a teenage girl, this is not as odd as it sounds. Loyalty is everything. When Reena, in revenge for not being allowed to go to a party, steals Jo’s address book and rings round her contacts spreading gossip and seeding rumours about her, her fate – did she but know it – is sealed. She is invited to the party after all, and never comes home.Her family suffer the police indifference to her disappearance for days. Reena may not quite be one of the “Bic girls” – the nickname Jo tells her the police have for those in foster care “because we’re disposable” – but she is close enough. Only policewoman Cam, another outsider – an Indigenous woman adopted as a child by a white family who are depicted as casually racist without compunction – eventually takes the time to look for the missing girl. She hears talk of a fight near the town’s bridge, jangles a few weak links in the local teens’ interconnected mass of loyalties, takes a look at CCTV and timelines, then gradually begins to piece together the awful truth.So, too, is Godfrey slowly forced, as her bond with Jo grows and her investigation deepens, towards belief in an almost incredible truth. She tries desperately to understand, to find the humanity in the actions of those who beat Reena so horribly and those who then drowned her, not least to try to absolve herself of her own past misdeeds. But it is something vanishingly rare, this degree of violence from girls against one of their number, and Under the Bridge can only ask whether there are some things beyond understanding and beyond forgiveness.Over the eight episodes, Under the Bridge covers its ground meticulously. It is carefully even-handed, non-exploitative (it does not linger on the violence, or depict much of it visually) and relentlessly sober. Racism and classism are all examined as contributory factors as is the emotional deprivation suffered by those in care. The simple chaos of the overwrought teenage years, and the influences that will rush in to fill the voids are given their moments in the sun.There is no winning, of course, with the telling of any story based round this kind of horror. The above approach is a noble and worthy effort by all involved. But noble and worthy does not, alas, scintillating television make. The two episodes available for review fairly crawl by, with no sign that things are due to pick up thereafter, thanks to a fairly blunt script (“The devil is working inside Josephine Bell … They have nothing. Reena has everything. They want to destroy it,” says Reena’s uncle, putting him apparently also several dozen steps ahead of the police at this point.) Keough is always worth watching but she has little to get her teeth into here and Godfrey’s quick, apparently thoughtless enmeshing with the gang does not ring true. Several badly demarcated flashbacks to different points in the history do not help either. Were the girls suffering mental health problems? Were they immoral? Or just at that particular time, in that particular formation and gathered around that particular poor, misfortunate child, dangerous to know? I’m not sure whether six more industrious episodes will get us any closer to finding out.Under the Bridge aired on ITV1 and is available on ITVX.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

But Ozzy felt more like my discovery, in 1981 or so. I was six years old, a neighbour had Blizzard of Ozz and I would just would stare at that album cover. I fell in love. The Randy Rhoads guitar solos, and then you would see footage of Ozzy and he looked as if he was having the time of his life up there. For a kid, he almost seemed like a cartoon character; the joy he was experiencing was infectious, but also the music was visceral. He became my favourite musician. I had a boombox next to my bed with the Tribute live album on at a low volume so nobody in the house would wake up, and I’d go to sleep to Ozzy every night.There’s something about his vocal phrasing, a timbre that’s so perfectly matched with the music that’s playing underneath. He had the ability to emote and tell a story and draw you in, and the melodies he chose were really special. I don’t think he got enough credit as asinger– to the layperson he was this madman, and to them, the magic lay there and not in his abilities. But the way he sang was so unique and powerful. It’s so ingrained in my mind that when I listen back to stuff that I’ve done in Mastodon, when I sing, I can tell that it’s so heavily influenced by him. I like big, heavy riffs with an almost evil-sounding, dark, high-pitched vocal tonality: that’s Ozzy to a T.I met him at Ozzfest in 2005: I had got a Randy Rhoads [tribute] drum kit made, and he, Sharon and Zakk Wylde came over in a golf cart to look at it. But I usually kept my distance just because I’m such a huge fan and didn’t want to get in the way.Then Mastodon got to play Back to the Beginning [Ozzy and Black Sabbath’s farewell concert on 5 July]. Some icons of music, they didn’t know when it was their last show – take Prince, for instance. And so it was really, really special [for them to perform a definitive final show]. Mastodon were on first and I was unsure if it was going to be just a couple of people in the crowd when we played. But we were driving to the stadium, passing all the pubs, and they were filled with people and you could hear Sabbath blasting out of them at 9.30am. And then we got there and all the bands, from Metallica to Slayer to Anthrax, are at the side of the stage, they want to see us do our thing. It was this really palpable energy, this big feeling of love forBlack Sabbath, to honour them the proper way.View image in fullscreenPure energy …  Ozzy Osbourne (left) and guitarist Zakk Wylde.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesBut then you knew that the big moment was looming: Ozzy’s gonna play. This is the last time you’re gonna hear Crazy Train.[Dailor begins crying.]Mr Crowley, the beginning, the organ, it was so powerful. Everybody was crying. It was just like, oh my God, this is the last time we’re going to see this. Then Tony’s guitar, Geezer’s bass – he was ripping, it was insane – and Bill’s drums. Those four super-special guys doing their thing. The gravity of the moment hit everybody at the same time, that this is it. It was a beautiful moment to be in.Sabbath were so influential because they were so riff-centric, and that just really didn’t exist before. You had some bands that were close to it – but nobody really took that leap into the sound of horror. Like with Led Zeppelin, it got kind of dark; with Deep Purple, there were some moments. Something was swirling around in the air – but Black Sabbath realised it. They knew people were lining up to go and see these scary movies, these Hammer films, and they wanted to get scared. They knew that could be a real wealth of inspiration, to really tap into this darkness that exists out there and inside of everyone, but also in a playful way.That darkness that you chase, that thing that resonates inside of you, it’s the devil’s chord – it just makes you feel something. If we’re composing something [in Mastodon], and it’s not evil enough, I’d rather it be more evil, please; we need to find different notes because this sounds too happy and I don’t like that. I lovebeinghappy, but the darkness makes me happier, somehow. Like Ozzy, I grew up in an industrial area – Rochester, New York – and it’s not all sunshine and happiness and roses. That’s not what’s happening in real life. And if you’re writing about sunshine and rainbows all the time, you’re kidding yourself. [Heavy metal] helps to try to unpack it and understand why some of the terrible things happen in the world, and it helps you get through it.‘I adored how much he loved the Beatles’Sam Carter, vocals, ArchitectsOzzy Osbournewas such a beautiful soul. He basically created metal as a genre, and we’re all so grateful to him for that. I also adored how much he loved the Beatles – as a Beatles superfan myself, I always used him as proof that without the Beatles, there would be no Sabbath and no Ozzy.He gave people like me the belief that I could become a touring musician, too. He showed us that if you care enough and work hard enough, you can make it – and you can do it without being a dickhead, but with a smile on your face. I will always be grateful to have had him as an idol.Ozzy Osbourne’s final performance revealed fragility was the metal god’s true power | Lauren MartinRead more‘They call him the Prince of Darkness, but maybe he’s a bit bigger than that now’Lita Ford, guitar, the RunawaysThe first concert I ever saw in my life was Black Sabbath at the Long Beach Arena in California, in 1971, when I was 12. The place was packed, just unlike anything I had ever seen. The guys in the band had this long thick black hair – you couldn’t even see them for all the blackness, though you could see these big gold crosses that they would wear. Along with the music and the power that was coming off the stage, they were the coolest thing ever. It absolutely carved my future out for me. I thought: I want to make people feel like these guys are making me feel right now.I had already been playing guitar for two years, but I started to live and breathe it. When I turned 14, I hitchhiked across California to go to the California Jam [festival]. The last thing you need to be doing as a young girl is hitchhiking, but I had to go. I was able to work my way into a hole through the fence, next thing I know I’m right in front of the stage. Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Emerson, Lake & Palmer … A lot of the things you hear Ozzy sing are not easy, but some of the high notes, he seemed to hit them effortlessly. His voice has so much character, it’s haunting, almost a cry.And then I ended up having a hit solo single with him in 1988. Sharon Osbourne was my manager and she came by the studio I was recording in, in North Hollywood, with Ozzy. Ozzy and I went into a little side room and just started pinging ideas back and forth. Nothing was pre-recorded; he didn’t have a title, I didn’t have a riff. We were in there all night, because when we came out of that room, the sun was coming up. That was Close My Eyes Forever: magic was created in that room, and who would have thought it would have been such a huge song [reaching No 8 in the US charts].With Sharon being my manager, Ozzy was always there. They were crazy. The stuff they did to each other – it wasn’t like any other relationship I’ve ever known. They were perfect for each other, that’s for sure, because he could dish it out and she could dish it out even bigger. She and Ozzy would play games with each other to let the other know they’ve pissed them off. You’d walk through a hotel and you’d see a pair of shoes out in the hallway, and you’d think: I wonder why Ozzy’s shoes are there? Well, Sharon had had enough of him, and she’d crapped in his shoes. And then of course he would crap in her shoes at a later date. He’d get her back.They came to my parents’ house one day for Easter dinner, and my mom had roasted a leg of lamb. Sharon and Ozzy come in, and Ozzy chugs a bottle of wine. He doesn’t drink the wine in a glass, he just drinks it out of the bottle, like it’s the last little bit of fluid he’s ever going to taste. And he starts sinking lower and lower into the chair until the wine’s gone. And then my father asks Ozzy to cut the lamb. Ozzy starts, but it slips off the plate and goes underneath the table. Ozzy says: “I’m sorry, I don’t eat meat!” My dad laughed his ass off.He’s the biggest, greatest rock star in the world. Right up to everything he did in the past month, doing the concert. Whether he could stand up and walk or not, he still delivered the songs, and the band killed it. I hate to say it, but it’s kind of the way to go: like a king. They call him the Prince of Darkness, but maybe he’s a bit bigger than that now.‘It’s absolutely disarming, the way he’s delivering his truth’Joe Duplantier, vocals/guitar, GojiraThe way he departed this world was absolutely magnificent. Raising all that money for charity with Back to the Beginning, bringing the whole scene together like this – and then he’s gone. It is very sad and at the same time, so perfect in a way.Back to the Beginning was like taking a picture of what the metal scene is. Of course Iron Maiden weren’t around; a lot of English bands were missing. But Slayer, Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax … all these people that mean so much. We’ve played thousands of shows, had so many important shows, but this one takes the cake. It is way more powerful than eventhe Olympic Games performance that we did last year. There was no competition involved like in the Olympics – this was art, spirituality, emotions. And everybody knew they were seeing Ozzy for the last time. I cried.There’s a purity to the lyrics he sings, and to his attitude. It’s absolutely disarming, the way he’s delivering his truth and saying that he’s going to do whatever he wants to do. The world is yours – you just have to decide it. The song Under the Sun that we covered at Back to the Beginning was very much like that, and I’m pretty sure he influenced a lot of the punk and thrash scenes with that speech, which is basically: fuck you, I’m going to be myself. It’s so basic, but so needed in our societies. Whenever [Gojira] talk about environment or equality between people or doing the right thing, it’s with this attitude, an attitude that is typical Ozzy.Before we knew he had died we were playing a show in Istanbul. It’s almost impossible to catch us playing a cover version – we’re proud like that, we’re French, we want to do our thing. But that day in Istanbul, we had decided to play Under the Sun. During the show, one of the fans in the front row put “Rest In Peace Ozzy” on his phone and held it up to me. That’s how I learned that Ozzy died. I checked with my tour manager on the side of the stage and they confirmed it. So I went to the microphone and told 9,000 people the news. Everybody stayed completely silent. The whole show shifted to a very deep tone. And at the end, we played the cover and there was a lot of emotion and a lot of people crying. It’s beyond words what I felt: one of the most epic moments in my life. I have children, I witnessed their birth, that would be number one for sure. But being on stage and playing a Black Sabbath song with everybody as one … in the lyrics he says: “I don’t want no one to tell me where I’m gonna go when I die.” I believe in a sort-of afterlife, and I was imagining him on his way there as I was singing that line.View image in fullscreenBoundless energy … Ozzy during a photoshoot for the cover of Diary of a Madman.Photograph: Fin Costello/RedfernsAt Back to the Beginning, it was amazing to see people being so supportive of this guy and this lifestyle and whatever it generates and communicates. There’s something in this genre that brings people together and gives hope. It’s a secret code: I see a metalhead in Japan or Turkey or Greece and we just know: we’re rooting for truth and we’re rooting for power. But the good power, the power that you find in a volcano or in a wave. And pointing at things that society won’t look at, but metal does.Metaltalks about pain, suffering, blood, and death: the one thing we all have in common. It’s not a political party, it’s not a religion, it’s this thing that we share, and we think more people should join and share that.‘I was in a room with him just 10 days ago’Randy Blythe, vocals, Lamb of GodThe guys in Sabbath didn’t walk around saying: we created heavy metal. But those of us who play music in this genre pretty universally point to Black Sabbath as the first metal band. We had toured with the original lineup before, we toured with Ozzy before, and we were very cognisant of the fact that we were invited to play with the creators. So getting to play their final show was just a tremendous honour and pretty overwhelming for all the band.His death is a very odd thing because all of us are still very much on a high from the concert, and I was in a room with him just 10 days ago, at Comic-Con, his last public appearance. He was really full of life and happiness over the whole Back to the Beginning thing. I was thanking him for the show, for having Lamb of God, and I’m like: “Oh, we went by 154 Lodge Road.” Because me and my lady and Ozzy’s agent went to see Ozzy’s childhood home: a tiny little terrace house in Aston. I told Ozzy and he gave me a big smile: “I bet that fucking guy who lives there is sick of hearing about me!” And he just busted out laughing. He was in a really good mood; he went out on a high note. His death is very sad, but my heart is full, because I got to witness him say goodbye to his fans. He said it a few years ago: if I can just play one more show and drop dead at the end, I’ll die as a happy man. So he got to do that.In 2012, I was in prison in Prague [Blythe was charged with manslaughter after a Lamb of God fan died from a fall off stage, and he was later acquitted]. I had paid bail, over $200,000. But the prosecuting attorney apparently did not like the fact that I had been given bail, he made some sort of objection, and I wasn’t released. So Ozzy and Sharon both said things via social media in support of me, but more importantly, they wrote a letter to the judge attesting to my character and offering to throw an Ozzfest concert in Prague, the proceeds from which would go to any desired charity. They didn’t ask them to find me not guilty, they just wanted them to honour my bail. It’s not cheap to put on an Ozzfest, so the fact that they were willing to do that, and stick up for a member of their extended musical family, speaks volumes to their character.When I was in prison, I didn’t have access to English newspapers or the internet. I came out into the prison yard one day, and all these dudes came up to me, speaking in broken English, very excited and impressed. “Ozzy Osbourne says good things for you.” When you’re in a foreign prison, and people are stoked that Ozzy is speaking up for you, it makes a difference. I’ll always be grateful for that.View image in fullscreenFinal bow … Ozzy on stage at the Back to the Beginning show at Villa Park.Photograph: Black Sabbath/Ross HalfinOzzy was not a pitch-perfect singer. He was not some Auto-Tuned product; there was a great humanity to his voice. The most important thing is his voice was singular, and a bit unhinged. A couple of times I’ve even confused a Led Zeppelin song with someone else because the vocals were similar enough. That has never, ever happened with any Ozzy song.‘Sabbath and Ozzy were a lesson in being yourself at all costs’Lzzy Hale, vocals/guitar, HalestormI remember a very early conversation with my parents about the difference between the music that you might hear at the grocery store where it’s kind of meant to fade in the background and not really be noticed, and rock’n’roll, and specifically Black Sabbath, that is meant to stop you in your tracks. From a very early age, that was the kind of music that I was attracted to. There’s a rite of passage, specifically for a woman who is attracted to that type of music: I lost a lot of friends, but Sabbath and Ozzy were a lesson in being yourself at all costs. You’re not doing it to be well liked, but because it is essentially a part of who you are. So many of the mission statements for our songs go back to that foundation.It’s actually been a shock to find out that he is mortal, because Ozzy was meant to live for ever. He’d survived so much in the business and been through drugs, alcohol, the quad bike accident [that nearly killed him in 2003] and illness, but he had so much love in his heart up till the end and was still hungry for it and doing it for the right reasons. When we played the Back to the Beginning final show, he was visibly frustrated that he couldn’t get out of the chair. There was a moment where it looked as if he was going to get up as if he was thinking: “Dude, I have wings.” Ultimately it’s about what we leave behind, how many many smiles we create and how much love we pass on, and what a wonderful man Ozzy was for all of that.‘I was a little worse for wear but in comparison to the Sabbath guys I was an Olympic athlete’Rick Wakeman, keyboards, YesYes ended up supporting Sabbath on a big American tour, and I hit it off with them right from the beginning. We were drinkers and kindred spirits in that we loved the social aspect. I ended up – much to the disdain of the Yes guys – travelling with Ozzy, Tony, Bill and Geezer on their own plane, surrounded by beer crates. It was brilliant. Ozzy said: “We’ve got some Minimoog lines that need doing, will you come and do it?” That’s how I got to play on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973).Yes were recording in studio three at Morgan Studios in north London and they were in studio two over the road. When I went over at about one o’clock in the morning I was a little worse for wear but in comparison to the Sabbath guys I was an Olympic athlete. The word “comatose” comes to mind. The only person who wascompos mentiswas the tape op, who was sort of terrified. He set the track up and I played what I thought was OK. Ozzy opened his eyes, said: “Fucking brilliant!” then he closed his eyes again. I think I ended up crashing there as well. There was even talk of me defecting to Sabbath but someone said: “We’ll lose what we have,” because at the time metal bands were all guitars and didn’t have keyboard players. I said: “One day that will change,” and it did. My son Adam ended up playing [keyboards] with Ozzy for 20 years and when he joined he asked me what I’d played on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. I said: “I can barely remember being there – can you let me know?”Some years after that I played on Ozzy’s Ozzmosis album (1995), which is still one of my favourite albums to this day. It’s almost prog metal. I certainly think most prog bands would have been delighted to have written a track like Perry Mason. That time, in the studio he was a lot more on the ball and much more knowledgable about what he wanted than people give him credit for. He was very clever at being the caricature of himself that the media wanted when they wanted it, but when it came down to music, he was a bright boy.I honestly think Sharon saved his life. I met them when they’d first got together on Ozzy’s first solo tour back in 1981 or something, which Sharon was production managing or something. I knew she was [the infamous music manager] Don Arden’s daughter and Ozzy said: “Rick, I can tell you because you’re a mate, but we’re an item.” I asked Sharon: “What does your dad think?” and she said: “He doesn’t know yet.” I wouldn’t want to have been in the room when they told him, but years later he said the only person that ever got one over on him was his daughter, because he’d taught her well. I’d never seen Ozzy so happy. Very few marriages don’t go through some sort of turmoil and theirs was very public, but they genuinely loved each other.View image in fullscreenLife saver … Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne were married for 43 years.Photograph: DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/ShutterstockI feel honoured to have worked with him. Ozzy sang Buried Alive on my Return to the Centre of the Earth album (1999) and did a fantastic job on it. I had the London Symphony Orchestra and he just thought it was great fun. A journalist asked him what he thought of the track, Oz went: “Fucking brilliant,” and that was the end of the interview. Ozzy could be hilarious, but had so many different sides and one of his endearing qualities for me is that he did a lot of really good things for charities and such, but didn’t wave a flag about it. Sharon was the same. They just got on and did it, which is how it should be. I’m going to miss him a lot even though I didn’t see him that much, but in a strange way he’ll never go away. People will always keep telling stories about him and I think that’s the legacy he’d like to leave.‘The riffs, the solos, the songs – it just oozed metal’Scott Ian, guitar/lyrics, AnthraxWhen Anthrax came together in the early 80s, we had all grown up with Sabbath – no Sabbath, no Anthrax. And then Ozzy comes out with these two genre-defining and -expanding solo records, with this new hot guitar player Randy Rhoads, and the riffs, the solos, the songs – it justoozedmetal. Everything he did was such an influence on us.I wouldn’t have even become a guitar player if it wasn’t for Sabbath. After taking guitar lessons for six months and being bored with my teacher trying to make me learn theory, all I wanted to do was listen to Sabbath and Zeppelin and learn how to play those songs. And so when he wouldn’t help me do that, I stopped lessons, and I would sit and listen to Sabbath records and learn the chords by ear. That’s literally how I learned how to play guitar.Ozzy was right up at the top of our list of guys we wanted a singer to sound like. Most of our peers, they all had vocalists who were shouters or yellers: James Hetfield, Tom Araya, Dave Mustaine, Paul Baloff, you could even put Lemmy in that category. The vision we always had for Anthrax was we wanted a singer, more in the vein of someone like Ozzy or Bruce Dickinson or Rob Halford, a voice that could be really aggressive but also really melodic at the same time.View image in fullscreenAnthrax pose for a photo after playing at the  Back to the Beginning concert, with Scott Ian in the centre.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesSabbath’s lyrics, people think of witches and demons, but so much had to do with the horrors of war. They grew up in postwar Birmingham, one of the most bombed places in the country. They had front-row seats to that, the savagery of it. On that first Anthrax record I wrote lyrics for, Spreading the Disease, there are lyrics about war, about being a disenfranchised teenager and having to fight for everything you have, about organised religion, which was all in me from listening to Sabbath records. I saw that there was a bigger world than my mother’s apartment in Bayside, Queens, and Sabbath was one of those things that opened that door for me, along with Stephen King or Marvel Comics. It opened my mind and it helped me use my imagination.Just so much of Sabbath still holds up, lyrically. They all saw, at a very young age, that the world was not a friendly place. And the powers that be are only in it for themselves. War Pigs: that song came out when Vietnam was still raging, but could itbemore prescient now?I met Ozzy in 1988 when he took Anthrax on tour in the US for two months. Every band that would open for Ozzy on these giant arena tours would then blow up in popularity – Mötley Crüe, Metallica, and it was the same for us. I’d say the deepest conversation I had with him was about AC/DC’s Bon Scott – it’s very rare to meet somebody who actually got to hang out with Bon. I said: what was he like? He thought about it for a second, and goes: “Now, Bon, he was a drinker.” Coming from Ozzy, that sets the bar pretty high.We had a different experience than, say, seven years earlier when he was still the bat-biting, dove-head-ripper-offer. He would pop his head through the door of our dressing room backstage and go: “You alright, mates? You need anything? Don’t bother talking to the crew people, just come see me and I’ll take care of it.” And that was every day. His kids were running around backstage – the world was a different place for him at that point. It’s one of those amazing things that when you meet your hero and he’s better than you can hope for.For a Brummie like me, Ozzy Osbourne’s voice mattered | Adrian ChilesRead more‘He’d order a quadruple brandy and neck it’Mick Box, guitar, Uriah HeepHe always had top-notch players with him – he even had three members of Uriah Heep [Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake and John Sinclair]. So, when we were recording our 1982 album Abominog in the Roundhouse studios, he was constantly popping down there and having a drink with us at the pub across the road. He’d order a quadruple brandy and I’d think: oh, it’s going to be one of them nights. He’d leave it there on the bar for quite a while, going on talking and joking, and then he’d just turn around and neck it. He said: “I hate the taste of it, I like what it does to me.” When you’re in his company, you’re always laughing; he’s just one of those characters. He did take the world quite seriously, on conspiracy theories and things like that at one point – but generally, there was just a funny side in everything.I like his later stuff, like [his debut solo album] Blizzard of Ozz. It rocked the heavy metal world, knocked it on its breeches, because it was that good. Being fired from Sabbath, I guess there was a degree of floundering about, but when that lineup came together, it really did take him into the stratosphere.If you’re looking at great [rock and metal] singers, you’d say Ronnie James Dio: a beautiful, creamy, lovely voice. But Ozzy had an equal to that in his own way: very powerful, and very recognisable, which is almost as important as anything else in music. There’ll never be another character like him. He was the godfather of everything, basically.View image in fullscreenBlack Sabbath, with Tony Iommi, Bill Ward, Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler.Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImage‘He reminded me of a hobbit – he had this beautiful whimsical side’Eleanor Livingston, vocals/guitar, Die SpitzMy dad introduced me to Black Sabbath and Blizzard of Ozz when I was really young. I would run around in my underwear and listen to Crazy Train; Mr Crowley was my favourite Ozzy song when I was a kid. When I was 10 I saw him live at the Moody Amphitheater in Austin [Texas]. There was this giant bucket of water on stage and between songs he would dunk his head fully in and you’d see the water splash out. That image stayed with me.When we started a band at the first show we ever did we played Paranoid, because it was the easiest one to play, but I’ve probably learned the riffs to at least 15 Sabbath songs. We were hugely influenced by Sabbath and in terms of performance, I always wanted that crazy fun attitude that Ozzy had. It always felt he wanted to create a world that people couldn’t be part of, but his soul was very gentle: he’d always say “God bless you” during shows and he was always talking about his children. He reminded me of a hobbit, and had this beautiful whimsical side. The biggest thing he taught me was that it’s OK to look how you want to and do your own thing, and not to doubt myself.It surprises people that we make the music we do because we’re women, but I’m not going to present myself as a pretty, meek girl or whatever. He presented himself as a freak and as much as people hated him initially, he made that iconic. There was a video of ours that went kinda viral where I’m hopping like a frog, and then I rewatched this Sabbath show from Paris in the 70s and Ozzy was hopping like a frog and generally being insane, and I thought: “Ah, that’s where it came from.” He influenced my dad, then me and I’m sure if I ever have kids I’ll tell them about him. He truly was one of a kind.‘There was a childlike playfulness that he carried on stage’MattBaty, vocals, Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs PigsThe blueprint for our band was heavily influenced by Sabbath, in the way that we wanted to tread that line between something quite heavy and serious-sounding, but counterpoint that with something celebratory and triumphant. And have music that people could, when it’s performed live, just completely enter into another world with. There’s amazing mental health benefits to that – like even just being a member of an audience going to see like a band that I love, if they can make me switch off for an hour and just kind of trample down all of those like horrible racing thoughts on a day-to-day basis, that’s magic.I also like to add to balance out the doom with a bit of a bit more of a positive message, or at least the message of: we’re in this together. Even when you think about [Osbourne’s 1980 debut solo single] Crazy Train, there’s that line that I absolutely love: “Millions of people living as foes but maybe it’s not too late to learn how to love and forget how to hate”. How beautiful is that? And it’s in a metal song.I’ve thought about that final performance quite a bit in the past couple of weeks because one of the things that struck me about Ozzy was even though he was sat down, he was still commanding the stage. You would hear a huge cheer from the audience just via him pulling particular faces. The greatest performers are the ones that can express themselves emotionally in a genuine way like that. As soon as things kind of become huge productions in huge arenas, performances can become, well, performative. Whereas Ozzy, he always felt genuine; there was a childlike playfulness that he carried on stage that was very endearing.There’s a live in Paris video from 1970, and I absolutely love that performance – he’s out of this world as a vocalist on that. And then California Jam, 1974, it’s incredible. It looks as if they’re playing in front of like a million people. They play Children of the Grave and there’s a dichotomy to it – it’s called Children of the Grave, right? But it’s a really celebratory and uplifting song. I’ve just put it on now: Ozzy’s wearing some gorgeous tassels.His singing is just so expressive – especially in that the earlier Sabbath catalogue, there’s no tricks to it, like straight-up blues singing, in a way. Incredibly emotive and quite raw. Rock and metal today, I find quite a lot of it quite formulaic sometimes, both the performance and the production of it. It loses a lot of character – and you could never really throw that accusation at Ozzy.The catalogue’s there; Ozzy and Sabbath are never going to be forgotten. And they’ll keep inspiring future generations of musicians to pick up a guitar or microphone and express themselves. One of the important things was they were always very open about their background as well: they came from nothing. Today there’s not a lot of hope for people in certain areas of the country, and you don’t see a lot of breakthrough artists that are truly working class – that’s a shame. Access to instruments, lessons, rehearsal spaces and the affordability of all of those things; even a pair of drumsticks now is about 15 quid. But I hope that there are kids that could look at a band like Sabbath and think: “Well, they just did it. They just got together and did it.”Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneBlack SabbathPop and rockMetalMastodonGojiraRick WakemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rob Brydon takes us inside BBC travel game Destination X, where  viewers – and contestants  – try to find themselves in EuropeAlexi DugginsFri 25 Jul 2025 08.28 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 08.55 EDTShareOutside a cinema in east London sits an absolute beast of a bus. It is jet black from wheel wells to roof, the windows are obscured by metal plates and it is so massive rock stars might kip in it prior to hopping on stage and yelling: “Hello Milton Keynes!” Essentially, it looks like a gothic Megabus commissioned by Alice Cooper. It does, however, have one key design flaw: it’s impossible to see out of. Once you’re inside, you will have no idea where you are going.For the next five weeks, expect to see a lot of this vehicle. It’s the star of the BBC’s latest big reality series, Destination X. Based on a Belgian hit, it sees 13 contestants ferried around Europe in total ignorance of their location, with the worst at identifying it being eliminated. Viewers are encouraged to guess along as its OTT challenges see contestants locked in boxes in village squares, peeping through a tiny window to work out where they are, or being whisked up a snow-topped mountain and made to hunt for clues while dangling from a rope 2,000 metres above sea level. Given that they spend an entire month living and sleeping on a coach together, there are points where cabin fever-ravaged contestants become so suspicious of each other that heated arguments flare up. It is, essentially, The Traitors meets Race Across the World – hosted byRob Brydon.View image in fullscreenMountain to climb … contestants are whisked up to snow-capped peaks to find clues to their destination.Photograph: BBC/TwoFourToday, I am its newest contestant. For the next couple of hours, I will be joining Brydon and a handful of other first-time players onboard the “X bus” for a whistlestop blind tour of London following a quick screening of the show at Hoxton’s Curzon cinema. While this may lack the scale of a pan-European jaunt, the crew’s commitment to realism means that they have painstakingly recreated the kind of temperatures you’d expect from a summer in southern Spain. Well, that or the air-conditioning is broken.“Bloody hell! Is it hot enough in here?” exclaims Brydon as he gets on the bus. He takes a moment to remove his navy blazer and mop his brow, before leaping straight back into presenting mode.“The clues are there!” he announces as the coach rumbles to life and we drive off to the sound of the most Rob Brydon thing imaginable – an impression of a TV star whose best-known work came before the 1990s. “As David Frost used to say, the clues are there as we go through the keyhole …”Exactly how you play this game is a mystery. It seems really quite random. But there’s one thing that is obvious from even a quick watch: you need your wits about you, because this is one devious TV show. The first episode opens with the contestants waiting in a packed German airport. But all the other passengers are actors. The check-in staff are fake. It is littered with details that the unknowing participants will shortly be tested on in a game they have to survive to avoid being kicked off the show – from fake couples loudly arguing about the allowable weight of luggage to names read out over the PA system. Before the passengers are even allowed on the bus, they’re stuffed into a helicopter, blindfolded and disorientated by being flown around for an hour. Hopefully, they didn’t come up with this idea based on the fact that the East German Stasi used the same tactic with political prisoners being driven to jail.But there is sneakiness here that even the Stasi didn’t think of: to make contestants think they have landed in the same place as they took off, they employ three sets of identical twins as fake airport staff. One set are in the original location, the second at the landing site. All the contestants need to do to figure it out is read the microscopic names on their identity badges.“That is the nuts!” chuckles the executive producer Dan Adamson. “We just thought: wouldn’t it be funny?”View image in fullscreenGoing round in circles … contestants start their trip with a confusing ride in a helicopter.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/CREDIT LINE:BBC/TwoFourVery sly. But while they go to extreme lengths to confuse the contestants, presumably they don’t deliberately make them think they’re in completely the wrong place? For example, at one point in Destination X’s first episode we’re shown a teaser of a screen being driven up alongside the bus as it barrels down the road, and playing a video through the window. That’s not an attempt to show fake scenery, is it? “No, we’re showing them a clue,” says Adamson. So we can trust what we’re shown through this bus’s windows should they open?“We don’t have the budget to CGI,” says Brydon. “Otherwise I would have been a bit taller!”As if on cue, the bus window pops open. We’re crossing the Thames on Tower Bridge! Well, hopefully I can trust that. Not that it is particularly useful info. How on earth do you do this?“We had players who would try to track the sun,” says Adamson. “We had one player who every time we went in a tunnel would count to see how long it was. They were trying to work out the speed and the distance of the coach. And they would react to weather, you know: it’s getting warmer, it’s getting colder …”“I would be terrible at this,” says Brydon. “If I saw the sun, that would tell me it’s daytime.”The more you hear about the show, the harder it is not to be blown away by the logistics involved. The sheer number of staff and kit meant that, according to Adamson, they had to travel in a convoy of about 50 vehicles, all of which did 11,000km in 32 days, before the 190 staff retired to one of the 7,000 hotel rooms they booked during the shoot. Every piece of food or drink had to be removed from its packaging and put in an unmarked container. To give contestants a fresh air “safe zone” after a journey, they’d park other coaches alongside the bus to create a four-walled square, top it with a camo net to prevent them seeing out and install a carpet and running machine. When Brydon arrived on location, he said the sheer scale meant it was often like they had “built a new town”.It is, however, hard not to wonder: is this the most environmentally responsible way to make a TV show? At this point in our race towards climate catastrophe, isn’t it in poor taste to pump 11,000km worth of vehicle emissions into the atmosphere – particularly given that it comes from the channel behind The Traitors, who know only too well how to create astonishingly addictive TV while barely leaving one building?According to the BBC, “Destination X is certified by Bafta Albert, which encourages sustainable TV and film production, confirming that consideration of carbon emission reduction was given throughout the production.” They point out to me that they had a “carbon action plan” whose measures included crew taking big minibuses to reduce the number of vehicles and minimising the diesel generators used – meaning they were certified two out of a possible three stars by Albert. The coaches were also not petrol, but Euro 6 diesel engines. So choosing to do all these miles is less an issue with the climate crisis, andmore one of the air quality local kids breathed.Talking of air quality, that presented its own challenge for the contestants cooped up on a coach together. “We set ourselves one rule: no number twos on the bus. That gave us a problem. Suddenly it was like: why do these people have to go to the toilet so often?” says Adamson of the fact that they had to pull the coach over every time anyone needed to go.“Everyone had to be really open about it – you couldn’t be discreet. You’d be blindfolded, chaperoned, have someone waiting outside while you did your business … I can’t believe how much time we spent talking about toilets.”At this point, Big Ben starts chiming. For a brief moment I can’t work out whether it’s real or coming over the coach’s sound system, until I look at my watch and realise it’s 2.12pm – not a usual time for a clock to chime.“He shouldn’t have been allowed his watch!” exclaims Brydon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Production staff repeatedly insist that there are clues all over the bus even though all I can see are a couple of half-inched boxes of popcorn and some flyers from the Curzon, plus a few bags of rapidly melting mini Wispas.“Is it worth mentioning to the driver that the air conditioning is ineffectual?” asks a reddening Brydon. “We’re all sitting here like lobsters in a pot.”By now, he’s looking a tad dishevelled. Which is a shame, because one of the most fun things about Destination X is Brydon going all flamboyant with his sartorial choices: from dressing like an airline captain to checked blazers that wouldn’t look out of place on Toad from The Wind in the Willows to a moment he turns up dressed as Indiana Jones. “I did look to Claudia Winkleman on The Traitors,” he says. “I’ve gone for it!”At this point, the coach grinds to a halt. We’re ushered to a recreation of “the map room”: the cubbyhole that contestants use to make their guess by placing an X on a digital map. They normally get two minutes – I’m given one. Bearing in mind the Big Ben bells we were played, I try to scroll across the map to find where Big Ben’s bell was created: Whitechapel Bell Foundry. But I can’t find it on the map. So as I run out of time, I go for plan B: Westminster, home of Big Ben.“The person whose guess was furthest from the location is …” announces one of the show’s producers, once we’ve all placed our X, “… Alexi!”Great. Last place. If this were the actual show, I’d have been booted off the coach at a random European destination. But as I step off the X bus, I find that we are … back at the Curzon cinema where we started. Exactly what sort of clues were meant to tip us off to that being our destination?“Didn’t you see the tubs of Curzon popcorn and Curzon flyers?”I thought they’d been nicked from the cinema!“There were fake tickets hidden in the cushions as well if you looked.”Brilliant. Clearly, I’d be terrible at the show. But it’s not like I missed out on much.“The prize?” I hear Adamson reply. “Oh yeah, it’s excellent … have a bag of melted Wispas.”Destination X is on BBC One on Wednesday and Thursday at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionRob BrydonReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They had found what they were looking for in the undersea meadows off the south coast ofEngland.“Seahorses are tricky to spot,” said Mark Fox. “The seagrass sways and they blend into it pretty well. It helps if it’s sunny and not too choppy but you have to get your eye in. When you see them, it’s brilliant.”Fox is one of a band of volunteers (he is a semi-retired painter and decorator) helping survey the creatures that live in Studland Bay.Over the last two decades, conservationists have worked hard to make conditions in theDorsetbay better for the seagrass – and thus the seahorses – including introducing almost 100 “eco moorings” that do not harm the habitat.Coming across a seahorse here used to be a rare event but this summer the divers have seen a surge in numbers, with 33 seahorses counted in one survey.View image in fullscreenThe seahorse survey in Studland Bay.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“It’s spectacular to see so many seahorses here,” said Ken Collins, an emeritus fellow at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in Southampton.Collins has worked on globally important projects such ashelping protect the water around the Galápagos Islandsbut is now a key member of the volunteer team monitoring the seahorses for the charity theSeahorse Trust.Studland Bay is a key spot in the UK for two species, the spiny seahorse and the short-snouted seahorse. The trust launched theStudland Seahorse Projectin 2008 to try to boost numbers and in 2019 thebay was designated a marine conservation zone.A problem for the seagrass and seahorses is that the bay is also a fine area for boats to shelter in. “And anchors tear out the roots of seagrass”, said Collins. “It takes years to grow back.”View image in fullscreenA photograph of a seahorse on the screen of an underwater camera.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianCollins said there had been tension over the years with “anti-conservationists”, some with “Trump-like views”, who seemed to think the champions of the seahorses were intent on driving the boaters away.Relations have improved since theStudland Bay Marine Partnership was createdin 2021, consisting of the Seahorse Trust, academics, boating organisations, community groups and local businesses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Bare patches in the seagrass are starting to grow back. “It’s a long process but we’re getting there,” said Collins.View image in fullscreen(Left to right) Mark Fox, Pete Lightowler, Dr Ken Collins, Tom Mills and Seb Hibbs.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThis week, the survey team set up camp on a picnic bench at Joe’s Cafe on South Beach before their dive. Volunteers, including a builder, a student and a usually desk-bound marine habitat project manager, hauled on wetsuits and scuba gear. Collins, not as young as he was, was not too proud to ask one of the younger divers to help zip him into his wetsuit.Jenny Mallinson, who used to run the aquarium at theNational Oceanography Centrein Southampton, briefed the divers: when you spot a seahorse, don’t take your eye off it or you will lose it; take a picture of the whole body so that the team can later try to identify if it is male or female; most importantly, don’t distress the seahorses – if their colour darkens or they turn away, it’s a sign that they are not happy and you should move away.Over the next three and half hours, three pairs of divers combed the seagrass, which lies about 100 metres out and 2 metres down and reported back to Mallinson. The total was not as dramatic as earlier this month but they saw seven, all spiny seahorses.Neil Garrick-Maidment, the executive director and founder of the Seahorse Trust, said they used to be pleased to spot one or two seahorses and often found none. “Seven is brilliant. It is fantastic to start seeing seahorses back in Studland Bay.

Shouts ring out, an alert is sounded and a US Customs and Border Protection SUV races toward the wall – warning enough to send the man scrambling back over it, disappearing intoMexico.The sighting on Tuesday was one of only two for the army infantry unit patrolling this sector of the southern border, where an emergency declaration byDonald Trumphas thrust the military into a central role in deterring migrant crossings at US ports of entry.“Deterrence is actually boring,” said 24-year-old Sgt Ana Harker-Molina, giving voice to the tedium felt by some fellow soldiers over the sporadic sightings. Still, she said she takes pride in the work, knowing that troops discourage crossings by their mere presence.“Just if we’re sitting here watching the border, it’s helping our country,” said Harker-Molina, an immigrant herself who came from Panama at age 12 and became a US citizen two years ago while serving in the army.View image in fullscreenAn army specialist demonstrates the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System in Nogales, Arizona, on Tuesday.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APUS troop deployments at the border have tripled to 7,600 and include every branch of the military – even as the number of attempted illegal crossings has plummeted and Trump has authorized funding for an additional 3,000 border patrol agents, offering $10,000 signing and retention bonuses.The military mission is guided from a new command center at a remote army intelligence training base alongside southern Arizona’s Huachuca mountains. There, a community hall has been transformed into a bustling war room of battalion commanders and staff with digital maps pinpointing military camps and movements along the nearly 2,000-mile border.Until now, border enforcement had been the domain of civilian law enforcement, with the military only intermittently stepping in. But in April, large swaths of the border were designated militarized zones, empowering US troops to apprehend immigrants and others accused of trespassing on army, air force or navy bases, and authorizing additional criminal charges that can mean prison time.The two-star general leading the mission says troops are being untethered from maintenance and warehouse tasks to work closely with border patrol agents in high-traffic areas for illegal crossings – and to deploy rapidly to remote, unguarded terrain.View image in fullscreenUS military personnel at a briefing at a border patrol station in Nogales, Arizona, on Tuesday.Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP“We don’t have a [labor] union, there’s no limit on how many hours we can work in a day, how many shifts we can man,” said Maj Gen Scott Naumann of the army. “I can put soldiers out whenever we need to in order to get after the problem and we can put them out for days at a time; we can fly people into incredibly remote areas now that we see the cartels shifting” course.At Nogales, army scouts patrolled the border in full battle gear – helmet, M5 service rifle, bullet-resistant vest – with the right to use deadly force if attacked under standing military rules integrated into the border mission. Underfoot, smugglers for decades routinely attempted to tunnel into stormwater drains to ferry contraband into the US.Trump’s new border wall will threaten wildlife in an area where few people passRead moreNaumann’s command post oversees an armada of 117 armored Stryker vehicles, more than 35 helicopters, and a half-dozen long-distance drones that can survey the border day and night with sensors to pinpoint people wandering the desert. Marine Corps engineers are adding concertina wire to slow crossings, as the Trump administrationreboots border wall construction.Naumann said the focus is on stopping “got-aways” who evade authorities to disappear into the US in a race against the clock that can last seconds in urban areas as people vanish into smuggling vehicles, or several days in the dense wetland thickets of the Rio Grande or the vast desert and mountainous wilderness of Arizona.Meanwhile, the rate of apprehensions at the border has fallen to a 60-year low.View image in fullscreenA view from inside a US border patrol vehicle in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on Wednesday.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APNaumann says the falloff in illegal entries is the “elephant in the room” as the military increases pressure and resources aimed at starving smuggling cartels – including Latin American gangs recently designated as foreign terrorist organizations.He says it would be wrong to let up, though, and that crossings may rebound with the end of scorching summer weather.“We’ve got to keep going after it; we’re having some successes, we are trending positively,” he said of the mission with no fixed end date.The Trump administration is using the military broadly to boost its immigration operations.“It’s all part of the same strategy that is a very muscular, robust, intimidating, aggressive response to this – to show his base that he was serious about a campaign promise to fix immigration,” said Dan Maurer, a law professor at Ohio Northern University and a retired army judge advocate officer. “It’s both norm-breaking and unusual. It puts the military in a very awkward position.”View image in fullscreenA US soldier monitors the area while standing next to a Stryker combat vehicle in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on Wednesday.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APThe militarized zones at the border sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits the military from conducting civilian law enforcement on US soil.“It’s in that gray area. It may be a violation – it may not be. The military’s always had the authority to arrest people and detain them on military bases,” said Joshua Kastenberg, a professor at the University ofNew MexicoSchool of Law and a former air force judge.Michael Fisher, a security consultant and former chief of the border patrol from 2010 to 2016, calls the military expansion at the border a “force multiplier” as border patrol agents increasingly turn up far from the border.“The military allows border patrol to be able to flex into other areas where they typically would not be able to do so,” he said.At daybreak on Wednesday in Arizona, Spc Luisangel Nito scanned a valley with an infrared scope that highlights body heat, spotting three people as they crossed illegally into the US, in preparation for the border patrol to apprehend them. Nito’s unit also has equipment that can ground small drones used by smugglers to plot entry routes.View image in fullscreenA Stryker combat vehicle sits atop a hill overlooking the US-Mexico border fence in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on Wednesday.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APNito is the US-born son of Mexican immigrants who entered the country in the 1990s through the same valleys he now patrols.“They crossed right here,” he said. “They told me to just be careful because back when they crossed they said it was dangerous.”Nito’s parents returned to Mexico in 2008 amid the financial crisis, but the soldier saw brighter opportunities in the US, returned and enlisted. He expressed no reservations about his role in detaining undocumented immigrants.“Obviously it’s a job, right, and then I signed up for it and I’m going to do it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS-Mexico borderUS militaryArizonaNew MexicoUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s only accessible by train, is super-remote and there are no roads for 20 miles.One day, we set off to climb a nearby Munro – me, my husband and our six- and nine-year-olds. As we reached the summit, the weather closed in and we realised we might have made an error trekking to a place where no cars could rescue us. We found ourselves in near-whiteout conditions in the snow. To make matters worse, I had recently torn my knee ligament, and while low-impact hiking was good rehab, I was unable to traverse steep terrain, so we had to take the long way round to get back down – all the while the snow was getting deeper and the visibility worse.After several exhausting hours, including miles of carrying the six-year-old and endless shouts of “Are we nearly there yet?”, we finally reached the bottom just as the sun came out. After hours of seeing no human life, we were rewarded by a train full of waving passengers passing along the track through the moor.

We hadn’t learned nearly enough Spanish or Portuguese beforehand, which resulted in a series of mini disasters, which were entirely of our own making.After crossing the border from Uruguay into Brazil, we bought bus tickets to Rio Grande, instead of Ilha Grande, near Rio de Janeiro (the two places are 1,200 miles apart). It meant we had to spend the night in the city of Pelotas in order to catch the correct bus the next day. The only place we could find was a pay-by-the-hour love motel with porn on every TV channel, carpeted walls, condoms and lube in the mini bar, and walls that were far too thin! Let’s just say we got out of there pretty sharpish the next morning, though we did end up getting to explore the world’s longest beach, which happened to be an hour’s drive away.Dopractise language basics before spending long periods in a country. Google Translate is helpful, but a phrase book will allow you to learn on the go.Don’tbe too rigid in your plans. Travelling rarely goes without a hitch and is much more enjoyable if you can go with the flow.The washout in the wildTom Cahalan, founder ofDorsia Travel, luxury travel agencyMy wife and I were staying at a new safari camp in Botswana for a few days as part of a longer tour. On the last day, torrential rain suddenly hit. Our camp was in the vast Okavango Delta, which can be a risk in the rainy season – but this was supposed to be the dry season! Within minutes, water was coming in through the roof of our tent and it started to fill up.The only staff member on hand was a masseuse, who clearly had no experience trying to make a tent water tight. We tried to get hold of someone else by radio – the only mode of communication in most safari camps – but no one came, so we were left rushing around trying to keep our things dry until it finally stopped raining. Thankfully, nothing got too damaged, and we were leaving later that day, so escaped another night in soggy lodgings.Dopay attention to the seasons when going on an adventure holiday. You might be unlucky, but your plans are less likely to be rained off if you opt for the right time of year.Don’tforget tocheck your travel insurance is suited to where you’re visiting. If there’s a risk of natural disaster or trip disruption due to extreme weather, make sure it’s on your policy.View image in fullscreen‘The bride-to-be arrived in tears.

She arrived in tears. Her luggage had been lost in transit – and it contained her wedding dress! Cue panic, with 48 hours until the ceremony. We called in many favours and had one of London’s best bridal stores make space in their schedule for an emergency appointment. Their team worked through the night making adjustments and delivered the dress to the hotel, where our valet team was on standby to steam it.But then, on the morning of the wedding, a man sauntered into the hotel holding her missing suitcase, which contained the original dress. To this day, I have no idea where he came from as we didn’t have time to ask. Ultimately, the replacement dress never saw the light of day.Douse AirTags so you have a way to locate lost luggage.

At the clinic, I’d been asked to eliminate sugar and caffeine, and advised to stick to simple-to-digest foods for a while afterwards.But on the first night at my new location, a Michelin-star chef served a succession of dishes full of cream and sugar, while the sommelier brought out a different wine to complement each course. Not only would it have been rude to refuse, but my job necessitated trying them, and so the post-detox rules went out the window, and I dutifully ate every plate of pasta and pudding laid before me.Just 15 minutes after finishing the meal, my strappy shoes started to feel tight. Something was wrong. When I looked down, I saw my feet had ballooned so much that my ankles were no longer visible! Shocked, I messaged a doctor friend, who explained it was a reaction to the rich foods after an abstemious period. Belly laughing while trying to get free from my shoes, I realised it was snowing, so I staggered into a drift to soothe my painful feet, before sleeping with them raised on a mountain of pillows. Needless to say, I’ve never broken the exit rules of a detox since.Doalways stick to the guidelines set by doctors if you’re doing a health retreat. In the case of a detox: always introduce new foods slowly afterwards.Don’tbe afraid to ask hotel staff for assistance if you fall ill. They have a duty of care for guests and some have medical services on-call.The 3am human alarm clockLucy Halfhead,travel editorDreaming of white sands and turquoise water, I thought St Lucia would be the perfect place to relax as new parents. In my excitement, what I failed to factor in was a punchy five-hour time difference. Night one: we get the baby down early and toast our expert parenting with a piña colada. At 3.17am we’re woken by the strains of Baa, Baa, Black Sheep and rhythmic clapping. My daughter thinks it’s morning. Because according to her body clock, itismorning.And so began our daily routine: waking up before the crickets had even clocked off their night shift, tiptoeing around a silent resort with a wildly energetic toddler and watching the sunrise in a fog of sleep deprivation and insect repellent. On the final day, just as her body clock had adjusted, it was time to fly home – where she then, of course, stayed on St Lucia time for a week.Doease into time zone changes, shifting your child’s naps and bedtimes by 15 to 30 minutes a day in the run-up to your trip. Alternatively, consider far-flung locations that are in the same or a similar time zone, such as Morocco or South Africa if you live in the UK.Don’tbe put off travelling with kids. It can be hard work sometimes, but you’ll create precious memories.The not-so-smart suitcase sagaIsabella Quinn,accountmanageratFox Communications PRI had just wrapped a dreamy press trip in Bali. Everything went to plan – until the final hour. Just as our group was about to board the flight to Doha to catch a connecting flight to London, we got a call from security over the tannoy.One of the journalists’ smart suitcases had triggered a full-scale panic: it had a built-in charger pack – a serious no-go at Bali airport, where even devices in checked-in luggage must be switched off and their batteries removed. Cue a mad dash through security and passport control – running, sweating, clutching boarding passes – to locate the suitcase and somehow eject the battery from inside, which was quite a scramble considering the person in question had never removed it before. Not quite the farewell I’d envisioned, but we made the flight, just.Doknow the specs on any smart tech you take on holiday, and how to eject and switch on/off any battery packs.Don’tforget to check that your luggage complies with local airline regulations on every leg of your flight.

An England victory would be an even bigger achievement than when they won Euro 2022, because this is a harder final than the oneagainst Germany at Wembley.England should be the favourites purely because they are the holders and have had the experience of winning it. Their belief that they can always get back into a game, no matter how indifferent they’ve been, is the one thing that stands out about England. Sometimes it pays to be lucky rather than good, but we shouldn’t dismiss that or talk it down. Their resilience is their superpower, and although they haven’t always been free-flowing, they’ve found ways to win, which is down to the character of the players and, most importantly, the ‘finishers’ from the bench demonstrating that England havea lot of quality and depth.That does not mean Sarina Wiegman should necessarily change her starting team because, as good asMichelle’s Agyemang’s impacthas been with her three goals in four caps, it is another jump up to do it from the start. There is so much a starting centre-forward has to do other than score goals, including to set the press, and Alessia Russo knows that role inside out. I cannot see Sarina changing that, and the strategy of players coming from the bench is working, even if the time for them to make an impact is getting shorter and shorter.We sometimes say “your name’s written on something” when things go in your favour: a bounce of the ball, a referee’s decision, that little rub of the green. England are scraping over the line and that may take them all the way, but this is their biggest test yet. Although Italy were good, they’re not at Spain’s level.Quick GuideEngland v Spain: past three meetingsShowSpain 2-1 England, 3 June 2025, BarcelonaEngland were knocked out of the  Nations League after going ahead through Alessia Russo in the 21st minute. In the second half, Spain’s Clàudia Pina made an instant impact from the bench, scoring two minutes after coming on, then doubling her tally 10 minutes later as Spain secured victory. The Lionesses would have qualified for the semi-finals at Spain’s expense with a win.England 1-0 Spain, 26 Feb 2025, LondonA Wembley crowd of 46,550 watched England defeat Spain in the teams' first meeting since the World Cup final, in Nations League A Group 3.

Lucía García’s first-half attempt that rattled the crossbar and second-half chances for the winger Salma Paralluelo were the highlights of Spain's attacking play but England held on.Spain 1-0 England, 20 August 2023, SydneySpain became world champions with a dominant performance. Lauren Hemp hit the bar from outside of the box early on but that was the pinnacle of England’s first-half chances and Olga Carmona ensured Spain went into the break ahead with a clinical finish past Mary Earps. Earps produced a fantastic 70th-minute penalty save from Jenni Hermoso and made further stops to keep England in the game but Spain deserved their win.Eze ObasiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Spain’s route to the final has been relatively uneventful compared with England’s. The world champions have controlled the vast majority of possession. Teams do get big chances against them, though, because they commit such numbers going forward. They leave space behind them because of their playing style, and that’s where their vulnerabilities are, down the sides of their centre-backs, as Germany’s chancesin their semi-finalshowed. Belgiumscored twiceagainst Spain and could have scored more,Italy scored against themand there’s a vulnerability to Spain that did not exist a few years ago, so the opportunity to score against them is greater.Sunday’s contest depends on who Spain start with, because when they play Clàudia Pina and Mariona Caldentey, they’re not pacey players who are going to get in behind. Is Montse Tomé going to start with a team that will dominate the ball but won’t stretch England in behind? Or will she start with the pace of a Salma Paralluelo? That is interesting, because Spain have often been kept at bay for quite a while – their knockout matches were both 0-0 at half-time – but when games become more stretched, their chances grow.View image in fullscreenAitana Bonmatí has been instrumental for Spain in the latter stages.Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SheKicks/SPP/ShutterstockThere have been distinct differences watching Spain this year. I’ve never seen Aitana Bonmatí so wide, and that’s because of having Alexia Putellas in the 10 position. But it means you get situations such as Bonmatí’s winning goal in the semi-final, which was 100% a shot. Ann-Katrin Bergerhas demonstratedthroughout the tournament she’s a world-class goalkeeper, but she has a tendency to step forward and leave a small gap at the near post, and I don’t think many players can score that goal. Aitana scores it because she’s Aitana. That was genius play and crucial because Berger is the best goalkeeper in the world at saving penalties, so the smart money would have been on Germany in a shootout.In terms of Spain’s threats, what I find fascinating is they are very good at set pieces. They’re well rehearsed. We always talk about Spain’s quality in possession but their quality out of possession is the best in the world. They’re the best counter-pressers. Oh my God, they’re unbelievable. And because they have a system and shape that puts bodies in such close proximity, it means if you can’t break out of the sides of their press, they just swarm you again and again and again. They don’t get the credit they deserve for the amount of defensive effort they put in. Their total team game is exceptional. And I’ve studied them, trust me.There has been up and down in England’s results over the past 18 months but Sarina is a smart woman, a world-class manager who’s been there before. The team’s resilience is key. They were 90 seconds from going out against Italy and it looked as if the luck had run out, but it hadn’t.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In my last year when we shouldn’t have won the title because Manchester City should have, you can sit there and say: “Oh, is that because Man City blew it?” Well, we still had togo and win it. If you score one more goal than your opponent, you’re the winner. This isn’t a game of fairness and Englandsimply scored more goalsthan Italy.View image in fullscreenSarina is a smart women, a world-class manager who’s been there before.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APSpain are prolific but I expect a close game. There may be moments for England and then complete Spanish dominance, but that doesn’t mean Spain will win. Just because you’re not the most dominant team doesn’t mean you cannot win. England must use all their experience.Overall, this has been a tournament about goalkeepers and the rise of so many good ones. Berger, Italy’s Laura Giuliani andEngland’s Hannah Hamptonhave stood out. This has also been a tournament about the strength of teams’ benches, because there has been much more quality from substitutes for so many teams. It is going to be a great final in Basel and a great showcase for the sport.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSpain women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Among the evening’s highlights was a fascinating Q&A session featuring Martin Johnson and Alun Wyn Jones, both of whom have led Lions teams into series-defining games and know from personal experience just how swiftly a sure thing can disintegrate.Johnson may have hoisted the Rugby World Cup in Australia in 2003 but the merest mention of the 2001 Lions tour, even two decades later, still prompts him to put his head in his hands. The Lions, as now, had won the opening Test with relative ease and were in front at half-time in Melbourne the following week. They felt firmly in control of the game and on the verge of sporting immortality.‘We’re not playing a pub team’: Itoje warns Lions of wounded Wallabies at MCGRead moreAnd then, in a flash, all their dreams were summarily dashed. Jonny Wilkinson had an attempted long pass intercepted, Richard Hill was taken out by an off‑the‑ball elbow and the Wallabies, 11-6 down at the interval, surged clear to win 35-14. A week later, with the Lions by now feeling the effects of a long, hard season, Justin Harrison’s stolen late lineout duly completed a famous Australian triumph in Sydney.It may not be entirely coincidental, then, that the battle-hardened Johnson was invited into camp to present the 2025 squad with their jerseys before what, for many, is the biggest game of their lives. He fully expects the underdog Wallabies to bite back after their Brisbane bashing, when the Lions won most of the key collisions and might have scored two or three more tries in the first half alone.With rain also around to complicate things, his gut feel is that those blithely expecting a Lions clean sweep are getting ahead of themselves. Jones, similarly, was part of the 2013 Lions squad which took the first Test in Australia only to go down narrowly in the second. They went on to win the decider in Sydney but, once again, nothing was guaranteed until the closing night of the series. The present Wallaby squad may not be the strongest in history but there is no more potent sporting cocktail than a mixture of damaged pride and do-or-die necessity.It is also hard to believe their head coach, Joe Schmidt, has not been sifting the ashes of the first‑half Suncorp surrender with the finest-toothed comb. Now Rob Valetini and Will Skelton are back, supported by a 6-2 forward‑heavy bench, the Wallabies should be much harder to skittle this time, particularly with Joe McCarthy injured and Ellis Genge benched. And if some front-foot ball is forthcoming, the hosts’ attacking potential will potentially be transformed.View image in fullscreenMartin Johnson knows from personal Lions experience just how swiftly a sure thing can disintegrate.Photograph: Jason O’Brien/Seconds Left Images/ShutterstockAt which point one of two hairline cracks in the Lions edifice might just be exposed. Talking to several former Lions out here there is near-unanimous concern that the touring side have not yet fully clicked as a forward unit. Their work around the breakdown can be frustratingly bitty and has lacked a cold-eyed ruthlessness that, say, the All Blacks would regard as non-negotiable.No one could also accuse James Lowe of being in the form of his life on the left wing. It is a not dissimilar story with James Ryan, who is nevertheless now involved on the Test bench. Hugo Keenan has been an Irish linchpin for several years but, again, has yet to soar to any great heights in Australia since returning from illness. Farrell must be hoping his green-tinged Lions are saving their best until last.Then there is the midfield duo of Bundee Aki and Huw Jones, which would have morphed into an all-Irish duo had the originally selected Garry Ringrose not stepped aside because of concussion symptoms. How exactly will Jones react, having dovetailed nicely with his mate Sione Tuipulotu in the first Test only for both players to be initially jettisoned for the second? And can he and Aki – “Hundee”? “Jaki”? – now write themselves into Lions folklore regardless?The most obvious conclusion is that Farrell is braced for an awkward contest which will require his side to dig deep defensively at times. There is also the minor matter of the refereeing. Andrea Piardi was the man in the middle in April, when Munster were mistakenly forced to play with 14 men for almost a quarter of an hour in a United Rugby Championship match against the Bulls after confusion over the laws surrounding uncontested scrums.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOn the flip side, Piardi – who will become the first Italian to take charge of a Lions Test – has plenty of experience when it comes to refereeing Leinster, who supply no fewer than nine members of the Lions’ matchday 23. Australia would be foolish to pin hope on anything out of their control, anyway. A more proactive plan, surely, is to start more strongly, get ahead on the scoreboard for the first time in the series and then see how the Lions respond when they are required to chase a game.And if the contest is still tight after an hour, the Wallaby bench is by no means the worst, with Angus Bell, Carlo Tizzano, Langi Gleeson and Tate McDermott all equipped to raise the tempo a notch. It is not a stretch to suggest the Wallabies will be a dozen points stronger this week which, if so, will require the Lions to up their game as well.View image in fullscreenRob Valetini’s availability is a major boost for the Wallabies and will aid their chances in the second Test.Photograph: James Ross/AAPEither way, it is necessary to rewind to 1950 and 1989 to find postwar instances of the Lions winning both the last two Tests of a series. Which backs up Johnson’s warning to today’s players that it is less a case of picking up where they left off at the final whistle in Brisbane as in effect starting again from scratch. “We had Martin Johnson in last night,” said the Lions scrum coach, John Fogarty. “He talked about the small margins in the biggest games and doing the fundamentals. For him as a player the issue was compounding errors. Those are the things you need to make sure you’re on top of during the match. We are not going to get everything our own way.”Ironically enough, Johnson could yet be left clutching an unwanted record if the Lions take an unassailable lead. Should that happen, as he self-deprecatingly observed this week, it will leave him as the only postwar Lions captain to have lost a series in Australia. In isolation this contest could be nip and tuck but a dead rubber in Sydney still feels the likeliest outcome.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Australia rugby union teamAustralia sportRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The race leader, Tadej Pogacar, untroubled by any meaningful attacks, maintained his overall lead fromJonas Vingegaard.The victorious Ineos Grenadiers rider, whose team have been fielding questions overa staff member involved in an anti-doping investigationrelated to their glorious days as Team Sky, was taking his second victory in the race.Tour de France 2025: Pogacar and Vingegaard break on final stage 19 climb to La Plagne – liveRead moreBut it was a disappointing stage for Scotland’s Oscar Onley, who after surviving almost everything that the Tour could throw at him, fell away from the podium positions in the closing moments, after third-placed Florian Lipowitz attacked to move clear with Pogacar and second-placed Vingegaard.With only 22sec between them, Onley and Lipowitz were inseparable for most of the stage, but, when Pogacar launched his first attack with seven kilometres to go, Lipowitz struggled to follow. However the German subsequently turned the tables on Onley, taking another 40sec on the young Scot at the line to further secure a probable third-place finish in his debut Tour.Ahead of them, Arensman, winner in thePyrenean stage to Superbagnèreswas hoping to replicate that success with another summit finish stage win, but as he entered the final two kilometres his lead began tumbling.Yet the grimacing Dutch rider hung on to win by only two seconds as Vingegaard, who had said he would risk all to win the race, finally attacked Pogacar in the last kilometre to finish just ahead of him.“I’m absolutely destroyed,” a drained Arensman said after the stage. “Already to win one stage in the Tour, unbelievable. But now, to win from the general classification group, against the strongest riders in the world, feels like I’m dreaming.”Arensman said that his lack of interest in the overall standings had fed into his decision to attack. “I started the climb with the lead group and I was: ‘I have no GC [interest], maybe I should just try, maybe they will look at each other.’”Of his series of accelerations, he said: “I didn’t take no for an answer … It was Tadej and Jonas. Everybody knows they are the strongest in the world, they are almost aliens. I just can’t believe I beat them today.”The stage, originally scheduled to be 130km over four climbs was truncated in length by almost 40km, after a cull of infected cows led to the removal of two climbs, the Côte d’Héry-sur-Ugine and the Col des Saisies.Lipowitz’s Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team had clearly intended to test Onley’s resolve and when Primoz Roglic attacked on the descent of the Cormet de Roselend, the tactic isolated the 22-year-old Onley even further.As cold rain fell on the valley road to La Plagne and UAE Team Emirates XRG gave chase, Roglic’s advantage ebbed away, until he was caught and summarily dispatched at the foot of the final climb.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anything is, of course, still possible, particularly on Sunday’s final stage through Paris, which replicates the Paris 2024 road race and includes three laps of the Côte de la Butte Montmartre.Asked if that stage might present another opportunity to win, the race leader sounded dismissive. “I hope I just come to Paris with the yellow jersey,” Pogacar said. “I don’t feel like super-energised right now to think about racing on Sunday.

The 27-year-old West Ham midfielder faced a lengthy ban after being charged in May last year with four counts of deliberately getting himself booked to influence betting markets so that friends and family members might benefit.The Football Association also brought two charges against the Brazilian of failing to cooperate withthe investigation, which opened in August 2023 and related to four yellow cards that he received for West Ham in Premier League matches between November 2022 and August 2023. He could have faced a life ban if found guilty.Newcastle’s Alexander Isak offered £600,000-a-week tax-free deal by Al-HilalRead morePaquetá was on the brink of an £85m move to Manchester City when the investigation was started – it fell down when West Ham briefed City about the situation – and he has since “been living this nightmare for two years” in the words of his wife, Maria Fournier.It appears that nightmare is almost over. A regulatorycommission finally convened to hear the caseon 17 March, retiring to consider its verdict in early June, and it is understood it has delivered a favourable verdict for Paquetá, who cost West Ham a club-record £51m when he joined from Lyon in August 2022. He has always maintained his innocence and been supported by West Ham, arguing he knew nothing about the bets placed on him and that the FA’s evidence was circumstantial.“I am extremely surprised and upset that the FA has decided to charge me,” Paquetá said upon hearing of the charges in May last year. “For nine months, I have cooperated with every step of their investigation and provided all the information I can. I deny the charges in their entirety and will fight with every breath to clear my name.”Three of the yellow cards that drew suspicion came in the 2022-23 season, the first for a late tackle on Leicester’s Boubakary Soumaré in a 2-0 home defeat in November 2022.

It was the 65th minute and the score at the London Stadium was 1-1. West Ham would win 3-1.The authorities had been alerted to suspicious betting patterns and the tipping point for them came in the first game of the following season when Paquetá was booked in stoppage-time at Bournemouth with the score 1-1, which is how the game would end. Again, more suspicious betting activity was detected.Most of the suspicious bets were traced to Paquetá Island off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, where Paquetá was born and from which he takes his name. About 60 bets were placed on him to be shown a yellow card in the games in question. A source with knowledge of the FA’s investigation said that one of the bets was for £7, with the highest £400.

We don’t know yet [if she’ll be ready], but that’s what we’re going to go for – [aiming for] 23 players available for the game on Sunday.”The Arsenal forward Beth Mead, who replaced James on Tuesday, could be in line to start if James is unavailable and the super-sub Chloe Kelly could also be under consideration.Ella Toone has predicted that another super-sub,Michelle Agyemang, will experience a significant change to her life when England return home after the striker’s starring role in the run to the final, but Toone has praised the 19-year-old’s maturity in her debut tournament.When England won Euro 2022 on home soil Toone came on to score in knockout games against Spain and Germany. This summer, Agyemang has stepped up with late equalisers against Sweden and Italy to save England’s campaign.“She might get papped eating a pasty like I did! I’ll have to warn her about that,” Toone said with a chuckle. “She’s definitely in the [team] bubble now, but I think when she gets out she’ll be recognised a lot more than she was before the tournament, that’s for sure, and she definitely deserves that as well.“It’s mad, I would think she’s about 30 years old, she’s so mature. She’s so humble. She’s coming to this tournament with freedom, not a worry, not a care. She’s just gone out there and done what’s been asked of her.“She’s been amazing for us. She’s turned up in big moments when we’ve needed her. She’s got a lot of talent and she can do a lot of things that not many players can do. Even when she scored and kept us in games, she’s been the same Michelle that she was when she started this tournament. I’m absolutely buzzing for her. It’s nice for good people to get things that they deserve and she’s definitely one of those people.”View image in fullscreenElla Toone (left) with Michelle Agyemang after the striker’s match-saving goal against Italy.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APEngland are contesting their third consecutive major final, which Toone described as “something the country can be proud of”. Toone thanked England’s fans for their support. “The fans at home, we’ve probably given them a heart attack,” she said, but she hopes the Lionesses’ fighting comebacks and spirit can help them in the final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ll have that togetherness to hopefully get over the line.”Wiegman is in her third straight Euros final and her fifth major final in a row, a sequence that began with winning the 2017 Euros with the Netherlands. Toone praised the Dutchwoman’s team talks, saying: “We had a good one before the Italy game, the night before in the meeting, one that definitely stood out. Then again before the game. Sarina’s speeches before the games have definitely got us motivated.“Even though sometimes we have gone a goal down, you still remember the words that she said before the game and it makes you want to go out and put on a performance for the second half as well. She’s been pulling them out of the bag. No matter what Sarina says, you listen, because she’s reached five major tournament finals so she definitely knows what she’s doing.”Toone also knows what to do in big games, having scored in an FA Cup final, a World Cup semi-final, the Women’s Finalissima at Wembley against Brazil and most famously when she opened the scoring in 2022’s Euros final against Germany with her lobbed effort. “Hopefully there’s a chance that I can put it in the back of the net like I have done in previous finals,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamLauren JamesWomen's footballWomen’s Euro 2025newsShareReuse this content"

This is her usual state, calm, and as England prepare for a third major tournament final, against Spain on Sunday, and Wiegman’s fifth consecutive major final, it’s what they need.Asked to look back on her own development during four whirlwind years in charge, she is reflective. “As every person in this room develops, I develop too, with experiences,” she says. “First my English has improved, so I understand a lot more, but also you learn more about the people you work with. You learn more again about yourself and how you respond to things and, while I’m always working on developing the team and developing or trying to help the development of people, I always try to keep developing myself.England v Spain: where the Women’s Euro 2025 final could be won or lostRead more“What I’ve really wanted to do over all these years is try to enjoy it all a little bit more. You have to be focused in this job, you have to be focused but you need to celebrate the moments that are good, it’s really nice.”The midfielder Keira Walsh said the manager has been incredibly consistent during her time at the helm. “She probably shows her excitement a little bit more after games than she used to do,” she said. “When you see on the side she’s dancing and singing and we didn’t see that so much when she first came in. But, in terms of how she delivers tactics and how she manages, I think she is very, very similar.“She’s probably one of the best managers I’ve played for in terms of trying to make everyone feel loved. It’s a really, really difficult job when you’re in a tournament, and obviously people want to play, people aren’t, but she really, really cares about the human side. Another thing that you notice when you play for her is how calm she is. It makes a massive difference in the 95th minute when you’re losing 1-0, and you look to the side and she’s very calm. That speaks volumes of her as a manager.”Wiegman smiles at the mention of her celebrations when Walsh’s comments are relayed to her. “That comes from these performances, of course. It’s so intense. Of course I look very calm, but when the whistle goes and we score a goal and we change the game, when you have one minute left or 10 seconds left, of course that is emotional.”View image in fullscreen‘It makes a massive difference when you’re losing 1-0, and you look to the side and she’s very calm’Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockThe manager has perhaps had more scrutiny in the buildup to this tournament than at any other point during her time with England. Performances have been questioned and the sudden retirements of Mary Earps and Fran Kirby plus the withdrawal of Millie Bright from selection, was cause for concern.“In this environment you have challenges all the time,” says Wiegman. “Before the World Cup, we had challenges with players who were injured. Of course, we prepare a lot and we know the players really well. We think of scenarios: ‘Who is the first player to select? Who is the second?’ You’re prepared for challenges. The challenge ahead of the tournament is the same for an injured player or a player who is not available. You have to move on to what you want and who is ready to compete.”Wiegman’s directness has at times rubbed players up the wrong way, particularly in the Netherlands, but she is pragmatic in her approach: if you add value to the team, you are in, if you don’t or don’t anymore, you are moved on. With time, wins and the authority that comes with them, players are more easily brought on board with her approach on and off the pitch.She’s probably one of the best managers I’ve played for in terms of trying to make everyone feel lovedKeira WalshAnd, regardless of some former Dutch players having expressed frustrations in the past, there are many that will speak about the impact of that human approach.The former Netherlands and Ado den Haag player Rianne Schorel is one of them. Schorel has nothing but love for Wiegman, despite having lost contact with her former manager since she was forced from the game due to a head injury that took 10 years to recover from. Wiegman’s attention to player welfare and her support for Schorel was hugely appreciated by the former player both at the time and still is today.The chief executive of the Football Association, Mark Bullingham, picked that characteristic out as a key reason as to why she is so special.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Really stressing that everyone’s in it together is critical and I think she’s really helped build a very, very strong culture, not just amongst players but the whole support team.”View image in fullscreen‘She’s really helped build a very, very strong culture, not just amongst players but the whole support team’Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/EPAOften players refer to her as being like a mum. “Yeah …”, says an unsure Wiegman. “Sometimes when people talk about ‘the girls’ I think: ‘Do they mean my daughters or do they mean my team?’ So, that’s tricky, I’m kind of a caring person. I care about them but at the same time I’m the coach, I’m making hard decisions at the moment so sometimes you have to leave that caring and leave it up to them. They’re grown-up women, but a mum should care.”Regardless of subjective opinions on England’s run to the final, Wiegman’s record speaks for itself and is an objective fact. “She’s just a very special coach and I think there are teams here that have got good players that haven’t made it through to a final,” added Bullingham. “We have got good players but so have some other countries. She’s performed so well at the highest level, keeping that calm composure, keeping the connection with the players and managing the games really well.”Schorel, having gone to play college football in the US before returning to the Netherlands, remembers Wiegman talking to her about calming down, taking some intensity out of her game and not overworking. This is familiar to those that have covered England for some time because that is the same message she came into the job delivering.Leah Williamson most recently reflected on that time: “The English are known for having a certain type of mentality – a fight about us. Historically we’ve maybe been quite a defensive team. I remember one of the first things she said was: ‘Just slow down’, she wanted us to focus on the football.” Though Wiegman and the Lionesses stand on the verge of more records and more history, the personal acclaim is something she is uncomfortable with.“Yeah, I do find that awkward,” she says. “Of course, I find it very special too, but I do believe that everyone plays his or her part in the success. What I’m trying to do is bring people together in the best possible way, players and staff, and the people around me are really, really good. If they perform at their highest level, then the chance of winning a game is the highest possible. That’s what I’m trying to do. I think I’m pretty good at bringing people together, but without the quality, you’re not going to win a tournament.“So, you need very good players, the support staff, the environment we’ve created, how we can do recovery, how we can do the gym sessions with players, the pitch, which is perfect to train on. There’s so many things that make us who we are now.”Explore more on these topicsSarina WiegmanWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are five key areas where the game could be decidedSophie Downeyin BaselFri 25 Jul 2025 09.25 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 15.48 EDTShareMidfield battleSpain’s domination in the middle of the park, in and out of possession, is what contributed significantly totheir victory over Englandat the World Cup in 2023. The trio of Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas and Patri Guijarro are very technical and comfortable on the ball and create midfield rotations. Guijarro is instrumental, allowing the other two to make their runs and finding the passes to cut through defensive lines. In thesemi-final against Germany, she completed more passes than anyone else. How England set up their midfield will be crucial. Their Nations League victory in February was down in large part to the selfless work rate of Ella Toone, Grace Clinton and Keira Walsh, who at times had to sacrifice the creative aspects of the game to close the midfield spaces, cut off the passing triangles that Spain love and prevent them from having free rein to roam through the thirds.England’s left-side frailtiesThe left side of England’s defence has been targeted throughout the tournament. Remember Delphine Cascarino for France, Stina Blackstenius and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd for Sweden and Sofia Cantore for Italy. England have not looked comfortable there, no matter who has been selected to start. Ona Batlle and Mariona Caldentey will be licking their lips at the prospect of imposing themselves early on Alex Greenwood and whoever is chosen at left centre-back. England tend to be caught high in that area and will need to be extremely disciplined and perhaps sit a little deeper to stop themselves being exposed to the pace of Spain. It also raises the question about whether Sarina Wiegman could start with a three at the back to try to add more protection and pack their box with numbers when Spain break.Quick GuideEngland v Spain: past three meetingsShowSpain 2-1 England, 3 June 2025, BarcelonaEngland were knocked out of the  Nations League after going ahead through Alessia Russo in the 21st minute. In the second half, Spain’s Clàudia Pina made an instant impact from the bench, scoring two minutes after coming on, then doubling her tally 10 minutes later as Spain secured victory. The Lionesses would have qualified for the semi-finals at Spain’s expense with a win.England 1-0 Spain, 26 Feb 2025, LondonA Wembley crowd of 46,550 watched England defeat Spain in the teams' first meeting since the World Cup final, in Nations League A Group 3. Jess Park’s 33rd-minute goal  secured victory for the Lionesses. Lucía García’s first-half attempt that rattled the crossbar and second-half chances for the winger Salma Paralluelo were the highlights of Spain's attacking play but England held on.Spain 1-0 England, 20 August 2023, SydneySpain became world champions with a dominant performance. Lauren Hemp hit the bar from outside of the box early on but that was the pinnacle of England’s first-half chances and Olga Carmona ensured Spain went into the break ahead with a clinical finish past Mary Earps. Earps produced a fantastic 70th-minute penalty save from Jenni Hermoso and made further stops to keep England in the game but Spain deserved their win.Eze ObasiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England’s distribution from the backIt is unlikely England will see much of the ball, either by design or by Spain’s ability to dominate possession. Therefore, the Lionesses must make sure they take their opportunities when they fall. One way to do this is to bypass midfield and set players such as Alessia Russo and Lauren Hemp away with crossfield passes and by going route one over the top. In Hannah Hampton, they possess one of the best distributors in the goalkeeping game. Her pass to Russo in England’s second match took out 95% of the Netherlands team for Lauren James’s opener and she is constantly hitting Lucy Bronze and Greenwood on the sidelines as she sets off England’s attacking play. Equally, Leah Williamson is one of the best ball-playing centre-backs and has registered the most accurate long balls per 90 minutes of anyone in the competition.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson is one of the best ball-playing centre-backs at the tournament.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockKey match-upsHemp against Batlle will be an eye-catching contest down England’s left. Both are lightning quick; in fact, Batlle has registered the tournament’s highest top speed at 30.5 km/h. Spain’s right-back likes to push high, which Hemp will have to be aware of defensively, but it is a strong option for England to hit on the transition and exploit the space left in behind. Irene Paredes and Russo know each other very well having come face-to-face inthis year’s Champions League final. Russo’s intelligence and energy in the press are among her strongest assets and she closed down Paredes exceptionally throughout. The Spain defender loves time on the ball and is the most accurate passer in the competition. The England forward can break through at pace, something Spain have not looked altogether comfortable with. Equally at the other end the new defensive unit of Williamson and either Esme Morgan or Jess Carter will have to be alert to deal with the direct threat of Esther González. One more to keep an eye on is Walsh v Bonmatí in midfield – two players who know each other’s strengths and weaknesses well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The options Wiegman has at her disposal give her a variety of ways to change a game. Michelle Agyemanghas caught the headlineswith two late goals from the bench that have arguably kept the Lionesses in the competition. Chloe Kelly is a big impact player whose delivery from wide areas is second to none and Aggie Beever-Jones is one of the most instinctive finishers. It is also the versatility of the players that serves Wiegman well; their ability to do a job wherever needed. Beth Mead played in every midfield position after coming on for James against Italy and applied herself with aptitude. Montse Tomé has finishers of her own. Athenea del Castillo has come on twice to change a match,scoring against Switzerlandand setting up Bonmatí’s extra-time winner against Germany. Salma Paralluelo is another who has that ability, hitting tired defences with her pace late on.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSpain women's football teamWomen's footballFootball tacticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is one of the many fields of play for Yana Daniëls, a footballeranda carpenter, and one of the more solitary and spacious.There is something to be said for the similarities between the art of carpentry and Daniëls’s sport, of the precision born of graft and execution, although crafted by hand rather than foot. But perhaps more to be said about the balance of life, control and chance.England’s unashamed icon: Chloe Kelly renews starring role at Euro 2025Read moreThis year Daniëls, who has left Liverpool at the end of her contract and has 45 caps for Belgium, has spent time making her own contribution to Euro 2025. She did not make the Belgium squad for the tournament but instead she has handcrafted the boxes for every player-of-the-match trophy in a converted Wirral garage, with wood from Arrowe Park.Each box is engraved with the matchday number, date and venue, above a proudly printed “Made by Yana Daniëls”. Alexia Putellas, Aitana Bonmatí and Chloe Kelly are among those who have been handed them in Switzerland.“The front lid slides in and out through a groove and the entire box is made from sustainable wood, no hinges or screws,” says Daniëls, who set up her own business a year and a half ago. “It’s 100% sustainable, which is something I care deeply about.”Perhaps more than most footballers, the former Belgium international has had to plan ahead. A decade on from a career-threatening injury, we speak after she has completed an intense training session followed by an hour-and-a-half commute home.View image in fullscreenYana Daniëls with some of the Euro 2025 player of the match trophy boxes.Photograph: Courtesy of Yana Daniels“I realised how quickly things can change, from playing to not having a football job. I think that helped me think about future plans,” says Daniëls, a self-professed “planning geek” who studied agro-biotechnology at university.“When you get older you start to realise: ‘How long will I play on for? Will I need to find a normal job?’ Your body gets tired, the young players come up, and they are really good. You start doubting yourself. You know one day you have to retire. I think that scares a lot of people.”Carpentry was an interest developed through DIY requests for the changing rooms at Liverpool as well as from many teammates. A table for a physio’s front room, wall decor for Laura Coombs, placemats for Gilly Flaherty and personalised racks for her teammates’ boots were all made, mainly from wood sourced from Arrowe Park. Some days the wood might be from other local parks, and on others Daniëls would get a message from a friend saying: “Tree chopped down, it’s here, come get it.”Across her career Daniëls has played in nearly every position and was called “a manager’s dream” by the then Liverpool manager, Matt Beard. Off the pitch it seems as if the carpentry has helped her. “Sometimes we are locked in a football world, which can be quite brutal,” she says. “Football is a business. Sometimes, you’re just a little number and you can be replaced the next day if they want.”The 33-year-old has had to be resourceful throughout her life. She remembers fondly the chalet she holidayed in as a child – handmade with local wood by her parents – as a core memory of creation and comfort. But it has not all been plain sailing. In 2015 she spent six months working as a zookeeper while recovering from a lateral cruciate ligament tear, an injury that sidelined her for two years. After the contract with Liverpool ran out this summer, she travelled across eight European countries in a hand-refurbished campervan with her partner and long-time teammate Jasmine Matthews, accompanied by their cockapoo, Alfie.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most leave it with little financial security. “It has changed in the last two or three years; the money is going up. Even an 18-year-old can have a full-time income,” she says. “We were never able to live that way, so we knew we had to have a backup plan.“It’s a totally different mindset for young players now. They are fully invested in football and that’s the only thing they do. But I think it’s so important that you don’t just focus on football. I think you can get quite isolated.”Daniëls’s company, The Woodcycle, has benefited from a development programme that aims to help female players with their careers after retirement. The programme, called The Second Half, has benefited from the collaboration and guidance of people in the game such as Karen Carney and Kim Little.“It’s about having the right team around you,” Daniëls says. “It’s nice that ex-players can prove that you can do so much more than just football. They helped me massively, but I was surprised by the number of people who wanted to help.“You’re quite independent as a footballer, and then you need to share your ideas outside of it. It is hard at the start, but once you open up, there are a lot of people willing to help.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballBelgium women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It hadn’t seemed a particularly significant game: the second leg of alast-32 Europa League tie against Midtjyllandon a chilly and cloudy February night. Old Trafford was far from full, the disillusionment that was beginning to stalk Louis van Gaal escalating after a 2-1 first-leg defeat.It soon got worse for United as Pione Sisto increased Midtjylland’s advantage. An own goal pulled one back only for Juan Mata to miss a penalty before half-time. But Rashford then slammed in a Mata cutback and converted a Guillermo Varela cross with a side-foot volley to give United the lead. They ended up winning 5-1. In the space of 12 second-half minutes, Rashford had been elevated from almost complete unknown to potential messiah, a status he confirmed three days later by scoring two and setting up another ina win over Arsenal. He was 18, Manchester-born, confident but understated. It was almost too perfect.Barcelona confirm Marcus Rashford loan from Manchester United with buy optionRead moreWhat then would have seemed a plausible future? What would he have taken had fate offered? One hundred goals for United? Two hundred? A Champions League? Given that was before Gareth Southgate had become England manager, perhaps dreams of winning a major international tournament would have seemed far-fetched, but 20 goals for his country? Thirty?Yet here we are nine years on, with Rashford unwanted at Old Trafford andjoining Barcelona on loan. He has scored 87 league goals for United and picked up two FA Cups, two League Cups and a Europa League. And while he was part of the side that was second at Euro 2020, the achievement is inevitably tainted by the fact that he hit the post with his penaltyin the shootout; three inches to the right, it would have been a goal and England would have led the shootout 3-2 with the pressure firmly on Italy.It’s a perfectly decent career, but there is an unavoidable sense of anticlimax, particularly over the past couple of seasons. Having scored 30 goals in all competitions for United in 2022-23, when he also got three in the World Cup, Rashford has scored just 19 over the past two years, four of them on loan at Aston Villa. He has often looked disaffected, the headlines about his off-field activities switching from hiscampaign for free mealsfor children toill-judged socialising.Rashford is still only 27, at his notional peak – albeit that players who start early often reach their peaks early (and those who believe inthe rule of 500may note that Rashford reached his 500th career appearance in Villa’s 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest at the beginning of April).He did enough for Villa to make it at least plausible that his problems are essentially those ofManchester Unitedand that a reset may yet allow him to reach the heights that seemed conceivable a decade ago. There has been little evidence of the sort of physical decline, the loss of acceleration Raheem Sterling has apparently suffered. Yet Villa clearly didn’t see enough in his 10 league appearances for them to exercise their £40m option to buy; even given how close they are pushing the threshold for trouble with the profitability and sustainability rules, it’s hard to avoid at least a slight sense of Rashford failing upwards, rejection from Villa leading to an offer from Barcelona.That’s assuming Barça are able to find another lever to pull so they can register him. He joins the goalkeeper Joan García in the queue of players Barcelona have signed but have not yet been able to register because of La Liga’s financial regulations. It’s not an uncommon problem at the club and they’ve always found a way. It took thecontroversial sale of rights to VIP seatsfor the next 25 years to a Qatari company for Dani Olmo and Pau Víctor to be registered last season. There is less and less future income to sell off. Rashford has agreed to a minimum 15% cut in his £325,000-a-week wages (potentially 25% including bonuses), but that still represents a significant sum even with Barça returning to the refurbished Camp Nou soon.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford’s breakthrough double against Midtjylland seems a long time ago.Photograph: Jon Super/APComplicated as Barcelona’s finances are, though, this could, if the issue is essentially clearing his head, be the perfect place for Rashford to recover his form. He’s away from the constant scrutiny of England, which was only heightened as he became a culture-war pawn. The pace and intensity of La Liga are not those of the Premier League.Barcelonaplay extremely attacking football, scoring 102 league goals last season; Rashford will get opportunities.

For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhich does perhaps raise the issue of why Barcelona want Rashford. Theirs is not a squad short of attacking players: Olmo, Ferran Torres, Víctor, Pablo Torre, Fermín López, Gavi and Ansu Fati started league games on the left last season, sometimes with Raphinha operating centrally. Fati has been loaned to Monaco and Torre has been sold to Mallorca, yet Barça still targeted a left-sided player this season, and considered Nico Williams and Luis Díaz before settling on Rashford as a (relatively) cut-price option seemingly undeterred by potential registration problems.Although there is a £26m option to buy, there is no obligation. If it works out, Barcelona get a quick and direct finisher and enhanced squad depth; if not, they can part ways at the end of the season, with nothing lost but a year of wages.For Rashford, meanwhile, there is real pressure. If this doesn’t work, what is the future for him? Potential can be a terrible curse. It doesn’t matter how good a young Premier League player looks, he is only ever a couple of disappointing seasons from being linked with the Turkish Super Lig or West Ham. When you promise as much as Rashford did in those few days in February 2016, even a very good career can end up suffering the taint of disappointment, however unfair that may be. For Rashford’s career and his legacy, these next few months are vital.Explore more on these topicsMarcus RashfordBarcelonaManchester UnitedcommentShareReuse this content"

Oliver Mintzlaff, the managing director of Red Bull’s parent company, Red Bull GmbH, was in attendance, a relatively rare occurrence and indicative of the sea change that has taken place, with Mintzlaff the ultimate victor in his power struggle with Horner.Mintzlaff, for such a key player, is anonymous enough to slip in and out of the paddock all but unnoticed. Not so Max Verstappen’s father, Jos, and his manager, Raymond Vermeulen, who arrived flanked by photographers who caught the relaxed and contented air emanating from both men, with Verstappen Sr in particular having long-lobbied against Horner.Helmut Marko, the head of motor sport and a Verstappen ally, duly took his place too as all of Red Bull’s power players came to oversee Mekies’s first race in charge and Red Bull’s first without Horner in control.Inside the team the personnel are without doubt undergoing a period of adjustment; for all the politicking Horner was well liked and sadness at his departure had been expressed by many.Paul Monaghan, Red Bull’s chief engineer, whom Horner recruited in his first year in charge in 2005, reflected what many were feeling about both past and future. “It was a shock to me and it was sad, Christian’s put a large chunk of his working life into the team,” Monaghan said.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen enjoyed a good start to his weekend at Spa by qualifying second for the sprint race.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“Laurent has got quite a difficult situation to be dropped in. So now it’s up to us to pull together as a team because nine other teams can’t wait to fight us. So if we’re going to stand up to them, we have to stand as a team.”The business as usual approach is intended to steady the ship and the management that ousted Horner are backing Mekies to do so. It is understood he is, as team principal and chief executive, being given full rein to do as he sees fit and is not considered in any way a caretaker manager, while Mintzlaff is expected to remain hands-off, although whether that remains the case might depend on quite how Mekies performs.Certainly in one key area, that of the relationship between the team and the Verstappen camp, tensions have eased after Horner’s dismissal.Whether Verstappen stays with Red Bull, however, still remains up in the air and he and his father’s attitude will surely be tempered by performance; the pressure is on Mekies from the off.The Frenchman said in Spa that he had been given no reason for Horner’s dismissal but that the former team principal had been in touch and offered his support to Mekies, who felt morale remained strong at Red Bull despite the upheaval. “The first 24 hours was a big adjustment, because nobody was expecting it,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After that, I’ve only found a huge amount of support from everyone, they just want to go racing.”The task facing him is immense not least in taking over the project of next year’s car being built to the biggest regulation change in over a decade and Red Bull’s first foray into building their own engines.These are long-term considerations around which he can still exert an influence, but for the moment the focus is narrow which may be to the Frenchman’s advantage.The nature ofFormula Oneand its relentless march forward means a win for Verstappen would go an enormously long way to easing the pressure and beginning the process of putting the past to bed and building anew.Certainly Verstappen has fine form here, Spa is a circuit he enjoys and with a host of upgrades for this race including a revised front wing he might be hopeful of making a decent fist of things under the new management but it is the dominant McLarens that look likely to once more hold the advantage.In qualifying for Saturday’s sprint race Oscar Piastri claimed pole with a mighty lap, a full half a second clear of Verstappen in second and his McLaren teammate Lando Norris in third. Lewis Hamilton finished in 18th having spun off on his hot lap in Q3.Explore more on these topicsRed BullFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Raducanu broke again to make it 4-3 courtesy of a scuffed drop-volley by Sakkari, who fought back once more following another double fault by the Briton. After getting her nose in front again, Raducanu held serve to take the opening set.Venus Williams, 45, falls short in bid for first win streak since 2019Read moreThe 22-year-old was looking to continue her impressive streak over the Greek player on her 30th birthday but Sakkari, who beat Katie Boulter earlier in the tournament, took a 4-2 lead in the second set. Temperatures of up to 36C took their toll as a physio was called on to the court to check on Raducanu. However, the break in play reinvigorated the 2021 US Open winner and she won five successive games to book her slot in the final four in two hours and 10 minutes.“My confidence has been building since Miami,” said Raducanu. “The amount of work I’m doing behind the scenes, to have that in the locker and banked; you know you’ve done it, it takes a little pressure off the results.“I’m really pleased today, Maria played a really good match and I think these conditions suit the jumpiness of her game. I’m really happy that I toughed it out.”Raducanu will face either Clara Tauson or Anna Kalinskaya for a place in the final.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

At least 1 million adults are estimated to have a bet on the horses in any given month of the year. And it is a very fair bet that on the morning of 13 November last year, no more than one in every 1,000 of them had even heard of Lord Allen of Kensington CBE, who was about to be unveiled as the new chair of theBritish Horseracing Authority, the ruling body of Britain’s second-biggest spectator sport.Lord Allen had, after all, had very little recorded contact with the sport of kings over the course of either a glittering business career in broadcasting, his time as a Labour party insider under Ed Milliband’s leadership, or a dozen years in the House of Lords. But his lack of a racing background seemed less important than Lord Allen’s well-connected position in what had recently become the ruling political party, and his track record with events including London’s successful bid for the 2012 Olympics and, more recently, the Invictus Games. Beyond that, he could always learn on the job after assuming his new role on 1 June this year.Racing’s response to tax ‘harmonisation’ bombshell risks disturbing endgame | Greg WoodRead moreLord Allen has had plenty of contact with racing in the eight months’ since his appointment was announced, however, which is the main reason why, nearly two months after his scheduled start date, his feet are still not under the BHA chairman’s desk. The former chair of several multi-nationals took a long look at the BHA’s governance structure, and in particular in the presence of members nominated by racing’s various special-interest groups on the Authority’s board, and did not like what he saw.He then went away and came back with an alternative vision. As a result, the 68-year-old will be cast in something akin to the Gwyneth Paltrow role on Monday as a sliding-doors drama with significant implications for a billion-pound industry unfolds at the BHA’s offices in London.In one version of the story, Lord Allen will finally take over as the most powerful individual in British racing, having persuaded the vested interests and power blocs that currently hold sway on the BHA’s board to, in effect, vote themselves into extinction. In the other, it will be a case of he came, he saw, he thought better of it.The first sign that Lord Allen was having second thoughts about his new role came just a few days before his intended start date, when the BHA somewhat sheepishly announced that, seven months after announcing his appointment, the new chair wanted more time to speak to stakeholders, “to better inform his vision for the sport”.Lord Allen himself has been tight-lipped throughout, in public at least, but his vision, according to well-sourced reports in the Racing Post, includes the removal of stakeholder-nominated members from the BHA board and the division of the Authority into two parts, one entirely commercial in its outlook and the other in charge of rules and regulation.Lord Allen is hardly the first individual to ponder the twisted knot of factional self-interests that pervades every level of the British racing industry and suggest that something needs to be done. Most rational observers, either inside or outside the racing bubble, would probably reach the same conclusion after 10 minutes of consideration.But he is arguably the first to do sobeforebeing sucked into racing’s political quicksand, where time stands still and a little foot-dragging here or there is more than enough to ensure that meaningful progress is always another a year or two away.A ruling body with a board focused entirely on the long-term health and interests of horse racing as a whole would be a first for British racing. Whether Lord Allen can get it across the line, however, is still far from certain.Special-interest groups proliferate in racing for a reason: it is not one sport, one business or even, as racehorse breeders will confirm, a single industry. It is a collection of many different businesses, from five-horse jumping stables to the uber-strings in Newmarket, from glittering venues like Ascot, the stage for Saturday’s King George, to small independent tracks like Pontefract and Newton Abbot. Owners, breeders and even jockeys (within reason) can also come in all shapes and sizes.View image in fullscreenLord Charles Allen appeared to be having second thoughts about whether to take up the post as chair of the British Horseracing Authority.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe two biggest racecourse groups – Jockey Club Racecourses and Arena Racing Company (ARC) – also operate with very different business models. JCR’s tracks, along with big independents like Ascot, Newbury and Goodwood, have high levels of raceday revenue from attendance. Many of ARC’s meetings, by contrast, are staged in front of empty stands to keep off-course betting turnover rolling.ARC’s biggest asset is the ownership of its fixtures. It will need a cast-iron guarantee that Lord Allen’s “commercial” ambitions for a body that does not, of itself, have a great deal to sell, will not impinge on that situation.Whether or not Lord Allen’s ambitious restructuring might actually come to pass or instead fade swiftly into obscurity may become apparent shortly after the BHA’s board meets on Monday. Similar aspirations for a less factional future have come to nothing in the past, but this could be the moment when Gwyneth finally gets onto the train.Romance can rule in King GeorgeFour of the five runners in Saturday’s King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot are closely matched on both ratings and recent form, and the outsider of that quartet, the ultra-dependableRebel’s Romance(4.10), has a better chance to record his first Group One win in Britain than a price of around 5-1 might suggest.Charlie Appleby’s gelding has seven top-level wins to his name abroad including two victories in the Breeders’ Cup Turf, but finished only third, behind Goliath and the subsequent Arc winner, Bluestocking, in last year’s King George.Rebel’s Romance was better than the bare result, however, having raced much closer to an unrelenting pace than either of the horses that came past him a furlong out.In a smaller field and a more conventionally-run race, the seven-year-old’s class and willingness to battle all the way to the line could be too much for his younger opponents.Ascot 1.40A wide-open renewal of this Group Three for juvenile fillies, withFitzellaperhaps the pick of the prices at around 5-1 to build on her three-length fourth at Royal Ascot last time.York 2.00Normal improvement from his first run for 149 days would seeJubilee Walkgo close in an ultra-competitive sprint.Ascot 2.20RoyalDresswon with plenty to spare last time and could be a stern opponent for the improving Chantilly Lace.York 2.40The excitingAlmaqamhas ground conditions to suit and should follow up his last-time out defeat of the subsequent Prince Of Wales’s Stakes winner, Ombudsman.Ascot 3.00Billyjohhad little chance from his draw over track and trip at the Royal meeting but has a better pitch here and plenty of pace among the high numbers to carry him into the race.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowAscot1.10 Dark Shore 1.40 Fitzella 2.20 Royal Dress 3.00 Billyjoh (nap) 3.35 Bopedro 4.10 Rebel’s Romance (nb) 4.45 Kuredu King 5.15 AramramYork1.25 Golden Palace 2.00 Jubilee Walk 2.40 Almaqam 3.20 Copper Knight 3.50 Chillingham 4.25 Tele Red 5.00 KisskodiChester1.30 Kokinelli 2.10 Oratorical 2.45 Vince Le Prince 3.15 Arabian Cobra 3.45 Aces Wild 4.20 Stash The Cash 4.55 Kodiac Thriller 5.30 Ey Up Its The BossNewcastle1.52 Crownthorpe 2.30 Fast Fred 3.08 Beny Nahar 3.40 Sheriff’s Court 4.15 Newyorkstateofmind 4.50 Greenlightforgo 5.25 Elettaria 5.55 PoetWindsor5.45 Desert Treasure 6.15 Startled Lady 6.45 Offiah’s Boy 7.15 Lady In Havana 7.45 Lahina Bay 8.15 Rage Of Thunder 8.45 Fancy DancerSalisbury6.00 Lost Signal 6.30 Addison Grey 7.00 The Bitter Moose 7.30 Patsy Snugfit 8.00 Twilight Moon 8.30 Alice’s ImpactWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.York 3.20The evergreenCopper Knightlooks the safest option in this annual sprint for jump jockeys, at a track where he already has seven wins to his name.Ascot 3.35David O’Meara’sBopedrois in the form of his life at nine years of age and looks big at around 10-1 to register a first win since the summer of 2023.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesBritish Horseracing AuthorityHorse racing tipscommentShareReuse this content"

How did this happen?Zoe WilliamsMost people believe Muslim values are incompatible with British ones, a new poll has found. It makes for bleak readingFri 25 Jul 2025 03.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 04.35 EDTShareAccording to YouGov, more than half of people do not believeIslamto be compatible with British values. I’m often dispirited by these polls, as much by the timbre of the questions as by the responses (how many times do we need to ask one another whether we can afford to avert a climate catastrophe, for instance?) But I can’t remember the last time I was stunned.Thislatest pollfound that 41% of the British public believe that Muslim immigrants have had a negative impact on the UK. Nearly half (49%) think that Muslim women are pressured into wearing the hijab. And almost a third (31%) think that Islam promotes violence. Farhad Ahmad, a spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, which commissioned the poll, was surprised that I was so surprised. Things had been really bad for ages, he said, directing me to not dissimilar numbersin 2016and 2019.This is the first year the community has included the question about the hijab, which strikes its own particularly depressing note. The hijab was a hot talking point in the early to mid-2000s, when military support for the US in its interventions in Afghanistan was often rhetorically justified by the toxic misogyny of the Taliban. Veils of all kinds came to represent the subjugation of women, to the dismay ofmany at the time.But 20 years have passed, during which time we’ve seen Boris Johnson use the burqa in what was condemned as aracist calloutto Telegraph readers, and the French experiment with banning full face veils – such as a niqab or burqa – in any public place, a chilling curtailment of, if not technically a human right, then what instinctively feels like any woman’s birthright to wear whatever the hell she pleases. Understanding has deepened, in other words – of the racism that anti-veil rhetoric often disguises, and the fact that to make a judgment about who’s controlling a woman and the extent of her autonomy, you have to know her pretty well. Or at the very least, have met her.If the figures aren’t striking to those who have been paying attention, they remain shocking, particularly when you compare the numbers with those who have a negative view of other religions: 7% have a bad opinion of Christians, 13% think poorly of Jewish people, 14% of Sikhs and 15% of Hindus. This has been a 25-year slide, from the idea that “Muslim extremists have views incompatible with British life” to “all Muslims”; and if people were making that elision already, it was not previously sayable. Sayeeda Warsi said in 2011 that Islamophobia was becoming socially acceptable – at the Conservative party conference she said it had “passed the dinner-table test”. The can’t be right, I remember thinking then – she must just be meeting too many Conservatives. Now we’re at the point where it’s not only socially acceptable, but socially dominant.In 2015, the US thinktank Center for American Progress publishedFear, Inc 2.0: The Islamophobia Network’s Efforts to Manufacture Hate in America, a revision of an earlier report by the author Wajahat Ali. It presented a forensic account of how post-9/11 feelings of grief and threat had been weaponised to produce a prejudice that had barely previously registered, and it made for depressing reading for several reasons.First, it revealed the amount of money pouring in to the creation of this narrative and from what sources (most of it was quite easily traceable back to billionaires and banking interests, which were simultaneously hosing cash at climate crisis counter-narratives among other conservative agendas). Second, it showed how coordinated and organised so many incredibly well-financed thinktanks were, amplifying one another’s messages and keeping a stable of ready commenters for broadcasters hungry for a hot-button issue. Third, the report laid bare how incredibly effective this network was in turning what were once “fringe, extremist views” (in Ali’s words) into mainstream talking points and wedge issues.The UK, however, seemed to lack a few core components of this campaign. There weren’t any obvious funders with deep pockets; evangelical Christians weren’t a strong voice in politics; and it had stronger regulation of hate speech in broadcasting (though weaker regulation in print). As it turned out, it didn’t matter. The US lab created this virus, and we caught it.Never have the effects of Islamophobia been so obvious, or so bleak. To read the domestic news, you would think that no grooming gang had ever contained a non-Muslim. In the rolling news cycle of even our public service broadcasting, Muslim lives are consideredless valuablethan non-Muslim ones, their loss less tragic. It would be functionally impossible to stand up in parliament and justify arms sales to Israel, small boats hysteria and inhumane treatment of asylum seekers, were it not for the groundwork that Islamophobia has laid.In subtler ways, this casual demonisation puffs up a notion of “British values” that are nowhere in evidence, nowhere defended, except in the supposed dichotomy with a Muslim worldview. Truthfully, if anyone cared to pin down a Muslim value that’s incompatible with a British one, it would be unlikely to flatter in the way this framing assumes. Last spring, I met a young woman who had been caring for her autistic brother since she was tiny. She said, in passing, that her faith had helped a lot, because in Islam, people with disabilities were prized, as were their carers, and their treatment as equals was a prerequisite for faithful Muslims. I hadn’t heard anything less like a modern British value in my life.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Where’s the backlash?Mohamad BazziAs the US president fires thousands in the name of preventing alleged fraud, he continues to spend taxpayer funds on his outingsFri 25 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 12.11 EDTShareDonald Trumpwill be visiting Scotland for five days, but he won’t spend most of his time in high-level diplomatic meetings or conducting other state business. He’s primarily visitingtwo of his golf resorts, and dedicating a new golf course named in honor of his mother, who was born in Scotland.In other words, Trump appears to be going on a junket, paid for by US taxpayers, to check out his golf properties in a foreign country.The White House has shared few details about Trump’s upcoming“private” trip,which starts on Friday and runs through 29 July. The secrecy is deliberate – to avoid questions and criticism of a presidential visit that is mainly focused on promoting Trump’s business interests. As of Tuesday, three days before Trump’s expected arrival in Scotland, the US administration still had not shared thepresident’s itinerarywith the Scottish police force, which is bracing for protests in several cities.Most coverage of Trump’s trip has focused on the fact that the White Housedecided to banWall Street Journal reporters from the press pool that will travel with the president, in retaliation for the outlet’s recent report connecting Trump to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But few media outlets have asked why Trump is visiting Scotland in the first place, especially since the White House is planning another, more elaboratestate visit to the UKin September, when Trump will be hosted by King Charles.When Trump’s aides finally confirmed his Scotland trip last week, they focused on hisplans to meetwithKeir Starmer, the UK prime minister, and John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister. Not surprisingly, the White House downplayed the fact that Trump will spend most of his time visiting his own golf courses – and holding those few official meetings at his properties. Trump is also expected to open anew golf courseat his resort along Scotland’s North Sea coast, near Aberdeen, naming it in honor of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. The Trump Organization isalready advertisingthe new 18-hole course, which is supposed to open to the public next month, as the “greatest 36 holes in golf”, alongside an original course that opened in 2012.It’s the latest example of Trump exploiting the presidency to promote his business interests, with little outrage or resistance from Congress, the news industry and the rest of the political establishment in Washington. With an obedient Congress led by Republicans who fear Trump’s wrath and a supreme court ruling that gave the president broad immunityfor official acts, Trump is more emboldened than ever. And while previous US presidents and their families have profited from their time in power, Trump has taken presidential graft to another level.The scope of Trump’s profiteering in the first six months of his second term has been astounding:foreign real estate dealsworth billions of dollars, negotiated by his sons and mostly based in the Middle East and Europe; a$2bn cryptocurrency projectwith an investment fund backed by the government of Abu Dhabi, which could eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for the president and his family; and anew private club in Washington(called “Executive Branch” and co-founded by Donald Trump Jr) that plans to charge a $500,000 membership fee. Thanks to its crypto investments and real estate deals, the Trump familyincreased its wealthby nearly $3bn after Trump took office in January.He also uses the vast resources of the presidency to regularly visit his properties, especially his golf resorts – and to publicly advertise his properties and other business interests at press conferences. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington estimated that, in his first six months back in office,Trump made 62 visitsto his golf courses, a 37% increase from his first term. (These visits include Trump appearances at private events and fundraisers, so he did not necessarily play golf at every outing.) A website called theDonald Trump Golf Tracker, which uses data from the president’s public schedule, says Trump has golfed about 23% of the days he has been in office (43 out of 186, as of Thursday).The problem isn’t that Trump enjoys golf – it’s that he insists on spending significant time at his own residences and golf courses, at taxpayer expense. And those trips often benefit Trump directly, since his properties have charged the US government tohouse Secret Servicepersonnel and White House staff, sometimes at“exorbitant” rates. Trump is particularly fond of his Florida mansion and private club at Mar-a-Lago, which he calls his “winter White House”. Since his inauguration, Trump has visitedMar-a-Lago 10 times, the last in early May, when he started making regular weekend trips to his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey – presumably to avoid the Florida heat.Each of Trump’s weekend jaunts to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster costs taxpayers millions of dollars. And they stand as a constant reminder of the president’s hypocrisy, as Trump fires thousands of federal workers and slashes government funding in the name of preventing alleged fraud – while he continues to spend taxpayer funds on his golf outings.In 2019, a report by the Government Accountability Officeanalyzed four tripsthat Trump took in 2017 to Mar-a-Lago, and estimated the price tag was $13.6m, or about $3.4m for each visit. That estimate included the cost of flying Air Force One, along with a separate cargo plane that carries the presidential motorcade, between Washington and the Palm Beach international airport. But the GAO reportdid not includethe cost of lodging, dining and other expenses incurred by White House staff during these visits, so the total bill is probably higher. With 10 trips to his Palm Beach resort so far into his second term, taxpayers have already spent at least $34m on Trump’s golf outings – not counting his visits to Trump-owned golf clubs in New Jersey and Virginia.How much will US taxpayers spend on Trump’s trip to Scotland, where he plans to visit his golf resorts at Turnberry and at Menie, north of Aberdeen? It’s difficult to come up with an accurate figure because audits of previous presidential travel usually include a partial accounting of costs incurred by multiple US agencies. But a visit by Trump to Scotland in July 2018, during his first term, to his Turnberry resort provides some clues. Trump made a weekend stopoverto play golfon his way to a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. An inspector general’s report, which was requested by Democrats in Congress, found that the Secret Service and the state department togetherspent more than $1.1mon the trip – a figure that doesn’t include the cost of flying Air Force One and its associated cargo plane.Trump’s weekend jaunt in 2018 to one of his golf resorts generated outrage from Democrats in Congress, and a subsequent investigation. Now Trump is embarking on an even longer, and largely personal, trip toScotland– one where he plans to visit all of his properties. And hardly anyone is raising a fuss because the president has normalized corruption and fully neutered his opposition.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionScotlandUS taxationcommentShareReuse this content"

The organisation is owned by its 17 million members – its customers – and is five times bigger than the next largest building society. What’s more, its members mostly seem happy with the service. Nationwide tends to come top of industry polls on that score.So we should be glad the society dodged the demutualisation craze of the 1990s that saw the likes of the Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock convert to banks, with generally terrible results. The mutual movement could have faded into irrelevance if Nationwide had fallen to the carpetbaggers.Nationwide boss’s £7m pay package declared ‘obscenity’ during AGMRead moreYet the boast about not being answerable to shareholders rings hollow when you see the limits of democracy, and thus boardroom accountability, at Nationwide.Exhibit A is the group’s adventure into the world of big acquisitions –last year’s £2.9bn purchase of Virgin Money. At a bank, shareholders would have had to approve the deal because the balance sheet was being increased by a third. By contrast, Nationwide’s members were not given a vote on a transaction that plainly has the potential to come back to bite them if it goes wrong.The explanation was coherent only in a legal sense: the 1986 Building Societies Act didn’t require a vote, and Nationwide would fall foul of the City takeover code if it inserted conditions that were not required by law. Come on, though, that is hardly satisfactory: there is a clear gap in regulations that were drawn up at a time when it was not imagined that building societies would buy banks.Exhibit B is the flashpoint for Friday’s annual meeting –the 43% increase in chief executive Debbie Crosbie’s maximum pay package to a mighty £7m. The society’s argument is that, after the Virgin deal, Nationwide is bigger and needs to mind the “competitive gap” on pay with NatWest and Lloyds Banking Group. “This is not about personal greed,” the pay committee chair, Tracey Graham, told the meeting. “It’s about equity with people who do similar jobs elsewhere.”What did the members make of that argument? It’s hard to say precisely. The poll on the remuneration report was merely advisory. Again, apparently, the rules don’t require a binding vote and Nationwide didn’t choose to have one. As it happens, 95% of votes were cast in favour – but the fact the board can ignore any rebellion is hardly an encouragement to turn out.In similar fashion, any member wanting to put themselves forward for election to the board – a not uncommon feature at building societies a generation ago – now has to have 250 nominations. Wannabe volunteer James Sherwin-Smith failed at that hurdle but may have been stymied by data protection rules, signature requirements and so on. It does not look as though Nationwide tried to assist him through the thicket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He addressed questions at the meeting openly but “them’s the rules” was the gist of his responses.For now, he can probably afford to be sanguine. Nationwide is performing well financially and it’s too soon to tell if Crosbie’s bet on Virgin Money will succeed or flop. It may also be only a small minority who would prefer Nationwide’s “fairer share” payments to be used instead to sharpen savings and lending rates. In good financial weather, you can even get away with portraying your bank rivals as oily fat cats in your TV adverts as your own chief executive is handed a potential £7m package.In trickier circumstances, however, it is not hard to see how life could become awkward. It is surely indefensible that shareholders in a bank get a binding vote on big takeovers and boardroom pay but members of Nationwide do not. That is a bad spin on the “we’re different” shtick. If the members are truly the owners, the governance needs an overhaul. It would be best done outside a crisis. If the rules for building societies are the problem, lobby to change them.Explore more on these topicsNationwideNils Pratley on financeBanks and building societiesExecutive pay and bonusescommentShareReuse this content"

But that doesn’t mean Trump can’t be defeatedFri 25 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 13.02 EDTShareThe fracas over the Jeffrey Epstein files – and declining poll numbers on every issue that wonDonald Trumpthe 2024 election – indicate cracks in the Maga coalition and weakening support for the president’s self-proclaimed mandate.But reports of Maga’s death are probably exaggerated.Trump has cheated death, both physical and political, many times. And while every tyrant craves the adoration of the people – and claims to have it even when he doesn’t – no tyrant worth the title counts on public support to stay in power.Last week, when the administration pulled an about-face on releasing100,000-odd documentsrelated to Epstein – amid conspiracy theories of deep-state pedophile rings, which Trump promoted – it looked like Trump was on the ropes. “Trump can’t stop MAGA from obsessing about the Epstein files,” reportedNBC. “Trump meets toughest opponent: his own base,” declaredAxios. Trump was “on the defense”,NPRsaid.The Guardianreported on Maga hat burnings.Even after House RepublicansblockedDemocrats on a resolution to force a vote on releasing the files, even after the speaker, Mike Johnson,withheldfrom the floor a similar resolution, the far right would not be mollified. “Dangling bits of red meat no longer satisfies,” the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posted onX. “The People … want the whole steak dinner and will accept nothing less.”Now some of the commentariat are predicting that even if Trump survives, the damage to the GOP is done.Inthe Hill, Douglas Schoen and Carly Cooperman marshaled polls showing Trump’s sliding approval from before to after the Epstein affair and conjectured that it could sink the Republicans in the midterm elections.At the same time, the populace, including Republicans, is changing its mind on Trump’s master plans. Six in 10 respondents to aCNN polloppose the federal budget bill; approval of Trump’s handling of the budget is down 11 points since March. On immigration, aGalluppoll showed a steep drop in respondents who favor more restricted admittance, from 55% in 2024 to 30% this June. The most striking change is amongRepublicans, from 88% who wanted fewer immigrants in 2024 to 48% in June 2025. Meanwhile, the percentage of Americans who think immigrants are good for America rose to a record 79%.The flood of TikToks showing masked men kidnapping people from the streets and manhandling elected officials has turned many people against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Two YouGov polls showed the agency’s favorability plummeting from anet positive of 15points in early February to adeficit of 13in late June. During Trump’s first term, “Abolish Ice” was the chant at tiny demonstrations by fringe-left organizations. Now more than a third of respondents to aCiviqs surveywant to see the agency gone, including an uptick of six points among Republicans since November, to 11% .Trump is not backing down. In fact, he’s doubling down on every policyAnd as David Gilbert pointed out inWired, even before the Epstein flap, some of the president’s most prominent supporters were defying him. The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson condemnedthe bombing of Iran. Trump whisperer Laura Loomer dissed his acceptance of a $400mplane from Qatar. Elon Musk defected overthe One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And Joe Rogan deemedIce raids targeting ordinary working migrantstoo much to bear.But Trump is not backing down. In fact, he’s doubling down on every policy. The deportation campaign has grown more vicious by the day. Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” is being rightly condemned as a concentration camp. A recentHuman Rights Watchinvestigation of three Miami area Ice facilities found detainees denied food and medicine, held in solitary confinement, and shackled at the wrists and forced to kneel to eat, as one man put it, “like animals”.The president muscled his budget and rescission package through Congress without regard to the disproportionate harm they augur for red-state residents, much less the deficit, the public health, or the planet’s future. His tariffs are barreling ahead, exasperating economists, hitting crucial US economic sectors and tanking entire economies overseas.General Motorsreported second-quarter profits down by a third. In the tiny, impoverished nation ofLesotho, “denim capital of the world”, Trump’s threatened 50% duties have shut down the garment factories, leaving thousands out of work, hungry and desperate.Trump may feel insulted, which he does most of the time; he may temporarily lose his footing. But he’s not relinquishing power without a fight.Tyrants don’t need high approval ratings. They intimidate voters, rig elections, or stop holding them altogether; suppress protest and jail, deport or assassinate their critics. The Nazis achieved peak support in 1932, at37.3%. Of the 1933 plebiscite that ceded all power to Hitler, the German Jewish diarist Victor Klemperer wrote: “No one will darenotto vote, and no one will respond No in the vote of confidence. Because (1) Nobody believes in the secrecy of the ballot, and (2) A No will be taken as a Yes anyway.”Daria Blinova, of the International Association for Political Science Students,arguesthat autocrats cultivate approval while consolidating their own power through the “illusion of substantial improvements”, which are actually insubstantial. In 2017, for instance, nine in 10 Saudi youth supported Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman because of such reforms as allowing cinemas to reopen.The Trump administration has begun deploying some similar tactics. The justice department ispressuring state electionofficials to turn over their voter rolls and give it illegal access to voting machines. The Republican National Committee istraining volunteersto “ensure election integrity” – AKA harassing voters and poll workers. It is trying to banish the opposition press. Homeland security is trying to deport the widely followed Salvadorian journalistMario Guevera, who has covered Ice raids and protests. Migrants sent home or to third countries can face persecution, torture or death.Still, none of this means that Trump is invincible, even when his administration uses violence to achieve its aims and terrify its critics. First – simplest and most difficult –the resistance must show up. Get bodies into the streets. The second nationwide anti-Trump rallies were bigger than the first; the third, fourth and 10th can be bigger still.Gather bodies at the sites of injustice.Volunteers are swarmingto immigration courts, where migrants who show up for mandatory hearings are being released into the clutches of waiting Ice agents. The court-watchers – experienced organizers and first-timers, retirees, students, clergy, elected officials, artists – are distributing “know your rights” leaflets in many languages, writing down names and contact information to inform families of their loved ones’ arrests or to connect arrestees to lawyers later on. Immigrants’ rights groups are holding training sessions. Spanish speakers are giving immigration-specific language lessons.This nonviolent gumming-up of the government’s criminal machine draws press and social media attention, multiplying participation, amplifying anger and mobilizing greater organization. At every step, people are bearing witness, storing it up for future accountability.The Epstein affair shows that no loyalty is unbreakable. The polls show that discomfort with Trump’s policies is growing. Discomfort can mature to rejection of injustice, rejection to resistance, resistance to action. A tyrant does not need majority support to maintain power. But neither does the opposition movement need majority participation to take power back.

Finally, justice has been doneRoberto SavianoThreats were made to stop me and other journalists reporting on their crimes. Now I hope to reclaim my freedomFri 25 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 05.22 EDTShareWhat criminal organisations fear most is the written word. That is what a court in Italy has established for the first time. It has taken 17 years for me to see justice done, but it finally came on 14 July. The court of appeals in Romeupheld a 2021 verdictin which the mafia boss Francesco Bidognetti and his former lawyer were found guilty of mafia-related threats against me.Bidognetti is the head of one of the most powerful and violent Camorra clans: the Casalesi. He is already in jail, serving a life sentence. Yet far from being merely symbolic, the new sentences (Bidognetti got a year and a half, his lawyer Michele Santonastaso a year and two months) are momentous.They are punishment for a case that involved no ordinary act of intimidation, but one that was unique in the history of organised crime. It was performed in public in March 2008, during the 10-year “Spartacus” maxi-trial, which involved 115 defendants and resulted in 27 life sentences including Bidognetti’s.That day, through his lawyer, Bidognetti publicly expressed his own criminal truth by singling out two journalists – myself and Rosaria Capacchione – to be held responsible if he were convicted. Santonastaso read a document aloud in court – a “proclamation” that we later learned echoed statements made by terrorist organisations.It was an unprecedented act in the history of mafia trials. The message was chilling: if the two mafia bosses in the dock, Bidognetti andAntonio Iovine, ended up in prison – as they did – the guilt would be ours. Our reporting, our complaints and our influence on prosecutors would be to blame.After reading out the document, Santonastaso removed his robes. It was a symbolic gesture to say from that moment on, the game would be played outside the walls of the court. The proclamation had served a specific purpose: to silence me and other journalists, and inform people outside the court that those responsible for Bidognetti’s conviction had names.At the time, a murderous Camorra hit squad operated a reign of terror in Campania. It reported directly to Bidognetti. This armed gang,led by Giuseppe Setola, committed a vast number of heinous crimes intended to demonstrate that the power of the clan persisted, despite trials and convictions. In September 2008, for example, Setola spearheaded the Castel Volturno killing, in which six African migrants, who had no involvement in criminal activity, lost their lives.To understand the scope of the proclamationagainst me it is important to also understand the history and savagery of its author. Bidognetti, nicknamedCicciotto di Mezzanotte– because anyone who stood between him and his business would seemezzanotte(midnight) descend on them – heads an organisation that built its power on blood, fear and the devastation of its territory through theillegal dumping of toxic wastefrom all over Italy.In 1993 he ordered the murder of Gennaro Falco, an innocent doctor who had been treating Bidognetti’s first wife, Teresa Tamburrino. Falco was accused by the Bidognetti family of failing to diagnose a tumour in timeto save her life. The doctor was murdered by Bidognetti’s son, Raffaele.But the violence did not start there. In December 1980, during a shootout, Bidognetti used Filomena Morlando, 25, as a human shield. She was killed in the crossfire. In another incident, Antonio Petito, a young man who had no involvement with the Camorra, had an altercation with another of Bidognetti’s sons, Gianluca. Petito was killed for “lack of respect for the boss’s son”.After the proclamation in court, my protection was immediately strengthened, from level three (an armoured car and two agents) to level two (two armoured cars and five agents). Life under protection means existing in an eternal armoured present, in a home that is both a refuge and a prison. It means losing not only your freedom of movement, but also your interpersonal and emotional freedom. Every encounter is behind closed doors. There is no privacy. Intimacy evaporates. Spontaneity is erased.The consequences are not only practical, but profound. My romantic relationships have been compromised. Friendships have dwindled under the weight of my situation. Anyone who interacts with me feels the need to protect me, to absorb some of my tension. That is unbearable for anyone.For 17 years I have faced trials, hearings and efforts to smear my name. Not only by the clans, but also elements of the state that were meant to protect me but instead made my isolation worse.Anti-mafia reporting has been isolated, criminalised, dragged through tribunals. In this silence, the mafia has won. It has disappeared from public discourse, but not from reality. It has morphed into an economic power, a form of criminal capitalism – invisible but pervasive.The 14 July verdict goes beyond symbolism: it was an act of judicial recognition that Bidognetti’s 2008 proclamation was athreat, and directly related to his mafia enterprise. We can further deduce that it wasa “fatwa”, a signal to anyone in the clan who might want to climb the ranks by eliminating a named target.For the first time in a trial involving a crime organisation, we can see that the mafia considers investigative journalists to be the main cause of its defeats. According to this criminal logic, to write, report or investigate means to interfere with justice. And so those who write about the mafia have to be punished. It is an acknowledgment that anything that might happen to me from now on will bear its signature.I emerge from this ordeal in pieces. I have sacrificed my life to an all-consuming battle. My existence is a form of life sentence, suspended between fear, isolation and surveillance. Solitude is the added punishment for courage.It is likely that nothing inItalywill change, but I can at least say I helped expose the ways in which the mafia operates. And believe me, it is not limited to Italy – it is a network that targets global financial centres, including London.I will remain under police protection indefinitely, because the judges confirmed that the mafia bosses fear what I write. But I don’t want to go on living like this. Little by little, I will take responsibility for reclaiming my freedom – for taking my life back, even at my own risk. Enough of this half existence: neither fully alive, nor dead.Roberto Saviano is an investigative journalist and the author of GomorrahDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Resident doctors in England (formerly known as junior doctors) are on the picket line from 7am today until 7am on 30 July, a fullfive-day walkout.And I’ll be joining them, in solidarity. Though I’m a resident doctor by grade, I currently work forNHSEngland on a freelance (locum) basis, so I’ll be supporting my colleagues by electing not to work on the aforementioned days, despite the sauteed carrot of “enhanced strike rates”.Whenever doctors are engaged in a public pay dispute, our status as “heroes” is lost to accusations of shirking and self-interest. These attitudes even play out within different generations of doctors.Discussing money in the sector has historically been taboo. When I was in medical school between 2011 and 2016, I can remember students being reprimanded by established doctors for any suggestion that they were pursuing medicine “to make money”. Those with “pound signs in their eyes” were advised to seek a career in the City instead. There was no need to discuss finances, as the understanding was that being a doctor was a challenging and noble vocation that, while it may never make you rich, would leave you more than financially secure.You could look to consultants as examples of such financial security. After years of arduous training, they’ve arguably reached the top of their profession, the pinnacle. Many of them are covering for resident doctor colleagues over the weekend so residents can strike safely, reportedly advised to demand up to £6,000 a shift. Some may balk at such fees, but how much would a top lawyer charge to work out of hours?With becoming a consultant no means a guarantee, debts of more than £100,000 and a rota that can be unforgiving, conditions for resident doctorsare challenging. Then you throw in pay –20% less in real termscompared with a doctor in 2008. Then, potentially, you can understand why morale is low among resident doctors.Last year, a study found that at leasthalf of the British publicthought new junior doctors, as they were still known then, were paid too little. Yet public support is now slumping, with49% opposingthe walkout, and a slew of tabloid headlines since the strikes were announced have painted us aswilfully hamperingthe NHS just to addmore moneyto our bank accounts.Such concerns wouldn’t be high on the British Medical Association’s agenda, as it is its job to deliver the best deal for its members, and90% of the resident doctorswho cast their ballot voted in favour of industrial action. Not even the current government received such support at the last general election.A friend of mine coined the term “gen Z BMA”. While I have no data on the generational makeup of BMA resident members, I would argue they’re gen Z in their approach – they’re fearless and resolute in their aims, and taboos around discussing money are a thing of the past. This current iteration of the BMA will probably shout: “We are paid X and we definitely aren’t worth less than colleagues of yesteryear who were paid Y.”This attitude is at odds with some older members’. We have had retired doctors publicly relinquish their BMA memberships, as they disagree with the approach of resident doctors. Of course, there are consultant and senior colleagues who do support their resident colleagues, but I do feel these generational disagreements are in line with wider societal disputes.The doctors’ strike threatens to scupper the NHS’s big turnaround – this time, the BMA has overreached | Polly ToynbeeRead moreGen Zs and, to an extent, millennials, are often called workshy, and accused of not being willing to sacrifice or put in the graft their colleagues of yesteryear put in. But it could be argued that these younger generations know their worth and aren’t willing to merely “get on with it”. They are prepared to take a stand for what they believe in. Shouldn’t that be commended?Some members of the public certainly don’t think so. A cursory look online reveals a lot of criticism: what about other public servants? What about nurses, teachers or firefighters? Do they not deserve a pay rise?That, I would say respectfully, is a concern for those professions and their respective unions. Unions exist to represent their members and act in their best interests. Why would the BMA consider the interests of nurses, teachers or firefighters?That said, there should be solidarity among public servants – not a race to the bottom.Strike action is meant to be disruptive. However, studies have foundno evidencethat strike action has any significant impact on in-hospital patient mortality. Patients are no more at harm than on non-strike days.Some argue that doctors shouldn’t be allowed to strike due to our vital role. So we are too valuable to strike, but not valuable enough to be paid appropriately? How does that make sense?Michael Akadiri is an award-winning standup comedian and resident doctorExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionIndustrial actionNHSHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

This year, more than ever, I have started to question what the purpose of it really is. Though I’ve been celebrating companies that took a stand against Donald Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders, under the radar I have noticed an insidious censorship rearing its head.Since 2023 we have been witness to one of the worst atrocities of our lifetimes. Livestreamed to our phones, we have seen the slaughter ofat least 58,000 Palestinians, more than17,000 of them children, and many of them in hospitals, schools, refugee camps and food queues. We have seen the denial of water, electricity and medical supplies, the obliteration of communities,mass manmade starvation, and continued calls by Israeli ministers for the permanent expulsion or eradication of Palestinians in Gaza. Israel’s plans for a so-calledhumanitarian cityto be built on the ruins of Rafah has been described by the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert as a “concentration camp”.Yet, althoughmore than 200 companiesreleased statements after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 – wholeheartedly condemning it and donating money to relief funds – since then, there has been a relative silence in the face of the ongoing destruction in Gaza.One senior manager I spoke to said he had received an email telling him to remind staff they weren’t allowed to wear “political” badges during the Gaza conflict. Another company leader firmly stated, “We’re an apolitical company. Our staff need to remember that.” Last year, 50 employees werefired by Googleafter protesting against its and Amazon’s $1.2bn (£900m) Project Nimbus cloud infrastructure contract with the Israeli government. And just last weekend we saw an official at the Royal Opera Houseattempt to snatch the Palestinian flagfrom a cast member who unfurled it on stage after a performance.All these organisations have DEI agendas. They say they are committed to inclusion and equal opportunity, and to enhancing business growth through diversity. Yet it seems this commitment is conditional on people’s silence. You can belong, as long as you don’t make us uncomfortable. We value your identity, as long as it’s not political.Yet the companies themselves are not devoid of politics. Arecent reportby the UN special rapporteur for Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, backed by a number of high-profile economists, exposes the vast number of businesses who have been enabling or profiting from the Israeli military operation in Gaza. “The report shows why the genocide carried out by Israel continues … because it is lucrative for many,”it says, highlighting not just arms manufacturers but also the complicity of big tech, household brands and even educational institutions.Booking.com and Airbnb have beenlisting propertiesin illegal Israeli settlements, enabling profit from stolen land. And, in the most stark cases of corporate hypocrisy, companies such as BAE Systems, which is directly tied to theIsraeli military machineand dehumanisation of Palestinians, proudly brand themselves as champions ofdignity and respect.For the first time, I have found myself questioning not just how we do DEI work, but whether it means anything at all. If DEI is about rewiring unjust systems, how can companies silence staff who speak out or, worse, actively profit from a brutal war machine, and still claim to be inclusive? What is the role of DEI, if not to embed values and basic humanity within the company?British ministers are betting they won’t face justice for complicity over Gaza. It’s a big risk to take | Owen JonesRead moreWhat is even more frustrating is that we have a direct blueprint of how business leaders can approach this. Since the invasion of Ukraine, more than1,000 companieshave voluntarily curtailed operations in Russia as a recognition that they don’t stand for war crimes, the murder of civilians or the ensuing humanitarian crisis. They hung Ukrainian flags on their buildings, donated tens of millions to humanitarian organisations, offered housing and created fast-track hiring schemes for Ukrainian refugees. The Royal Opera House itself published a statement insupport of Ukraine, lit up its building in the Ukrainian flag colours, and for a period of time played the Ukrainian national anthem before every performance.For many staff, this contrast makes the corporate silence onGazafeel even more pointed. It’s not “apolitical”, it’s a choice. And it is a failure of DEI, which at its core is about challenging systems that breed inequality. It is rooted in values of fairness, dignity and respect for all. This isn’t simply about respecting racial or religious difference on an interpersonal level, it’s about who you invest in (or divest from), what you choose to speak out on, how you balance profit with purpose. To stay silent in the face of mass violence sends a clear message: some lives don’t matter.What gives me hope is the people-powered movements within companies. Staff are holding their leaders to account. Be that employees at the Boston Consulting Group who shared a letter to the company’s top managementdemanding an endto its involvement in the development of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, staff at the Berlin-based retail company Zalando protesting against the dismissal of an Arab employee who criticised its support of Israel, or the more than 100 BBC staff who spoke out against censorship in its reporting of Israel/Palestine. These ordinary workers are taking up the mantle where DEI is failing.We need to move away from this current sanitised, apolitical version of DEI towards one with meaning. Core values of dignity, humanity and fairness need to be integral to business decisions, not just corporate buzzwords. If you stand for nothing, you will fall for anything. And that’s not a DEI I want to be part of.Jinan Younis is the founder of diversity, equity and inclusion agency WeCalibrate and former assistant politics editor at gal-dem magazineExplore more on these topicsDEI policiesOpinionGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

The Swisstrack recordin women’s football was nothing to write home about. The stadiums would be of a modest size, unable to offer the grandeur and sense of occasion that accompanied games at Wembley or Old Trafford in Euro 2022. Would it all be a bit of a comedown after that heady summer’s day three years ago, when EnglandbeatGermany to end 56 years of hurt in front of almost 90,000 people?As the Lionesses prepare to defend their title this weekend against the competition favourites, Spain, such fears have long been put to bed. Sunday’sfinalin Basel, pitting English athleticism against subtle Spanish passing rhythms, promises a worthy denouement to a tournament that has delivered further progress for the women’s game.From the group stages onwards,recordnumbers of fans have packed out grounds from Lucerne to Zurich, while in Britain ITV’s coverage has attracted itshighestviewing figures of the year. The Swiss fell in love with their underdog team, which battled courageously through to the quarter-finals. (“This is just the beginning,” read one supporter’sbanner.) Sweden sparkled and then self-combusted in an unbearably tensepenalty shootoutagainst England. Four thousand fans dressed in red and green accompanied Wales’s women to their first ever major tournament. Only four years ago, Wales played a World Cup qualifier in Slovenia in front of a handful of spectators.As for England, where to start? Online racist abuse directed at the defenderJess Cartercast a long, unhappy shadow off the field. As the women’s game continues to grow, the Football Association must be proactive in seeking to protect players suddenly exposed to some of society’s darkest undercurrents.On the pitch, it was thrilling stuff. The Lionesses’ madcap progress to the final has been arguably the most gripping spectacle of the sporting year. Dead andburiedagainst the Swedes, down and out against Italy in thesemi-final, veterans such as Lucy Bronze and Chloe Kelly somehow found a way to win. The joy of those comebacks will for ever be savoured by girls who have grown up with these players as idols and role models.Michelle Agyemang, the 19-year-old former Wembley ballgirl whose remarkable last-gasp goals twice saved England, announced herself as a star for the next generation.Such stories – and such drama – will become part of the sport’s folklore, as women’s football writes its own vivid 21st-century history. The game has its challenges to address, particularly at club level, where a gulf in resources has emerged between elite clubs and the rest. But successful international tournaments are crucial to sustaining momentum, or as Bronzeput itbefore England’s match against Sweden, “exploding” the game in Europe and beyond. In that respect, Euro 2025 has more than done its job.Sunday’s final is a repeat of the 2023 World Cupfinalin Australia, which Spain deservedly won. The form book, and the quality of players such as two-time Ballon d’Or winnerAitana Bonmatí, points to another Spanish victory. On the other hand, there is an old football saying often applied to teams that ride their luck and reach a cup final without truly playing well. Could it be that England’s “name is on the trophy”?

These new bodies should have been launched long agoFri 25 Jul 2025 13.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 13.29 EDTShareAyear ago, following Labour’s election win and the Conservative rout, the new government’s standing could hardly have been higher or its opportunities greater. The political field lay open, in ways that it only does after an election, for serious political reform. One of the most trenchant sections of Sir Keir Starmer’selection manifestohad pinpointed “a crisis of confidence in our political system”. Labour had accordingly promised “a reset in our public life”.Twelve months ago, the voters gave permission to Sir Keir to do just that. Fatally, he failed to seize the opportunity. Instead, the chance to make radical change to Britain’s government and politics has largely been squandered. As a result, the work of rebuilding confidence has become harder than ever, as the continuing rise of Reform UK makes clear.The government’s new ethics and integrity commission, a manifesto promise, should have been launched decisively last year on a tide of post-election reforming commitment and goodwill. Instead, momentum was lost by the freebie furore and wider policy failures. Long overdue, the commission was quietly announced on Monday in awritten parliamentary statementto MPs, which few of them are likely to have read, on the eve of the summer recess.It is false to claim, as theConservativesdid this week, that this was a Labour attempt to bury bad news. The Tories are in no position to talk, having so often trashed the existing standards regimes in recent years. But Labour should be ashamed. It should not have left things unaddressed for so long, so that the impetus for post-Tory reform and for rebuilt trust were wasted.The statement, published by the Cabinet Office ministerPat McFadden, is fine as far as it goes. Uncertainty over whether the commission would be an oversight body for standards regulation, or would bundle up the work of established committees and regulators, has been resolved. It will mainly be the former, beefing up and replacing the committee on standards in public life (as advocated by Sir John Major) while leaving individual cases to a reduced number of regulatory bodies. The current advisory committee on business appointments will also be scrapped, with its ministerial and civil service arms enforced by separate bodies. As a tidying-up exercise, this all makes sense.The real problem is that a golden chance to reform the system in a watertight way has been passed up. The McFadden statement implies ministers want to avoid legislation to set up the commission. The result is thatenforcementis not properly addressed or strengthened. The role of independent scrutiny, essential for public confidence, is left hanging.The statement leaves enforcement sanctions too vague. It is good that ex-ministers should “be expected” to lose their severance pay if they take post-ministerial jobs that raise conflicts of interest. But what if that expectation is not fulfilled? Or if the rewards of such jobs are so high that the loss of severance pay is treated as a price worth paying? The system risks lookingtoothless.Cleaning up politics is not an optional priority. It is a compulsory one. These steps don’t go far enough. Nor do they suggest a ruthless culture of ethical behaviour, led from the top, of the kind required. Mr McFadden’s statementacceptsthat the changes will depend on the public’s wider view of the work of politicians and government. That is indeed the problem. But there is not enough here to shift that dial.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This raises important issues. We are unaware of evidence that this would be effective.As measles is spread by coughing, sneezing, singing etc, should masks be worn?Two-thirdsof cases of measles this year have been in children aged 10 years or younger. Should we be asking the children in the nursery to wear PPE as well? What will be the effect on young children of being cared for by people in aprons and gloves, and possibly masks – surely not good for their emotional development?More importantly, as Frances describes, we refer to the “personal choice” of parents not to have their child vaccinated with the safe and effective MMR vaccine. This “personal choice” should not extend to putting other children at risk. In a nursery there will be unimmunised children – not through a parent’s decision, but because the child is not eligible. Some of the children will be too young to be vaccinated with MMR and occasionally there will be a child whose immune system does not work properly.If either of these groups of children develops measles, they are more likely to have serious complications, including brain damage and death. As they cannot be vaccinated, the only way to protect them is to ensure that their contacts are immunised.With freedom comes responsibilities. Perhaps when measles is around, children who are not immunised should be excluded from nursery. What all too often happens is that the child who cannot be immunised is excluded.

His considerations begin with Channel 4’s Devil’s Advocate, in which Darcus Howe challenged Bernie Grant MP on his call for a “voluntary repatriation” scheme for Black people in Britain.I was Channel 4’s commissioning editor, co-conceiving the format and mission of Devil’s Advocate. It set out to challenge Black nationalism, which Darcus spent his life opposing, in his dedication to the postcolonial development of multi-ethnic Britain.As Jason contends, Diane simply pointed to the fact that the racism the Black population of Britain faces through skin colour is different from the undoubted discrimination experienced by other communities. Her suspension is a mystery. Diane has in fact pointed to something thatLabourneeds to address urgently. What precisely is the distinction between anti-Netanyahu-Zionism and antisemitism? What precisely do Black youths on the streets being challenged by the police face that white youths don’t?The work of theDarcus Howe Legacy Collectivecontinues Darcus’s championing of social justice, equality and representation to provide a framework for debate and understanding of current racial and social issues. Is the Labour government unable to recognise the distinctions, formulations and policies that should follow what Diane has so modestly pointed out?If Devil’s Advocate were still broadcast today, we’d invite Diane and Keir Starmer to examine why pointing out an obvious truth entails suspension from the very party that keeps us from the disaster of the Tories and the death wish of Reform.Farrukh DhondyTheDarcus HoweLegacy CollectiveHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Chemical signatures in the ancient bones point to a nutritious and somewhat inevitable side dish: handfuls of fresh maggots.The theory from US researchers undermines previous thinking that Neanderthals were “hypercarnivores” who stood at the top of the food chain with cave lions, sabre-toothed tigers and other beasts that consumed impressive quantities of meat.Rather than feasting on endless mammoth steaks, they stored their kills for months, the scientists believe, favouring the fatty parts over lean meat, and the maggots that riddled the putrefying carcasses.“Neanderthals were not hypercarnivores, their diet was different,” said John Speth, professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Michigan. “It’s likely maggots were a major food.”Neanderthals were thought to be top of the food chain because of the high levels of heavy nitrogen in their bones. Nitrogen builds up in living organisms when they metabolise protein in their food. A lighter form of the element, nitrogen-14, is excreted more readily than the heavier form, nitrogen-15. As a result, heavy nitrogen builds up in organisms with each step up the food chain, from plants to herbivores to carnivores.The curse of Toumaï: an ancient skull, a disputed femur and a bitter feud over humanity’s origins – podcastRead moreWhile the levels of heavy nitrogen in Neanderthal bones place them at the top of the food chain, they would not have been able to handle the amount of meat needed to reach those levels, the researchers say.“Humans can only tolerate up to about 4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, whereas animals like lions can tolerate anywhere from two to four times that much protein safely,” said Speth.Since many Indigenous groups around the world routinely consume maggots in putrefied meat, the researchers decided to explore their potential role. The experiments were not for the squeamish.Dr Melanie Beasley, a member of the team at Purdue University in Indiana, was formerly at the ForensicAnthropologyCenter, or Body Farm, at the University of Tennessee. There, researchers study donated human corpses that are left to decompose. The work helps forensic scientists hone their techniques, for example, to ascertain for how long people have been dead.Beasley measured heavy nitrogen in putrefying muscle and the maggots that infested the corpses. Heavy nitrogen rose slightly as muscle putrefied, but was far higher in the maggots. The same process would have occurred in carcasses the Neanderthals stored, Beasley said.Even Neanderthals had distinct preferences when it came to making dinner, study suggestsRead moreThe finding,reported in Science Advances, suggests that rather than consuming meat as ravenously as lions and other hypercarnivores, Neanderthals acquired high levels of heavy nitrogen by eating maggots, which themselves were enriched with heavy nitrogen.“The only reason this is surprising is that it contradicts what we westerners think of as food,” said Karen Hardy, professor of prehistoric archaeology at the University of Glasgow. “Elsewhere in the world, a very wide range of things are eaten, and maggots are a great source of protein, fat and essential amino acids.”“It is a no brainer for Neanderthals,” she added. “Put out a bit of meat, leave it for a few days then go back and harvest your maggots, its a very easy way to get good nutritious food.”“How does it shift our thinking? The Neanderthals as top carnivores was nonsense, it was physiologically impossible. So this makes sense, but also explains these high nitrogen signals in a way that nothing else has done so clearly,” Hardy said.Explore more on these topicsScienceNeanderthalsAnthropologyEvolutionBiologyArchaeologynewsShareReuse this content"

It also found that 75% of Reform voters wanted more action to help with the cost of living.With Nigel Farage’s party leading in the polls, No 10 has been tackling the threat of Reform by attacking its record on the NHS, highlighting previous statements about it being open to an insurance-based model.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, also criticised Reform on Thursday for “continually attacking” police officers trying to tackle unrest and, more widely, the government has been trying to cast doubt on Reform’s economic competence.Press shift: how the rightwing media are pivoting to ReformRead moreFarage’s party has remained top of the polls for some months – at about28-29%– on public unhappiness about the cost of living, economy and immigration, with its lead appearing to widen afterJeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana launched a new leftwing party.The research on Reform voters, commissioned by Arden Strategies with JL Partners, looked in particular at former Labour voters who had opted for Farage’s party in 2024. It found that 58% said they could be tempted back to Labour with more NHS investment and 52% cited a reduction in hospital waiting lists would be key. More than half of those who had switched to Reform from Labour were concerned that Reform could merge or strike a deal with the Conservative party.Four out of 10 of all the Reform voters questioned said they would be less likely to support Nigel Farage’s party if it proposed to change the NHS to an insurance-based model.The research found that more than half of those who backed Reform at the last election thought there was a chance they would not vote for the party next time, with 46% saying they were “absolutely certain” to vote for Reform again.Across other policy areas, about four in 10 Reform voters said they would be less likely to vote for the party if it was seen to be too friendly to Vladimir Putin and Russia, while almost eight in 10 said it was important to “stand up” to Putin.Six in 10 of the Reform voters polled felt it was important for the party to support Ukraine and four in 10 said it was important for the party to support Israel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than half were keen on the idea of a tax on wealth, with 56% backing the idea of an annual 2% levy on those owning assets worth more than £2m.Murphy, the founder and executive chair of Arden Strategies, said the comprehensive poll of Reform voters suggested that “many are far from certain about how to vote at the next UK general election and are watching what progress the government makes on the key issues that matter to them, like the NHS and the cost of living”.Tom Lubbock, the founding partner at JL Partners, said: “The good news for Labour is that Reform voters and those defectors from Labour have the same concerns as most of the country. They are ‘bills and blue lights’ voters; they want to see much more attention on their cost of living and are reserving judgment on the progress that Labour has so far made on the NHS. It’s a tough audience, as this research shows, but one that can be won back by campaigning on those issues to show that Labour shares the same interests.”Lubbock said the challenge the Reform party faced was convincing the voters who had joined them since the election that they had the experience to govern.Explore more on these topicsReform UKLabourNHSUK cost of living crisisImmigration and asylumHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

When he joined he was given share options, which allowed him to buy shares in the company at a preferential rate if they became profitable.Revealed: how members of House of Lords benefit from commercial interestsRead moreThe Guardianrevealedthat, in 2023, Duncan forwarded a letter to Andrew Bowie, the nuclear minister at the time, from Simon Irish, the firm’s chief executive who wanted a meeting with the minister at short notice. The peer signed off his email “Lord D of S”.The chief executive of the company, which is developing a new type of nuclear reactor, secured the meeting with Bowie at whichhe lobbied for Terrestrial Energy to be given easier access to government funding.In his response to the watchdog, Duncan said Bowie was a “friend of long standing” who had helped him get elected as a member of the European parliament in 2014 and had then worked in his Brussels office.Duncan argued: “It was this personal relationship, and not my membership of the upper house, nor my government service, which led Mr Irish to ask whether there was a prospect (albeit limited) that a personal request might help land a meeting during his visit.”Margaret Obi, the Lords commissioner, decided that the rule prohibiting peers from providing “parliamentary services in return for payment or other incentive or reward” was absolute.She added: “It did not provide an exemption in cases where there was an existing personal relationship.”She ruled: “Although Lord Duncan stated he was not paid specifically for facilitating this introduction, he received an allocation of share options as consideration for his work for Terrestrial Energy.“I consider that this can reasonably be understood to have been an incentive or reward for the various tasks he undertook for the company.”Do you have information about this story?

Outdoor workers – gardeners, builders, farmers, and delivery workers – along with unhoused people and those with substance use issues are particularly vulnerable.Aheat domeis a particular weather phenomenon where hot air is trapped over a region by a stalled high-pressure system causing high temperatures on the ground. With little cloud cover due to the stuck high-pressure system, the sun’s rays directly hit the ground, further increasing the heat.While heat domescause heatwaves– which are becoming more frequent thanks to the climate crisis – there can be heatwaves without heat domes. Climate scientists have found that heat domes are getting hotter due to global heating caused by humans burning fossil fuels.And while the latest dome in the US is moving slowly, it continues to cause dangerous conditions in parts of the mid-south to mid-Mississippi Valley, with heat alerts still in place from Oklahoma to West Virginia.In the so-called corn belt, the midwestern and some southern states where most corn is farmed, a phenomenon known as corn sweat exacerbates the humidity, and can increase the heat index by as much as 10F. This is due to the pores on the underside of maize leaves, where oxygen – and water vapor – are released, Justin Glisan , state climatologist of Iowa, said in an interviewwith CBS News.Meteorologists have also forecast flash flooding from north-east Kansas to much of Indiana, as well as possible scattered thunderstorms across parts of New England, the northern mid-Atlantic, and North Dakota. Meanwhile dry, windy conditionshave triggered a red flagwildfire warning for parts of Utah and Oregon.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherClimate crisisExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

But over time, this developed into a completely different book: a clarion call to embrace neurodiversity in the fight against the extinction crisis.Across Britain, 15% of people are thought to be neurodivergent. In the process of writingNeurodivergent, By Nature, Harkness discovered that an estimated 30% of conservation employees were neurodivergent. Why?“People like myself, especially those who are undiagnosed, probably found nature was their balm from a mental health perspective,” says Harkness when we meet beneath an awesomely peaceful ancient oak close to his home in ruralNorfolk. “The other thing is, we’re different from what we’d define as neurotypical people. Therefore we like more odd things. Special interests. Nature lends itself to people who are different.”He interrupts his own answers by repeatedly spotting micro-moths – his latest special interest – zipping across our path. “Did you see that? Is it a yellow shell? No, it’s another one of thosemother of pearl moths. Sorry. They’re everywhere.”View image in fullscreenDara McAnulty has flown the flag for neurodiversity in environmental work.Photograph: Four Communications/PA MediaHarkness’s full-time job is teaching autistic and other neurodiverse children, but he did not suspect he had ADHD until a fellow teacher said she thought he had. It took a further six years to obtain a formal diagnosis and access to medication that he has found extremely helpful.Naturalists such as the broadcasterChris Packhamand the writerDara McAnultyhave flown the flag for neurodiversity in the environmental sector but Harkness interviews dozens of less celebrated conservationists who have undertaken pioneering work on everything from UN climate talks to saving the Seychelles black parrot and restoring pine marten populations.Harkness, whose debut book,Bird Therapy, was a surprise self-published hit, explains well why neurodivergent people can prosper in ecological jobs.But he also makes a strong case for the natural world needing a neurodiverse cohort of people to save it. Beside the ancient oak where we talk is a small, scruffy meadow, filled with a jumble of wild grasses, insects and the flit of birds. “There is biodiversity right in front of you,” says Harkness, pointing at the meadow. “You look at it one way, I look at it another way. Therefore, if we are trying to help it, we can bring different things to it. If you’re looking at it from a completely different angle because of how your brain is wired, you bring a different approach again.“You cannot be creative and make change and do good things unless you utilise all the different skills of the people you work with. If you don’t have diversity of people, you don’t have biodiversity. You can’t have one without the other. They are intrinsically connected.”More specifically, Harkness reveals how neurodiverse conservationists find their “superpowers” can make them uniquely effective at their job, with skills including lateral thinking, hyperfocus, memory skills and empathy, as well as having an aptitude for fieldwork.The autistic ecologistNaomi Davistold Harkness their favourite aspect of the job was finding and categorising species. Both Davis and the consultant ornithologist Colin Everett speak of sensory superpowers helping their surveying work: detecting fragments of birdsong that everyone else misses; even hearing bats echolocating – calls that are usually far too high-pitched for adults to hear them.Clearly, neurodiverse people can be vital champions for biodiversity, although Harkness is bluntly honest about his own ADHD. “I don’t feel like the symptoms I experience are helpful or conducive to wellbeing and peak performance at work,” he writes.And some people are still wary of disclosing neurodiversity. He interviews Emma Marsh, an executive director at the RSPB, who did not reveal her later-in-life autism diagnosis to work colleagues for a while, although when she finally did, she was heartened by receiving such a positive response.As Harkness explains, harnessing the skills of neurodiverse employees often requires changes in work practices. Fieldwork – in peaceful, natural settings – is one attraction for many neurodiverse conservationists, but office-based workers may require adaptations. One senior conservationist was given permission to conduct her meetings outdoors.Is the conservation sector meeting the needs of its neurodiverse employees? “Approaches to neuro-inclusion across the conservation sector are fragmentary at best, with some areas of outstanding practice, and some terrible tales of discrimination and needs not being met,” says Harkness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

For meaningful change, he says, there must be more routes into conservation through apprenticeships and not just degrees.View image in fullscreenHarkness’s experience at school was bleak.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianWorking as a senior teacher at an “outstanding” complex needs school, Harkness is fiercely critical of mainstream British education, and the multi-chain academy system in particular, for failing to meet the needs of both neurodiversity and nature. Without more nature-literate schooling, he says, many neurodiverse young people won’t be able to discover the balm of the natural world – or the well-fitting jobs available within it.“If you need something different, you’re not going to get it,” he writes of the academy school system.His own personal schooling experience was bleak. Lacking an ADHD diagnosis as a young person, Harkness was simply written off as a naughty child of a single parent from social housing.When he got his belated diagnosis, did he grieve for how long it took? “What I really grieved for was my experience at secondary school,” he says. “Medication has completely changed my life for the better. It doesn’t for everyone but it’s worked for me. What if I’d had that in year 11? Would I have got my A-levels and gone to university? Would I be a completely different person? Do I want to be?

Last year Hurricane Beryldemolished more than 90% of buildings in parts of multi-island SVGand left thousands homeless and without running water, electricity and food.Gonsalves said the advisory opinion – which said a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a human right – connects climate action treaties such as theParis agreementto other international laws such as those governing human rights.Echoing Gonsalves’ sentiments, the Bahamas’ attorney general, Ryan Pinder, praised the ICJ for taking a “very strong position” that allowed countries to “speak and argue about the adverse effects of the climate crisis on its people” and potentially provided more legal options to small states.“It certainly opens up the positions of … states like the Bahamas to go into other areas of the United Nations and other multilateral institutions that are human rights-focused,” he told the Guardian.Referring to the catastrophic Hurricane Dorian in 2019, which killed more than 70 people andcaused an estimated US$3.4bnworth of damage, Pinder said: “[This] had a significant impact on the human rights of our people, whether that be displacement … the right to an adequate standard of living … [or] access to food, water and housing.“All of those are fundamental human rights that the ICJ has now recognised as a significant component of the adverse effects of climate change.”The advisory opinion’s focus on reparations, he said, was important for the Bahamas, because it was about the obligation of major polluters to restore a country and its assets if it suffered the effects of a climate change-related disaster.Human rights and climate justice lawyer Nikki Reisch said it was possible to connect devastating climatic events to climate change and to the states responsible and pursue justice.“The science on attribution and causation is strong and only getting stronger. The court made clear that there is no technical barrier to connecting climate destruction to its causes, to the continued pollution from fossil fuels and destruction of carbon sinks,” she said.“The science is there, and this decision confirms that the law is too.”Reisch added that countries were responsible for past and present environmental breaches.“The court really rejected the attempts of the biggest cumulative emitters like the United States and others to sweep history under the rug and ignore the decades of climate destruction, of fossil fuel production and pollution, of colonialism that laid the foundations for the devastation that climate change is wreaking in so many parts of the world.”In the UK, some MPs criticised the ICJ opinion, with the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel,describing it on Xas a “mad” decision, adding that the ICJ had “lost its core purpose and is now joining political campaigns and bandwagons”.Dr Justin Sobion, who coordinated the Caribbean’s ICJ submissions, said the opinion was an interpretation of climate obligations under international law, including global agreements that countries such as the UK – which recognise there is a climate emergency – have ratified.Pinder said: “I’m not sure, given some of the commentary we’ve seen from larger developed countries and countries that were in the Industrial Revolution, that [the ICJ advisory] is really going to change their opinions.”He added that the “rather unfortunate” comments from some political leaders in the UK on the ICJ opinion indicated that “multilateralism is still going to be a significant challenge”.Pinder and Gonsalves said their countries were reviewing the ICJ opinion – which UN member statesinstructed the ICJto produce in 2023 after years of campaigningby Pacific island law studentsand diplomacy led by Vanuatu – and considering how to work with other countries in the region on next steps.“This has given us an excellent platform,” Gonsalves said. “We have … to follow through with some heavy lifting, to do negotiations. At the end of the day, this is about life, living and production for all of us on planet Earth.”Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanInternational court of justiceClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Hinchliffsubmitted amendmentsto the bill that would stop new developments from being able to further abuse these habitats. Fifteen of his colleagues voted for these amendments.A source on Keir Starmer’s team said the MPs had been suspended for “persistent knobheadery”. Hinchliff looks visibly hurt by the accusation, saying: “I’ll leave that for others to assess … I suppose ever so slightly more seriously about that, it doesn’t surprise me that people use that language. That is the sort of language we persistently see from a certain set of people involved in politics for whom it’s all a personality thing, it’s all a game.”He added: “The conversation itself was OK. I have no gripes with the whips. But yes, it was a surprise. They said I was having a pattern of behaviour investigated, and I am not sure I accept the characterisation of being a persistent rebel. I am persistent, but I am not a rebel. I have voted with the government, by my calculations, 97% of the time in the over 250 votes I have been present for.”The day after he was stripped of the whip, the government slipped outsome amendmentsto the planning and infrastructure bill that look very similar to Hinchliff’s own – including one that gives some protections to “irreplaceable habitats” such as chalk streams.Hinchliff said he was pleased with these and thought the whole situation did not have to happen, as ministers could have met him to discuss the issue and tweaked the bill to allay his concerns.“I asked time and again for meetings with ministers to discuss some tweaks to the bill. None met with me,” he said. “But these new amendments have significantly addressed the primary purpose of the amendments that I put forward. I think the bill is now in the position that it can go ahead, I want to support the government.”It has been a bruising experience for Hinchliff, who until he became an MP last July worked in the charity sector, which has HR departments and codes of conduct that preclude the kind of bullying he has faced in Westminster. He has been referred to as a nimby and “Hedgehog Hezbollah” by his colleagues, and accused of trying to thwart Labour’s growth plans with his call for chalk stream protections.“Look, I’m not trying to get the world’s tiniest violin out to say, ‘poor MPs’,” he said. “But I will say there seems to be a certain set of people who behave in here more like a private schoolboy drinking club than serious professional people thinking about how to improve the country.”He has had support, though. Many people were disappointed that he was punished for standing up for nature. “I have to say, it’s been really heartwarming, having absolute floods of handwritten notes, emails, Facebook messages of support from people I have met and people I haven’t, from my constituency and wider and in the labour movement and beyond, and that has meant a lot at what would have otherwise been quite a difficult time. It shows there are still some good people out there.”And it is not just wayward MPs who have faced strong language from some in the Labour party.Newts and batshave had a rough time, accused by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Keir Starmer of being the cause of Britain’s housing crisis. Now, snails have been added to the list. Reeves this week said: “I care more about a young family getting on the housing ladder than I care about some snails.”Hinchliff hopes this rhetoric towards nature stops: “In some of my rural villages where I’ve joined parish meetings, that has not gone down particularly well, so it’ll make my life a bit easier if we all just take a step back from that slightly more heated language.”On Monday, the government announced its plans toabolish the water regulator, Ofwat, and replace it with a stronger alternative to get a grip on the sewage crisis plaguing England’s waterways. Hinchliff thinks this will help his local chalk streams, too. “Fair play to the government. Over the year that I’ve been elected, I’ve had a lot of constituents contact me with pretty angry words to say about the water regulators. So I think looking at abolishing Ofwat in the way that they are is a very welcome move.”‘Broken’ water industry in England and Wales faces tighter controls under new watchdogRead moreSome of his colleagues have been critical of the government for not considering nationalising the water industry, but Hinchliff is sanguine about the prime minister’s plans: “We didn’t stand on a manifesto of nationalisation. If we find that we cannot resolve the problems in the water system over the duration of the parliament with a privatised system, then I would certainly be very open.”He thinks that the sector as it stands needs fast reform, which is what the government is trying to do: “For me, actually sort of more viscerally at the moment, is what can the government do to make these bastards pay, basically, and get some of the money back that has been stripped out of our countryside, sweated our assets, and now it’s left to people already struggling with the cost of living to bail them out and solve the problem.”Despite the treatment he has experienced, he hopes to have the whip restored and will keep campaigning for Labour: “I am Labour through and through. I am determined to be a representative for the Labour party.”There is no question of him joining the former Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn’s proposed new partyof leftwing MPs, or the Greens. “I almost swore when you asked me that!” he said. “Absolutely no way will I be joining them. I have been a Labour member all of my adult life.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

New primary legislation would give parliament the final word over the handling and disclosure of commission arrangements to borrowers.Crucially, the Treasury is understood to be weighing whether the new laws could be retrospective, meaning they would cover old cases and contracts and therefore slash a potential £44bn compensation bill for lenders such as Lloyds, Santander, Barclays and Close Brothers.Retrospective legislation would also ensure the scandal does not balloon beyond car loans, and potentially expose lenders to complaints over commission payments across other financial products, like appliances and furniture.Motor finance compensation ruling ‘goes too far’, says City regulatorRead moreThe government is considering the move after months of lobbying by the Financing & Leasing Association (FLA) – the industry body that represents car lenders – and Lloyds Banking Group, which is one of the most exposed to the scandal through its Black Horse division. Lloyds has alreadyput aside £1.2bnfor potential compensation.While rare and controversial, the UK parliament has passed retrospective legislation on payouts in the past.In 2013, the coalition governmentpushed through the Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act,in order to “protect the national economy” from a £130m payout to those whose benefits were stopped after they refused to take on unpaid work for private companies. However, in that case, the laws were pushed through to protect the public purse rather than the profits of private companies.Discussions around the potential intervention in the car finance scandal are considered sensitive, given the government does not want to be seen as disrespecting the court process.However, there are growing concerns that an adverse ruling that prompts a massive compensation bill could have devastating effects on the sector.The FLA has warned it could disrupt the car finance market, resulting in some providers offering fewer or more expensive loans, while others could go bust.The Treasury is concerned that the scandal is deterring investment, and dampening US appetite for UK company shares at a time when the City isdesperate to revive the London Stock Exchange.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Santander UK putaside £295m in November to cover potential payouts, prompting frustrations at the top of the Spanish-owned lender.A move to supersede the supreme court judgment would not be out of line with the Labour government’spush to change regulations to try to kickstart growth, which has already resulted ina raft of City changesand theforced resignationof the chair of the competition watchdog in January.That month Reeves also tried to intervene in the car finance supreme court case, warning the justices to “avoid conferring a windfall” to consumers.The Treasury argued that it should be able to provide submissions to the court given the outcome stood to cause “considerable economic harm”. Its intervention in the hearing was ultimately rejected.Lenders have argued that last October’s appeal court ruling set a much higher bar for disclosing commission arrangements and securing customers’ consent than they previously thought necessary under rules set by the City regulator, theFinancial Conduct Authority.Concerns have also been raised that the judgment could open the door to complaints across a much wider range of loans where brokers are paid on commission.The matter was later brought to the supreme court, leading to a three-day hearing at the start of April. The judges will release their ruling next Friday, 1 August.Commenting on the prospective contingency plans, a Treasury spokesperson said: “We don’t comment on speculation. We want to see a balanced judgment that delivers compensation proportionate to losses that consumers have suffered and allows the motor finance sector to continue supporting millions of motorists to own vehicles. It is now appropriate to let the appeals process run its course.”The FLA and Lloyds declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsMotor financeRachel ReevesUK supreme courtFinancial sectorBankingFinancial Conduct AuthorityMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

In a televised sentencing on Friday, Judge Lucraft KC told them they would be locked up for at least 15 years and 10 months before being eligible for parole.Lucraft said the schoolboy’s death was a “senseless loss” of another young life to the “horrors of knife crime”. In a victim impact statement, Kelyan’s mother, Marie Bokassa, said: “At least my son is at peace, and those two kids are going to have a really tough time.“I ask myself what has happened to those two boys that has resulted in that terrible act of violence, and I cannot imagine how can they be so angry. What they did was horrific and I do not know what has led them to do this, and maybe I will never.”Bokassa said she had spent her son’s 15th birthday at his graveside.Earlier, the prosecutor Deanna Heer KC said the victim had boarded the bus just after 2pm to attend an appointment at a youth justice centre in Woolwich. CCTV footage showed that Kelyan, an aspiring rapper, went to sit on the back seat of the top deck, with a knife in the waistband of his trousers.Heer said the teenager looked around and out of the windows before taking his seat “giving every impression that he was concerned for his safety”.The defendants boarded the bus 20 minutes later, each armed with a machete hidden in their clothes. They walked towards Kelyan “with purpose” and drew their blades before immediately stabbing him without uttering a word to their victim.Heer said: “Since Kelyan Bokassa was seated on the back seat, he was cornered, unable to escape as the defendants repeatedly thrust their knives towards him, smiling as they did so.”She added: “Kelyan Bokassa had no time to reach for his own knife, which remained in his trousers, and instead tried in vain to protect himself with his schoolbag. There were several other passengers on the top deck who fled in panic when they realised what was happening. They describe hearing intense screaming from the back of the bus and the victim shouting: ‘Help. Help. I’ve been stabbed.’”The bus driver activated his emergency alarm just before 2.27pm and the defendants fled when the vehicle stopped at Woolwich Ferry.Kelyan stumbled down the aisle to the stairs, where another passenger went to help him. He was heard to say: “Take me to my mum’s. I want my mum,” before he collapsed, bleeding heavily from a wound to the leg.Members of the public flagged down a passing police car, but Kelyan died at the scene at 3.23pm.One of the machetes was thrown into the River Thames, but was later recovered by police. Samantha Yelland, the senior crown prosecutor for CPS London North, said the teenagers’ “violent attack” on Kelyan had left him with “little chance of survival”.Explore more on these topicsLondonKnife crimenewsShareReuse this content"

That is what we need to pay them, for us to believe that we are paying them equally or fairly.”Standon acknowledged that Nationwide had done “lots of good things for members … and it’s commendable that you followed through on the principles behind mutuality by not prioritising profit”. But she said that while the building society claimed to value people over profits, its justification for the rise “suggests that unfortunately, your executive team are primarily motivated by money”.“If they do leave purely because of the money, then, is it not the case that they were not in line with Nationwide principles in the first place?” Standon asked.The Nationwide chair, Kevin Parry, defended the building society’s bosses, saying: “I don’t think that money is the primary motivation … I’m very confident in saying this is not about personal greed. This is about equity with people that do similar jobs elsewhere.”Members ultimately gave the green light to the pay policy: 627,982, or 94.8%, voted in favour. Nationwide said 34,492 members, accounting for 5.2% of voters, rejected the pay package.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Parry, confirmed that while votes to re-elect board members are binding – meaning members have a final say – Nationwide is not required to hold binding votes on pay under building society rules.The board was also forced to admit during the livestreamed AGM that a £316m accounting error was missed by the building society and its auditor EY, and only came to light as a result of one of its eagle-eyed members, Mr Dugan.Nationwide explained that while it did force the building society to correct its 2024 results, the mistake related to the way it had deducted expenses from its income, but did not affect profitability.Dugan pushed the matter, saying the error was six times larger than the £55m threshold at which errors are deemed material, meaning the point at which they could end up influencing business decisions. He asked why Nationwide was willing to reappoint EY on that basis.“We were very grateful last year when you identified the issue,” the chair of Nationwide’s audit committee, Phil Rivett, said during the AGM. However, he said the society was still “very satisfied with the quality of the work they [EY] do, and the challenge that they provide to management on accounting judgments and issues”.Explore more on these topicsNationwideBanks and building societiesExecutive pay and bonusesCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

We will all miss her terribly. The family wish to be given space to grieve and ask for privacy at this very difficult time.”She was well known for a longstanding collaboration with her late husband, the composer and reed player John Dankworth, singing with his jazz bands from the mid-1950s onwards. But she also had a stellar solo career, including in the US, where she became the only female artist to be nominated for Grammy awards in pop, jazz and classical categories; few singers have the versatility to deliver atonal Arnold Schoenberg pieces and to have duetted with Ray Charles.View image in fullscreenStarting at the top ... Cleo Laine and John Dankworth performing in 1963.Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsLaine was born in Uxbridge, west London, in 1927, the daughter of a Jamaican father and an English farmer’s daughter (her original name was Clementina Campbell, though she was registered at birth as Clementine Bullock, her mother’s surname). She was raised in nearby Southall and had an unassuming youth, working at various jobs after leaving school including as a hairdresser, librarian and pawnbroker. Still a teenager, she married George Langridge and had a son, Stuart.She sang in clubs after work, but became a professional singer in her mid-20s after successfully auditioning for Dankworth’s band the Dankworth Seven. “In a sense, with them, I started at the top,” she later said. She earned £7 a week, and changed her name to the snappier Cleo Laine. Her marriage faltered – Langridge “thought my career was a pipe-dream”, she said – and Laine left him for Dankworth, marrying him in 1958.She developed her voice, eventually reaching a four-octave range and becoming one of the most esteemed proponents of the scat singing style. She acted in plays and musical theatre in London, as well as performing with Dankworth and his band; in 1961, she crossed over into the British pop charts with You’ll Answer to Me reaching No 5.She and Dankworth achieved further recognition with their jazz arrangements of poetry by Shakespeare, ee cummings, WH Auden and TS Eliot. Emboldened by a successful Australian tour, they began live performances in New York. US reviewers received her rapturously, and Laine cemented her American career with concerts backed by her husband at prestigious venues such as Carnegie Hall, alongside musical theatre on Broadway. She recorded anacclaimed album of Stephen Sondheim numbers, duetted with Ray Charles for a recording of Gershwin’s opera Porgy and Bess, and made collaborative albums with the guitarist John Williams and the flautist James Galway. In 1992, she supported Frank Sinatra for a five-night residency at London’s Royal Albert Hall.In 1970, she and Dankworth founded the Stables venue in the grounds of their home in Wavendon, Buckinghamshire, which has gone on to present concerts by Dave Brubeck, Amy Winehouse and many others, and hosts music education projects.In 1979 she was awarded an OBE and in 1997 she was made a dame. Dankworth was knighted in 2006.View image in fullscreenJoined at the hip ...

Laine performed later that night, alongside their musician children Jacqui and Alec, for a scheduled concert celebrating 40 years of the Stables;she only announced her husband’s death at the end of the concert. “It wasn’t so much ‘the show must go on’ – I’m not that committed to the stage,”she saidin 2010. “I instinctively knew Johnny would want it to. That if I had died he would have gone on. Johnny and me – we were joined at the hip.”She is survived by Jacqui and Alec.

Since December 2024, Assad has been living in exile in Russia after rebels led by Turkish-backed forces took control ofSyria.Mariana Pena, a senior legal counsel with the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI), said the ruling was a “missed opportunity” for the court to make an exception on the waiving of immunity for heads of state accused of the most serious crimes, but added the campaign to bring Assad to justice would continue.A French court issued the international arrest warrantin November 2023 in response to two chemical weapons attacks in Syria. In the first, in August 2013, the banned gas sarin is believed to have killed more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children, in the district of Ghouta, in eastern Damascus. In the second, in April 2018, 450 people were injured in the towns of Adra and Douma.The case that led to the arrest warrant was brought by civil parties including survivors of the attacks, the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression and the OSJI.Its cancellation was initially sought by France’s anti-terrorism office on the grounds of head of state immunity. Last year, the Paris court of appeal upheld the warrant following a request for annulment, only for the anti-terrorism office and the public prosecutors’ office to lodge a fresh appeal.At the appeal hearing, the OSJI argued that immunity should not apply when leaders perpetrated grave crimes against their own population.France has previously issued international arrest warrants for three other senior Syrian officials, including the former leader’s brother Maher al-Assad for complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Cour de Cassation did not rule on these warrants, which are still in effect.The sarin attack in 2013 almost led to US intervention in Syria’s civil war. Barack Obama, then US president, had warned Assad that the use of chemical weapons would be a “red line”, but backed down from military action after Syria agreed to dismantle its chemical weapons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But was the process transparent?Read moreSenior author, Prof Susan Davis, said while vasomotor symptoms (VMS) – such as hot flushes and night sweats – were already known to be typical of menopause, the study found moderate to severe VMS symptoms to be the most defining symptom of perimenopause, the time period leading up to the final menstrual period.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAlthough other symptoms were commonly reported by perimenopausal women, including poor memory and low mood, analysis showed none differed in prevalence enough from pre-menopause to differentiate between menopausal stages.The study found 37.3% of women in late perimenopause had moderately-to-severely bothersome hot flushes: meaning they were five times more prevalent among perimenopausal women compared with pre-menopause.Severe vaginal dryness was 2.5 times more prevalent among perimenopausal women compared with pre-menopause.Menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT, also known as HRT) is effective for treating VMS due to menopause, but there are no specifically designed or approved interventions for these symptoms for perimenopausal women, the researchers noted.Treating perimenopause is not the same as treating post-menopause because women are still randomly ovulating, contraception needs to be considered, MHT can make bleeding heavier and progesterone worsens PMS, Davis said.The study also challenged the assumption that menstrual irregularity is the earliest sign of perimenopause.Our findings support a more symptom-based approachDr Rakib IslamDavis said it is common for women to ask their GPs if their heavier periods and hot flushes are a sign of perimenopause, only for the doctor to respond: “If you’re still getting regular cycles, you can’t possibly be perimenopausal.”But when the study compared pre-menopausal women with VMS whose periods were still regular but had changes – becoming lighter or heavier – they were the same as women who had VMS but who’d started experiencing changes in period cycle frequency.“So we’re really saying ignoring hot flushes and night sweats is wrong,” she said.Dr Rakib Islam, also a study author, said defining perimenopause and menopause by menstrual cycle overlooks women with regular cycles and those who no longer menstruate, such as those who have had an endometrial ablation or hysterectomy, and users of hormonal contraception.“Our findings support a more symptom-based approach, enabling earlier recognition of perimenopause and more timely care,” Islam said.Davis said it was “critical” that women were recruited to the study with no mention made of menopause, so the sample was not biased.The unspoken agony of vaginal dryness: ‘I had to give up four jobs in four years’Read moreProf Martha Hickey, the chair of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Melbourne and lead author of last year’sLancet series on menopausecalled it an important study.The study reached quite a large number of women and provided deeper insight into perimenopause, an area traditionally overlooked in menopause research,” she said.“More than a third of research in medical treatments is done by pharmaceutical companies. They traditionally have excluded perimenopausal women from the research because the perimenopausal women are still producing their own hormones in a sometimes unpredictable way, and it didn’t fit with the study design that they wanted,” Hickey said.Hickey said the study’s main limitation was that it was a cross-sectional survey. So while it was helpful for knowing what symptoms women categorised to a particular stage might experience, “it doesn’t tell us how these things change as women go through menopause”.Explore more on these topicsMenopauseHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

To get on the ballot, a candidate must be nominated either by at least 20 members of parliament or at least four local authorities. It is unclear if the Lord of the Dance star can muster such support.In April, the former mixed martial arts fighterConor McGregorcomplained that the nomination rules could block his stated ambition to run.Two candidates have so far secured enough support to enter the race:Mairead McGuiness, a former journalist and EU commissioner, is the Fine Gael party nominee. Small leftwing parties have backedCatherine Connolly, a political independent and former mayor of Galway.

Now she has a slate of upcoming projects, including a bold new venture at the fringe. Will one of them be the next big thing?Best of the fest: 10 sensational Edinburgh fringe comedy showsKate WyverFri 25 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareFrancesca Moody’s name is a sign to pay attention. The Olivier-winning producer discovered the plays that led to two of the most successful TV shows in recent memory: Fleabag andBaby Reindeer. If a show has Moody’s backing, it has a higher-than-average chance of soaring to success.But as Moody’s recognition has grown, so has the pressure to create a hit. “That is exciting,” she cautions as we slip into a small glass-walled room in her office off London’s Leicester Square. She looks surprisingly calm given the restaurants’ worth of plates she’s spinning. “But it’s also terrifying. The stakes are higher than they used to be.” She’s busy unleashing a new set of shows across the US and UK – including an entire miniature festival at the Edinburgh fringe – and has another Netflix show in development.Risk is part of the producing game, and Moody’s threshold is high. She hadn’t raised the money for Richard Gadd’s Baby Reindeer until the week it was due to go on at the Edinburgh fringe in 2019. At that point, she didn’t have much of a buffer for the money not coming through. “I don’t know what I would have done,” she concedes. These days, she has greater financial stability. But there’s also more hanging in the balance. “It’s our company’s money,” she says, “our investors’ money, and ultimately my name.”View image in fullscreen‘A great example of trusting your gut’ … Phoebe Waller-Bridge in Fleabag in 2013.Photograph: Jane Hobson/REX/ShutterstockMoody now runs her own production company, Francesca Moody Productions, which has a knack, as she puts it, for “finding unusual, kooky, sometimes auteur-led work that doesn’t always immediately feel commercial”. It currently has nearly a dozen scripts at various stages of development, plus a film in the works and a first-look deal with Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s production company. “There are a few ideas on our plate now that we’re just itching to get in the room,” Moody says. The list sounds exhausting, but she seems energised.Failures do happen. “Things go wrong every day,” she says, “on the good stuff, too.” But some mishaps are more marked than others. “We had a musical called Berlusconi,” a cautionary tale about the former Italian PM, “which was universally panned by critics.” She says it casually; this job demands rolling with the punches. “I stand by the boldness of the idea, and it was such a collegiate group of creatives, it was almost comical that it didn’t hit in the way we were expecting it to.”Good or bad, the role is all-consuming. Moody admits to an “almost unhealthy relationship” with her work. “It’s so much more than a job,” she explains, searching for the right description for what fuels her. “‘Vocation’ sounds horribly wanky, but it’s so all-defining. It would be really hard for me to unpick who I am without this.”View image in fullscreenSeiriol killer … How to Win Against History.Photograph: Pamela RaithAnd how does she spot a hit? She talks about intuition. “I always thinkFleabagis a great example of trusting your gut.” She first met Waller-Bridge and Fleabag’s director Vicky Jones in Soho Joe, a now-defunct pizza place next to London’s Soho theatre, to discuss producing a play they had commissioned. “I remember it as a whirlwind of ideas,” says Moody. She was nervous and Waller-Bridge made her laugh. When she later heard about a short piece Waller-Bridge had written, which eventually became Fleabag, she leapt at the chance to work with her. “I knew that Phoebe was an incredible actor who could spin comedy and tragedy on a dime,” she says. She locked Waller-Bridge in a room until she finished Fleabag.Edinburgh festival 2025: 20 golden comedy shows to see this summerRead moreHer nose has continued to serve her well. She first read the script for Baby Reindeer on a train and didn’t get off until she’d reached the last page. And it only took one song for her to fall in love with Jon Brittain and Matthew Floyd Jones’s comedy musical Kathy and Stella Solve a Murder!, which leapt from the fringe to the West End. “You have to start with: Do I love this show? Is it like anything else I’ve ever seen before? You have to be 100% all in.”As with most of her hits, the Edinburghfringe was the birthplace for Weather Girl, Brian Watkins’ unsettling climate-comedy, which sees a weather reporter smiling her way through the apocalypse. This prophetic eco-monologue played in Edinburgh in 2024, sold out at Soho theatre earlier this year, and is soon transferring to St Ann’s Warehouse in New York. On first reading, Moody says, “it hooked me”. But she knew it needed work. Her team helped to guide it into what it is now: an absurd comedy that quickly tumbles into giddy climate disaster.View image in fullscreenGreen initiative … Ohio.Photograph: Oliver Rosser“I always try to think about the audience and whether they will connect with a character, so my notes on Weather Girl were largely bound up in that – but it was all there at the beginning,” she says. The show is currently in development with Netflix – and may well be another next big thing.On the other side of the world at the Edinburgh fringe, Moody is ushering in a new roster of shows. “Edinburgh’s not a place to be making money,” Moody says. “It’s a place to be investing.” This year, her investments include three shows and an entire month-long festival-within-the-festival. The first show is Ohio, an autobiographical folk drama by married couple and award-winning musicians the Bengsons, which gathered a keen following in the US and already has a transfer to south London’s Young Vic planned. She’s also bringing Seiriol Davies’ camp historical musical How to Win Against History back to the fringe. (It started there nearly a decade ago.) Her third show is Garry Starr: Classic Penguins. “It’s the best version of clowning I’ve seen,” Moody says, “and the most beautiful holding of an audience through quite exposing audience interaction.” She compares it to Julia Masli’s cult hit, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.In recent years, Moody’s name has become synonymous with success at the festival. “We understand the conditions you need to facilitate a sense of something being exciting,” Moody asserts. “That’s 25% of the way there, in terms of building a bit of a hit.” A producer has to create more demand than a show can satisfy, she says. That means choosing a small enough venue that you can sell a show out and create a buzz.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The eye-catching marketing image, of the lead actor’s grinning face drowning in a pool of bright red, did a lot of work to make the new show recognisable.Perhaps most exciting is Moody’s upcoming collective endeavour. As her company grows, she worries about “not being in the weeds in the same way I used to be, creatively”. To rectify this, she wants to get back to her roots in fringe theatre and support artists in this prohibitively expensive climate. “I came up through the fringe at a time just before it started to get really difficult to make work there,” she says. “You couldn’t make a show any more in the way we made Fleabag in 2013. Our two-bed flat was like £2,000 for the month. You’d be hard pressed to find that for less than six or seven grand now.”After many conversations about the difficulties of producing work, Moody decided to “put our money where our mouth is”. The result is Shedinburgh. Originally conceived with writer and performer Gary McNair and producer Harriet Bolwell during the pandemic, it started as a digital festival where shows were livestreamed from two small sheds in London and Edinburgh. This year, they’re turning the idea into an intimate, 100-seat live venue for the duration of the fringe. “It was too good an idea to let go of,” she says.View image in fullscreenFringe concern … Richard Gadd in Baby Reindeer in 2019.Photograph: Andrew PerryThe programme is eclectic, with the “shed-ule” consisting of one-off performances of old and new work from the likes of Sophie Duker, Maimuna Memon and Christopher Brett Bailey. Paying artists’ travel, accommodation, plus a fee or a box office split, whichever is higher – an inversion of the typical method at the fringe – the project is made possible by investors who believe in its ethos. “We wanted to imagine a bit of a utopia,” Moody reasons. “It’s a love letter to the fringe.”The fringe used to feel like a level playing field. “Once you’re there, the literary manager at the NationalTheatrecan see your show. The theatre critic at the Guardian can see it.Ican see it. Now, it’s so much harder to just get there.” She places these struggles against wider concerns about the “death of fringe theatre” – particularly with the recent cancellation of London’s Vault festival – where so much emerging work begins. Shedinburgh is determinedly creating opportunities in spite of these difficulties. “Theatre is my first love,” Moody says. “We want to reinvigorate that sense that the next best play can come from anywhere, and inspire others to do the same.”Shedinburgh runs 1 to 24 August; Ohio is at Assembly Roxy, Upstairs,30 Julyto 24 August; How to Win Against History is at Underbelly, George Square,30 Julyto 24 August.Explore more on these topicsFringe theatreEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalTheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)FleabagfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But does this approach contradict what Peyo’s original Smurfs stood for?Philip OltermannFri 25 Jul 2025 07.04 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareSmurfs, a new Paramount Pictures CGI-spectacle directed by Chris Miller, has received an all-round critical panning and faltered at the box office. But it does a serviceable job reminding viewers of the utter strangeness of the three-apples-tall characters originally conceived of by Belgian comic artist Pierre “Peyo” Culliford in 1958.In the film, James Corden voices No Name Smurf, who experiences existential angst because unlike the other inhabitants of Smurf Village – Brainy, Grouchy, Hefty etc– he does not “have his own thing”, a skill or character trait that makes him stand out. This special trait is eventually identified as “magic” and No Name is pressed – by a serenading Rihanna-voiced Smurfette – to realise his inner USP and “don’t let anyone ever say you are not anyone” and accept that “you were born great”.An identity crisis might be a relatively novel experience for the motormouthed British actor, but it is certainly a first in the 67-year history of Peyo’s blue cosmos. In fact, it may be a contradiction in terms: to be a good Smurf, in the proto-communist vision of the original comics, was to never elevate your own personality above the collective.Of Smurf Village’s original 100 inhabitants, says French sociologist and Smurfologist Antoine Buéno, “About 90% were totally indistinguishable. They all looked the same, they were all dressed the same.” While some Smurfs were identified by name, he says, this was usually through a skill that is related to how he (all of the original Smurfs were male) is useful to the community. “The Smurfian society is an archetypal corporatist society, meaning that each Smurf that is identified represents a social function.”In Miller’s latest reboot of the franchise, unleashing your true inner self is presented as the key to overcoming a problem – in Peyo’s original book, it is the root of all evil. “In the comics, each time a Smurf tries to be an individual, it creates a catastrophe,” Buéno says.View image in fullscreenHidden ideological underpinnings? Papa Smurf and No Name in Smurfs.Photograph: Paramount Animation/PAFor instance, in the second book of the original series, 1965’s Le Schtroumpfissime (King Smurf), the inhabitants of the village hold a vote for an interim leader in the absence of Papa Smurf, but democracy does not become them. One nameless Smurf realises he can play the system by making promises he can’t keep to each of his potential voters, and wins. But once elected, he rules as an autocrat, installing an oppressive regime marshalled by Hefty Smurf and forcing the other Smurfs to build him a palace. The book was translated into Dutch as De Smurführer.“All bad comes from individuality, which is also linked with private property”, says Buéno. “Each time private property is claimed in the village, it ruins the whole balance of the society.”The 2011 book in which Buéno explored the hidden ideological underpinnings of Peyo’s fictional world,Le Petit Livre Bleu: Analyse Critique et Politique de la Société des Schtroumpfs, triggered a bitter backlash from true blue fans, and is wilfully polemical in the way it spells out political allusions that the comics never make explicit. The revolutionary connotations of the Phrygian caps (red for Papa, white for all the rest) are plausible, the identification of bearded Papa Smurf as Marx and bespectacled Brainy as Trotsky perhaps less so.The search for messages hidden in the books may even have distracted from how genuinely original an exercise in storytelling the Smurfs were on the surface: a series of tales with 100 protagonists, of whom most look exactly the same, in which heroism lies in collective action.Smurfs review – Rihanna is star turn of the new generation of floppy-hatted blue elvesRead moreSpeaking more than a decade after the publication of his Little Blue Book, Buéno sounds more balanced in his assessment. “My theory was always that Peyo was not into politics at all”, he says. “But his genius was in creating a utopia that drew from our joint political history and coming up with images that spoke to everyone.”Using Smurf Village as an example of working socialism did not just die with the new reboot, it was washed out of the Smurfverse after Peyo sold the rights to his creation in the 1970s. “For me, what we witnessed in the Smurfs is a perfect demonstration of Guy Debord’s analysis of capitalism”, says Buéno. “Capitalism’s strength lies in never frontally destroying its enemies, but taking them in and digesting them.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmComics and graphic novelsFamily filmsCommunismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then we see a face, trying to eat moss on a log, and a tongue searching for liquid in rocks. When Caleb Landry Jones (Dogman, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) fully emerges, his blue cape flows like a toga or a Japanese courtier’s cape, close mics capturing every tiny sound – and then exhilarating Romanian prog rock kicks in.Harvest has been described as a folk horror film – one that has sharply divided the critics – but its trippy, haunting opening, inspired byJean-Jacques Rousseau’s unfinished book Reveries of the Solitary Walker, introduces something far stranger than that. It’s been a “very personal film” for itsgenre-hopping Greek new wavedirector Athina Rachel Tsangari, whose previous work includes an avant garde commentary on Greek society (Attenberg), a twisted male friendship comedy (Chevalier) and a BBC Two series about a throuple (Trigonometry).Today, the 59-year-old is presenting a retrospective of her movies at the New Horizons film festival in Poland, where Attenberg won best film in 2011. “It’s full of people in their 20s,” she says, smiling. “Really hardcore film buffs, who come for 10 days and watch like five, six films a day.” Harvest was a project brought to her by Joslyn Barnes, who was Oscar-nominated this year for the screenplay for US reform school drama Nickel Boys. “She had a script and a mood board already, so there was a world there. I just needed to figure out how and if I fitted in.”View image in fullscreen‘He is someone who does not really belong and never will’ … Caleb Landry Jones as Walter Thirsk in Harvest.Photograph: © Jaclyn Martinez/Harvest Film LimitedAdapted from Jim Crace’s 2013 Man Booker prize-nominated novel of the same name, Harvest tells the story of the descent and destruction of a village over seven days. The cast is made up of local people from Oban in Scotland, where Harvest was filmed, and outsiders slowly enter the fray: two unnamed men who get put into stocks, a woman who is suspected of being a witch (Trigonometry’s Thalissa Teixeira), and Quill (Arinzé Kene), a map-maker tasked with charting the land.Tsangari “completely identified” with two of the lead characters, she says: Walter Thirsk (played by Landry Jones) and Quill. Why? “[Walter is] such a tragic, tragic character. You know, someone who does not really belong and he never will.” And Quill? “Because he’s the artist – his job is to draw and describe and name things. I suppose I was fearing that in the end. As an artist, you are going to be complicit with some kind of system that’s going to try to co-opt you, devour you, or employ you to its service.”Two Harry Potter alumni also put in haunting appearances: Harry Melling is the town’s weak-willed mayor and Frank Dillane, as his city cousin, arrives with a terrifying Witchfinder General vibe, as well as tall hat. Keen to preserve the novel’s peculiar mood, Tsangari turned to her “treasure trove” of favourite films, she says, including Peter Watkins’ 2000 docudramaLa Commune (Paris, 1871)and wayward 70s westernsMcCabe and Mrs MillerandThe Missouri Breaks. She doesn’t buy that Harvest is a folk horror. “It’s more pastoral … yes, there is paganism in it, but I’ve called it a nihilist western.”The passivity of its characters as dread encroaches has a contemporary power, while Crace’s setting of the story in an unspecified era – albeit with echoes of theHighland Clearances– adds to its allegorical sheen. “The last thing I wanted to do was locate it and lodge it in a specific time,” Tsangari says. “Especially since the dissolution of communities, and the bordering up of land, the ghettoes, are happening literally everywhere now.”View image in fullscreenAn outsider entering the fray … Arinzé Kene as Quill.Photograph: © Jaclyn Martinez/Harvest Film LimitedThis is Tsangari’s first full-length film as a director in nearly a decade. Greek cinema is in a dire state, she says. “There is not enough support by our government, especially after the big exodus Greek cinema has had in this century.” She often worked with Yorgos Lanthimos before he found Hollywood success with The Lobster and The Favourite (she co-produced his Greek-language filmsDogtoothand Alps), but says the problems have been longstanding, citing one man as Greek cinema’s saviour. “[Producer] Christos V Konstantakopoulos single-handedly financed half of theGreek new wavefilms. That’s actually a fact.”She is now part of Visibility: Zero, a campaign launched with an open letter from nearly 2,000 signatories in June, demanding institutional reform within the Greek arts. Or as Tsangari puts it: “It’s a revolt against the total disregard for the Greek cinema community by our state.” Part of the problem is a cash rebate programme for non-Greek film-makers working in the country, she explains, that has prioritised movies with bigger budgets and squeezed indie productions.“It’s an issue happening more and more in Europe – the whole industry is getting overextended, and then it becomes prohibitive for our very modest films to be made. It’s also becoming more and more difficult to make films in my own language.” A few days after we speak, 176 international actors, directors and producers, including Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe, signed a letter demanding that the Culture Ministry and the Hellenic Film and Audiovisual Center – Creative Greecetake immediate action.View image in fullscreenTwisted … Chevalier.Photograph: BFIBut back to Harvest, loved by some critics and hated by others. I ask if Tsangari likes making films that produce extreme reactions. “I’m not the right person to respond to this,” she says. She doesn’t read reviews, she adds, but admits to readingthe Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw’s negative take. “It was the first one … a bit traumatic”. Now she is focusing on travelling, she says, to present the film “out in the world”.She is much happier talking about the film’s epic sound design. The fabulous opening track, byRomanian experimental one-man band Rodion GA, was made on cassette during the culturally punitive rule of Ceaușescu; she tells me excitedly that she got the masters from bandleader Rodion Roșca’s daughter. She also loved building up a Harvest Family Band, which included Landry Jones (who is also a musician) and experimental recorder player Laura Cannell, with support from ethnomusicologist Gary West and Gaelic musicians Sarah and Anna Garvin.Sound of Metal’s award-winning composer Nicolas Becker and sound engineer David Bowtle-McMillan also bolstered the film’s extreme sensory intensity, the latter often using 20 mics at one time, “buried in the mud, when it was raining, like a Zen Buddha, as if he was mixing jazz,” Tsangari says with a laugh. Whatever your take on it, Harvest is a film that envelops you in its noise, that lingers, that you can’t extract yourself from, I say. Tsangari smiles, perhaps with relief. “That is literally music to my ears!”Harvest is in cinemas on 25 July and on Mubi from 8 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsWesternsGreeceEuropeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Hawes just gets better and betterLucy ManganFri 25 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 10.19 EDTShareAmenopausal assassin has been a long time coming, even though there is literally no more perfect pairing in the world than a woman rapidly emptying of oestrogen and a gun. I blame the patriarchy, but I understand its unwillingness to confront the truth that if women were free to express themselves instead of raised in mental straitjackets, then armed at 40, the world would look very different indeed.Keeley Hawes, who just gets better and more impressive with every outing, is that menopausal assassin, in the aptly named six-part series The Assassin. Julie is her name and trying to live quietly in Greece and spurning every overture of friendship in the village is her game. Alas, she is called by her handler Damian, after 10 years of quietude, to perform one more time. This happens just as her son Edward (Freddie Highmore, absolutely shining in what is essentially a light comic part in a bloody, murderous caper) comes to visit for the first time in four years too! Even hitwomen have to juggle home and work demands. Oh, and Edward’s gone vegan since they last spoke and she got wagyu steaks in for tea. Handlers and kids, eh? Anyway, Edward’s here to ask her about the fortune that landed in his account when he turned 30 and if it’s anything to do with the father she has always refused to tell him about. She, more or less, tells him to shut up and eat his goddamn tofu.View image in fullscreenFamily business … Keeley Hawes and Freddie Highmore in The Assassin.Photograph: Amazon Prime VideoThe Assassin is perfectly crafted preposterousness. It is stylish, witty, tightly written, even more tightly paced and takes the job of massively entertaining us at every turn with the proper amount of seriousness. It establishes its various plotlines swiftly and has us looking forward to their intersection whenever we have enough attention to spare, given that excellent things – from barbed exchanges between unmaternal mother and exasperated son to endless action sequences – are always happening in front of us.Obviously the main plot revolves round Julie. She soon realises the man calling is not her real handler (just in time to stop her killing the woman he has given as the target, which turns out to be doubly lucky for her, in a twist which adds much to the preposterousness and, I hope, the gaiety of the viewing nation). Then, after a massacre of almost the entire village by a very bad sniper trying to kill her, she sets herself the task of finding out what’s happened to the real Damian and hopefully finding out why she is now a marked woman and more and more people are trying to kill her.This first involves pretty much commandeering the yacht belonging to her former target, Kayla (Shalom Brune-Franklin) and her berk of a brother Ezra (Devon Terrell), scions of a mega-rich mining family owned by a man called Aaron Cross (Alan Dale. One day “Him from Neighbours! My God, he’s doing well!” will not be my first thought when I see him, but that day is not yet here), and trying to get to Albania. An old colleague, Sean (Jack Davenport), arrives on a jet ski. Is he here to help or hinder? We, and a variety of weapons, soon find out.Meanwhile! Another plot strand is unfurling in a Libyan prison. Its newest inmate is a Dutch man called Jasper (David Dencik), who possibly has dirt on Cross that will get him out of said Libyan prison but not before he has added – with the help of the terrifying Russians who “adopt” him in jail – his quotient of gory set pieces to the series. He, or most of him at least, eventually escapes and disappears into the desert to find Plot A.Meanwhile again! Plot C begins in London, with the astonishingly unexpected but always welcome advent of Gina Gershon as a mysterious woman called Marie who attends an art class in order to draw a picture of someone we recognise as Edward and a speech bubble coming from his gobsmacked gob the narratively fertile phrase “You’re my father?” Aaaaand scene!It’s so much fun. Hawes is so good, so funny, Highmore so nimble and perfectly pitched and everyone else – including Gerald Kyd as villager Luka, who survives the massacre and follows the woman who is clearly his best hope of safety to the yacht, where they bond over middle-aged medication – turning in brilliant performances. Do not come looking for realism or social commentary or anything else that clearly has no place here – or I will smash your head in with a rock, like Julie does to her adversaries, especially if I’ve not replaced my HRT patch on time. Consider yourselves warned.The Assassin is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsKeeley HawesTV reviewTelevisionAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Perched in front of them as they sit side by side – Kureishi, who has been tetraplegic since breaking his neck in a fall in 2022, is in a wheelchair – is a silver cake made to look like a washing machine, commissioned to mark the 40th anniversary of their witty, raunchy comedy-drama My Beautiful Laundrette.Some of the bubbles land on the cake’s surface, causing everyone present to make a mental note to skip the icing, while others burst on the brim of Frears’s hat or drift into Kureishi’s eyes. It is not perhaps the most dignified look for an esteemed duo celebrating an enduring Oscar-nominated gem. Don’t think they haven’t noticed, either. As the bubbles pop around them, Kureishi upbraids the photographer for trampling on his garden – “Mind my flowers!” – while Frears grumbles: “I could be watching the cricket.”All the girls said: ‘You want Daniel Day-Lewis.’ He was top of the crumpet list at the Royal CourtGet them on to the subject of the film, though, and an aura of pride soon prevails. No wonder. My Beautiful Laundrette, which revolves around a run-down dive transformed into “a jewel in the jacksie of south London” by an Anglo-Pakistani entrepreneur and his lover, did many things: it distilled and critiqued an entire political movement (Thatcherism), portrayed gay desire in unfashionably relaxed terms, and audaciously blended social realism with fable-like magic and cinematic grandeur. It launched a writer (Kureishi), a production company (Working Title, later the home of Richard Curtis), a prestigious composer (Hans Zimmer) and, most strikingly, one of the greatest of all actors:Daniel Day-Lewis, who plays Johnny, the ex-National Front thug teaming up (and copping off) with his former schoolmate Omar (Gordon Warnecke). Or “Omo” as Johnny teasingly calls him even as he licks his neck in public or they douse one another in champagne.It is well known that Gary Oldman and Tim Roth were also in the running to play Johnny. Frears adds an unlikelier name to the mix. “Kenneth Branagh came to see me,” says the 84-year-old film-maker. “Half a second and you knew: ‘Well, he’s not right.’ But good for him for wanting to do it.”View image in fullscreenRita Wolf, Gordon Warnecke and Daniel Day-Lewis in My Beautiful Laundrette.Photograph: Photos 12/AlamyThe leading candidate seemed clear in Frears’s mind, and not only because Day-Lewis threatened to break his legs if he didn’t cast him. “All the girls said: ‘You want Dan.’ He was top of the crumpet list at the Royal Court.” On screen, he is magnetically minimalist. “Dan loved Clint Eastwood,” Kureishi points out. “He loved how still Clint was. You can see the influence: Dan doesn’t move very much.” Frears detected the echo of an even older star. “I remember him standing by the lamppost under the bridge in the scene where he and Omar meet again, and I thought: ‘Ah, I see. You want to play it like Marlene Dietrich.’”Kureishi, now 70, was already established as a young playwright before he wrote the film. Not that his father was impressed. “He hadn’t come to this country to see his son doing little plays above pubs,” he says in between sips of kefir. “He thought I’d never make a living as a writer, so I really wanted to get moving.”Frears once likened reading My Beautiful Laundrette to “finding a new continent”. In writing it, Kureishi combined scraps of autobiography with cinematic tropes. “My dad had got me involved with a family friend called Uncle Adi, who ran garages and owned properties. He was kind of a grifter. He took me around these launderettes he owned in the hope that I would run them for him. They were awful fucking places; people were shooting up in there. So I thought I’d write about a bloke running a launderette. Then I thought: ‘Well, he needs a friend.’ It could be a buddy movie, likeThe Sting. But I couldn’t get a hold on it. Then, as I was writing, they kissed – and suddenly everything seemed more purposeful. Now it was a love story as well as a story about a bloke going into business.”The tension between Omar and Johnny, his formerly racist pal-turned-lover, was drawn from Kureishi’s own experience of growing up in southLondon. “Lots of my friends had become skinheads. My best friend turned up at my house one day with cropped hair, boots, Ben Sherman shirt, all the gear. My dad nearly had a heart attack. He’d spent a lot of time trying not to be beaten up by skinheads. It was terrifying to be a Pakistani in south London in the 1970s.”View image in fullscreenGordon Warnecke, Shirley Anne Field and Saeed Jaffrey in the film.Photograph: Ronald GrantOmar’s uncle, exuberantly played by Saeed Jaffrey, was similarly lifted from life. “He was based on a friend of my father’s: a good-time boy who had a white mistress.” That lover was played in the film by Shirley Anne Field, star of the kitchen-sink classic Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. “She was a woman of such grace and elegance,” sighs Kureishi. “Dan and I would interrogate her all the time: ‘Who’s the most famous person you’ve slept with?’ She’d slept with President Kennedy.AndGeorge Harrison!” He still sounds amazed.When Frears came on board, he made some invaluable suggestions. “Stephen told me: ‘Make it dirty,’” says Kureishi. “That’s a great note. Writing about race had been quite uptight and po-faced. You saw Pakistanis or Indians as a victimised group. And here you had these entrepreneurial, quite violent Godfather-like figures. He also kept telling me to make it like a western.”Frears looks surprised: “Did I?” Kureishi replies: “Yeah. I never knew what that meant.” There are visual touches that suggest the genre: a Butch Cassidy-esque bicycle ride, a Searchers-style final camera set-up peering through a doorway, not to mention a magnificent crane shot that hoists us from the back of the launderette and over its roof. “I think what Stephen meant is that it’s about two gangs getting ready to fight. The Pakistani group and the white thugs. There’s something coming down the line.”View image in fullscreenKureishi.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianHis other note to Kureishi was that the film should have a happy ending. Why? “We’d asked people to invest so much in these characters,” says Frears. “And a sad ending is quite easy in an odd sort of way. This one’s only happy in the last 10 seconds.” Kureishi agrees: “Yeah. But you leave the cinema in a cheerful mood.”It was a happy ending for the film-makers, too. Frears recalls one reviewer observing that while Kureishi might not be able to spell, he could certainly write. That reminds me: the story goes that Kureishi deliberately misspelt the title as an indictment of his own education. But he scotches that rumour. “I’m from Bromley,” he says. “I thought that was how you spelled it.”If the film was a skyrocket for its writer, it heralded a new chapter for Frears. He had recently made his second film for cinema – the stylish, ruminative thriller The Hit starring Roth, John Hurt and Terence Stamp – 13 years after his debut, Gumshoe. Ironically, My Beautiful Laundrette, which was shot on 16mm for just £600,000, was only intended to be screened on Channel 4. But a rapturous premiere at the Edinburgh film festival, accompanied by acclaim from critics includingthe Guardian’s Derek Malcolm, made a cinema release the only possible launchpad. Kureishi recalls that trip with fondness. “I was in Edinburgh with Tim Bevan [of Working Title] and Dan, and we all slept in the same room. I made sure I got the bed, and the others were on the floor. Dan didn’t even have a suitcase, just a toothbrush. Every night, he’d wash his underwear and his socks in the sink and put them on again the next day.”Blown up to 35mm, this low-budget TV film became a magnet for rave reviews here and in the US (the New Yorker’s Pauline Kael called it “startlingly fresh”), bagged Kureishi an Oscar nomination and helped reinvigorate Frears’s movie career, paving the way for later hits including Dangerous Liaisons, The Grifters and The Queen.View image in fullscreenFrears.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianNeither of them has seen it recently. “I don’t watch my old films,” Frears says with a grimace. “You either sit there thinking: ‘I should have done that better.’ Or else: ‘That’s rather good. Why can’t I do that any more?’” I assure them that the picture looks better than ever, whether it’s the visual panache of Oliver Stapleton’s cinematography or the enchanting subtlety of Warnecke’s performance, which was rather overshadowed by Day-Lewis at the time but can now be seen to chart delicately Omar’s gradual blossoming.It goes without saying that My Beautiful Laundrette was ahead of its time, especially in its blase approach to queerness. When the picture was released in the UK at the end of 1985, homophobia was becoming more virulent and widespread in the media as cases of Aids escalated. The Conservative government’s section 28 legislation, outlawing the “promotion” of homosexuality by local authorities, was just over two years away. The timing of the film’s re-emergence today is not lost on its author. “It’s so hard to be gay now,” says Kureishi. “There’s all this hostility toward LGBT people, so it feels important that the film is out there again in this heavily politicised world where being gay or trans is constantly objectified. It’s a horrible time.”View image in fullscreenWarnecke and Day-Lewis.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyInterviewed in 1986 by Film Comment magazine, however, Kureishi dismissed the idea of it as a “gay film”, and derided the whole concept of categories. “There’s no such thing as a gay or black sensibility,” he said then. How does he feel today? “I still don’t want to be put in a category. I didn’t like it when people called me a ‘writer of colour’ because I’m more than that.” The film, too, is multilayered. “It’s about class, Thatcherism, the Britain that was emerging from the new entrepreneurial culture. I didn’t want it to be restricted by race or sexuality, and that hasn’t changed.”How we made: My Beautiful LaundretteRead moreI wonder if it rankles, then, that My Beautiful Laundrette was voted the seventh best LGBTQ+ film of all time ina 2016 BFI poll. And it does – though not for the reason I had anticipated. “What was above it?” demands Frears in a huff. “Why didn’t it win?”Still, both men are thrilled that the film was embraced by queer audiences. “If Stephen and I have done anything to make more people gay, we’d be rather proud of that.”My Beautiful Laundrette is in cinemas from 1 August.

You get what they mean. The winners of this year’s Glastonbury Emerging Talent competition are the product of a burgeoning new Manchester underground scene but started out performing Hank Williams and Bob Dylan covers in drummer Paddy Murphy’s bedroom. While the vocals locate them firmly in the UK, there’s a distinct country/rockabilly undertow to their sound.But equally, Britainicana feels like a slightly ungainly term for music that seems so natural and spontaneous. Recent single Alright Alright Alright rattles along at high speed, its influences buried under a layer of fuzz and feedback and punky vigour, the guitar lurching from the central riff into bursts of noisy abstraction: it sounds like a snatched recording of a band playing live, complete with the thrilling sense that their performance is seconds away from collapsing.The quartet’s debut EP is forthcoming, and the first tastes of This Better Be Something Great are more sedate. I’ve Never Met Anyone I Thought I Could Really Love (Until I Met You) lopes in time-honoured slacker style; Shells starts out as a hushed ballad before unexpectedly bursting into life 90 seconds in. But they’re equally marked by a mood of ramshackle invention at odds with the studied, polished air of a lot of current alt-rock. The name, incidentally, comes from the horse riders employed to ensure trains didn’t exceed a certain speed in 19th century America: another weird choice, given the velocity Westside Cowboy currently seem to be travelling at.Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenAcoustic meditation … Flock of Dimes AKA Jenn Wasner.Photograph: Elizabeth WeinbergFlock of Dimes – Long After Midnight“People say it’s not my problem / They say that actions have a consequence,” Bon Iver collaborator Jenn Wasner sings on a beautiful acoustic meditation about offering help against your better judgement.Kieran Hebden + William Tyler– Spider BalladFour Tet shatters the Nashville guitarist’s arid playing into kaleidoscopic fragments, creating a tense, near-breathless strobing effect that evokes glimpsing horror in half light.Confidence Man x Jade – GossipGossip’s delicious, destructive power is brandished like a weapon on this icy double threat, decorated with enjoyably unexpected acoustic guitar and Jade spitting averyrude word in pure South Shields.Joanne Robertson – GownThe sometime-Dean Blunt collaborator leads her new album with a song that evokes Sinéad O’Connor’s Celtic hymnals heard through Grouper’s damp-forest haze – with stirring cello byOliver Coates.John Also Bennett – Ston ElaiónaFar from his formative years in the Ohio noise scene, Bennett channels the stillness and swoop of the view from his new Athens home, in gorgeous, consciousness-tweaking ambient bass flute oscillations.Daniel Avery – Rapture in Blue ft Cecile BelieveThe wildly underrated Canadian singer – and former Sophie collaborator – gets a deserved showcase leading this anguished, expansive and surprisingly pop turn by the British producer.Chuquimamani-Condori – LRC withPueblo De Dios Capo E DJ editOne half of one of 2025’s best records – Los Thuthanaka – blesses us with a 24-track collection of edits.

It’s a sharp opening to a fresh, ferocious third album from Editrix – an experimental trio founded in Massachusetts’ DIY scene – which explores forms of frustrated, imbalanced communication via a musical language all their own.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Big EFrom rock’s foundations and various genres – blues, jazz, punk, prog, hardcore, indie, metal – Editrix carve a style that is articulate and crushingly exhilarating. With galloping interplay between Steve Cameron’s bass and Josh Daniel’s drums (which alternate between cavernous and deadened, sometimes as if he’s simply drumming his fingers on a plastic tabletop), the band fall in and out of togetherness; musical conversations begin, get interrupted and pick up somewhere new.What’s Wrong uses uneasy, skipping polyrhythms to warn of the dangers in projecting your desires upon someone else (perhaps a lover, or an idol) while Eisenberg’s vocals and electric guitar compete for the same melody. “Help me figure out what inspires me to say no,” asks Eisenberg (also a member of Bill Orcutt’s Quartet) on the blurrily heavy No, and the second half of the track does just that – toying with repetition before running headlong into a concrete wall of noise.Editrix make complex music feel organic, like the natural thing to do, and imply that sound succeeds where words often fail us. So let me say it plainly: Editrix rock.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Bye bye.” At that moment, the awesomely virtuosic and intellectually formidable multi-reeds improviser and composer had probably heard one too many carps from traditionalists that his ideas were too cerebral and unswinging for jazz.View image in fullscreenAnthony Braxton Quartet: (England) 1985.Photograph: IA FreemanNow 80, Braxton’s cross-genre visions have since fascinated jazz bands, symphony orchestras, opera and experimental modern-dance companies, and the influential imaginations of younger admirers including John Zorn andMary Halvorson. Feigin’s Leo Records label, and Switzerland’s Intakt, have kept the immense resource of his influence simmering for years. Now the enterprisingBurning Ambulance Music(which has also brought much of the now-retired Feigin’s invaluable Leo Records catalogue to Bandcamp) releases Quartet (England) 1985, catching the sound of one of Braxton’s most skilfully intuitive groups on that year’s UK tour.Salvaged by state-of-the-art tech methods from former Wire magazine writer andBraxton chronicler Graham Lock’s original lo-fi cassette recordings, the set celebrates Braxton’s conviction that triggering loose improv through tightly challenging compositions can mirror the everyday flux of living. On the Sheffield gig, Braxton’s alto sax (the constructions of Charlie Parker, Warne Marsh, John Coltrane and many more fly by) over jostling four-note patterns takes off into flying avant-bebop. Leicester’s show similarly launches on stop-start bop-reminiscent figures that stretch into free-collective passages powered by bassist Mark Dresser’s pizzicato and bowing skills, drummer Gerry Hemingway’s muscularity and mercurial pianist Marilyn Crispell’s cauldron of delicacy andCecil Taylor-esque intensity. The Bristol takes emphasise that the audio quality of quieter subgroups survives better than the band’s full-on jams, but the brief soundchecks on standard songs are enchanting, and Lock’s notes on Braxton’s methods are essential reading.Also out this monthPianistFred Hersch(an early teacher of Brad Mehldau) has long been one of jazz’s undercover maestros. Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans are his guides, but almost everything he plays sounds fresh.The Surrounding Green (ECM)shares originals and covers with bassist Drew Gress and drummer Joey Baron – including a spirited account of Ornette Coleman’s Law Years and pieces by Egberto Gismonti, Charlie Haden and the Gershwins.Shifa (Discus Music)joins the quirky and inquisitive UK tenor saxophonistRachel Mussonwith eclectic pianistPat Thomasand free-jazz drummerMark Sanderson a straight-through improv set showcasing Musson’s free-blowing ensemble power and spacious lyricism. And French-Martinican pianistTony Tixier’sPoems Never End (Whirlwind)takes a seductively global-jazz slant on a hip original repertoire plus Work by Monk, in which his sharp trio is augmented by saxophonists Seamus Blake and Logan Richardson, plus a guest appearance from Miles Davis percussion legend Mino Cinélu.Explore more on these topicsJazzJazz album of the monthreviewsShareReuse this content"

I can still clearly picture the woman with the longest fingernails in the world.My favourite book growing upI loved the world-building in Michelle Paver’sWolf Brotherseries. Its stone age setting was different to anything I knew, but so easy to imagine being a part of.The book that changed me as a teenagerI boughtNWby Zadie Smith because its cover design was so striking. I had no idea she was such a big deal! Once I finished it, I sought out the books that she recommended. That’s how I ended up readingElizabeth Strout,George Saundersand Gustave Flaubert – which was a very good place to start.The writer who changed my mindI didn’t read biographies until I stumbled upon Dana Stevens’s book about Buster Keaton,Camera Man. She changed my mind about the genre, and now I can’t watch Keaton’s films without thinking about scenes from the book.The book that made me want to be a writerReading short stories at university made me want to become a writer. Extra by Yiyun Li, A Temporary Matter by Jhumpa Lahiri andRecitatifby Toni Morrison stand out as early examples that got me to think differently about reading and writing.The book or author I came back toI didn’t getHeart of Darknessat all when I first read it, and was too quick to judge it. Thankfully, I revisited it and now count Joseph Conrad as one of my favourite writers. I love his prose style and the scale of ambition in his novels.The book I rereadTeaching courses on the short story allowed me to regularly revisit some favourites. Two stories that never left my syllabus were Pet Milk and Paper Lantern by Stuart Dybek. After dozens of rereads, Dybek’s writing always feels new – I get swept along every time.The book I could never read againI listened to Karl Ove Knausgård’sMy Strugglewhile training for a marathon. I think if I read it again, it would invoke some kind of Pavlovian response.The book I discovered later in lifeI have myself to blame for reading Daniel Defoe’sRobinson Crusoelater than I should have – it was on my university course but I missed the lecture. Since reading it, I struggle to get on with novels that don’t have any oomph to them.

She recalls, for example, finally feeling that she has made it as a translator when she is invited to speak at the London Book Fair; years later, she returns to tell the audience that she has plenty of work, but only £30 in her bank account because so many of the organisations in the room are behind on paying her. “Out of the frying pan of grifting,” as she acidly notes, “into the fire of contempt”.But it is not simply a question of spiralling workload, dwindling rates of pay, insecure employment or even the spectre of AI. Translators are additionally required to go along with their own erasure: to sign up to the idea that invisibility is hard-wired into their value, and that a truly great translation is the one that the reader fails to notice. Maintaining this fiction might take obvious forms – neglecting to give a translator their rightful billing on the text itself – or it might be subtle and insidious, as in the insistence that translators suppress their regional identity by rendering everything in homogeneous southern English. Departing from such strictures has not hindered translators such as the inestimable Deborah Smith, who introduced Yorkshire dialect into her versions of the novels of Korean Nobel laureate Han Kang.In fact, as Calleja demonstrates through several fascinating and detailed translations in progress, shepherding a piece of writing from one language into another requires so many minute responses, thought processes and decisions that the translator would find it impossible to suppress their own voice and experiences; and that if they managed it, the result would probably be worse, inert and undynamic. Her relationship with the manuscripts on her desk, for example, is informed by her life-changing encounter with Bernhard Schlink’sDer Vorleser(The Reader), a novel that she selected at random in a Munich bookshop when she was a teenager, over time allowing the chasms in her understanding and appreciation of the prose to slowly fill in and resolve. “Looking at this first page now, it feels so strange to know how I would translate it, how only I would translate it,” she writes. “Even stranger to think that now I pick up novels in German, open them, read them, and know how to translate them into books you buy in shops. That people trust me to do this.”Fair is so titled in part to reflect its qualities as a manifesto – not only an improvement in pay and working conditions, but a demand that literary translation as a practice and profession should be a viable aspiration for a far greater number and type of people. It also describes the book’s puckish structure, in which we wander the stands, stalls and hallways of a notional trade fair, and where the illusion of cosy intimacy and friendliness – the decorated cubicles for meetings, the drinks receptions, the musical performances – are at odds with the corporate reality of such gatherings, which are essentially transactional rather than poetic. It can be a somewhat distracting and disorientating mechanism, which is perhaps the point. Stripping away the industrial structures of creating art is far easier said than done, but as she repeatedly tells us, you have to start somewhere.Fair: The Life-Art of Translation by Jen Calleja is published by Prototype (£12.99).

Several performers slip and fall during the ensemble opening number – Puttin’ on the Ritz. The show is stopped, the stage mopped up (its wetness apparently caused by unexpected condensation), and then the show really does proceed to put on the ritz.Adapted by Matthew White and Howard Jacques, its drama of mistaken identity faithfully follows the 1935 movie starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers but it has more Irving Berlin tunes, each more divine than the last. Phillip Attmore plays Jerry Travers, the avowed bachelor and Broadway star whose head is turned by the independently minded fashion model Dale Tremont (Lucy St Louis). She, in turn, mistakes him for the older, married Horace Hardwick (Clive Carter) and the whole thing plays out like an American Restoration drama but with added tap dance and swing.It is ravishingly directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, who was behind the winning 2021 revival of Cole Porter’sAnything Goes at the Barbican theatrein London.View image in fullscreenEasy on the eye … Attmore leads a dance on the revolving art deco set.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe twinkly eyed Attmore brings sublime tap all the way through but especially in the titular Top Hat, White Tie and Tails, complete with an immaculate dancing ensemble. There is incredibly silky singing from St Louis in songs such as Wild About You and Better Luck Next Time, and the central couple have a natural chemistry on stage.Meanwhile, Horace and his wife Madge (Sally Ann Triplett, very amusing) bring anti-marital comedy, some of it predictable but entertaining nonetheless. Horace’s British valet, Bates (James Clyde), who refers to himself in the royal “we”, is a dryly comic highlight, as is Italian fashion designer Alberto Beddini, hammily played by Alex Gibson-Giorgio.It is a show that is extremely easy on the eye with gorgeous ostrich-feathered costumes (designed by Yvonne Milnes and Peter McKintosh) and a revolving art deco set (also designed by McKintosh) which gestures to the elegant opulence of the film. Some of the costumes honour the film too, especially Dale’s silk and feather dress during her duet with Jerry in Cheek to Cheek.Choreography goes from natty, bouncing tap to smooth, floaty numbers, and the latter have a swirling, romantic quality while the ensemble give the illusion of a far larger chorus line. LikeCrazy for You, which played at the same theatre in 2022, this show seems raring for a London transfer. It stretches on for too long, and is not quite as spectacular as that musical, but the whole thing oozes style and wit.

The 38-year-old pop star has just opened her “Tits Out” show with TiK ToK, the sleazy, insouciant, inescapable party anthem that rocketed her to fame in 2009, cradling a model of her own head from that time – blond, dead-eyed, distinguishable as the artist formerly known as Ke$ha by one single glitter tear. She paraded the head while gamely barreling through that first indelible, now altered, lyric – “wake up in the morning like FUCK P Diddy” – and the IDGAF brag of brushing her teeth with a bottle of Jack (Daniels). Then she places it on an altar of empty glasses and candles and bows to a prayer of “freedom from my past”, how the “truth will set you free”.If this all seems like a lot, somehow both cartoonishly blunt and muddled, hedonism strangely crossed with sanctity – well, that’s Kesha, a millennial-beloved artist always on the messy bleeding edge of culture, for better and for worse. Once the 22-year-old from Nashville who rolled in on her gold Trans-Am and glittered-bombed the early 2010s with a ridiculous string of feral, slangy hits, then a cautionary tale stalled by a nearlydecade-longlegaldisputewith her former producer, the artist born Kesha Rose Sebert has finally stepped into her role as a generational symbol on her own terms, much to the delight of a loyal crowd at the Garden, who hollered at every mention of the word freedom – and there were many – like it was a revelation.Kesha: . (Period) review – a smart, funny return to her hedonistic hot-mess personaRead moreAnd it was – for years, Kesha represented not only the bombast, disillusionment and debauchery of youth fucked over by the 2008 financial crash, with attitude so fierce and undeniable it could make diabolical lyrics such as “don’t be a little bitch with your chit chat / just show me where your dick’s at” winsome, but also the dark side of the predacious music industry. In 2014, she sued to be released from her contract with producer Łukasz “Dr Luke” Gottwald, who convinced her to move to Los Angeles at 17, for alleged drugging, sexual assault and emotional manipulation; aprotracted legal battleforced her to continue working for him, her music still released under his imprint if not with his input, until last year.. (pronounced Period), her album released this month, is her first output truly independent of Dr Luke.View image in fullscreenKesha at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Drew GanyerSo you can’t begrudge Kesha some pointed and grandiose words on liberation, nor for remixing the production of some of her most recognizable hits – Blow, Die Young, Timber – into something a little smoother, more mature, more her. “I’ve had these songs taken from me and I want you to help me take them back tonight,” she proclaims during Act I of four murkily defined sections, before she laps the floor to a medley of tracks from Animal and Warrior in a shocking reminder of just how deep her cuts go. The choreography may be pop standard (sharp and suggestive but cold-blooded), the backing track sustaining the more vigorous dance numbers, the more conceptual moments (a straitjacket, dancers in kitty-cat mascot suits) a little too belabored, but it doesn’t matter. As a statement of legacy – her Auto-tuned recklessness a clear antecedent of today’sBrat-green pop landscape – and as an act of reclamation, the Tits Out tour is a triumph.It’s also extremely fun, Kesha’s grip on the pulse of a hot banger as tight as her stage banter is loose and breezy. As with her recession pop peer Lady Gaga’sMayhemBall, the new dance tracks flow seamlessly with the old. Red Flag, a punchy ode to being magnetized for all the wrong reasons, bends smoothly into the cheerleader taunt of Dinosaur. (“D-I-N-O-S-A, U-R a dinosaur!” remains one of Kesha’s most deranged and stupidly catchy lyrics). Period’s Delusional morphs so easily into the girl-on-girl punches of Backstabber that I thought it was one song. New track Attention! finds Kesha in the pocket of the mode she pioneered – taunting, headstrong, teetering on obnoxious – straight into a sick repetition of “I’m a bitch!” with a 2010s bass so sticky it basically spells out LMFAO. No one could be still.Except, briefly,Keshaherself, when she paused on multiple occasions to celebrate her freedom with kiss-offs (“hey, look how much money you made off of me!”) that would feel overdone if they weren’t so hard-earned. At one point, when she mentioned being in “year eight of litigation” ahead of the self-love track The One., I gasped – her onstage persona is so buoyant, it’s easy to forget just how long she endured.She drove the point into the stratosphere with a victorious encore; a note-perfect performance of Praying, her typically on-the-nose #MeToo ballad fantasizing a perpetrator’s recognition, her voice honeyed and soaring, led to a five-plus-minute standing ovation. She let her tears flow; I shed a tear too, for a moment more raw than anything I’ve seen at a pop show in recent memory. “This love is not only for me, it’s for anyone who survived something they never should’ve had to survive,” she said. And then it’s back to business, with early tracks Your Love Is My Drug and We R Who We R, and one final, perfect, very Kesha farewell: “Have a good night!” she said with that cheeky giggle. “And I hope … you all … get laid.”Explore more on these topicsKeshaPop and rockDance musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

There are also jokes that you will only fully appreciate if you understand ancient antagonisms between Yorkshire’s West and North Ridings and why “Cadbury’s” (in a place built around Rowntree’s) is a punchline.Yet writers Misha Duncan-Barry and Bridget Foreman have plundered this most local of stories and found something universal, relevant and powerful.Antony Jardine, one of two professional actors in the production (the other being Amelia Donkor playing Gulie Harlock) plays Seebohm Rowntree, the son of Joseph Rowntree, chocolatier, philanthropist and modest man (unlike Titus Salt who named a whole village after himself; a joke that acts as a litmus test of whether or not you will get this story).Seebohm grew up in privilege and emerged a social reformer, conducting three comprehensive studies into poverty in York during his lifetime. We meet him burning his last study, having arrived at the end of a lifetime of work believing nothing has changed, despite introducing the concept of the “poverty line”, below which nobody, he believed, should fall.View image in fullscreenAmelia Donkor and Jardine, foreground, with the community cast.Photograph: SR Taylor PhotographyDirectors Juliet Forster and Paul Birch give a sense of dynamism to this history lesson by employing tricks including a literal trapeze artist swinging from the rafters.The history of Seebohm Rowntree becomes increasingly interrupted by meta-intrusions – at one point we watch actors playing the writers and directors of the play we’re watching, rehearsing the play we are watching. As we watch Seebohm attempt to raise people out of poverty, we also see a performance of a King Lear speech, which transforms into an enormous pageant and celebration of the power of art itself.By the end, when the modern world of zero-hour contracts and clogged GP telephone lines have completely bled into Seebohm’s early 20th century, it all gets a little Boal and Brechtian, to moving effect. With his resolution that he has “so much to do” you can’t help but also hear a little of Alexander Hamilton in Seebohm Rowntree. This is a big play with big ideas, but one which has been well contained within the city walls.At YorkTheatreRoyal until 3 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Well, it seems that for guys, it’s the opposite. With turbulent markets, our shorts are rising higher than ever – so much so thatthis season has been dubbed “thigh guy summer”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sure, we’vesort ofbeen here before. Donald Glover was spotted in teeny tiny shorts back in 2022 while Paul Mescal, the king of short shorts, has been wearing them ever since Normal People was released in 2020. And lest we forgetMilo Ventimiglia’s viral momentin his post-workout micro-minis in 2021.However, this year has brought a gear change that can’t go unnoticed: Marks & Spencer, purveyor of British wholesomeness, has jumped on board. The high-street retailer has released a range of its shortest shortsever, with an in-seam of less than 12.7cm (5in) – clear proof that a thigh-grazing length is going mainstream.View image in fullscreenShort memory: John Travolta in a scene from the film Perfect, released in 1985.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyWhat’s so interesting about short shorts, though, is that they always make headlines. They’ve been around for decades (think John Travolta in Perfect, Tom Selleck as Magnum PI,and basically every pair of running shorts in the 70s), but a man’s bare legs still cause a stir. Whenever a celebrity wears anything above the knee – whether on the red carpet or spotted in the wild – it sends the internet into swooning overdrive: whether it’sVogueandGQreporting on Paul Mescal wearing boxers as shorts or the hoards of people thirsting over the Gladiatoractor’s legs on X.Mere mortals may notreceive such high praise for baring a little leg, but only because it’s not fully normalised for a guy to show his mid-thigh area – yet. Even as a stylist and fashion writer, I’ve received a disapproving glance or two from more conservative folk, but the compliments always far outweigh the flak.And, as a menswear expert, trust me when I say it just lookssogood. It’s sexy. It’s cool. It even makes you look taller by visually elongating your legs. So, us guys have to be brave, pull our socks up, and put our short shorts on (look at Alexander Skarsgård on Lorraine, below, to see how it’s done). The best part? They’re the comfiest bottoms going, too.View image in fullscreenActor Alexander Skarsgård on-message with his short shorts look.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockTo get it right, there are a few easy rules to follow. First of all, context is key. You may not want to wear them somewhere formal or if you’re likely to be with people who are more conservative. Second,alwayswear underwear to avoid any Basic Instinct-coded mishaps.So, whether you need new swim shorts for an upcoming holiday, a tailored pair to wear to dinner or a sporty pair for casual dressing, I’ve put together a list of all the best short shorts you can buy now – most of which are less than £100 – as well as tips on how to wear them.The best men’s short shorts for summer 2025Best sports shortsView image in fullscreenAdidas Adicolor Classics sprinter shorts£40 at Adidas£40 at AsosAdidas is your best bet for a sporty take.

They look good with everything from a big shirt, which is on the smarter side; a boxy tee, more casual; a hoodie, super-casual; or a polo shirt, which is somewhere in the middle. They’re more chic than many other types of shorts (such as cargos, jersey and oversized jorts). If you’re a short king like me (5ft 8in, to be exact), they also give the illusion of extra height.To show off your shorts in all their glory, a boxy fit is your friend. Don’t wear anything on top that’s so oversized it covers most of your shorts – or you’re in danger of looking like you’ve forgotten to get dressed. Wear them with an Oxford shirt and loafers to double down on smart casual; a T-shirt and retro kicks for a laid-back look; or even a knit for a cooler evening.Since most of your legs are on show, mid-calf ribbed socks tend to look best.

Don’t stress: embrace the chaosInstead of relentlessly weeding and trimming, take time to stop and stare – to marvel at the sheer beauty of natureClaire RatinonFri 25 Jul 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 13.03 EDTShareThe growing season is at its peak. There have been harvests already and more to come. The boughs of our plum tree bend towards the ground, heaving with fruit, and there are new cucumbers and courgettes swelling with each warm summer day.My season started late, and since the spring equinox I feel as if I’ve been stumbling while I try to catch up. My crops are being outpaced by the creeping buttercup, couch grass and nettles that sneak under the chicken-wire fence. Self-seeded lemon balm and teasels pop up wherever there’s a thumbnail’s worth of bare soil. While it’s a glorious time in the veg patch, all I seem to feel is overwhelm.While overwhelm is a feeling I know all gardeners experience at some point – whether in the depths of a long, soggy winter, or while watching blight take hold of their tomatoes, or just when contemplating a never-ending to-do list – it isn’t something I see people talk about much. Beyond the carefully curated photos and the thoughtfully worded, triumphant captions shared on Instagram, there are other feelings the garden can induce that we growers ought to share more.A kind friend once said ‘a messy garden is better than an empty one’ – and I’ve been leaning on that truthRight now, it is a major source of frustration for me. Everything is growing so rapidly I’ve lost sight of what my garden can be – or what, perhaps, it ought to be. Instead of being a place of nature and nurture, joy and thriving, it feels draining and disappointing. But this isn’t unusual and there is a gentle, sane way to manage these feelings.Stop. Stop trying to get on top of the weeds, the mess and the endless tasks. Just sit down amid the chaos of your garden at the height of summer and see it for the beauty it holds, not the things it has failed to be. A kind friend said to me recently that “a messy garden is better than an empty one”, and I’ve been leaning on the truth and reassurance of that statement to hold me steady as the illusion of control slips through my fingers.I’m also reminded of the wise counsel of skilled gardener and friend Andrew Timothy O’Brien, who wrote an entire book,To Stand and Stare, that embodies a gentler way of being with the plants in your garden. He invites us to pay attention to the garden as it expresses itself, embracing what it has to say even when it’s not part of our plan, and taking the time to be with the garden instead of relentlessly doing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There’s no reason not to have bothBenjamina EbuehiFri 25 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareIdon’t make doughnuts very often, but few things are better than the first bite of a freshly fried, pillowy-soft one, sugar-coated lips and all. When it comes to fillings, custard just about beats jam for me, but who’s to say you can’t have both? So, to satisfy everyone, I’ve filled these doughnuts generously with a thick vanilla custard and a speedy strawberry jam.Strawberry and custard doughnutsPrep15 minProve1 hr 45 min+Cook1 hr 45 minMakes9For the custard4 egg yolks50g caster sugar25g cornflour400mlmilk½ tspvanillabean paste100ml double creamFor the strawberry jam250gstrawberries, hulled and roughly chopped100gcaster sugar1 tbsp lemonjuiceFor the dough360gbread flour,plus extra for dusting7gdried instant yeast55gcaster sugar,plus extra for sprinkling½ tsp salt100mlmilk1 large egg40gunsalted butter,softened1 litre vegetable or sunflower oilMake the custard by beating the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour in a bowl until smooth. Put the milk and vanilla in a small saucepan and heat gently until steaming. Pour a big splash of the hot milk mix on to the eggs, whisk well, then whisk in the remaining milk. Pour back into the saucepan and cook, whisking constantly, over a medium heat, until thick and bubbling. Pour the custard into a clean bowl, cover with clingfilm so it touches the surface, and leave to cool completely before chilling in the fridge.To make the strawberry jam, put the strawberries, sugar and lemon juice in a small pan and bring to a boil. Simmer for seven to nine minutes, until softened and jammy, using the back of a spoon to mash any large pieces of fruit. Set aside to cool, then spoon into a piping bag.To make the dough, put the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix to combine. Make a well in the centre, pour in the milk, water, egg and softened butter, and knead on low speed for six to seven minutesrest uncovered in the bowl for five minutes.Knead again for five minutes, until the dough is smooth and supple and isn’t sticking to the sides of the bowl, then transfer to a lightly greased bowl, cover and prove in a warm place for one or two hours, until nearly doubled in size.Knock out the air, turn out the dough on to a well-floured surface and roll the dough into a rectangle about 1¼cm thick. (If it keeps springing back, let it rest for a few minutes before rolling again.) Use a round cutter to stamp out nine doughnuts, re-rolling the dough if needed.Put each doughnut on a small square of greaseproof paper, cover with a damp tea towel and prove for 30-40 minutes, or until puffy.Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan until it reaches 175C. Fry two or three doughnuts at a time (no need to peel off the greaseproof paper; it will float in the oil so you can pick it out) for a minute and a half to two minutes per side, until deeply golden. Transfer the cooked doughnuts to a plate lined with kitchen paper and repeat with the remaining dough.Once they’re cool enough to handle, put some caster sugar on a shallow plate and roll each doughnut around until covered. Remove the custard from the fridge and whisk well to remove any lumps. Lightly whip the double cream to soft peaks, then fold into the custard; transfer to a piping bag.Using a skewer, make a hole in the top of each doughnut and fill with custard and jam. Serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBakingDessertSnacksFruitEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Even her accessories veered towards the traditional: a bouquet of locally grown white cosmos and dahlias, a short white veil, and slingback heels.Despite the look being more conventional than defiant, Alexandra Macon, the weddings editor of Vogue.com and founder of the e-commerce site Over The Moon, describes the pop star’s choice of designer as a “perfect match”.“Vivienne Westwood has forged a legacy as a true ‘anti-bride’ icon in the world of bridal fashion,” Macon said.View image in fullscreenCarrie Bradshaw: jilted at the aisle in floor-length Vivienne Westwood.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyIn 2008, Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw was jilted at the altar by Mr Big while wearing a floor-sweeping corseted gown from the British designer. Yet even without the couple’s eventual happy ending, a Westwood wedding dress has been desired by millennial brides ever since.Seventeen years later, gen Z have welcomed their own bridal muse. This time the hemline may be shorter but the brand remains the same.Charli xcx’s dress was inspired by the Cocotte, a style of dress Westwood first unveiled in her autumn/winter 1995 collection. Featuring a swooping neckline, a waist-cinching corset and draping detail on the hip, the original paid homage to the dresses worn by the 17th-century French author and courtesan Ninon de l’Enclos.Westwood was one of the first to subvert the historical flat corset. Instead of lacing there are zip fastenings, and while the corset still moulds the body there are stretch panels for comfort. Since then, the brand has launched numerous iterations of the silhouette. Off-the-peg versions start from £3,200. The style is as popular among celebrities as it is with non-famous brides.In 2005, Dita Von Teese wore a billowing purple version.

Macon describes the silhouette as “instantly recognisable and beloved, which is why we see it again and again on brides”.A finale bridal look has been the brand’s show signature since the 1990s when the model Sara Stockbridge was an unconventional bride, carrying her baby down the catwalk in a dress depicting Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s 1797 painting The Swarm of Cupids.Bridal is now a core part of the business with a dedicated atelier. In April, Vivienne Westwood staged its first standalone bridal show.After trying on 120 dresses in her search for her perfect dress, the writer and influencer Katherine Ormerod was surprised to find herself choosing a Cocotte.“No one wants to be a basic bitch and feel like what they’re wearing is ubiquitous, but also after all my years working in fashion, I’ve seen the distinction between something that is trend-led and ‘everywhere’ and design which is iconic, timeless and popular for a reason,” she says.The Cocotte dress is also a hot ticket item on resale andrental platforms. Ormerod says that “in contrast to a sea of algorithmically fine-tuned brands and designs”, it “feels like a bit of a FU to the lace and full train”.Six months after her wedding, Ormerod sold hers. “I can’t think of anything sadder than that beautiful dress hanging, Miss Havisham-like, in a dust bag for ever. It wasn’t a hard sell: within a fortnight it had found its new bride.”Explore more on these topicsWedding dressesVivienne WestwoodCharli xcxThe 1975WeddingsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Garment industry workers who make clothes for leading brandshave been beatenfor asking for living wages and notes pleading for help have been foundhidden in clothing. There have also been stories abouthidden child labourand some workers in UK factories are feared to betrapped in modern slavery.Now after a series of labour investigations by Milanese prosecutors, the luxury fashion industry is fast coming under similar scrutiny.Last week, Loro Piana, the 100-year-old Italian brand that sells four-figure cashmere jumpers and whose“quiet luxury” aesthetichad been championed by celebrities includingGwyneth Paltrowand worn by the super-rich characters in the TV showSuccession, was placed under a 12-month court administration over alleged worker exploitation.The ruling arises from an investigation into Italy’s luxury goods supply chain that began in 2023. According to the court, Loro Piana – owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH – outsourced production of some clothing including cashmere jackets to an external Chinese-operated fashion company, which in turn subcontracted the work to two other companies. These were illegal workshops that operated on the outskirts of Milan. In May, the labour crime unit of theCarabinieri military police foundthat 10 Chinese people, five of whom were undocumented migrants, were forced to work up to 90 hours a week for as little as €4 per hour, as reported by Reuters.It is worth noting that the brand is not under criminal investigation and if the company complies with a set of legal requirements before the deadline issued by the court, the order will be lifted.In a statement to the Guardian, Loro Piana said the supplier had not informed the company of the existence of subcontractors. It also said: “Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on 20 May, and, as a result, the Maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.”However, news of the order has further tainted the idea of the “Made in Italy” label, a term that typically denotes high-quality manufacturing.Loro Piana is now the fifth fashion house to be placed under court monitoring in Italy since 2023.Armaniand LVMH’sDiorhave both faced similar action over the last year. In February the monitoring orders placed on them were lifted early as thecourt saidboth brands had taken all thenecessary corrective actionbefore the 12-month deadline assigned to them had passed. In May asubdivision of Valentino, Valentino Bags Lab Srl, was also placed under judicial administration.Last year, an investigation by Italian police found that Armani bags that retail for €1,800were being made by a Chinese subcontractorfor €93 and then sold on to the group by an intermediary for €250. A Dior subsidiarywas sanctionedfor paying as little as €53 for bags that retail for more than €2,000, the FT reported.Loro Piana released a statement about the difference between the price tag on its clothing and the supposed cost to produce it. According to the recent Italian investigation into Loro Piana, some jackets from the brand that can retail for more than €3,000 were being produced for as little as €118. The statement said: “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.”For many consumers, there is a perception that luxury and ethics go hand in hand. But Deborah Lucchetti, who works as a national coordinator at the Italian segment of Clean Clothes Campaign, a network dedicated to improving working conditions and empowering workers in the global garment industry, says that this is an illusion. “Luxury is based on a production system founded on cost reduction, profit maximisation and opaque supply chains based on subcontracting, which often employ immigrant workers who have no protection and contracts,” she says.Lucchetti points to another ongoing case involving a group of workers in Prato, Tuscany, employed inthe Montblanc supply chainwho say they lost their jobs after raising complaints against inhumane working conditions. “All this is protected by commercial audits that protect the reputation of brands, not workers,” says Lucchetti. “Honestly, where is the difference from fast fashion?”In a statement, Montblanc told the Guardian that it had terminated the firm’s contract because it had failed to adhere to its parent company’s supplier code of conduct and was working with “an undeclared and unauthorised subcontractor. It is important to understand that neither unannounced inspections nor a third-party forensic audit conducted in early 2023 showed any evidence of the alleged extent of precarious working conditions.”They added that the company in its supply chain decided to dismiss “six workers - out of an estimated 60”, 10 months after it had stopped working with Montblanc.View image in fullscreenThe cost of luxury … a vicuña is known for its soft wool.Photograph: Sebastian Casta eda/APLast year, meanwhile,a Bloomberg investigationalleged problems in the supply chain for Loro Piana’s vicuña (a type of South American camelid known for its soft wool) by underpaying the Indigenous Peruvian workers who supply the fibre. Loro Piana has disputed the claim. “Since it arrived in Peru in the 80s, Loro Piana has been committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical and responsible business practices,” the company said in a statement to Bloomberg.These latest claims come at a particularly challenging time for the luxury industry with tariffs, wars and a volatile financial market causing a widespread slowdown. Whether supply chain scandals are scaring away consumers or not, steep price hikes certainly seem to have contributed to a sharp downturn in demand.According to HSBC, luxury prices in Europe are 52% higher than they were in 2019. The fact that many of these pieces are made for a tiny fraction of their retail price could also put off consumers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSarah Kent, chief sustainability correspondent at the Business of Fashion, says it is difficult to ascertain how much the allegations will impact sales. “Historically, luxury consumers have not proved particularly responsive to scandals. What feels different (and potentially more dangerous) this time is that the scrutiny on luxury’s supply chains has coincided with a broader conversation about whether big brands’ products are still worth the money given steep price hikes since the pandemic and online complaints about declining quality.”Loro Piana’s chair Antoine Arnault, who also oversees LVMH’s environmental strategy and whose younger brother Frédéric became the CEO of Loro Piana in June, has previously described luxury products as “sustainable by nature”. Speaking at the 2023 global fashion summit in Copenhagen, he said: “That’s what makes them so special. They are made from the highest-quality materials; they are durable; they are repairable. That is what separates us from the rest of the fashion industry.”View image in fullscreenBig business … workers at a garments factory in Karachi, Pakistan.Photograph: Shahzaib Akber/EPABut the lines between fast fashion and luxury seem to be becoming more blurred. Mass fashion giants regularly blame aconvoluted supply chainfor exploitation. Some specialised work such as embroidery may be subcontracted because fashion brands may not be able to do everything in-house. Luxury houses have sometimes given the impression that such specialised work is being done in small artisan workshops which in turn justify higher prices for the finished product, whenin fact, some items have been made in larger factoriesthat exploit workers.As Lucchetti sees it, the causes of exploitation need to be addressed directly. “The phenomenon highlighted by the Milan Public prosecutor’s office is structural in nature and cannot be resolved in a short time, certainly not by a voluntary protocol, that does not address the root causes of the problem: unfair commercial practices and predatory prices imposed by brands on suppliers, forcing them to break the law and national collective contracts to remain on the market.”The Italian Competition Authority has previously launched parallel investigations concerning misleading ethical claims. In May it concluded an unfair-practices probe into Dior,with the brand pledgingto contribute €2m over five years to support anti-exploitation initiatives.Kent highlights the fact that prosecutors in Milan have “described the issues with subcontracting identified in their investigations as a feature, not a bug in the system” and that “luxury brands routinely turn a blind eye to issues that should raise red flags in order to maximise profits.”She concludes: “Critics certainly argue that the consequences for brands caught up in the scandal are too lax and change would be swifter if there were financial penalties for failures in due diligence.”To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

Not a tourist trap but an island where people actually live, it’s a delightful slice of unhurried Italian life. The island is small enough to be explored on foot or by bicycle, though there is a bus service too. There are many pretty little beaches for swimming, sunbathing and picnicking – our favourite was Il Postino, where scenes from the movie of the same name were filmed. As people still fish for a living, there’s no shortage of wonderfully fresh seafood in the restaurants. A local delicacy is lemon salad, made from the enormous, thick-skinned lemons unique to Procida.Villa CaterinaB&B’s orchard of lemon and orange trees provides fresh juice and marmalade for breakfast, and the rooms have wonderful views of the island and the bay, with Vesuvius looming in the distance and Naples only 45 minutes away by ferry.Bernie GSeafood and sunshine in SwedenView image in fullscreenThe Styrsö coastline.Photograph: Maximiliane Wagner/AlamyWhen life gets too much, I dream of Styrsö in the Gothenburg archipelago. Big open skies, nature trails and heaps of swimming spots make this car-free island the perfect summer escape. It’s topped off by a brilliant seafront restaurant,Tångbaren, where you can have a plateful of fresh seafood and a cold glass of wine, and watch the sea bob away.HannahTranquillity among the dunes, GermanyView image in fullscreenThe dunes of East Frisia’s Spiekeroog.Photograph: Image Professionals/AlamyI was 21, living in Germany for a year to improve my language skills, and decided on a whim to visit the tiny East Frisian island of Spiekeroog (yes, it was the fantastic name that first attracted me to the place). I spent a happy couple of nights at theHotel Inselfriede, a small family-run hotel just a 10-minute walk from where the ferry arrives from the mainland. The island is car-free and a beautifully peaceful place to explore the dunes or simply sit with a coffee and watch the sea.LizzyA Balearic beautyView image in fullscreenSa Dragonera viewed from La Trapa monastery on Mallorca.Photograph: Kris Hoobaer/AlamySa Dragonera is a tiny but utterly beautiful uninhabited island that lies just south-west of Mallorca in the Balearics. It is brimming with history (there are 18th-century watchtowers built to observe pirate activity). Supposedly named after the lizards that inhabit it, the island is a hugely popular walking and birding spot, and is only accessible by small ferries from the nearby Sant Elm. It is best to go first thing to beat the heat and pedestrian traffic – you won’t regret it when you see the views from the top.TomA tiny Greek island with great beachesView image in fullscreenChora, the main village on Kythira.Photograph: Napa/AlamyEveryone knows that Greece has some of the most beautiful Mediterranean islands. But few foreign tourists have heard of Kythira and that’s just the way the locals like it. For most of the year only about 3,500 people live on the island. In summer, however, thousands of Greeks come for holidays, many back to homes that have been in their family for generations. There are no major tourist resorts – it’s a Greek island rich in history and tradition, with dozens of beautiful beaches.Andy MoffatExplore old world Ireland in Galway BayView image in fullscreenRuins and stone walls on Inisheer.Photograph: Juan Carlos Munoz/AlamyInisheer (or Inis Oírr), one of the three spectacular Aran Islands in Galway Bay, is my favourite small island by far. The ferry from Rossaveel on the mainland takes just under an hour, but you feel as if you’ve been transported back in time – this is a tiny island of stone walls, fishing boats, old cottages, and more ponies and traps than cars. You can walk or cycle across the island in an afternoon to explore shipwrecks and ancient ruins. At the end of the day, enjoy some traditional music in the charming pub. You can camp almost on the beach for a good price.Eleanorskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Setting foot on the island, you’ll meet a welcoming committee of friendly sheep. The only indication you’re in a bustling European capital is the skyscrapers across the water. To get to Kuusiluoto, start from the city’s technology museum (itself well worth visiting, and just a short bus journey from the city centre) and walk a couple of miles along well-marked paths through reed beds. The island has a sauna, woodland trails, free postcards and those most valuable attributes – peace and quiet.ArranSnorkel in the coves of Silba, CroatiaView image in fullscreenSilba has quiet coves and is car-free.Photograph: Jure Gasparic/AlamyI didn’t know much about Silba before I arrived – it’s a small, car-free island with no hotels, just family-run guesthouses. The catamaran from Zadar takes roughly 90 minutes, with several sailings a day during summer. Once there, you can walk on shaded paths through olive groves, find quiet pebble coves with clear water for swimming, and climb the Toreta tower at sunset for great views of the Adriatic. My tip: bring a snorkel, stay at least two nights, and make sure you book your return ferry in advance as the schedules are limited.ElaineStunning vistas in Scotland’s HebridesView image in fullscreenLon Liath bay on the Isle of Eigg.Photograph: Arch White/AlamyOn the community-owned Isle of Eigg, the constantly changing light is so enthralling that you don’t need to do anything else during your stay but say “Look!” and point out beautiful variations of rainbows, sunbursts or cloud formations. Stay at theLaig Beach Bothyand gaze out of the beautiful big windows at the sky, sea and mountains. As Virginia Woolf wrote: “One should not let this gigantic cinema play perpetually to an empty house.”AnnaWinning tip: France’s wild westView image in fullscreenNividic lighthouse on Ouessant (Ushant).Photograph: Jekaterina Sahmanova/AlamyThe island of Ouessant (Ushant) is the most westerly point of metropolitan France. It’s a short ferry ride from the mainland, and as wild as it gets. Visit for a day as part of a longer holiday, or stay on the island for your entire trip. You can hire bikes as soon as you step off the ferry. There are beautiful beaches, such as Plage du Prat; impressive lighthouses; and bars and restaurants in the main village of Lampaul.AirelleExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysReaders' travel tipsBeach holidaysWalking holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now many couples are ditching the sweet stuff and doling out cigarettes instead. Bowls and trays piled high with fags have become the new party favour.Last weekend, guests at Charli xcx’s nuptials were served Vogue Essence Bleue slim cigarettes from silver trays, and social media is peppered with wedding receptions featuring tiered dessert stands laden with smoking paraphernalia and dedicated “smoking stations”.It can be an expensive addition to any wedding bill, consideringthe average cost for a packet of 20 cigarettes is now £14.Many modern brides take their inspiration from Mary-Kate Olsen, the child star turned fashion designer for The Row. In 2015,Olsen doled out mini bowls of cigarettesduring her wedding to her now ex-husband Olivier Sarkozy.Emma Westblade, the editor-in-chief of the wedding planning directorythe Wed, described the trend as “a soft rebellion against the polished perfection long associated with weddings, in favour of something more unfiltered and deliberately nostalgic”.View image in fullscreenCharli xcx, whose wedding feature trays loaded with cigarettes for guests.Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/APShe added: “It’s controversial, yes, but it’s part of a larger return to vice-coded aesthetics, plucked from the noughties and revived by gen Z for today’s weddings.”At theonline marketplace 1st Dibs, sales of items with cigarette, lighter, tobacco and cigar in the item title are up 11% this year compared with 2024. Trending items include 1930s cigarette dispensers, art deco cases and porcelain Hermès ashtrays from the 1980s.Getting a nicotine fix is also trending at fashion parties. In September, guests at a party in Paris forKylie Jenner’s clothing brand Khywere greeted by waiters holding silver platters of slim cigarettes and branded matches. At an event to celebrate her collaboration with thedenim brand Madewell, Alexa Chung served guestsice cold martinis next to bowls of Camel Blues.And in November, at the launch ofLili Anolik’s book Didion & Babitzat Hollywood’s Chateau Marmont, cigarettes and lighters branded with the book’s title were placed on tables.Last month,the sale of single-use vapes in England was banned. Perhaps traditional cigarettes never really went away, but they now seem to be having a resurgence.In March, research found thatsmoking rates in parts of England had increased for the first time since 2006. This is despite the fact thatsmoking is widely known to increase the risk of cancerand94% of UK adults recognise this.The trend is also reflected in pop culture. Singers Lorde and Addison Rae both mention smoking in their recent singles, andSabrina Carpenter uses a fork as a cigarette holderin the video for her new song, Manchild. In June, just beforeFrance’s new smoking ban, Beyoncé lit up a cigaretteon stage in Parisduring her Cowboy Carter tour.Charli xcx was photographed smoking outside her wedding reception, while Dua Lipa and Paul Mescal are regularly spotted with a fag in hand.On screen, Seema (Sarita Choudhury) smokes everywhere inAnd Just Like That, including in her bed.Dakota Johnson’scharacter, Lucy, is rarely without a cigarette in her new film The Materialists, and in the latest series ofThe Bear, even anti-smoker Sydney attempts to light up.Jared Oviatt who runs theInstagram account Cigfluencersdescribed cigarettes as “kind of like blue jeans. They’ve survived every trend cycle you can imagine.”Citing generational factors as playing a role in smoking’s revival, Oviatt added: “The dream of stability, owning a home, financial security feels increasingly out of reach. So the question becomes: why not do what you want? Why not smoke? Nothing matters!”Explore more on these topicsSmokingCharli xcxWeddingsCancerKylie JennerAlexa ChungHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, suddenly, we have hundredsTim EarlFri 25 Jul 2025 00.30 EDTShareExcitement ran high when lesser twayblade, a diminutive, two‑leafed orchid that normally grows under the cover of heather, was found by the botanists Aline Thomas and Andree Dubbeldam on one of our southern hills. After all, it had not been recorded in the island since 1881, and their Sunday walk close to Snuff the Wind – a former mine – had hardly been charged with expectation. A government ranger was called and the record was made official.That was in 2009. Afterwards, three further records were found, but then the shy little plant slipped back into hiding.View image in fullscreenThe spruce plantation where hundreds of lesser twayblade orchids have been found.Photograph: Liz CharterStoney Mountain is close to Snuff the Wind. Its habitat is wet upland heath on granite, but one particular area was dry enough 40 years ago to be earmarked for a Sitka spruce plantation. The trees stood largely unbothered until winter 2024, when one of our violent gales struck – “if you want to see all of theIsle of Man, stand still and watch it blow past you” is a popular local joke, a nod to our situation in the notoriously rough Irish Sea.Many trees fell, blocking established paths – but this led to a fresh discovery only weeks ago. The government ecologists Liz Charter and Philippa Tomlinson were visiting the mountain to survey its flora. The carnage forced them to leave their planned route and push through dense stands of spruce. As they bent double to get under low branches, to their astonishment, they spotted spikes of lesser twayblade. And not just a few but hundreds.Visiting the stand of orchids now, I am amazed that it has grown in two such different habitats – open moorland and in the darkness of a spruce plantation. It is also extraordinary to me that these were found at all, their tiny stalks just peeking above the needles and moss. I applaud the skill and tenacity of the finders.Many questions remain. Were the orchids growing here under heather when the trees were planted? Were they in the ground then, or blown in after? And why was this moorland specialist doing so well underneath Alaskan conifers?Perhaps the orchid dislikes its “lesser” title and is getting its own back on the botanists.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsPlantsCountry diaryRural affairsIsle of ManWild flowersTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An eight-year-old boy was among those killed.Cambodia’s national government has not provided details of any casualties or evacuations of civilians, but a local official in Oddar Meanchey province told Reuters that one civilian had been killed and five were wounded, with 1,500 families evacuated.Thailand’s acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, told reporters in Bangkok: “This present incident of aggression is escalating and could develop to the stage of war. However, right now we are still at altercation level, battling with heavy weapons. What we have done so far is to protect our land and sovereignty of our nation.”View image in fullscreenPeople from Ta Miang village shelter in a bunker in Phanom Dong Rak district, Surin province, Thailand.Photograph: Kaikungwon Duanjumroon/EPACambodia’s prime minister, Hun Manet, said he had supported a proposal by Malaysia for a ceasefire, but claimed Thailand had initially agreed, only to reverse its decision. Both sides have accused the other of starting the clashes and of violating international norms.Thailand’s foreign ministry said later on Friday it had agreed in principle to a Malaysian proposal, but that it must be based on “appropriate on-the-ground conditions”.“It must be stated that throughout the day, Cambodian forces have continued their indiscriminate attacks on Thai territory,” the ministry said in a post on X.Malaysia, which chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) regional bloc, called on Thailand and Cambodia to stand down, while the US and China both expressed concern. Fighting resumed from before dawn on Friday in the Ubon Ratchathani and Surin provinces, according to the Thai military.Map“Cambodian forces have conducted sustained bombardment utilising heavy weapons, field artillery and BM-21 rocket systems,” the Thai military said in a statement. “Thai forces have responded with appropriate supporting fire in accordance with the tactical situation.”Fighting first broke out on Thursday morning afterweeks of simmering tensionsover a long-running border dispute between the south-east-Asian neighbours.The clashes are the latest in a history of conflict along Cambodia and Thailand’s 508-mile (817km) border, sections of which are subject to overlapping claims owing to disagreements about colonial-era maps.View image in fullscreenCambodian civilians injured during fighting are treated at a facility near the Cambodia-Thailand border in Oddar Meanchey province.Photograph: Kith Serey/EPATensions have been high since May, when troops briefly exchanged fire in a contested area, killing a Cambodian soldier. This led toretaliatory measures by both sides.The crisis worsened on Wednesday when five Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine, the second such incident in a week. Thailand responded by recalling its ambassador to Cambodia and saying it would expel Cambodia’s envoy in Bangkok. Thailand alleged the landmines had been placed in the area recently, which Cambodia denies.The following day, Thailand accused Cambodia of launching rocket and artillery attacks, including in civilian areas, and said its air force had launched airstrikes on military targets.The dispute has been fanned by nationalist sentiment, compounded by a bitter feud between two powerful politicians: Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia with an iron fist for four decades before handing power to his son Hun Manet in 2023, and Thaksin Shinawatra, the former populist leader of Thailand, whose daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister in 2024. Both former leaders remain highly influential.On Thursday night, Thaksin said on social media he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate but would like to wait a little bit, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and teach Hun Sen a lesson.”Hun Sen responded on Facebook that Thaksin’s “warlike tone” underscored “Thailand’s military aggression toward Cambodia”.View image in fullscreenA Thai soldier at the Phanom Dong Rak hospital, which was damaged after Cambodia fired artillery shells in Surin province, Thailand.Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/APThe UN security council was due to meet on Friday over the conflict. The US, a longtime treaty ally of Thailand, called for an immediate end to hostilities.“We are … gravely concerned by the escalating violence along the Thailand-Cambodia border and deeply saddened by reports of harm to civilians,” the state department’s deputy spokesperson, Tommy Pigott, told a regular news briefing.China also said it was “deeply concerned” by the clashes and that that Beijing “has and will continue to in its own way do its best to promote peace and dialogue”.Britain’s foreign ministry on Thursday advised against all but essential travel to parts of Cambodia and Thailand.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But many see the underlying cause as economic insecurity among a population that both understands the need for overseas labour and visitors, and feels anxiety at the changes they bring and symbolise.Sanseito’s new contingent of 14 upper house lawmakers, up from a single seat in the previous election, is undoubtedly a breakthrough, but still leaves it a minor force in the 248-seat chamber. Its success comes against the backdrop of arecord 3.8 million foreign residentsas of 2024,tourist visitssurpassing 20 million in the first quarter of this year, and Tokyo property prices rapidly rising due to wealthy foreign buyers.How Japan’s hard-right populists are profiting from anti-foreign sentiment and a cost of living crunchRead more“To put it simply, I feel like the Japanese are starting to lose confidence,” says Masafumi Usui, a social psychology professor at Niigata Seiryo University. “When you’re living a comfortable life and are respected by others, then you feel secure, and you’re more open. But when people feel that their survival is under threat or in crisis, they start wanting to protect their existing culture. I think that leads to things like patriotism and xenophobia.”Adjusting to a new realityUsui notes there was little anti-foreign sentiment during Japan’s bubble economy in the 1980s, when it was seen as a powerhouse to be looked up to and learned from. But as its GDP growth stagnated and neighbours such as China and South Korea began to leave it behind in sectors from electronics to shipbuilding, he suggests Japan has struggled to adjust to its new reality.“I do think people who openly engage in hate speech like ‘get out of Japan’ are still a minority,” says Usui. “But more and more people have started saying, ‘Why are we spending money on foreigners? Spend it on Japanese people instead.’ And I think that’s what Sanseito’s ‘Japanese First’ slogan in the election really tapped into. It struck a chord with people who feel like they need to protect Japanese culture and way of life.”Japan’s foreign-born population only accounts for about 3% of its residents. One of the contradictions is that to grow its economy Japan needs to increase that figure. Sanseito’s answer to the chronic labour shortage is automation and AI, but even those wary of immigrants acknowledge that for the immediate future, more foreign workers are essential.View image in fullscreenTourists walk through the Shinjuku entertainment district in Tokyo.Photograph: Franck Robichon/EPAThere are around a dozen Vietnamese at the company where Akio Ono installs air conditioners, “I get on well with them, most of the guys do. But when they go to customers’ homes, they still have to go with a Japanese colleague as there is still prejudice, as well as language issues.”Reports of crimes by foreigners, often circulated on social media, have also raised hackles, even though police statistics show immigrants commit proportionally fewer offences than the native population. Ono believes news stories about Vietnamese and Chinese theft rings are “a big part of what is driving the concerns about immigration.”“I like the guys I work with but if I see a group of Vietnamese or Chinese walking around, I find them a bit scary. I think a lot of Japanese people feel that way,” adds Ono, who nevertheless voted for the left-wing Reiwa party.Decline from the glory daysToyonori Sugita, who runs a metalworking factory just south of Tokyo, leans right but also rejected Sanseito. He sees the electorate’s main concerns as the economy and the sales tax, which Sanseito promised to cut.“What can they actually do to realise ‘Japanese First,’ make the Chinese people who bought land return it?” questions Sugita.View image in fullscreenPrecision-machining machines for automotive parts at a factory at Kyowa Industrial Co. in Takasaki. To grow its economy, Japan needs more immigrants.Photograph: Issei Kato/Reuters“I’ve had Vietnamese working here under the government’s Technical Intern Training Program for about three years,” he says. “They mostly work hard and are earnest; unlike some Japanese, who complain a lot.”The tourist boom has also aroused conflicting emotions. While the money spent by visitors on luxury accommodation and high-end dining that now seem cheap by global standards boosts the economy, it is a stark reminder of Japan’s decline from its glory days.Usui points out that Japanese people hadn’t really been conscious of the gradual fall in relative prices over the last few decades until recentmedia coverage of big spending foreign touristsdrove the point home.“The reality is that Japan has become a cheap country. You can’t deny that wages are higher overseas or that there are 10,000-yen [£50] sea urchin lunches aimed at foreigners. So, in order to protect their emotional wellbeing and maintain their sense of self-worth, people cling to the idea that Japanese culture is the best.”Explore more on these topicsJapanThe far rightAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

But was the process transparent?Read moreSenior author, Prof Susan Davis, said while vasomotor symptoms (VMS) – such as hot flushes and night sweats – were already known to be typical of menopause, the study found moderate to severe VMS symptoms to be the most defining symptom of perimenopause, the time period leading up to the final menstrual period.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAlthough other symptoms were commonly reported by perimenopausal women, including poor memory and low mood, analysis showed none differed in prevalence enough from pre-menopause to differentiate between menopausal stages.The study found 37.3% of women in late perimenopause had moderately-to-severely bothersome hot flushes: meaning they were five times more prevalent among perimenopausal women compared with pre-menopause.Severe vaginal dryness was 2.5 times more prevalent among perimenopausal women compared with pre-menopause.Menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT, also known as HRT) is effective for treating VMS due to menopause, but there are no specifically designed or approved interventions for these symptoms for perimenopausal women, the researchers noted.Treating perimenopause is not the same as treating post-menopause because women are still randomly ovulating, contraception needs to be considered, MHT can make bleeding heavier and progesterone worsens PMS, Davis said.The study also challenged the assumption that menstrual irregularity is the earliest sign of perimenopause.Our findings support a more symptom-based approachDr Rakib IslamDavis said it is common for women to ask their GPs if their heavier periods and hot flushes are a sign of perimenopause, only for the doctor to respond: “If you’re still getting regular cycles, you can’t possibly be perimenopausal.”But when the study compared pre-menopausal women with VMS whose periods were still regular but had changes – becoming lighter or heavier – they were the same as women who had VMS but who’d started experiencing changes in period cycle frequency.“So we’re really saying ignoring hot flushes and night sweats is wrong,” she said.Dr Rakib Islam, also a study author, said defining perimenopause and menopause by menstrual cycle overlooks women with regular cycles and those who no longer menstruate, such as those who have had an endometrial ablation or hysterectomy, and users of hormonal contraception.“Our findings support a more symptom-based approach, enabling earlier recognition of perimenopause and more timely care,” Islam said.Davis said it was “critical” that women were recruited to the study with no mention made of menopause, so the sample was not biased.The unspoken agony of vaginal dryness: ‘I had to give up four jobs in four years’Read moreProf Martha Hickey, the chair of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Melbourne and lead author of last year’sLancet series on menopausecalled it an important study.The study reached quite a large number of women and provided deeper insight into perimenopause, an area traditionally overlooked in menopause research,” she said.“More than a third of research in medical treatments is done by pharmaceutical companies. They traditionally have excluded perimenopausal women from the research because the perimenopausal women are still producing their own hormones in a sometimes unpredictable way, and it didn’t fit with the study design that they wanted,” Hickey said.Hickey said the study’s main limitation was that it was a cross-sectional survey. So while it was helpful for knowing what symptoms women categorised to a particular stage might experience, “it doesn’t tell us how these things change as women go through menopause”.Explore more on these topicsMenopauseHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The company did not respond to Guardian Australia’s request for comment.On 8 July, Gillin lodged a complaint with the agency.View image in fullscreenLauren Gillin says she was told she needed to be home during a 2.5 hour window on a weekday morning to allow access for a smoke alarm inspection, or face a $90 reschedule fee.Composite: Guardian design/SuppliedIn the email, seen by Guardian Australia, Gillin said her experience with the agency had otherwise “been really positive” which made the letter she got from them “all the more surprising”.She followed up on 9 July, citing legal adviceshe had received from the tenants’ union and the NSW rental commissioner, Trina Jones, that she did not need to be at home during a smoke alarm inspection.Jones told Guardian Australia that a fee for not being present during a smoke alarm inspection could not legally be passed on to tenants.She said the state’s rental taskforce – which was created earlier this year – contacted Gillin’s agent to advise them of their responsibilities under the law and make clear the charge was not permitted.“Illegal fees and charges remain an issue in the sector,” Jones said. “Since January, the Rental Taskforce has overseen refunds of $165,303 to renters who were charged unlawful fees.”On Wednesday, Gillin said the smoke alarm technician let her know they had got a key from the agency to let themselves into the property.But she said the agency still had not responded to her complaint.Explore more on these topicsRentingConsumer affairsHousingBusinessNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

This includes lobbyists who do not disclose links to foreign companies and governments.Greens and independents to push Labor for tougher regulation of political lobbyingRead moreBut Guardian Australia can reveal no one involved in the 14 breaches substantiated by the federal attorney general’s department since January 2023 has been formally sanctioned.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA departmental spokesperson said each breach was administrative in nature and “resolved through engagement between the department and relevant lobbyists”.“In most cases where breaches are substantiated, they are administrative in nature and remediated through communication with the responsible officers within lobbying organisations,” the spokesperson said.“There were no reported breaches referred to the secretary for consideration during the relevant period.”Transparency International Australia’s chief executive, Clancy Moore, said federal lobbyists breaking the rules “do so with impunity”.“Put simply, the federal lobbying code of conduct is as weak as a cup of cold milky tea,” Moore said.“The commonwealth needs a big stick to sanction lobbyists who break the rules.”Crossbench MPs and the Greens have flaggedpushing Labor to toughen the rules in the new term of parliament. One element of the rules persistently identified as a shortcoming is that the code of conduct only covers paid third-party lobbyists and their clients. Lobbyists employed internally by corporations and interest groups are not required to sign up.Currently about 360 lobbying organisations and more than 700 individual lobbyists are included on the transparency register. They represent a combined 2,400 clients.More than 40% of registered lobbyists are identified former government representatives, including former staffers, former government ministers and other ex-office holders.In Victoria, no lobbyist has been sanctioned by the state authority since the latest code of conduct was introduced by the Napthine government in 2013.Under current rules, the only sanction available in Victoria is the removal of a lobbyist from the register.The state’s public sector commissioner, Brigid Monagle, said six potential breaches of the lobbying code had been investigated in the past five years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Victorian government has accepted Ibac’s recommendations, in principle, and is now consulting on possible changes.In New South Wales, six lobbyists were suspended from operating last month after failing to provide a regular update on which government officials they had met and on whose behalf.TheNSW Electoral Commission, which regulates the lobbying industry, required this information to be updated every three months. Lobbyists must update the list even if they have been inactive during this period.There is no such requirement for lobbyists meeting with federal government officials.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsLobbyingnewsShareReuse this content"

But the report, also seen by Guardian Australia, has not yet been made public.A spokesperson for the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the minister was seeking feedback from senators involved in parliamentary inquiries into PwC Australia before the outcome of the department’s review was finalised.“This period of consultation is ongoing and the report will be finalised after any feedback or other relevant information has been received and considered,” the spokesperson said.The Australian federal police has confirmed it is still investigating how confidential Treasury information about draft taxation was shared by a former PwC Australia partner to win private sector work overseas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The police investigation, dubbed Operation Alesia, is examining whether formerPwCAustralia staff committed a crime by disclosing official secrets.The finance department’s decision is likely to be criticised by two senators who led parliamentary inquiries into the consultancy firm’s alleged conduct – Greens senator Barbara Pocock and Labor senator Deborah O’Neill – who have said previously they do not believe the ban should be lifted until the police investigation is concluded.Finance’s decision is expected to be seen as an endorsement of the measures PwC Australia has put in place since the scandal decimated its reputation and income from government contracts. The company is not expected to resume tendering for government work, having sold its advisory business.PwC Australia has argued the firm’s culture, internal processes and governance have been significantly overhauled since the damaging scandal.Before Guardian Australia revealed the decision, O’Neill said she strongly stood by her recommendation that “PwC Australia cannot be allowed to tender again for government services until – at the very least – all investigations into its conduct are complete”.Pocock issued a similar statement in early July, saying any green light from the finance department would send “precisely the wrong signal” about the consequences of breaching confidentiality provisions.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsPwCLabor partyBusinessAccountancynewsShareReuse this content"

It led to a joint call for Israel to lift its food blockade immediately, an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas. But there was no apparent shift in Merz’s or Starmer’s position on recognition.Macron not expected at UN summit on two-state solution for Palestine and IsraelRead moreThe German government said it had “no plans to recognise a Palestinian state in the short term”.Starmer stuck to his position that statehood would only come as part of a sequence of coordinated steps towards peace.“Recognition of a Palestinian state has to be one of those steps. I am unequivocal about that,” he said. “But it must be part of a wider plan which ultimately results in a two-state solution and lasting security for Palestinians and Israelis.”The French argument is that in the absence of any sign of moves towards stopping the war, European governments have to try to break the deadlock with the levers they have to hand.“It obviously puts huge pressure on the UK to act likewise,” said Victor Kattan, an assistant professor of public international law at Nottingham University. “France and the UK are very close allies, and they’ve obviously spoken about this when Macron visited the UK a few weeks back.”The continuing shift in western European positions has come at a time when UN officials and increasing numbers of legal experts are accusing Israel ofcommitting genocide in Gaza.The international court of justice in The Hague is currently weighing up a genocide charge against Israel, brought by South Africa in December 2023.France’s stated intention of recognising Palestine, joining approximately 147 other UN member states, is clearly a reaction to the catastrophic situation inGaza, with deaths from hunger from Israel’s blockade multiplying alongside the relentless toll of Palestinians killed by Israeli bombing and gunfire.World map showing countries that have recognised a Palestinian stateMacron’s declaration, however, would do nothing immediate to stop the killing, argued Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies.“I think this is a mostly symbolic gesture that will annoy the Israelis but ultimately will not change anything on the ground, least of all in Gaza. It does nothing to bring about a ceasefire or to address the catastrophic mass starvation in Gaza, which is not only man-made but engineered as a matter of Israeli policy, or the systematic destruction of Gaza,” Elgindy said.He said the only meaningful actions for western countries in the face of Israeli war crimes was to impose trade sanctions and arms embargos. France, like other western states, has not stopped arms supplies to Israel, despite expressions of outrage at Israeli actions.Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, argued that to look for immediate results from state recognition was to miss the point.Severe malnutrition among under-5s in Gaza City has tripled in two weeks, charity saysRead more“This is really the wrong question, and it has led us to where we are today: genocide, mass killing, mass starvation, mass destruction, and the further erosion of the very idea of a two-state solution,” Zomlot said. “Issues of recognition of a people’s legitimate self-determination is an inalienable right.”He said no real progress could be made towards ending the conflict until Palestinian statehood was recognised. “The key message is that the recognition has got to be without ifs and buts and it has got to be immediate and it has got to kickstart a political process that has the potential of ending all this mess we are in,” Zomlot said, adding: “If not now, when?”Macron’s announcement comes in the run-up to a two-day conference on Monday at the UN in New York, hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, delayed by the Israel-Iran war, which is supposed to start work on a blueprint for peace through the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.That will be followed by a summit on the issue at the UN general assembly high-level meeting in September, where Macron will formally recognise Palestine. The French hope is he will not be alone, and that other G7 powers will have followed suit by then, building momentum.Between then and now, the political pressure on Starmer will be intense, with a brewing mutiny on the issue in the Labour party andin the cabinet.The House of Commons foreign affairs committeepublished a reporton Friday arguing the UK “should now recognise the state of Palestine while there is still a state to recognise”. “An inalienable right should not be made conditional. The government cannot continue to wait for the perfect time because experience shows that there will never be a perfect time, and in hindsight it is possible to see times when it should have occurred.”Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli government adviser and peace activist, argued that the major western powers’ failure to recognise Palestine had contributed to the failure to make progress towards a two-state solution, and was a reflection of the lack of real political will around the world to create the right conditions for peace.“How many years can you talk about a two-state solution and only recognise one of them?” said Baskin. “There’s a need to break out of this duplicity of intentions and actions, so the French making that step is good. It needs to be done along with other G7 members, and members of the European Union that haven’t yet done it. It’s important because it makes a statement – that the world is committed to a solution to this conflict.”Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warFranceEmmanuel MacronKeir StarmerGazaEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

He said he was also planning to meet the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, on Saturday.TheEuropean Commissionsaid von der Leyen’s visit would be at Trump’s invitation. Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said on Friday a deal would “hopefully be signed off before the weekend is over”.After getting off Air Force One, Trump described von der Leyen as a “highly respected woman”, said there was a “good 50-50 chance” for a deal, and said the “sticking points have to do with maybe 20 different things”. He said it “would be the biggest deal of them all if we make it”.Trump heaped praise on Starmer and Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, and said the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was “a team player” but thatFrance’s planned recognition of Palestine as a statewould not “carry any weight”.Trump said he was looking forward to meeting Swinney. Before boarding the presidential plane, he told journalists: “The Scottish leader is a good man, so I look forward to meeting him.”He said he had a “lot of love” for Scotland.Trump hinted he was looking for more concessions from the EU, saying Japan had had a worse chance than Brussels of getting a deal but succeeded after offering more to the US.He also criticised what he called “the windmills” – windfarms – which he claimed were “ruining your beautiful fields and killing your birds”, and hit out at the level of immigration in the EU, saying it was an “invasion” which was “killing Europe”.Von der Leyen said she “had a good call” with Trump before he landed in Scotland and they had “agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong”.Trump would not meet von der Leyen unless a deal was ready to be signed, sources have said.He also hinted he was ready to widen the deal he had already agreed with the UK, fuelling speculation he could finally eliminate the 25% tariff he imposed on steel. “This week we want to talk about certain aspects [of the trade deal] which are going to be good for both countries; more fine tuning. We are also going to be doing a little celebrating together because, you know, we get along very well,” he said.“We are going to have a good time, I think. The prime minister and I get along very well; the Scottish leader too, we have a lot of things, my mother was born in Scotland, and he’s a good man, the Scottish leader … so I’m looking forward to meeting him.”Asked about a trade deal with the EU, he said: “I would say that we have a 50/50 chance, maybe less than that … I would have said we had a 25% chance with Japan, and they kept coming back and we made a deal.”The EU is resigned to an agreement in principle on 15% baseline tariffs, including on cars, which will make brands from Volvo to Volkswagen more costly for US traders to import than Range Rovers from Britain, which carved out a deal allowing 100,000 cars a year to be imported to the US at a 10% tariff.On Friday, Volkswagen laid bare the cost of Trump’s import tariffs saying it hadtaken a £1bn hitin the first half of the year as a direct result.Trump struck a deal with Starmer in May, reducing tariffs on cars from 27.5% to 10% in exchange for increases in UK imports of beef and ethanol. While it is being seen as a clever move by Starmer, the ethanol industry says it isfighting for survivalagainst US ethanol, which is used in E10 biofuel in filling stations around the UK.The president of the National Farmers’ Union, Tom Bradshaw, said his “biggest worry” was that Starmer would sell farmers out by allowing in US dairy products. “We understand the US is pushing very, very hard for dairy access, and for us that is a real red line as they use hormones that we stopped using in dairy production 30 years ago.”He said the farming sector could not “give any more” and warned Starmer not to sacrifice agriculture.Before boarding Air Force One, Trump claimed he would have sealed deals with nearly all of the 60 countries he threatened with punitive tariffs by next Friday, his self-imposed deadline for agreements.He said he had not “really had a lot of luck with Canada” but he was not focused on it, and rather was “working very diligently with Europe, the EU” to get a deal.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropean CommissionDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

To get on the ballot, a candidate must be nominated either by at least 20 members of parliament or at least four local authorities. It is unclear if the Lord of the Dance star can muster such support.In April, the former mixed martial arts fighterConor McGregorcomplained that the nomination rules could block his stated ambition to run.Two candidates have so far secured enough support to enter the race:Mairead McGuiness, a former journalist and EU commissioner, is the Fine Gael party nominee. Small leftwing parties have backedCatherine Connolly, a political independent and former mayor of Galway. The Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin parties have yet to nominate candidates.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since December 2024, Assad has been living in exile in Russia after rebels led by Turkish-backed forces took control ofSyria.Mariana Pena, a senior legal counsel with the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI), said the ruling was a “missed opportunity” for the court to make an exception on the waiving of immunity for heads of state accused of the most serious crimes, but added the campaign to bring Assad to justice would continue.A French court issued the international arrest warrantin November 2023 in response to two chemical weapons attacks in Syria. In the first, in August 2013, the banned gas sarin is believed to have killed more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children, in the district of Ghouta, in eastern Damascus. In the second, in April 2018, 450 people were injured in the towns of Adra and Douma.The case that led to the arrest warrant was brought by civil parties including survivors of the attacks, the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression and the OSJI.Its cancellation was initially sought by France’s anti-terrorism office on the grounds of head of state immunity. Last year, the Paris court of appeal upheld the warrant following a request for annulment, only for the anti-terrorism office and the public prosecutors’ office to lodge a fresh appeal.At the appeal hearing, the OSJI argued that immunity should not apply when leaders perpetrated grave crimes against their own population.France has previously issued international arrest warrants for three other senior Syrian officials, including the former leader’s brother Maher al-Assad for complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Cour de Cassation did not rule on these warrants, which are still in effect.The sarin attack in 2013 almost led to US intervention in Syria’s civil war. Barack Obama, then US president, had warned Assad that the use of chemical weapons would be a “red line”, but backed down from military action after Syria agreed to dismantle its chemical weapons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the way to ensure it is a tool of maximum utility to improve the lives of those who are suffering, which, of course, will always be our ultimate goal.”World map showing which countries have recognised Palestinian statehood and in what year they recognisedThe statement came as Donald Trump flew into Scotland for a four-day visit, which includes a visit from Starmer on Monday. Macron upped the pressure on Starmer this week byannouncing that France would recognise a Palestinian stateat the UN general assembly in September.Trump on Friday dismissed Macron’s move by saying it “doesn’t carry weight” and is “not going to change anything”.The UK government’s policy is that it will formally acknowledge Palestine as part of a peace process, but only in conjunction with other western countries and “at the point of maximum impact”.Cooper and Rayner are among more than half a dozen cabinet ministers pressing for urgent action. The Guardian revealed this week that Wes Streeting, the health secretary, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, and Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary,have all pushed for recognition of Palestineat recent cabinet meetings.Ian Murray, the Scotland secretary, and Jo Stevens, the Wales secretary, have also raised the issue in cabinet, according to a cabinet source. Murray and Stevens declined to comment.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, is also said to have called for action, and Lammy is said by colleagues to be pushing Downing Street to take a stronger stance. A government source said it was increasingly “everybody v No 10”.“Too many people in No 10 just see this as a ‘left’ issue and actually don’t get how widespread public anger is,” aLaboursource said.Rayner said last month that the west needed to avoid repeating past mistakes when it came to Gaza. Addressing a service at St Paul’s Cathedral to mark the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, in which more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed by Serbian forces in 1995, she said: “The west took too long to act in the 1990s and we should have acted sooner. Now we must learn the lessons of history and the consequences of inaction.”On Friday, 221 MPs from nine parties signed a letter to Lammy calling for British recognition of Palestine to be announced next week at a UN conference in New York.“Whilst we appreciate the UK does not have it in its power to bring about a free and independent Palestine, UK recognition would have a significant impact due to our historic connections and our membership on the UN security council,” the MPs wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since 1980 we have backed a two-state solution. Such a recognition would give that position substance as well as living up to a historic responsibility we have to the people under that mandate.”The letter’s signatories included several Labour select committee chairs, including Emily Thornberry, of foreign affairs, Sarah Champion, of international development, and Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, of defence.Other signatories included the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, the Green party co-leaders, Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, and the Conservative MPs Kit Malthouse and Edward Leigh.The true number of backbench Labour MPs who support recognition is even higher. Several said they were in favour of the move but did not put their names to the letter. “We need to do more. Israel is committing terrible war crimes,” one Labour MP said. Nearly 60 Labour MPs signed a similar letter to Lammyearlier this month.There is a dangerous disconnect: on Gaza, politics no longer speaks for the people | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said that cases of severe malnutrition among children under five at its Gaza City clinic had tripled in the last two weeks and the UN World Food Programme said nearly a third of people in Gaza were not eating for days, with the hunger crisis having reached “new and astonishing levels of desperation”.Israel said it would allow foreign countries to resume aid drops into Gaza from Friday.In an article for the Daily Mirror, Starmer said ministers were working with Jordanian authorities to get British aid on to planes and into Gaza.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, accused the international community of sticking its head in the sand as Palestinians starved in Gaza, lambasting what he called a “lack of humanity”. “This is not just a humanitarian crisis. It is a moral crisis that challenges the global conscience,” he said on Friday.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyLabourMiddle East and north AfricaGazaPalestinian territoriesKeir StarmerAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

Malnutrition is surging, with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment,” the WFP said in a statement.Graph of starvation deaths in GazaNaji al-Qurashali, an obstetrician-gynaecologist in Gaza, said statistics appeared to underestimate the true scale of the problem, estimating that 50% of the hundreds of pregnant women he saw each day were suffering from malnutrition.“The malnutrition situation is unimaginable. Throughout my entire medical career, I never expected, not even in my wildest dreams, that things would reach this level,” said Qurashali.Miscarriages had increased significantly among the patients he saw as mothers struggled to find food to feed themselves, he said. Those babies that were carried to term were significantly underweight and were increasingly born prematurely or with disfigurements.Qurashali said he lacked many of the medical supplies necessary to treat the malnourished women. He and other doctors were forced to use unsanitary medical gloves and prescribe expired medication to patients.“As a helpless doctor, it is an incredibly painful feeling,” he said. “Many times, I leave the hospital running, because I can’t bear the fact that I can’t meet even the simplest needs of these women.”Medical experts have said that society’s most vulnerable, children and pregnant women, are the first to die in mass hunger events.View image in fullscreenDesperate Palestinians wait to receive food distributed by a charity in the Rimal neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsrael has denied it is responsible for the hunger crisis in Gaza, with the foreign ministry calling it a “deliberate foreign ploy to defame Israel”, and blamed the UN for failing to distribute aid. The UN said it was operating as well as it could under Israeli restrictions, which prevent the UN-led aid system from using its 400 aid distribution points throughout the strip.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, accused the international community of sticking its head in the sand as Palestinians starved in Gaza, lambasting what he called a “lack of humanity”.“This is not just a humanitarian crisis. It is a moral crisis that challenges the global conscience. We will continue to speak out at every opportunity,” Guterres said on Friday.The leaders of the UK, France and Germany said in a joint statement on Friday that the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza “must end now” and called on the Israeli government to lift restrictions on aid.“We firmly oppose all efforts to impose Israeli sovereignty over the occupiedPalestinian territories,” the leaders said, calling for an immediate ceasefire.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said late on Thursday thatFrance would recognise a Palestinian stateat the UN general assembly in September. The UK prime minister hascome under pressure to do the same, with more than 100 MPs signing a letter demanding Keir Starmer follow suit.Macron had previously urged the UK to recognise a Palestinian state alongside France and is expected to try to enlist other European countries to do the same. Starmer called the humanitarian situation in Gaza “unspeakable and indefensible” in a post on X on Thursday, but said nothing about recognising a Palestinian state.Macron’s move was dismissed by Donald Trump, who was due to meet Starmer on Friday evening when he arrived in Scotland. The US president said of Macron on Friday: “He’s a very good guy. I like him, but that statement doesn’t carry weight. Here’s the good news: what he says doesn’t matter. It’s not going to change anything.”Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Israeli military announced on Friday that it had agreed to let Jordan and the United Arab Emirates airdrop aid into Gaza. Each flight carrying aid is far more expensive and holds fewer supplies than lorries do. Hamas described it as a political stunt.“The Gaza Strip does not need flying aerobatics, it needs an open humanitarian corridor and a steady daily flow of aid trucks to save what remains of the lives of besieged, starving civilians,” Ismail al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, told Reuters.Amal Masri, a 31-year-old mother in Gaza who is pregnant, said finding food was near impossible. The food she did find was unsuitable for her pregnant state, and if she ate it out of desperation, she vomited.“Most of the time I am completely exhausted, my blood pressure is very low, and I often feel like I’m suffocating, like I’m on the verge of death,” Masri said.Her husband, like many Palestinians, has been unsuccessful at getting food from the private US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution sites, and arrives home injured and empty-handed. More than 1,000 people have been killed while trying to get food at GHF or aid sites – the GHF denies any responsibility for shootings outside its distribution sites.As the humanitarian situation declines, ceasefire negotiations appear to have collapsed. On Thursday, Israel and the US recalled their negotiators from Qatar, where talks were being held.Trump blamed Hamas for the collapse, accusing it of not wanting to make a deal or give up Israeli hostages. The US president said he thought Hamas leaders would be “hunted down”.Hamas officials denied they were responsible for the end of the round of peace talks, and accused Israel of stalling.Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said: “What we have presented – with full awareness and understanding of the complexity of the situation – we believe could lead to a deal if the enemy had the will to reach one.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesAidHungerChildrenMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s claims are contradicted by clear evidence of its efforts to undermine aid distribution.Despiteinternational warnings of the humanitarian risksposed by banning Unrwa, the main UN agency for Palestinians and the organisation with the most experience in Gaza, from Israel,its operations were closed down, complicating aid efforts.Instead Israel, backed by the US, has relied on the private, inexperienced and controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation; its sites have been the focus of numerous mass killings of desperate Palestinians by Israeli soldiers.Israel’s attempts to hamper with aid efforts have continued. Last week it said it would not renew the work visaof Jonathan Whittall, the most senior UN aid official in Gaza; and a UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, told reporters on Thursday that Israel had rejected eight of the 16 UN requests to transport humanitarian aid in Gaza the previous day.He added that two other requests, initially approved, led to staff facing obstruction on the ground as he described a pattern of “bureaucratic, logistical, administrative and other operational obstacles imposed by Israeli authorities”.All of which has injected a new sense of urgency into the catastrophe in Gaza as UN agencies warned that they were on the brink of running out of specialised food needed to save the lives of severely malnourished children.“Most malnutrition treatment supplies have been consumed and what is left at facilities will run out very soon if not replenished,” a WHO spokesperson said on Thursday.More starvation deaths appear inevitable.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelAidGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesFood securityanalysisShareReuse this content"

Gaza is in the grip of a humanitarian catastrophe,” Albanese said in his statement on Friday. “Israel’s denial of aid and the killing of civilians, including children, seeking access to water and food cannot be defended or ignored.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHe added: “We call on Israel to comply immediately with its obligations under international law. This includes allowing the United Nations and NGOs to carry out their lifesaving work safely and without hindrance.”Global condemnation of Israel’s actions in Gaza has sharply increased in recent weeks and days. International humanitarian organisations have pleaded for attention onstarvation and malnutrition concerns for civilians still remaining in Gaza.At least 45 people have died of hunger in the last four days. The UN and aid groups blame Israel’s blockade of almost all aid into the territory for the lack of food. Imagesof skeletal and starving childrenhave been published on newspaper front pages worldwide.Abreakdown in negotiations over a Gaza ceasefireappears to have partly contributed to new statements from Australia, the UK, France and other western nations.Albanese stressed that Australia “condemns the terror and brutality of Hamas and we reiterate our call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages”, and said “every innocent life matters. Every Israeli. Every Palestinian.“We continue to support all international efforts to facilitate a ceasefire, recognising that an immediate and permanent ceasefire gives the best hope of bringing hostages home and easing the agony of their loved ones.”But the prime minister expressed major concern over the ongoing humanitarian situation in the besieged territory, and reiterated the government’s support for a two-state solution, which he said was necessary for a “just and lasting peace”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The role is separate to the No 10 director of communications.The Telegraph reported thatKeir Starmerinterviewed the candidates who made the final shortlist and is said to have been impressed with Dinsmore’s understanding of modern communication challenges.The role is a new position called the permanent secretary for communications, created after the prime minister voiced concerns about government communications late last year.Dinsmore started his career in journalism as a reporter for the Scottish Sun in 1990 and rose to become its editor in 2006. He has held a number of senior roles at the Sun including managing editor and helped to oversee the launch of the Sunday edition.Dinsmore currently works at News UK, which publishes the Sun, the Times and Sunday Times, where he has been chief operating officer for the past decade.While editor of the Sun in 2014, Dinsmore was named “sexist of the year” after a poll run by a feminist campaigning coalition called End Violence Against Women.The Sunwas at the time still publishing photographs of topless women each day on page three of the newspaper – it stopped in 2015.Dinsmore is not the first senior tabloid journalist to transition into a communications role at Downing Street.Andy Coulson, the former editor of the now defunct News of the World, worked for David Cameron in opposition and then in Downing Street, before resigning as director of communications in 2011 over the phone-hacking scandal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also claimed he had not “really been following” the justice department’s interview with Epstein’s convicted longtime associate,Ghislaine Maxwell.“A lot of people have been asking me about pardons” for Maxwell, Trump said. “Obviously, this is no time to be talking about pardons.“You’re making a very big thing over something that’s not a big thing.”Trump’s name appeared on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003,according to reporting from the New York Times, lending further weight to reports that the president participated in the leather-bound collection of messages, drawings and accolades – even though he denied that he contributed a signed and sexually suggestive note and drawing, as reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.Trump’s name is listed among Epstein’s friends and acquaintances who contributed birthday messages for the professionally bound book which reportedly had multiple volumes, the New York Times reported. The tome opens with a handwritten letter, also reviewed by the outlet, from Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for conspiring to sexually traffic children.Maxwell had a secondmeetingon Friday with the US deputy attorney general and Trump’s former personal criminal defense attorney, Todd Blanche, in Florida, where she is serving her prison term – following an initial face-to-face on Thursday.Trump was asked about Maxwell on Friday morning as he departed forScotlandwith the shadow of the rumbling Epstein scandal hanging over the visit.Maxwell is appealing her conviction and the US president did not get into detail when asked about possible clemency for the disgraced British socialite and daughter of the latenewspaper proprietor Robert Maxwell. Trump cited the ongoing investigation, while confirming he had the power of the presidential pardon, which can be used for federal or national level crimes but not state level.“I’m allowed to do it, but it’s something I have not thought about,” Trumptold reportersoutside the White House as he prepared to depart Washington DC.Trump cranks up distraction machine but focus refuses to budge from EpsteinRead moreWhen he arrived in Scotland, a large crowd was on hand, and some looking on reportedly applauded him.He was greeted by Scottish secretary of state, Ian Murray, as he walked off Air Force One. The pair were seen shaking hands at the bottom of the aircraft stairs before Trump walked across the tarmac to a group of journalists to answer questions.Trump planned to spend the weekend at one of his golf properties near Turnberry. Early next week, he will be visiting Aberdeen, where his family has one golf course and is getting ready to open a second course soon.Trump plans to meet with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to talk trade, amid his continual threats of imposing steep tariffs on US trading partners.But none of that could overshadow Epstein, whose birthday gift collection includes about five dozen contributions from public figures and unknown acquaintances, according to documents reviewed by the Times andthe Wall Street Journal, and was assembled before Epstein’s first arrest in 2006.The birthday book controversy has deepened anger over the decision by Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, and FBI director, Kash Patel, to backtrack on promises to release the Epstein investigative files.Trump has responded to the growing backlash from his usually loyal supporters – and Democrats – over the U-turn with mounting fury, claiming that news reports over the birthday book were fake news.Last week, Trump sued Journal’s billionaire owner, Rupert Murdoch, publisher Dow Jones and twoJournalreporters for libel and slander over claims that he sent Epstein a signed lewd letter and sketch of a naked woman as part of the birthday book.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The letter allegedly concluded: “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Trump followed the lawsuit, which seeks $10bn in damages, by barring Journal reporters from this weekend’s trip to Scotland.He also called for relevant grand jury testimony in the prosecution of Epstein to be publicly released, insisting that he had nothing to hide. On Wednesday, a district judge in Florida denied a request by Trump’sDepartment of Justice to unseal the transcripts.Congress wassent home earlyfor summer recess by the House speaker and Trump loyalist, Mike Johnson, in an effort to quell Democratic party demands for a vote on the Epstein files.But Trump’s desire to play down his relationship with Epstein has been repeatedly thwarted by a steady drip of evidence –photos, videos,books andwitnesses– that strongly suggest his name could appear in the files.Earlier this week, CNN published newly uncovered photos and videos that show Epstein atTrump’s 1993 wedding to Marla Maples, and the pair at a Victoria’s Secret event in 1993, seemingly joking with Trump’s future wife, Melania Trump.The New York Times then reported that even before the birthday anthology, Trump had written another gushing note to Epstein in 1997. “To Jeff – You are the greatest!” reads an inscription in a copy of Trump’s book Trump: The Art of the Comeback that belonged to Epstein, which the Times said it had reviewed.And the Journal reported more details on the birthday book, which Epstein’s brother Mark Epstein recalls Maxwell putting together.The contents page was organized into categories, with Trump and Bill Clinton listed under the “Friends” group, according to the Journal. A message in Clinton’s distinctive handwriting reportedly read: “It’s reassuring isn’t it, to have lasted as long, across all the years of learning and knowing, adventures and [illegible word], and also to have your childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference and the solace of friend.”Also listed as a friend is the Labour politician and current UK ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, whose tribute, the Journal reported, included photos of whiskey and a tropical island, and referred to Epstein as “my best pal”.Clinton has previously said that he cut ties with Epstein more than a decade before his 2019 arrest and didn’t know about Epstein’s alleged crimes. In 2023, Mandelson told the Journal that he “very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein”.A House committee on Wednesday voted to subpoena the justice department for the Epstein investigation files, with three Republicans voting alongside Democratic members. Democratic representative Ro Khanna of California has said he will subpoena Epstein’s estate to hand over the book.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinScotlandGhislaine MaxwellTrump administrationUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He also asked his wife for help to end his life.The coroner, Jonathan Stevens, said the last time Thorpe was seen in person by healthcare professionals was on 26 March 2024. “In my judgment there were shortcomings in the care that should have been provided to Graham in the last four months or so of his life,” he said.Stevens added that “there were failings in the provision of his care”, but said that, on the evidence, he could not conclude those failings were gross and that, without them, Thorpe would not have died. He said healthcare appointments were offered to Thorpe, but he “found it hard to attend these” because of his mental health.Stevens found that “someone should have gone to see him to properly monitor and assess him, to do a face-to-face risk assessment and understand and address his care needs as required by the care plan”.The inquest heard that healthcare professionals did not consider Thorpe to be in a “crisis situation” after he missed an appointment with the community mental health team on 28 June. At the time, Thorpe’s wife, Amanda, told his care coordinator over the phone that her husband had been asking her “for help to end his life”.During the same phone consultation, Thorpe said he “hadn’t been out for a while” and “didn’t see the point of being here”, but had no immediate plans to act on his suicidal thoughts.The coroner said: “I don’t accept that when Graham was constantly asking his wife to help him end his life, which was a new presentation … that he was not at that point in crisis.“It’s clear there were shortcomings in his care. If he had been seen in those last four months, particularly after that incident on 28 June, I cannot say whether it would or would not have made any difference.”In May 2023, Thorpe had suicidal thoughts and was given inpatient treatment. Stevens said that “some similar protective measures should have been considered in June 2024”.Ex-cricketer Graham Thorpe ‘spiralled into depression’ after losing job, inquest hearsRead moreAn investigation was carried out by Surrey and Borders PartnershipNHStrust after his death.Thorpe was a mainstay of the England men’s cricket team for many years, as a batter between 1993 and 2005, and then as a coach for 12 years.During his international career, he struck 16 Test hundreds for England, including a debut century against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1993. In all formats, he represented his country 182 times.Amanda Thorpe told the inquest the termination of his employment with the England and WalesCricketBoard was a “real shock to Graham”, which was the “start of the decline of his mental health”.Speaking outside the coroner’s court, she said: “We will never get over the tragic loss of Graham, and we miss him every day. He was my best friend, my soulmate, and he was just a joy. And he loved life – but he got very ill.”Mark McGhee, the family’s legal representative, said the coroner had found “significant shortcomings” in the care provided. He said Thorpe’s family “hope that the coroner will address these concerns” so that such a loss “never happens again”.Jo Lynch, the chief nursing officer for the Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS trust, said: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Graham Thorpe and our thoughts are with Graham’s family and loved ones.“We will reflect on the coroner’s findings and our role in Graham’s care with a view to continuous improvement and learning.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The public have been urged to keep coming forward forNHScare during this period, and NHS England has urged hospital chief executives to keep routine operations and appointments and only reschedule if there is a risk to patient safety.The NHS chief executive, Jim Mackey, told broadcasters on Friday that the NHS was taking a new approach after learning from previous strikes that “harm to patients and disruption to patients was much broader than the original definitions”.“Colleagues in the service have tried to keep as much going as humanly possible as well, and the early signs are that that’s been achieved so far, but it is early doors,” he said. “The thing that colleagues won’t compromise is safety in the actual delivery. But it does look like people have really heard that. They’re really pulling together to maximise the range of services possible.”Mackey noted that further strikes were “possible” given the BMA has a six-month mandate.View image in fullscreenWes Streeting, the health secretary, said the BMA’s decision to hold the strike was a ‘reckless and unnecessary action’.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PASpeaking shortly after the start of the strike on Friday morning at the NHS England headquarters in London, where officials are monitoring its impact, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, praised NHS staff whom, he said, were trying to limit its effects.This included, he said, “many resident doctors who have ignored their union and are turning up for work”.Streeting said, however, that patients would feel the impact, saying: “We know that there have been operations, appointments and procedures already cancelled, and we know that there will be real challenges over the next five days.”Calling the BMA’s decision to hold the strike a “reckless and unnecessary action”, he added: “We won’t let the BMA hold this country to ransom.”The BMA has agreed to requests for doctors to come off picket lines and work in hospitals experiencing the most pressure. One doctor was told to return to work at Nottingham City hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit over the weekend, and a request from Lewisham hospital in south London for two anaesthetists to work on Saturday was also accepted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of 48,000 members, 55% voted, of whom 90% supported industrial action – representing less than half of members – compared with a turnout of 71.25% in 2023’s expanded electorate, of whom 43,440 (98.37%) voted to go on strike.During the last round of 12 strikes in 2023 and 2024, nearly 1.5m appointments were rescheduled. In the final industrial action from 7am on Thursday 27 June to 7am on Tuesday 2 July, 23,001 staff were absent from work at the peak of the action.The BMA is asking for a rise of 29% over the next few years in order to achieve what it considers to be full pay restoration to pre-2008 levels, after the 2023 industrial action resulted in a pay bump of 22% to cover 2023-24 and 2024-25. At present, ministers have offered a 5.4% pay rise for 2025-26.View image in fullscreenDr Tom Dolphin,the newly electedBMA council chair, told the BBC that a ‘clear, guaranteed pathway’ to pay restoration would be required for resident doctors to return to work.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianThe BMA council chair,Dr Tom Dolphin, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that a “clear, guaranteed pathway” to pay restoration would be required for resident doctors to return to workHe said: “So you’ve got last year’s pay offer which did indeed move us towards [pay restoration], but Wes Streeting himself said that pay restoration is a journey, not an event, implying that there would be further pay restoration to come, and we were expecting our pay to be restored in full – that’s our campaign’s goal. We got partway there, but then that came to a halt this year.”Keir Starmer made a last-minute appeal to resident doctors, saying the strikes would “cause real damage”.“Most people do not support these strikes. They know they will cause real damage … These strikes threaten to turn back the clock on progress we have made in rebuilding the NHS over the last year, choking off the recovery,” the prime minister said.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsNHSIndustrial actionEnglandTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he was also planning to meet the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, on Saturday.TheEuropean Commissionsaid von der Leyen’s visit would be at Trump’s invitation. Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said on Friday a deal would “hopefully be signed off before the weekend is over”.After getting off Air Force One, Trump described von der Leyen as a “highly respected woman”, said there was a “good 50-50 chance” for a deal, and said the “sticking points have to do with maybe 20 different things”. He said it “would be the biggest deal of them all if we make it”.Trump heaped praise on Starmer and Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, and said the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was “a team player” but thatFrance’s planned recognition of Palestine as a statewould not “carry any weight”.Trump said he was looking forward to meeting Swinney. Before boarding the presidential plane, he told journalists: “The Scottish leader is a good man, so I look forward to meeting him.”He said he had a “lot of love” for Scotland.Trump hinted he was looking for more concessions from the EU, saying Japan had had a worse chance than Brussels of getting a deal but succeeded after offering more to the US.He also criticised what he called “the windmills” – windfarms – which he claimed were “ruining your beautiful fields and killing your birds”, and hit out at the level of immigration in the EU, saying it was an “invasion” which was “killing Europe”.Von der Leyen said she “had a good call” with Trump before he landed in Scotland and they had “agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong”.Trump would not meet von der Leyen unless a deal was ready to be signed, sources have said.He also hinted he was ready to widen the deal he had already agreed with the UK, fuelling speculation he could finally eliminate the 25% tariff he imposed on steel. “This week we want to talk about certain aspects [of the trade deal] which are going to be good for both countries; more fine tuning. We are also going to be doing a little celebrating together because, you know, we get along very well,” he said.“We are going to have a good time, I think. The prime minister and I get along very well; the Scottish leader too, we have a lot of things, my mother was born in Scotland, and he’s a good man, the Scottish leader … so I’m looking forward to meeting him.”Asked about a trade deal with the EU, he said: “I would say that we have a 50/50 chance, maybe less than that … I would have said we had a 25% chance with Japan, and they kept coming back and we made a deal.”The EU is resigned to an agreement in principle on 15% baseline tariffs, including on cars, which will make brands from Volvo to Volkswagen more costly for US traders to import than Range Rovers from Britain, which carved out a deal allowing 100,000 cars a year to be imported to the US at a 10% tariff.On Friday, Volkswagen laid bare the cost of Trump’s import tariffs saying it hadtaken a £1bn hitin the first half of the year as a direct result.Trump struck a deal with Starmer in May, reducing tariffs on cars from 27.5% to 10% in exchange for increases in UK imports of beef and ethanol. While it is being seen as a clever move by Starmer, the ethanol industry says it isfighting for survivalagainst US ethanol, which is used in E10 biofuel in filling stations around the UK.The president of the National Farmers’ Union, Tom Bradshaw, said his “biggest worry” was that Starmer would sell farmers out by allowing in US dairy products. “We understand the US is pushing very, very hard for dairy access, and for us that is a real red line as they use hormones that we stopped using in dairy production 30 years ago.”He said the farming sector could not “give any more” and warned Starmer not to sacrifice agriculture.Before boarding Air Force One, Trump claimed he would have sealed deals with nearly all of the 60 countries he threatened with punitive tariffs by next Friday, his self-imposed deadline for agreements.He said he had not “really had a lot of luck with Canada” but he was not focused on it, and rather was “working very diligently with Europe, the EU” to get a deal.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropean CommissionDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The outage disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices.It was unclear whether Thursday’s outage affected SpaceX’s other satellite-based services that rely on the Starlink network. Starshield, the company’s military satellite business unit, has billions of dollars’ worth of contracts with the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Are Americans ready to let go?In the past, US consumers have resisted their favorite foods changing to natural dyes. Attitudes might shift if Maha converts the entire industryAimee LevittFri 25 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 11.39 EDTShareThe Make America Healthy Again (Maha) movement celebrated this month after the US dairy industryvoluntarily pledgedto remove all artificial dyes from ice-cream by 2028. In April, US health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jrprevailedupon the food industry to stop using artificial dyes, and many of the nation’s largest food manufacturers, including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo, have alreadypromised to comply. But the ice-cream pledge made Kennedy especially happy because, he said, ice-cream is his favorite food.Prepare to say goodbye to the brilliant pink (from red dye No 40) that signifies strawberry, the cool green (yellow 5 and blue 1) of mint chocolate chip, and the heroic combination of red 40, blue 1, and yellow 5 and 6 that makes up Superman.One of thegoalsof the Maha movement is to prevent childhood diseases, which Kennedy argues can be accomplished by, among other things, addressing the use of additives in ultra-processed foods. Arecent studypublished in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics calculated that, in 2020, 19% of food products contained artificial dyes – “the most egregious” additive, according to Kennedy. Those dyes, heclaims, are responsible for a host of health issues, including cancer, hyperactivity and possibly autism.“The American people have made it clear – they want real food, not chemicals,” Kennedy said in a statement.View image in fullscreenRobert F Kennedy Jr and the US secretary of agriculture, Brooke L Rollins, hold up ice-cream cones during a press conference in front of the United States Department of Agriculture on 14 July 2025 in Washington DC.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesAside from jokes on social media about Donald Trump’sskin toneand Kennedy’s alleged use ofmethylene blue(an artificial dye that some claim boosts “mitochondrial efficiency” and longevity), the initiative has faced little political opposition. In January, when Joe Biden was still president, the FDA announced abanon red dye No 3 scheduled to go into effect in 2027. Red 3, the FDA explained, was shown to cause cancer in rats, and while it does not show up in food in large enough quantities to affect humans, it still violates a law forbidding additives that contain carcinogens.Meanwhile, states as politically varied as West Virginia, Texas and California have already established their own bans or requirements that foods containing artificial dyes carry warning labels, citing the need to protect kids. (In the UK and the EU,restrictionson artificial dyes have been in place for years.)Why the fuss over food coloring? Are natural dyes really that much better for our health?“They’re better for some people’s health,” says Jamie Alan, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University. “There is a very small percentage of children who are very sensitive to these dyes. And when they eat these dyes, they display behaviors that we sometimes associate with ADHD.”Alan stresses that there is no evidence that those kids actually develop ADHD. But research hasfoundthat after eating foods containing certain dyes, children, including those diagnosed with ADHD or autism, can show signs of hyperactivity, moodiness and inattentiveness. However many of these foods, particularly candy and soda, also contain sugar, which has also been connected to hyperactive behavior.Alan recommends that parents talk to a pediatrician and try an elimination diet to make sure the dye and not another ingredient is to blame. But she largely supports phasing out artificial dyes; most public health advocates think this is agood idea. “In my opinion,” Alan says, “because we’re talking about children and because they are a vulnerable population, I do think this is a great thing to do. But I will recognize that it is not going to impact the vast majority of the population.”One group that the change in dyes will certainly affect is the food manufacturers themselves. Switching from artificial to natural dyes is a complex process, says Travis Zissu, the co-founder and innovation lead of ScaleFoodLabs in Golden, Colorado, which offers a program to help manufacturers with the dye conversion.View image in fullscreenFroot Loops cereal, sold in Canada and made with natural dyes, left, and Froot Loops cereal, sold in the US and made with artificial dyes, on 22 May 2024.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesUnlike artificial dyes, which are derived from petroleum, natural dyes come mostly from plants: turmeric, for example, is used for yellows; algae and butterfly pea flower for blues; lycopene from carrots and tomatoes for reds. These dyes can be less stable, so Scale’s program begins with finding natural pigments that will not be affected by heat and other chemicals, followed by tests to determine which combination of dyes will produce the most reliable color. Next, Scale helps companies lock in contracts that will not force them to raise their prices too much and secure light-sensitive packaging to protect the colors. Finally, there are nine to 12 months of product testing to make sure production runs smoothly and that there are no adverse effects for consumers, such as red-dyed feces (something that has been known to happen with beet powder and extract; Alan says it’s harmless, but admits it can be unnerving).But Zissu’s biggest concern is that there won’t be enough to go around. Natural color demand is already up between 30-50% across the industry since food companies began announcing their intentions to stop using artificial color, he says, and the earliest deadline – 2027 – is still years away.“There is simply not enough supply to replace every single item in the market,” he says. “You’ll see the largest companies locking down colors soon, but there will not be enough until 2030.”There is also the worry that American consumers will reject the new colors altogether. While their counterparts in Europe, Canada and Japan have peacefully accepted the duller hues of natural dyes, Americans remain stubbornly attached to neon-bright candy and cereal.Case in point: in 2015, General Mills pledged to remove all artificial colors and flavorings from its products. The following year, it rolled out a natural version of Trix, the kid-friendly fruity breakfast cereal. But the muted Trix, colored by radishes, purple carrots and turmeric, was a flop. Customers missed the vibrant colors and complained that the new version didn’t taste right. By 2017, “classic Trix” had returned to grocery stores.On the other hand, when Kraft reformulated the powder for its macaroni and cheese and quietly began selling the all-natural version in December 2015, there was much less protest. As an Eaterheadlineat the time put it: “Kraft Changed Its Mac and Cheese and Nobody Noticed.” Perhaps it was the marketing strategy – Kraft did not bother to make a big announcement until after it had sold 50m boxes – or maybe it was because the natural dyes were just as orange as the original. (Alan recalls that her young nieces and nephews were slightly worried about the change but accepted the new mac and cheese without much fuss.)One reason consumers liked [food dyes] is because they were excited about these colors they had never seen beforeAi HisanoAs the adage goes, we eat with our eyes. The appearance of food should not change our perceptions of how it tastes, but, as anyone who has ever bought produce knows, it definitely does. In nature, brighter colors indicate that foods are ripe and will taste good. This principle also applies to human-made food.As far back as the middle ages, according to Ai Hisano, a professor of business history at the University of Tokyo and author of Visualizing Taste: How Business Changed the Look of What You Eat, dairy farmers would mix carrot juice and annatto from achiote trees into their butter to make it a more appetizing yellow. When scientists discovered petroleum-based dyes in the mid-19th century, the dairy industry was one of the earliest adopters: the artificial dyes were cheaper, and they helped create uniform yellows for butter and cheese that appealed to shoppers.Other food producers quickly followed suit. Meat would be red! Sandwich bread would be white! Oranges – which sometimes stayed green, even when they were ripe – would be orange! By the early 20th century, the US government had started regulating food coloring to make sure it didn’t kill anyone.This was also the beginning of the golden age of industrial food such as candy, breakfast cereal and, most notoriously, Jell-O, which came in colors never seen in nature. Food dye became vital for branding, Hisanowrites. Even if brighter color didn’t really affect flavor because the food was entirely manufactured, peopleperceivedthat it did, and that was what mattered. Would a beige Flamin’ Hot Cheeto taste as spicy?View image in fullscreenA box of Starburst, which is made using artificial dyes, happens to be Donald Trump’s favorite candy.Photograph: Felix Choo/Alamy“I assume many consumers in the early 20th century were frightened by those bright-red foods,” Hisanotoldthe Atlanticin 2017. “But one reason consumers liked them is because they were excited about these colors they had never seen before.” And the knowledge that they were regulated by the FDA made them feel they were safe to eat.Because the identity of their products depends on color, the most resistance to Kennedy’s initiative has come from America’s candy manufacturers. A spokesman for the National Confectioners Associationsaidthat candy makers will not adopt natural dyes until federal regulations compel them to. Of all the biggest US food companies, only Mars, maker of M&Ms, Skittles and Starburst (incidentally, Trump’sfavoritecandy), has not yet pledged to give up artificial dye, except for the already banned red 3. However, FDA commissioner Marty Makary told Fox News that he thinks Mars will come around sooner than later.Zissu, the food dye consultant, foresees “an R&D sprint” to develop natural dyes before the 2027 deadline. And indeed, since May, the FDA has approved four new natural colors – three blues and one white – for a wide range of food, including juices, milk-based meal replacements, cereal, chips, sugar and ready-to-eat chicken products.But Zissu does not think that a transition to natural dyes means that the color of food will revert to a pre-industrial dullness. “I believe we will always see the bright colors in candy and other items that consumers come to expect,” he says. “There will just be a lot more research dedicated to getting those colors if artificial [dye] is banned.”It may also help if America’s food manufacturers act en masse, as they appear to be doing: the change will be so overwhelming that, as Zissu puts it, “neon synthetics will look as dated as trans fats.” Perhaps in a few years, we will look back at green mint chip ice-cream in wonder. (Some people already do: many ice-cream producers, including Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs, don’t use green as the signifier for mint.)Inside RFK Jr’s conflicted attempt to rid America of junk foodRead moreIt seems Maha is poised to help shake America of its affair with artificial colors. But it celebrates this victory at the same time as theTrump administrationguts public health infrastructure.The ice-cream industry’s pledge came just 11 days after Congress passed a spending bill that willcut Medicaid spending, and therefore healthcare for millions of children, andslash Snapfood assistance for US families. It came the same day that the Department of Healthlaid offthousands of employees. Under Trump, the government has also cut research grants to scientistsstudying, among other things, disease prevention and vaccines (of which Kennedy is a notorious skeptic). Underlying issues such as food and housing insecurity and child poverty that devastate children’s wellbeing are likely to worsen.Alan thinks that if Kennedy is serious about improving the health of America’s kids, there are much more pressing issues than food dye to work on. “I just can’t believe that someone would be given a chance to make such an impact,” she says, “and this is what they choose to do.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryFoodUS politicsHealthIce-cream and sorbetRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It added that 64,300 vehicles were shipped to the US over both months.Before Trump’s return to the White House, the US charged a 2.5% tariff on European-made cars, while the EU had a 10% duty on vehicles imported from the US.The Volvo chief executive, Håkan Samuelsson, last week called on the EU to drop its 10% tariff, saying it was “absolutely unnecessary” in an effort to accelerate a deal with the US.However, the EU is now closing in on a deal with the USfor blanket tariffs of 15%on most goods with no special exemption for the automotive industry if a deal is struck before Trump’s 1 August deadline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the 1990s, the league saw off the challenge of the AmericanBasketballLeague (ABL), which paid higher salaries but lacked the NBA’s marketing muscle, but perhaps that victory gave the NBA and WNBA a dose of complacency. Attendance steadily dropped for several years, and went through revolving doors from city to city – or into permanent hiatus.Now, with women’s sports in the middle of a growth spurt and the dazzling skills ofCaitlin Clarkon display, the WNBA has an age-old issue: More money, more problems – or, at least, more critics conjuring up more questions.In All-Star voting, WNBA players ranked Caitlin Clark ninth. Is that absurd?We live in a media landscape in which the fretting over “generational talents” is so robust that NBA fans started panicking aboutCooper Flaggwhen he had a poor shooting performancein his first Summer League game. As anyone knows from following her college career, she doesn’t just have extraordinary shooting range. She can dominate a game with her passing even if her shots aren’t falling.To be sure, Clark certainly has a lot of work to do before she turns the corner from being the league’smost excitingplayer to becoming the league’sbestplayer. In her rookie year,Basketball Reference calculatedher PER, a measure of overall effectiveness, at 18.8, nowhere near the top four of A’ja Wilson (34.9), Breanna Stewart (26.4), Brittney Griner (26.0) and Napheesa Collier (25.1).But PER tends to favor forwards and centers – such Clark’s Indiana teammate, 2023 top overall draft pick Aliyah Boston, who was also ahead of Clark. Among guards, she was third. She also led the league in assists per game with 8.4, with only Alyssa Thomas (7.9) anywhere close. On the other hand, she also led the league in turnovers with a staggering mark of 5.6 per game – Thomas again was second at 3.6.This year, Clark is struggling with injuries, and most of her scoring and shooting numbers have dropped significantly. Given the ridiculously short window of aWNBAseason, she may not have time to pull her season averages up to where they were last year.The WNBA actually has a trio of young “generational talent” guards who have come into the league in the 2020s. The first was Sabrina Ionescu, a record-smashing triple-double machine from Oregon who had a slow, injury-riddled start to her pro career but has since made the All-WNBA second team three straight years – and surely had a case to make the first team ahead of Clark last year. The next is Paige Bueckers, who is putting together a rookie season almost on par with Clark’s season last year. In a year or two, depending on when she declares for the draft, the WNBA will add USC’s JuJu Watkins.In the media and player All-Star voting, the leader was Bueckers’ teammate in Dallas, Allisha Gray. Funny how they don’t seem to be held responsible for the Wings being in last place, and yet critics harp on Clark because Indiana isn’t dominating.So the fans got it wrong in ranking Clark first and Ionescu fifth. But the players’ votes were harsh on stars (Clark) and Olympians (Jackie Young was 12th; Kelsey Plum a bewildering 16th). For once, the media may have gotten it right, ranking her third.Truth or fiction: TruthIs the league too dependent on Clark?In a recent anonymous survey of WNBA by the Athletic, a majority of respondents said Clark will be the face of the WNBA in five years. But it was a slim majority of 53.8%. Watkins was second, Bueckers was third. Next was the first non-guard, Clark nemesis Angel Reese, and A’ja Wilson, who was merely the MVP of the WNBA (for the third time)andthe Olympics in 2024.And yet the WNBA is headed toward its highest average attendance ever (see below), propelled somewhat by Clark but also by the fervor behind the expansion Golden State Valkyries. While ratingscertainly dropwhen she’s out injured, they don’t fall through the floor.Perhaps the fact that Clark has not immediately established herself as the best player in the league has made people realize that veterans like Wilson, Stewart, Griner, Collier and Ionescu know how to play some ball, too.Truth or fiction: FictionThe lack of dunking holds back the leagueIn the cartoon Futurama, a female computer is horrified to learn that the men who have landed on an all-women’s planet made fun of women’s basketball.“What??! Did you explain how the women’s good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk?” roars the computer, voiced by Bea Arthur.The men scoffed at the concept. But WNBA players’ fundamentals are indeed pretty good, most notably free throws – the NBA’shighestoverall percentage of the past 10 years (78.4%, 2023-24) trails behind the WNBA’slowest(78.5%, 2024, down from 80.0% the year before and 80.8% in 2021).The WNBA is also more of a passing league than the NBA, which sees its stars shine in one-on-one isolations. In 2024, 68.6% of field goals in WNBA play were the result of assists. In the NBA last season, the number was 63.6%.In the NBA, you may see Anthony Edwards explode past a defender for a dunk. In the WNBA, you may see Caitlin Clark whip a pass through a seam mere mortals wouldn’t have anticipated. True basketball fans appreciate both, and the US has a lot of true basketball fans.Truth or fiction: FictionIs the WNBA plagued by substandard refereeing?WNBA officials have had their share of detractors this year, among them standout playersAngel Reese(Chicago) andKelsey Plum(Los Angeles), coachesNatalie Nakase(Golden State) and Stephanie White (Indiana).The latter’s criticism followed a game against the Connecticut Sun in which Clark was poked in the eye in the third quarter, and Clark’s assailant was fouled near the end of the game with the outcome not in doubt, prompting a scuffle that saw three people ejected.White’s complaint was a familiar refrain: “The referees lost control of the game.”Did they?The eye poke on Clark drew a flagrant foul on Connecticut’s Jacy Sheldon, while Clark and two Connecticut players got technical fouls for the ensuing fracas. In the last minute, Sheldon drove into Indiana’s Sophie Cunningham, who pulled Sheldon down onto the floor.View image in fullscreenThe Indiana Fever and their fans have embraced the notion that Sophie Cunningham, above, has filled the role of an NHL enforcer.Photograph: Matt Krohn/Getty ImagesCunninghamcouldargue that Sheldon initiated the contact by lowering her shoulder and charging into her like a running back or rugby player, and that she accidentally pulled down Sheldon while stumbling backwards. But she and the Fever have embraced the notion that Cunninghamfilled the roleof an NHL enforcer, protecting their star player when the refs wouldn’t. Cunningham’s jersey sales went through the roof, and entrepreneurs are sellingcommemorative T-shirtsin her honor.Maybe the WNBA has found a new source of revenue?WNBA refs are paid far less than their NBA counterparts, so no one should be surprised if the men’s league attracts more experienced referees. But the refs aren’t the ones escalating things even after the flagrant and technical fouls have been called.And NBA refs aren’t exactly above reproach. Even if we toss out the aberration of Tim Donaghy, the referee who spent time in prison after a gambling scandal, NBA referees have been the object of many fine-worthy infractions through the years. Anthony Edwards’ fines in a single season could pay several WNBA players’ salaries.Should WNBA refs do more to protect stars like Clark so that Cunningham won’t feel compelled to do it herself? Maybe. But they’d also do well to avoid the absurdity of the 1990s, when the mere act of trying to guard Michael Jordan could draw a whistle.Truth or fiction: MixedThat’s not the easiest set of questions, and it’s just part of the league’s to-do list right now. The WNBA has to manage expansion carefully while also landing a fair collective bargaining agreement to prevent a work stoppage.But these are also happier questions to consider than “Will the league survive the season?”Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballCaitlin ClarkIndiana FeverNew York LibertyUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The walkout, which union leaders say is the first in Fenway Park’s 113-year history, follows more than a year of contract negotiations and months of escalating frustration over pay, job security and automation.High school star Ethan Holliday agrees record $9m signing bonus with RockiesRead moreIn addition to higher wages, one of the biggest sticking points has been the rise of self-service machines that Aramark installed at Fenway in 2023. The company added six Mashgin units – AI-powered kiosks that dispense beer and popcorn without the need for human staff – and Local 26 members say the machines threaten to erode the fan experience and replace workers altogether. Similar technology has already spread to 20 of the 30 ballparks across Major League Baseball and thousands of other venues nationwide.US senator Bernie Sanders, who spoke with union members during a recent Zoom call, weighed in with a public letter to Aramark CEO John Zillmer and Red Sox principal owner John Henry, urging them to support “living wages” and “human interaction” at the ballpark. “If Aramark can afford to pay you $18.7 million in compensation and provide nearly $100 million in dividends for your wealthy shareholders,” Sanders wrote to Zillmer, “it can afford to pay all of your workers a living wage and not threaten to take away their jobs and their income with faceless Mashgin touchscreen computers.”With no deal reached by the deadline, the union went on strike at noon on Friday, rallying behind demands for “living wages, guardrails on technology and R-E-S-P-E-C-T!”The most recent bargaining session between Aramark and the union took place last Tuesday, but the two sides remain far apart on key issues. In a statement, Aramark expressed disappointment over the strike and said it had “contingency plans in place to ensure that fans will not encounter service interruptions”. The company added it remained willing to bargain in good faith.With the Red Sox and Dodgers scheduled to start at 7.10pm local time, union officials had a message for fans attending this high-profile series: “We’re asking you to NOT buy concessions inside the ballpark,” Local 26 wrote on social media. “Tailgate before the games!”Union workers walked the picket line outside Fenway wearing green T-shirts that read “FENWAY WORKERS ON STRIKE” and carried signs shaped like baseballs bearing the Local 26 logo.Because concession work at Fenway is seasonal, union leaders acknowledged that a prolonged indefinite strike would pose hardships for many part-time workers. For now, the plan is to remain off the job through the weekend. The Red Sox head out of town Monday for a three-game road trip in Minnesota, before returning for a six-game homestand in August.In an open letter this week, Local 26 called on Henry and Fenway Sports Group to step in and pressure Aramark to deliver “reasonable proposals” that reflect the workers’ value. “Mr Henry, Fenway Park is your house,” the letter said. “We’re asking you … to intervene.”Explore more on these topicsBoston Red SoxUS unionsBostonUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Oliver Mintzlaff, the managing director of Red Bull’s parent company, Red Bull GmbH, was in attendance, a relatively rare occurrence and indicative of the sea change that has taken place, with Mintzlaff the ultimate victor in his power struggle with Horner.Mintzlaff, for such a key player, is anonymous enough to slip in and out of the paddock all but unnoticed. Not so Max Verstappen’s father, Jos, and his manager, Raymond Vermeulen, who arrived flanked by photographers who caught the relaxed and contented air emanating from both men, with Verstappen Sr in particular having long-lobbied against Horner.Helmut Marko, the head of motor sport and a Verstappen ally, duly took his place too as all of Red Bull’s power players came to oversee Mekies’s first race in charge and Red Bull’s first without Horner in control.Inside the team the personnel are without doubt undergoing a period of adjustment; for all the politicking Horner was well liked and sadness at his departure had been expressed by many.Paul Monaghan, Red Bull’s chief engineer, whom Horner recruited in his first year in charge in 2005, reflected what many were feeling about both past and future. “It was a shock to me and it was sad, Christian’s put a large chunk of his working life into the team,” Monaghan said.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen enjoyed a good start to his weekend at Spa by qualifying second for the sprint race.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“Laurent has got quite a difficult situation to be dropped in. So now it’s up to us to pull together as a team because nine other teams can’t wait to fight us. So if we’re going to stand up to them, we have to stand as a team.”The business as usual approach is intended to steady the ship and the management that ousted Horner are backing Mekies to do so. It is understood he is, as team principal and chief executive, being given full rein to do as he sees fit and is not considered in any way a caretaker manager, while Mintzlaff is expected to remain hands-off, although whether that remains the case might depend on quite how Mekies performs.Certainly in one key area, that of the relationship between the team and the Verstappen camp, tensions have eased after Horner’s dismissal.Whether Verstappen stays with Red Bull, however, still remains up in the air and he and his father’s attitude will surely be tempered by performance; the pressure is on Mekies from the off.The Frenchman said in Spa that he had been given no reason for Horner’s dismissal but that the former team principal had been in touch and offered his support to Mekies, who felt morale remained strong at Red Bull despite the upheaval. “The first 24 hours was a big adjustment, because nobody was expecting it,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After that, I’ve only found a huge amount of support from everyone, they just want to go racing.”The task facing him is immense not least in taking over the project of next year’s car being built to the biggest regulation change in over a decade and Red Bull’s first foray into building their own engines.These are long-term considerations around which he can still exert an influence, but for the moment the focus is narrow which may be to the Frenchman’s advantage.The nature ofFormula Oneand its relentless march forward means a win for Verstappen would go an enormously long way to easing the pressure and beginning the process of putting the past to bed and building anew.Certainly Verstappen has fine form here, Spa is a circuit he enjoys and with a host of upgrades for this race including a revised front wing he might be hopeful of making a decent fist of things under the new management but it is the dominant McLarens that look likely to once more hold the advantage.In qualifying for Saturday’s sprint race Oscar Piastri claimed pole with a mighty lap, a full half a second clear of Verstappen in second and his McLaren teammate Lando Norris in third. Lewis Hamilton finished in 18th having spun off on his hot lap in Q3.Explore more on these topicsRed BullFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

US president Donald Trump has banned travel to the United States from 12 other countries, citing national security concerns.Earlier in the month, the Cuban women’s volleyball team was denied visas to participate in a tournament in Puerto Rico.“They told us that Venezuela is on a list because Trump says Venezuelans are a threat to the security of his state, of his country,” said Kendrick Gutiérrez, the league’s president in Venezuela. “It hasn’t been easy the situation; we earned the right to represent Latin America in the World Championship.”The Senior League Baseball World Series, a tournament for players aged 13-16, is played each year in Easley, South Carolina. It begins Saturday.The tournament organizers replaced the Venezuelans with the Santa Maria de Aguayo team from Tamaulipas, Mexico, the team that was a runner-up in the Latin American championship.“I think this is the first time this has happened, but it shouldn’t end this way. They’re going to replace us with another team because relations have been severed; it’s not fair,” Gutiérrez added. “I don’t understand why they put Mexico in at the last minute and left Venezuela out.”Explore more on these topicsBaseballVenezuelaUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The race leader, Tadej Pogacar, untroubled by any meaningful attacks, maintained his overall lead fromJonas Vingegaard.The victorious Ineos Grenadiers rider, whose team have been fielding questions overa staff member involved in an anti-doping investigationrelated to their glorious days as Team Sky, was taking his second victory in the race.Tour de France 2025: Pogacar and Vingegaard break on final stage 19 climb to La Plagne – liveRead moreBut it was a disappointing stage for Scotland’s Oscar Onley, who after surviving almost everything that the Tour could throw at him, fell away from the podium positions in the closing moments, after third-placed Florian Lipowitz attacked to move clear with Pogacar and second-placed Vingegaard.With only 22sec between them, Onley and Lipowitz were inseparable for most of the stage, but, when Pogacar launched his first attack with seven kilometres to go, Lipowitz struggled to follow. However the German subsequently turned the tables on Onley, taking another 40sec on the young Scot at the line to further secure a probable third-place finish in his debut Tour.Ahead of them, Arensman, winner in thePyrenean stage to Superbagnèreswas hoping to replicate that success with another summit finish stage win, but as he entered the final two kilometres his lead began tumbling.Yet the grimacing Dutch rider hung on to win by only two seconds as Vingegaard, who had said he would risk all to win the race, finally attacked Pogacar in the last kilometre to finish just ahead of him.“I’m absolutely destroyed,” a drained Arensman said after the stage. “Already to win one stage in the Tour, unbelievable. But now, to win from the general classification group, against the strongest riders in the world, feels like I’m dreaming.”Arensman said that his lack of interest in the overall standings had fed into his decision to attack. “I started the climb with the lead group and I was: ‘I have no GC [interest], maybe I should just try, maybe they will look at each other.’”Of his series of accelerations, he said: “I didn’t take no for an answer … It was Tadej and Jonas. Everybody knows they are the strongest in the world, they are almost aliens. I just can’t believe I beat them today.”The stage, originally scheduled to be 130km over four climbs was truncated in length by almost 40km, after a cull of infected cows led to the removal of two climbs, the Côte d’Héry-sur-Ugine and the Col des Saisies.Lipowitz’s Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team had clearly intended to test Onley’s resolve and when Primoz Roglic attacked on the descent of the Cormet de Roselend, the tactic isolated the 22-year-old Onley even further.As cold rain fell on the valley road to La Plagne and UAE Team Emirates XRG gave chase, Roglic’s advantage ebbed away, until he was caught and summarily dispatched at the foot of the final climb.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anything is, of course, still possible, particularly on Sunday’s final stage through Paris, which replicates the Paris 2024 road race and includes three laps of the Côte de la Butte Montmartre.Asked if that stage might present another opportunity to win, the race leader sounded dismissive. “I hope I just come to Paris with the yellow jersey,” Pogacar said. “I don’t feel like super-energised right now to think about racing on Sunday.

An England victory would be an even bigger achievement than when they won Euro 2022, because this is a harder final than the oneagainst Germany at Wembley.England should be the favourites purely because they are the holders and have had the experience of winning it. Their belief that they can always get back into a game, no matter how indifferent they’ve been, is the one thing that stands out about England. Sometimes it pays to be lucky rather than good, but we shouldn’t dismiss that or talk it down. Their resilience is their superpower, and although they haven’t always been free-flowing, they’ve found ways to win, which is down to the character of the players and, most importantly, the ‘finishers’ from the bench demonstrating that England havea lot of quality and depth.That does not mean Sarina Wiegman should necessarily change her starting team because, as good asMichelle’s Agyemang’s impacthas been with her three goals in four caps, it is another jump up to do it from the start. There is so much a starting centre-forward has to do other than score goals, including to set the press, and Alessia Russo knows that role inside out. I cannot see Sarina changing that, and the strategy of players coming from the bench is working, even if the time for them to make an impact is getting shorter and shorter.We sometimes say “your name’s written on something” when things go in your favour: a bounce of the ball, a referee’s decision, that little rub of the green. England are scraping over the line and that may take them all the way, but this is their biggest test yet. Although Italy were good, they’re not at Spain’s level.Quick GuideEngland v Spain: past three meetingsShowSpain 2-1 England, 3 June 2025, BarcelonaEngland were knocked out of the  Nations League after going ahead through Alessia Russo in the 21st minute. In the second half, Spain’s Clàudia Pina made an instant impact from the bench, scoring two minutes after coming on, then doubling her tally 10 minutes later as Spain secured victory. The Lionesses would have qualified for the semi-finals at Spain’s expense with a win.England 1-0 Spain, 26 Feb 2025, LondonA Wembley crowd of 46,550 watched England defeat Spain in the teams' first meeting since the World Cup final, in Nations League A Group 3. Jess Park’s 33rd-minute goal  secured victory for the Lionesses. Lucía García’s first-half attempt that rattled the crossbar and second-half chances for the winger Salma Paralluelo were the highlights of Spain's attacking play but England held on.Spain 1-0 England, 20 August 2023, SydneySpain became world champions with a dominant performance. Lauren Hemp hit the bar from outside of the box early on but that was the pinnacle of England’s first-half chances and Olga Carmona ensured Spain went into the break ahead with a clinical finish past Mary Earps. Earps produced a fantastic 70th-minute penalty save from Jenni Hermoso and made further stops to keep England in the game but Spain deserved their win.Eze ObasiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Spain’s route to the final has been relatively uneventful compared with England’s. The world champions have controlled the vast majority of possession. Teams do get big chances against them, though, because they commit such numbers going forward. They leave space behind them because of their playing style, and that’s where their vulnerabilities are, down the sides of their centre-backs, as Germany’s chancesin their semi-finalshowed. Belgiumscored twiceagainst Spain and could have scored more,Italy scored against themand there’s a vulnerability to Spain that did not exist a few years ago, so the opportunity to score against them is greater.Sunday’s contest depends on who Spain start with, because when they play Clàudia Pina and Mariona Caldentey, they’re not pacey players who are going to get in behind. Is Montse Tomé going to start with a team that will dominate the ball but won’t stretch England in behind? Or will she start with the pace of a Salma Paralluelo? That is interesting, because Spain have often been kept at bay for quite a while – their knockout matches were both 0-0 at half-time – but when games become more stretched, their chances grow.View image in fullscreenAitana Bonmatí has been instrumental for Spain in the latter stages.Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SheKicks/SPP/ShutterstockThere have been distinct differences watching Spain this year. I’ve never seen Aitana Bonmatí so wide, and that’s because of having Alexia Putellas in the 10 position. But it means you get situations such as Bonmatí’s winning goal in the semi-final, which was 100% a shot. Ann-Katrin Bergerhas demonstratedthroughout the tournament she’s a world-class goalkeeper, but she has a tendency to step forward and leave a small gap at the near post, and I don’t think many players can score that goal. Aitana scores it because she’s Aitana. That was genius play and crucial because Berger is the best goalkeeper in the world at saving penalties, so the smart money would have been on Germany in a shootout.In terms of Spain’s threats, what I find fascinating is they are very good at set pieces. They’re well rehearsed. We always talk about Spain’s quality in possession but their quality out of possession is the best in the world. They’re the best counter-pressers. Oh my God, they’re unbelievable. And because they have a system and shape that puts bodies in such close proximity, it means if you can’t break out of the sides of their press, they just swarm you again and again and again. They don’t get the credit they deserve for the amount of defensive effort they put in. Their total team game is exceptional. And I’ve studied them, trust me.There has been up and down in England’s results over the past 18 months but Sarina is a smart woman, a world-class manager who’s been there before. The team’s resilience is key. They were 90 seconds from going out against Italy and it looked as if the luck had run out, but it hadn’t.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In my last year when we shouldn’t have won the title because Manchester City should have, you can sit there and say: “Oh, is that because Man City blew it?” Well, we still had togo and win it. If you score one more goal than your opponent, you’re the winner. This isn’t a game of fairness and Englandsimply scored more goalsthan Italy.View image in fullscreenSarina is a smart women, a world-class manager who’s been there before.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APSpain are prolific but I expect a close game. There may be moments for England and then complete Spanish dominance, but that doesn’t mean Spain will win. Just because you’re not the most dominant team doesn’t mean you cannot win. England must use all their experience.Overall, this has been a tournament about goalkeepers and the rise of so many good ones. Berger, Italy’s Laura Giuliani andEngland’s Hannah Hamptonhave stood out. This has also been a tournament about the strength of teams’ benches, because there has been much more quality from substitutes for so many teams. It is going to be a great final in Basel and a great showcase for the sport.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSpain women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

We don’t know yet [if she’ll be ready], but that’s what we’re going to go for – [aiming for] 23 players available for the game on Sunday.”The Arsenal forward Beth Mead, who replaced James on Tuesday, could be in line to start if James is unavailable and the super-sub Chloe Kelly could also be under consideration.Ella Toone has predicted that another super-sub,Michelle Agyemang, will experience a significant change to her life when England return home after the striker’s starring role in the run to the final, but Toone has praised the 19-year-old’s maturity in her debut tournament.When England won Euro 2022 on home soil Toone came on to score in knockout games against Spain and Germany. This summer, Agyemang has stepped up with late equalisers against Sweden and Italy to save England’s campaign.“She might get papped eating a pasty like I did! I’ll have to warn her about that,” Toone said with a chuckle. “She’s definitely in the [team] bubble now, but I think when she gets out she’ll be recognised a lot more than she was before the tournament, that’s for sure, and she definitely deserves that as well.“It’s mad, I would think she’s about 30 years old, she’s so mature. She’s so humble. She’s coming to this tournament with freedom, not a worry, not a care. She’s just gone out there and done what’s been asked of her.“She’s been amazing for us. She’s turned up in big moments when we’ve needed her. She’s got a lot of talent and she can do a lot of things that not many players can do. Even when she scored and kept us in games, she’s been the same Michelle that she was when she started this tournament. I’m absolutely buzzing for her. It’s nice for good people to get things that they deserve and she’s definitely one of those people.”View image in fullscreenElla Toone (left) with Michelle Agyemang after the striker’s match-saving goal against Italy.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APEngland are contesting their third consecutive major final, which Toone described as “something the country can be proud of”. Toone thanked England’s fans for their support. “The fans at home, we’ve probably given them a heart attack,” she said, but she hopes the Lionesses’ fighting comebacks and spirit can help them in the final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ll have that togetherness to hopefully get over the line.”Wiegman is in her third straight Euros final and her fifth major final in a row, a sequence that began with winning the 2017 Euros with the Netherlands. Toone praised the Dutchwoman’s team talks, saying: “We had a good one before the Italy game, the night before in the meeting, one that definitely stood out. Then again before the game. Sarina’s speeches before the games have definitely got us motivated.“Even though sometimes we have gone a goal down, you still remember the words that she said before the game and it makes you want to go out and put on a performance for the second half as well. She’s been pulling them out of the bag. No matter what Sarina says, you listen, because she’s reached five major tournament finals so she definitely knows what she’s doing.”Toone also knows what to do in big games, having scored in an FA Cup final, a World Cup semi-final, the Women’s Finalissima at Wembley against Brazil and most famously when she opened the scoring in 2022’s Euros final against Germany with her lobbed effort. “Hopefully there’s a chance that I can put it in the back of the net like I have done in previous finals,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamLauren JamesWomen's footballWomen’s Euro 2025newsShareReuse this content"

This is her usual state, calm, and as England prepare for a third major tournament final, against Spain on Sunday, and Wiegman’s fifth consecutive major final, it’s what they need.Asked to look back on her own development during four whirlwind years in charge, she is reflective. “As every person in this room develops, I develop too, with experiences,” she says. “First my English has improved, so I understand a lot more, but also you learn more about the people you work with. You learn more again about yourself and how you respond to things and, while I’m always working on developing the team and developing or trying to help the development of people, I always try to keep developing myself.England v Spain: where the Women’s Euro 2025 final could be won or lostRead more“What I’ve really wanted to do over all these years is try to enjoy it all a little bit more. You have to be focused in this job, you have to be focused but you need to celebrate the moments that are good, it’s really nice.”The midfielder Keira Walsh said the manager has been incredibly consistent during her time at the helm. “She probably shows her excitement a little bit more after games than she used to do,” she said. “When you see on the side she’s dancing and singing and we didn’t see that so much when she first came in. But, in terms of how she delivers tactics and how she manages, I think she is very, very similar.“She’s probably one of the best managers I’ve played for in terms of trying to make everyone feel loved. It’s a really, really difficult job when you’re in a tournament, and obviously people want to play, people aren’t, but she really, really cares about the human side. Another thing that you notice when you play for her is how calm she is. It makes a massive difference in the 95th minute when you’re losing 1-0, and you look to the side and she’s very calm. That speaks volumes of her as a manager.”Wiegman smiles at the mention of her celebrations when Walsh’s comments are relayed to her. “That comes from these performances, of course. It’s so intense. Of course I look very calm, but when the whistle goes and we score a goal and we change the game, when you have one minute left or 10 seconds left, of course that is emotional.”View image in fullscreen‘It makes a massive difference when you’re losing 1-0, and you look to the side and she’s very calm’Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockThe manager has perhaps had more scrutiny in the buildup to this tournament than at any other point during her time with England. Performances have been questioned and the sudden retirements of Mary Earps and Fran Kirby plus the withdrawal of Millie Bright from selection, was cause for concern.“In this environment you have challenges all the time,” says Wiegman. “Before the World Cup, we had challenges with players who were injured. Of course, we prepare a lot and we know the players really well. We think of scenarios: ‘Who is the first player to select? Who is the second?’ You’re prepared for challenges. The challenge ahead of the tournament is the same for an injured player or a player who is not available. You have to move on to what you want and who is ready to compete.”Wiegman’s directness has at times rubbed players up the wrong way, particularly in the Netherlands, but she is pragmatic in her approach: if you add value to the team, you are in, if you don’t or don’t anymore, you are moved on. With time, wins and the authority that comes with them, players are more easily brought on board with her approach on and off the pitch.She’s probably one of the best managers I’ve played for in terms of trying to make everyone feel lovedKeira WalshAnd, regardless of some former Dutch players having expressed frustrations in the past, there are many that will speak about the impact of that human approach.The former Netherlands and Ado den Haag player Rianne Schorel is one of them. Schorel has nothing but love for Wiegman, despite having lost contact with her former manager since she was forced from the game due to a head injury that took 10 years to recover from. Wiegman’s attention to player welfare and her support for Schorel was hugely appreciated by the former player both at the time and still is today.The chief executive of the Football Association, Mark Bullingham, picked that characteristic out as a key reason as to why she is so special.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Really stressing that everyone’s in it together is critical and I think she’s really helped build a very, very strong culture, not just amongst players but the whole support team.”View image in fullscreen‘She’s really helped build a very, very strong culture, not just amongst players but the whole support team’Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/EPAOften players refer to her as being like a mum. “Yeah …”, says an unsure Wiegman. “Sometimes when people talk about ‘the girls’ I think: ‘Do they mean my daughters or do they mean my team?’ So, that’s tricky, I’m kind of a caring person. I care about them but at the same time I’m the coach, I’m making hard decisions at the moment so sometimes you have to leave that caring and leave it up to them. They’re grown-up women, but a mum should care.”Regardless of subjective opinions on England’s run to the final, Wiegman’s record speaks for itself and is an objective fact. “She’s just a very special coach and I think there are teams here that have got good players that haven’t made it through to a final,” added Bullingham. “We have got good players but so have some other countries. She’s performed so well at the highest level, keeping that calm composure, keeping the connection with the players and managing the games really well.”Schorel, having gone to play college football in the US before returning to the Netherlands, remembers Wiegman talking to her about calming down, taking some intensity out of her game and not overworking. This is familiar to those that have covered England for some time because that is the same message she came into the job delivering.Leah Williamson most recently reflected on that time: “The English are known for having a certain type of mentality – a fight about us. Historically we’ve maybe been quite a defensive team. I remember one of the first things she said was: ‘Just slow down’, she wanted us to focus on the football.” Though Wiegman and the Lionesses stand on the verge of more records and more history, the personal acclaim is something she is uncomfortable with.“Yeah, I do find that awkward,” she says. “Of course, I find it very special too, but I do believe that everyone plays his or her part in the success. What I’m trying to do is bring people together in the best possible way, players and staff, and the people around me are really, really good. If they perform at their highest level, then the chance of winning a game is the highest possible. That’s what I’m trying to do. I think I’m pretty good at bringing people together, but without the quality, you’re not going to win a tournament.“So, you need very good players, the support staff, the environment we’ve created, how we can do recovery, how we can do the gym sessions with players, the pitch, which is perfect to train on. There’s so many things that make us who we are now.”Explore more on these topicsSarina WiegmanWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are five key areas where the game could be decidedSophie Downeyin BaselFri 25 Jul 2025 09.25 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 15.48 EDTShareMidfield battleSpain’s domination in the middle of the park, in and out of possession, is what contributed significantly totheir victory over Englandat the World Cup in 2023. The trio of Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas and Patri Guijarro are very technical and comfortable on the ball and create midfield rotations. Guijarro is instrumental, allowing the other two to make their runs and finding the passes to cut through defensive lines. In thesemi-final against Germany, she completed more passes than anyone else. How England set up their midfield will be crucial. Their Nations League victory in February was down in large part to the selfless work rate of Ella Toone, Grace Clinton and Keira Walsh, who at times had to sacrifice the creative aspects of the game to close the midfield spaces, cut off the passing triangles that Spain love and prevent them from having free rein to roam through the thirds.England’s left-side frailtiesThe left side of England’s defence has been targeted throughout the tournament. Remember Delphine Cascarino for France, Stina Blackstenius and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd for Sweden and Sofia Cantore for Italy. England have not looked comfortable there, no matter who has been selected to start. Ona Batlle and Mariona Caldentey will be licking their lips at the prospect of imposing themselves early on Alex Greenwood and whoever is chosen at left centre-back. England tend to be caught high in that area and will need to be extremely disciplined and perhaps sit a little deeper to stop themselves being exposed to the pace of Spain. It also raises the question about whether Sarina Wiegman could start with a three at the back to try to add more protection and pack their box with numbers when Spain break.Quick GuideEngland v Spain: past three meetingsShowSpain 2-1 England, 3 June 2025, BarcelonaEngland were knocked out of the  Nations League after going ahead through Alessia Russo in the 21st minute. In the second half, Spain’s Clàudia Pina made an instant impact from the bench, scoring two minutes after coming on, then doubling her tally 10 minutes later as Spain secured victory. The Lionesses would have qualified for the semi-finals at Spain’s expense with a win.England 1-0 Spain, 26 Feb 2025, LondonA Wembley crowd of 46,550 watched England defeat Spain in the teams' first meeting since the World Cup final, in Nations League A Group 3. Jess Park’s 33rd-minute goal  secured victory for the Lionesses.

Earps produced a fantastic 70th-minute penalty save from Jenni Hermoso and made further stops to keep England in the game but Spain deserved their win.Eze ObasiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England’s distribution from the backIt is unlikely England will see much of the ball, either by design or by Spain’s ability to dominate possession. Therefore, the Lionesses must make sure they take their opportunities when they fall. One way to do this is to bypass midfield and set players such as Alessia Russo and Lauren Hemp away with crossfield passes and by going route one over the top. In Hannah Hampton, they possess one of the best distributors in the goalkeeping game. Her pass to Russo in England’s second match took out 95% of the Netherlands team for Lauren James’s opener and she is constantly hitting Lucy Bronze and Greenwood on the sidelines as she sets off England’s attacking play. Equally, Leah Williamson is one of the best ball-playing centre-backs and has registered the most accurate long balls per 90 minutes of anyone in the competition.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson is one of the best ball-playing centre-backs at the tournament.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockKey match-upsHemp against Batlle will be an eye-catching contest down England’s left. Both are lightning quick; in fact, Batlle has registered the tournament’s highest top speed at 30.5 km/h. Spain’s right-back likes to push high, which Hemp will have to be aware of defensively, but it is a strong option for England to hit on the transition and exploit the space left in behind. Irene Paredes and Russo know each other very well having come face-to-face inthis year’s Champions League final. Russo’s intelligence and energy in the press are among her strongest assets and she closed down Paredes exceptionally throughout. The Spain defender loves time on the ball and is the most accurate passer in the competition. The England forward can break through at pace, something Spain have not looked altogether comfortable with. Equally at the other end the new defensive unit of Williamson and either Esme Morgan or Jess Carter will have to be alert to deal with the direct threat of Esther González. One more to keep an eye on is Walsh v Bonmatí in midfield – two players who know each other’s strengths and weaknesses well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The options Wiegman has at her disposal give her a variety of ways to change a game. Michelle Agyemanghas caught the headlineswith two late goals from the bench that have arguably kept the Lionesses in the competition. Chloe Kelly is a big impact player whose delivery from wide areas is second to none and Aggie Beever-Jones is one of the most instinctive finishers. It is also the versatility of the players that serves Wiegman well; their ability to do a job wherever needed. Beth Mead played in every midfield position after coming on for James against Italy and applied herself with aptitude. Montse Tomé has finishers of her own. Athenea del Castillo has come on twice to change a match,scoring against Switzerlandand setting up Bonmatí’s extra-time winner against Germany. Salma Paralluelo is another who has that ability, hitting tired defences with her pace late on.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSpain women's football teamWomen's footballFootball tacticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old West Ham midfielder faced a lengthy ban after being charged in May last year with four counts of deliberately getting himself booked to influence betting markets so that friends and family members might benefit.The Football Association also brought two charges against the Brazilian of failing to cooperate withthe investigation, which opened in August 2023 and related to four yellow cards that he received for West Ham in Premier League matches between November 2022 and August 2023. He could have faced a life ban if found guilty.Newcastle’s Alexander Isak offered £600,000-a-week tax-free deal by Al-HilalRead morePaquetá was on the brink of an £85m move to Manchester City when the investigation was started – it fell down when West Ham briefed City about the situation – and he has since “been living this nightmare for two years” in the words of his wife, Maria Fournier.It appears that nightmare is almost over. A regulatorycommission finally convened to hear the caseon 17 March, retiring to consider its verdict in early June, and it is understood it has delivered a favourable verdict for Paquetá, who cost West Ham a club-record £51m when he joined from Lyon in August 2022. He has always maintained his innocence and been supported by West Ham, arguing he knew nothing about the bets placed on him and that the FA’s evidence was circumstantial.“I am extremely surprised and upset that the FA has decided to charge me,” Paquetá said upon hearing of the charges in May last year. “For nine months, I have cooperated with every step of their investigation and provided all the information I can. I deny the charges in their entirety and will fight with every breath to clear my name.”Three of the yellow cards that drew suspicion came in the 2022-23 season, the first for a late tackle on Leicester’s Boubakary Soumaré in a 2-0 home defeat in November 2022. West Ham were 1-0 down at the time of the offence in the 60th minute.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The second was for a scything foul on Aston Villa’s John McGinn in the 70th minute of a 1-1 home draw in March 2023 – it was 1-1 at the time – and the third was for a trip on Leeds’s Crysencio Summerville to stop a counterattack. It was the 65th minute and the score at the London Stadium was 1-1. West Ham would win 3-1.The authorities had been alerted to suspicious betting patterns and the tipping point for them came in the first game of the following season when Paquetá was booked in stoppage-time at Bournemouth with the score 1-1, which is how the game would end. Again, more suspicious betting activity was detected.Most of the suspicious bets were traced to Paquetá Island off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, where Paquetá was born and from which he takes his name. About 60 bets were placed on him to be shown a yellow card in the games in question. A source with knowledge of the FA’s investigation said that one of the bets was for £7, with the highest £400. Paquetá did not place any bets himself.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

It hadn’t seemed a particularly significant game: the second leg of alast-32 Europa League tie against Midtjyllandon a chilly and cloudy February night. Old Trafford was far from full, the disillusionment that was beginning to stalk Louis van Gaal escalating after a 2-1 first-leg defeat.It soon got worse for United as Pione Sisto increased Midtjylland’s advantage. An own goal pulled one back only for Juan Mata to miss a penalty before half-time. But Rashford then slammed in a Mata cutback and converted a Guillermo Varela cross with a side-foot volley to give United the lead. They ended up winning 5-1. In the space of 12 second-half minutes, Rashford had been elevated from almost complete unknown to potential messiah, a status he confirmed three days later by scoring two and setting up another ina win over Arsenal. He was 18, Manchester-born, confident but understated. It was almost too perfect.Barcelona confirm Marcus Rashford loan from Manchester United with buy optionRead moreWhat then would have seemed a plausible future? What would he have taken had fate offered? One hundred goals for United? Two hundred? A Champions League? Given that was before Gareth Southgate had become England manager, perhaps dreams of winning a major international tournament would have seemed far-fetched, but 20 goals for his country? Thirty?Yet here we are nine years on, with Rashford unwanted at Old Trafford andjoining Barcelona on loan. He has scored 87 league goals for United and picked up two FA Cups, two League Cups and a Europa League. And while he was part of the side that was second at Euro 2020, the achievement is inevitably tainted by the fact that he hit the post with his penaltyin the shootout; three inches to the right, it would have been a goal and England would have led the shootout 3-2 with the pressure firmly on Italy.It’s a perfectly decent career, but there is an unavoidable sense of anticlimax, particularly over the past couple of seasons. Having scored 30 goals in all competitions for United in 2022-23, when he also got three in the World Cup, Rashford has scored just 19 over the past two years, four of them on loan at Aston Villa. He has often looked disaffected, the headlines about his off-field activities switching from hiscampaign for free mealsfor children toill-judged socialising.Rashford is still only 27, at his notional peak – albeit that players who start early often reach their peaks early (and those who believe inthe rule of 500may note that Rashford reached his 500th career appearance in Villa’s 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest at the beginning of April).He did enough for Villa to make it at least plausible that his problems are essentially those ofManchester Unitedand that a reset may yet allow him to reach the heights that seemed conceivable a decade ago. There has been little evidence of the sort of physical decline, the loss of acceleration Raheem Sterling has apparently suffered. Yet Villa clearly didn’t see enough in his 10 league appearances for them to exercise their £40m option to buy; even given how close they are pushing the threshold for trouble with the profitability and sustainability rules, it’s hard to avoid at least a slight sense of Rashford failing upwards, rejection from Villa leading to an offer from Barcelona.That’s assuming Barça are able to find another lever to pull so they can register him. He joins the goalkeeper Joan García in the queue of players Barcelona have signed but have not yet been able to register because of La Liga’s financial regulations. It’s not an uncommon problem at the club and they’ve always found a way. It took thecontroversial sale of rights to VIP seatsfor the next 25 years to a Qatari company for Dani Olmo and Pau Víctor to be registered last season. There is less and less future income to sell off. Rashford has agreed to a minimum 15% cut in his £325,000-a-week wages (potentially 25% including bonuses), but that still represents a significant sum even with Barça returning to the refurbished Camp Nou soon.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford’s breakthrough double against Midtjylland seems a long time ago.Photograph: Jon Super/APComplicated as Barcelona’s finances are, though, this could, if the issue is essentially clearing his head, be the perfect place for Rashford to recover his form. He’s away from the constant scrutiny of England, which was only heightened as he became a culture-war pawn. The pace and intensity of La Liga are not those of the Premier League.Barcelonaplay extremely attacking football, scoring 102 league goals last season; Rashford will get opportunities.

Theirs is not a squad short of attacking players: Olmo, Ferran Torres, Víctor, Pablo Torre, Fermín López, Gavi and Ansu Fati started league games on the left last season, sometimes with Raphinha operating centrally. Fati has been loaned to Monaco and Torre has been sold to Mallorca, yet Barça still targeted a left-sided player this season, and considered Nico Williams and Luis Díaz before settling on Rashford as a (relatively) cut-price option seemingly undeterred by potential registration problems.Although there is a £26m option to buy, there is no obligation. If it works out, Barcelona get a quick and direct finisher and enhanced squad depth; if not, they can part ways at the end of the season, with nothing lost but a year of wages.For Rashford, meanwhile, there is real pressure. If this doesn’t work, what is the future for him? Potential can be a terrible curse. It doesn’t matter how good a young Premier League player looks, he is only ever a couple of disappointing seasons from being linked with the Turkish Super Lig or West Ham. When you promise as much as Rashford did in those few days in February 2016, even a very good career can end up suffering the taint of disappointment, however unfair that may be. For Rashford’s career and his legacy, these next few months are vital.Explore more on these topicsMarcus RashfordBarcelonaManchester UnitedcommentShareReuse this content"

If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players.\"I know for a fact that these people, Omar and Jason, and the club have a number [price] for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.\"I understand clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise and I'm ready. I'm ready to receive the players.\"They have more competition - if you want to play in the World Cup you need to play, so I'm really happy with that because I have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it is perfect.\"Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Eriksen’s agent, Martin Schoots, told the Daily Mail: “Wrexham are really upgrading everything both on and off the field, and it is a hugely impressive project, as you can see from the presence of people like [chief executive] Michael Williamson there. But Christian still wants to play in a first-tier competition and he absolutely wants to stay in Western Europe. There are some contacts going on but it has to suit both sides.”Wrexham’s Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have shown plenty of ambition ahead of the Red Dragons’ return to the second tier of English football after a 43-year absence. They have already added the Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward, the left-back Liberato Cacace, the midfielders Lewis O’Brien and George Thomason and the forwards Josh Windass and Ryan Hardie to their ranks after a third consecutive promotion.It has been reported that Wrexham, who begin their Championship campaign at Southampton on 9 August, have broken their transfer record twice this summer.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowManchester CityWrexhamBurnleyNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Inevitable is a dangerous word in a fickle sport like cricket and yet the events that transpired felt as close to this as is possible: the likeliest of outcomes once Root gambolled out to the middle first thing under an azure blue sky.The first expectation was that England, trailing India by 133 runs on 225 for two, would take control of this fourth Test and, sitting 2-1 up, the series as a whole. Ben Stokes, Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley had inflicted suchdamage on day twothat it was going to take something remarkable from the tourists to turn their fortunes around.The fun has gone for frazzled India as Shubman Gill’s passivity leaves teammates drifting | Simon BurntonRead moreThere was also a strong suspicion that Root, starting on 11, would end the day with only Sachin Tendulkar higher on the all- time run-scoring chart. Compiling 150 from 248 balls, a 38th Test century and another for his personal Louvre, this was very much achieved, with a trio of greats surpassed and his career tally now sitting at 13,409 runs. Tendulkar, who retired on 15,921, is now the final boss left to conquer.Not that Root milked the moment when, on the stroke of tea, he guided the innocuous Anshul Kamboj for a single behind square to move to 120 andovertake Ricky Ponting(13,378 runs) in second place. If anything, Root seemed sheepish. As Ponting graciously purred on the Sky commentary, and those celestial numbers flashed up on the big screen, the crowd’s ovation was met with a simple wave of the glove.But then Root is as team-first a cricketer as they come – No Ego Joe, if you will – and will likely have drawn greater satisfaction from England’s position at stumps. It was a commanding one, too, the hosts closing on 544 for seven and leading by 186 runs. There is a bit of rain forecast to arrive on Sunday but Shubman Gill’s men will need to get there first. Given their bereft state and Rishabh Pant’s broken foot, it is hard to envisage a soggy draw.There were fine support acts on the day; the Richard Ashcrofts to Root’s headlining Oasis. Ollie Pope made a purposeful 71 that, over the course of 38 overs, added 144 for the third wicket. Pope did not always exude the same permanence as Root – he still jabs crookedly in defence and not least against the spinners – but his role in a death-by-a-thousand-cuts morning of singles drove India to distraction.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes retired hurt then returned as he made his first half-century of the series.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAnd Stokes continued what is becoming very much a series being moulded in his image, that long-awaited five-wicket haul on day two followed by a punchy 77 not out. Though paused on 66 – a battle with cramp in his left leg forced him to retire hurt for a spell – the England captain will go into day four eyeing a first Test century for two years. Of greater concern will be how much he can bowl second time around.For India there was a brief spell in the afternoon when the door that Root and Pope were bolting shut creaked ajar just a sliver. Washington Sundar made a mockery of his bizarre 68-over wait to bowl, with the drift witnessed at Lord’s harnessed once more. Pope edged to slip, while Harry Brook was fooled into a needless stumping on three. England were 349 for four, trailing by nine, and the second new ball was overdue.It was a fleeting pushback, however, and soon weary bodies went the way of a good few Dukes balls during this hard-fought series. Jasprit Bumrah left the field after one over with the second new ball due to an apparent ankle twinge. Mohammed Siraj got one delivery to rear up and clang Stokes in the box – eye-watering in the extreme – only to soon follow his strike partner with a stiff hobble back to the dressing room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although among them was Chris Woakes’s off stump being knocked over by a ball from Siraj that scuttled along the ground. When India’s time to bat again comes around, they will not simply have to overcome a refreshed England attack.As much as the tourists struggled, shipping 319 runs, so much of this came back to Root and the genius on show. The only inconvenience came when eventually stumped off Ravindra Jadeja in the final session, Root accidentally trod on the ball and, for a split second, gave rise to fears of something more sinister having occurred.That aside, this was another display of Root’s command of the crease: that ability to pick up length early and manipulate the field to his will. A half-century from 99 balls, his latest century from 178, and just 12 crisp fours picked off along the way. Provided the 34-year-old stays fit and hungry – and the latter feels unlikely to diminish given his sheer love for his craft – it feels almost inevitable that he will one day top the lot.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamJoe RootCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The London club have yet to receive any bids for Son but they can expect one from LAFC, which would leave their highest-profile player with a decision to make.LAFC, who signed Hugo Lloris from Spurs in December 2023, have tracked Son for some time. It is understood there is no interest in him at present from clubs in Saudi Arabia, which has been mooted as a possible destination.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreSon, who has one year on his Spurs contract, is poised to travel with the club on their pre-season trip to Hong Kong and his native South Korea. They depart on Sunday after the friendly at Luton on Saturday and Son’s legions of Korean fans are looking forward to seeing him in Seoul next Sunday when Spurs play Newcastle. It is unthinkable that the 33-year-old is not involved. Spurs face Arsenal in Hong Kong before that on Wednesday.Son’s future at Spurs is in considerable doubt, with the new manager, Thomas Frank, offering no guarantees at his unveiling last Friday that the forward would stay beyond the closure of the transfer window. Frank also said he had yet to decide whether Son would retain the captaincy.Son did wear the armband the following day when he played the second half of the 2-0 win at Reading; he was out of sorts and could get nothing going. Spurs appear well stocked in wide attacking areas, having signed Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and made Mathys Tel’s loan from Bayern Munich permanent. Frank can also call upon Brennan Johnson, Dejan Kulusevski, Wilson Odobert, Manor Solomon and Mikey Moore.The club want to add the £60m-rated attacking midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest but talks are deadlocked.

When fans filled stands in cities from Miami to Vancouver, they could typically count on seeing their team winabout 60% of the time. It’s a notable mark. The Premier League saw home teams winjust 45.7%of matches between the league’s inception in 1992 up to the start of the 2024-25 season.But as 2025 unfolds,MLShome-win percentages have slumped to the mid-40s – putting the US and Canada league roughly in line with English and European norms. Rather than suggesting decline, though, the shift signals maturity: an American league evolving into a globally competitive, balanced championship.In its early years, the competitive balance of MLS was shaped by the league’s geography and infrastructure. The vast distances between cities, frequent long-haul flights across multiple time zones, high-altitude arenas like Colorado’s and patchwork playing surfaces made away games gruelling. And home teams capitalized.The MLS All-Star game entertained plenty, but that may no longer be enoughRead moreData covering the last 15 seasons shows how a rise in home win percentage came to a peak at 56% in 2017. But since then, it has steadily declined to the current all-time league low for the 2025 season of 44%, almost precisely in line with the Premier League average.This stark dominance of home teams in MLS was always seen as somewhat unnatural – results shaped by a concoction of quirky conditions rather than sheer sporting merit. When refereeing decisions skewed towards “home cooking”, stadiums were hostile and travel wreaked havoc on routines, the raw result was a clear disadvantage for away sides. MLS was an outlier compared to its top European counterparts not because its teams were vastly better at home, but because away fixtures were uniquely punishing.The geography of MLS road fixtures hasn’t changed, but the response to it has. Clubs now send players on charter flights, design travel routines to combat jet lag and ensure sleep and training adhere to circadian science.In aninterview with the Guardianbefore leaving LAFC, striker Olivier Giroud discussed the physical toil of an MLS travel schedule and the need to prioritise proper rest and recovery.“Here, I’ve already done 20 hours of flight in a month,” the French striker said. “So it’s important to be even more professional in your recovery – sleeping well, eating well and doing the treatments you need to be fit.”View image in fullscreenOlivier Giroud left LAFC this summer to return to France, where he now plays for Lille.Photograph: Javier Rojas/PI/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockMembers of the Vancouver Whitecaps staff once publicly stated that the club adapts training, meal timing and sleep schedules to match West Coast rhythms and reduce circadian disruption ahead of arduous road trips. Dr Ben Sporer, who was part of the club’s sports science team, explainedto the St Albert Gazettethey “keep them on the same pattern that they’ve been used to” to maintain performance across long travel trips. “Basically from the standpoint of the players,” he added, “they don’t feel like they’re dealing with this circadian rhythm change that throws you off and makes you feel fatigued later in the day.”Another factor that has likely contributed to a flattening of the home-away playing field is a continual uptick in refereeing accuracy, as MLS has embraced VAR and invested in referee training, which reduces home bias.Academic research, including Carron and Paradis’ 1992 report on home advantage in sports, shows that officiating bias is one of the most consistent drivers of home field advantage. With VAR in use, decisions over marginal offsides or fouls are less likely to tilt toward the home side. MLS’ Professional Referee Organization (Pro) has publicly acknowledged past officiating errors and committed to greater transparency, aligning the league with global standards. Less referee bias equals fewer undeserved points for home teams, levelling the competitive field.The tactical revolution MLS has undergone over the last decade is another contributor. Teams now travel with play strategies built around pressing systems that suppress opposition creativity in a more aggressive manner than the kind of sit-back-and-defend approaches more common in the past. Bolder tactical systems call for midfielders not to drop back and augment the defense – thus inviting pressure and ceding possession – in away games but to press high and control tempo.The archetypal away performance is now one of tactical discipline and ruthless exploitation of hard-earned openings, not bodily surrender and hoping for set-piece serendipity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2006,researchshowed an extra 10,000 fans delivered about 0.1 extra goals per match in England. Yet, while new stadium designs often seek to amplify crowd noise, and although passionate fan cultures have developed, their impact on results appears mitigated by the improved preparation of visiting teams and greater referring scrutiny.MLS’ trajectory mirrors other professional leagues. Home advantage across sports has declined as travel has improved, refereeing has become more consistent and tactics more sophisticated. A little past the midway point of the 2024-25 Premier League season, home wins had fallen to just 39% – eventually rising to 41% by the end of the campaign – a levelonly seenduring the Covid era of empty arenas.This shift has implications: the value of home advantage for playoff qualification is now contextual rather than assumed. Teams that still rely on fortress mentality must now invest in tactical flexibility, squad depth and mental resilience. As parity reigns, home games still matter, but they’re no longer automatic points.Away teams are better prepared, travel strategies refined, referees more consistent and coaches smarter. The geography might still bite, but not as deeply as it once did.The shift towards home and away parity suggests that MLS has graduated from a quirky outpost in the global soccer landscape to a structured league where points are earned, not gifted.There are plenty of factors that make MLS wonderfully unique within the wider football world, but the shifting home-away dynamic shows that in terms of play, preparation and infrastructure, US soccer’s top division is now a match for its European counterparts.For a league still looking for global respect, aligning its home win percentages with European norms is a sign of convergence in competitive standards. MLS’s tumbling home-win rate isn’t evidence of decline – it’s proof of growth.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This hard-court tournament was the first event for Williams since March 2024; she missed time because of surgery for uterine fibroids.The last time Williams won at least two matches in a row was in August 2019, at the Cincinnati Open, where she put together three consecutive victories before losing to Madison Keys in the quarter-finals.Williams began well against Frech, going up 2-1. But from there, Frech claimed seven straight games to own the first set and lead 2-0 in the second.Frech is a 27-year-old from Poland whose best grand slam showing was a run to the fourth round at the 2024 Australian Open before losing to Coco Gauff.The show under the lights on this evening was all about Williams, whose greeting was much louder when she walked out on court toting a green exercise band. Every time Williams unfurled one of her booming groundstrokes – and make no mistake, she still can hit the ball hard – the crowd in the main stadium let out a roar.The problem for Williams: She frequently was unable to properly calibrate those shots, including when she sailed a forehand way out after rushing forward to get to a short ball off Frech’s racket. That gave Frech a 3-2 lead.Williams would drop her head or slump her shoulders after some misses, and she had 14 unforced errors in the opening set, more than twice as many as Frech. Fans often responded with an “Awwww” right away, before trying to give Williams a boost by yelling support.After Williams fell behind 1-0 in the second set, a chorus rose of “Here we go, Venus! Here we go!”She generated loud applause after getting a game a few minutes later, and there were clap-accompanied chants of “Venus!” when she broke to get within 4-2 in that set. But Williams didn’t get another game.When it ended after 1hr 12min with one last Williams forehand that landed long, spectators gave her a standing ovation, and she responded with a smile and the sort of pirouette and wave she usually reserves for celebrating wins.“We’re never going to say goodbye to Venus Williams, are we?” the stadium announcer said.In other action Thursday, top-seeded Jessica Pegula lost to 2021 US Open runner-up Leylah Fernandez 6-3, 1-6, 7-5, and Emma Raducanudominated her first career matchup against Naomi Osaka, winning the showdown between past US Open champions 6-4, 6-2.“I did feel it had a bit of extra,” Raducanu said. “It’s a match that I feel a lot of people were talking about beforehand.”Raducanu, the first qualifier to claim a grand slam title when she did that in New York in 2021 by defeating Fernandez in the final, saved the only two break points she faced Thursday and broke the big-serving Osaka three times.Seeded men advancing included No 4 Ben Shelton, No 6 Frances Tiafoe, No 7 Alex de Minaur, No 8 Daniil Medvedev, No 12 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and No 14 Brandon Nakashima.Explore more on these topicsVenus WilliamsTennisEmma RaducanuNaomi OsakaUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Tech companiesDara KerrMillions spent by Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and others appear to have paid off as president vows to cut red tapeFri 25 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 12.57 EDTShareDonald Trump’s AI summit in Washington this week was a fanfare-filled event catered to the tech elite. The president took the stage on Wednesday evening, as the song God Bless the USA piped over the loudspeakers, and then he decreed: “America must once again be a country where innovators are rewarded with a green light, not strangled with red tape, so they can’t move, so they can’t breathe.”The message was clear – the tech regulatory environment that was once the focus of federal lawmakers is no longer.“I’ve been watching for many years,” Trump continued. “I’ve watched regulation. I’ve been a victim of regulation.”As Trump spoke to the crowd, he addressed them as “the group of smart ones … the brain power”. In front of him were tech leaders, venture capitalists and billionaires, including Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang and Palantir’s chief technology officer Shyam Sankar. The Hill and Valley Forum, an influential tech industry interest group, co-hosted the confab, along with the Silicon Valley All-in Podcast, which is hosted by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks.Dubbed “Winning the AI Race”, the forum was an opportunity for the president to deliver what he called the “AI action plan”, which aims to loosen restrictions on the development and deployment of artificial intelligence.The cornerstone of that plan are three executive orders that Trump said will turn the US into an “AI export powerhouse” and roll back some of the rules put in place by the Biden administration, which included guardrails around safe and secure AI development.“Winning the AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley – and long beyond Silicon Valley,” Trump said.One executive ordertargets what the White House calls “woke” AIand requires any company receiving federal funding to maintain AI models free from “ideological dogmas such as DEI”. But the other two focus on deregulation, a major demand of American tech leaders who have taken an increasingly bullish stand on government oversight.One of those promotes the export of “American AI” to other countries and the othereases environmental rulesand expedites federal permitting for power-hungry data centers.Millions in lobbyingTo get to this moment, tech companies have been forging a friendly relationship with Trump. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Apple donated to the president’s inauguration fund and met with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, hasbecome a close ally of Trump, and Nvidia’s Huang has also cozied up with the president with promises ofinvesting $500bn in AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years.“The reality is that big tech companies are still spending tens of millions of dollars to curry favor with lawmakers and shape tech legislation,” said Alix Fraser, the vice-president of advocacy for the nonprofit Issue One.In areportreleased on Tuesday, Issue One looked at lobbying spending in 2025 and found that the tech industry has spent record-breaking sums. Eight of the largest tech companies spent a combined $36m – that’s an average of about $320,000 per day when Congress is in session, according to Issue One.Meta spent the most, $13.8m, and has hired 86 lobbyists this year, according to the report. And Nvidia andOpenAIsaw the biggest increases, with Nvidia spending 388% more than the same time last year, and OpenAI spending 44% more.In the lead-up to Trump’s unveiling of his AI plan, more than 100 prominent labor, environmental, civil rights and academic groups countered the president and signed a “People’s AI action plan”. In astatement, the groups stressed the need for “relief from the tech monopolies” that they say “sacrifice the interests of everyday people for their own profits”.“We can’t let big tech and big oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families’ wellbeing, even the air we breathe and the water we drink – all of which are affected by the unrestrained and unaccountable rollout of AI,” the groups wrote.Meanwhile, tech companies and industry groups celebrated the executive orders.Microsoft, IBM, Dell, Meta, Palantir, Nvidia, Anthropic, xAI and others praised the plan. James Czerniawski, the head of emerging technology policy at the Consumer Choice Center, a pro-business lobbying group, heralded Trump’s AI plan as a “bold vision”.“This is a world of difference from the hostile regulatory approach of the Biden administration,” Czerniawski concluded.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Where’s the backlash?Mohamad BazziAs the US president fires thousands in the name of preventing alleged fraud, he continues to spend taxpayer funds on his outingsFri 25 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 12.11 EDTShareDonald Trumpwill be visiting Scotland for five days, but he won’t spend most of his time in high-level diplomatic meetings or conducting other state business. He’s primarily visitingtwo of his golf resorts, and dedicating a new golf course named in honor of his mother, who was born in Scotland.In other words, Trump appears to be going on a junket, paid for by US taxpayers, to check out his golf properties in a foreign country.The White House has shared few details about Trump’s upcoming“private” trip,which starts on Friday and runs through 29 July. The secrecy is deliberate – to avoid questions and criticism of a presidential visit that is mainly focused on promoting Trump’s business interests. As of Tuesday, three days before Trump’s expected arrival in Scotland, the US administration still had not shared thepresident’s itinerarywith the Scottish police force, which is bracing for protests in several cities.Most coverage of Trump’s trip has focused on the fact that the White Housedecided to banWall Street Journal reporters from the press pool that will travel with the president, in retaliation for the outlet’s recent report connecting Trump to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But few media outlets have asked why Trump is visiting Scotland in the first place, especially since the White House is planning another, more elaboratestate visit to the UKin September, when Trump will be hosted by King Charles.When Trump’s aides finally confirmed his Scotland trip last week, they focused on hisplans to meetwithKeir Starmer, the UK prime minister, and John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister. Not surprisingly, the White House downplayed the fact that Trump will spend most of his time visiting his own golf courses – and holding those few official meetings at his properties. Trump is also expected to open anew golf courseat his resort along Scotland’s North Sea coast, near Aberdeen, naming it in honor of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. The Trump Organization isalready advertisingthe new 18-hole course, which is supposed to open to the public next month, as the “greatest 36 holes in golf”, alongside an original course that opened in 2012.It’s the latest example of Trump exploiting the presidency to promote his business interests, with little outrage or resistance from Congress, the news industry and the rest of the political establishment in Washington. With an obedient Congress led by Republicans who fear Trump’s wrath and a supreme court ruling that gave the president broad immunityfor official acts, Trump is more emboldened than ever. And while previous US presidents and their families have profited from their time in power, Trump has taken presidential graft to another level.The scope of Trump’s profiteering in the first six months of his second term has been astounding:foreign real estate dealsworth billions of dollars, negotiated by his sons and mostly based in the Middle East and Europe; a$2bn cryptocurrency projectwith an investment fund backed by the government of Abu Dhabi, which could eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for the president and his family; and anew private club in Washington(called “Executive Branch” and co-founded by Donald Trump Jr) that plans to charge a $500,000 membership fee. Thanks to its crypto investments and real estate deals, the Trump familyincreased its wealthby nearly $3bn after Trump took office in January.He also uses the vast resources of the presidency to regularly visit his properties, especially his golf resorts – and to publicly advertise his properties and other business interests at press conferences. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington estimated that, in his first six months back in office,Trump made 62 visitsto his golf courses, a 37% increase from his first term. (These visits include Trump appearances at private events and fundraisers, so he did not necessarily play golf at every outing.) A website called theDonald Trump Golf Tracker, which uses data from the president’s public schedule, says Trump has golfed about 23% of the days he has been in office (43 out of 186, as of Thursday).The problem isn’t that Trump enjoys golf – it’s that he insists on spending significant time at his own residences and golf courses, at taxpayer expense. And those trips often benefit Trump directly, since his properties have charged the US government tohouse Secret Servicepersonnel and White House staff, sometimes at“exorbitant” rates. Trump is particularly fond of his Florida mansion and private club at Mar-a-Lago, which he calls his “winter White House”. Since his inauguration, Trump has visitedMar-a-Lago 10 times, the last in early May, when he started making regular weekend trips to his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey – presumably to avoid the Florida heat.Each of Trump’s weekend jaunts to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster costs taxpayers millions of dollars. And they stand as a constant reminder of the president’s hypocrisy, as Trump fires thousands of federal workers and slashes government funding in the name of preventing alleged fraud – while he continues to spend taxpayer funds on his golf outings.In 2019, a report by the Government Accountability Officeanalyzed four tripsthat Trump took in 2017 to Mar-a-Lago, and estimated the price tag was $13.6m, or about $3.4m for each visit. That estimate included the cost of flying Air Force One, along with a separate cargo plane that carries the presidential motorcade, between Washington and the Palm Beach international airport. But the GAO reportdid not includethe cost of lodging, dining and other expenses incurred by White House staff during these visits, so the total bill is probably higher. With 10 trips to his Palm Beach resort so far into his second term, taxpayers have already spent at least $34m on Trump’s golf outings – not counting his visits to Trump-owned golf clubs in New Jersey and Virginia.How much will US taxpayers spend on Trump’s trip to Scotland, where he plans to visit his golf resorts at Turnberry and at Menie, north of Aberdeen? It’s difficult to come up with an accurate figure because audits of previous presidential travel usually include a partial accounting of costs incurred by multiple US agencies. But a visit by Trump to Scotland in July 2018, during his first term, to his Turnberry resort provides some clues. Trump made a weekend stopoverto play golfon his way to a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. An inspector general’s report, which was requested by Democrats in Congress, found that the Secret Service and the state department togetherspent more than $1.1mon the trip – a figure that doesn’t include the cost of flying Air Force One and its associated cargo plane.Trump’s weekend jaunt in 2018 to one of his golf resorts generated outrage from Democrats in Congress, and a subsequent investigation. Now Trump is embarking on an even longer, and largely personal, trip toScotland– one where he plans to visit all of his properties. And hardly anyone is raising a fuss because the president has normalized corruption and fully neutered his opposition.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionScotlandUS taxationcommentShareReuse this content"

He should urge Trump to force an end to the Palestinians’ agonyFri 25 Jul 2025 11.31 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareSo great is the despair, so intense the desperation, that the hopes of the Palestinians of Gaza now rest on a man who covets their land and wants to see them gone. The man in question isDonald Trump– and this weekend, there is a rare chance to push him to do the right thing.There should be no mystery as to what that right thing is. Ideally, it would mean the US president using his leverage to force the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, into ending the nearly 22-month war in Gaza. But if that’s too much to ask, there is an even more pressing demand that Trump should be making right now: that Israel lift all restrictions, remove all bureaucratic impediments, and flood Gaza with the food and medicine the people thereso urgently need– and that it happen immediately.This is a case that should not even need to be made. It is so starkly obvious, most plainly in the images that this week shocked the world. The woman holdinga skeletal childon the front page of the Guardian, the emaciated baby on the front of the Daily Express, haunt anyone who glimpses them. Once seen, they cannot be unseen.Similarly, you cannot unhear thevoice of the Gazan motherwhose greatest pain is not her own hunger, but her inability to feed her daughter. You cannot unlearn that doctors in Gaza’s few remaining emergency rooms are themselvesfainting from lack of food. Or that the BBC, AP, AFP and Reuters news agencies havejoined togetherto warn that the reporters on the ground on whom they rely – because Israel continues to deny journalists free access to Gaza – are unable to work because they are starving. Or that aid workers themselves, like the people they want to help, are now “wasting away”, in the words of ajoint statementfrom more than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups, including Médecins Sans Frontières, Save the Children and Oxfam.Israel trying to deflect blame for widespread starvation in GazaRead moreIsrael insists that plenty of aid gets into Gaza; it posts videos showinghundreds of containersinside the strip, which it says are just waiting to be picked up and distributed by the UN and other agencies. It’s this “collection bottleneck” that is the problem, it says. The UN counters that it cannot get from Israel first,the authorisation it needs to transport aidthrough areas declared by Israel to be military zones, and second, a commitment that Palestinians who approach aid convoys won’t come under fire.You can see why the latter is essential, given thatmore than a thousand Palestinians, guilty of nothing more than being hungry and desperate, have been, according to the UN, gunned down at or close to food distribution points run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the joint US-Israeli body that puts the work previously done by the UN and others into thetrigger-happy handsof US private contractors and the IDF. Handing out food at just four – as opposed to hundreds – of sites, which are sometimes open for as little as11 minutes, the GHF operation was this week branded “a sadistic death trap” by one UN official.It’s no use Israel complaining of bottlenecks and the like. This is a country with the technical knowhow and ingenuity tohit nuclear and other targetsin distant Iran and toeliminate Hezbollah fightersby means of their own pagers. If they wanted to ensure the starving of Gaza received food, water and medicine, if they had the will, they could make it happen right now. (Note Friday’s decision, doubtless in response to the current international outcry, to allowairdrops of aidfrom Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.) It is a political choice Netanyahu is making, an unconscionable one, using the flow of aid as a bargaining chip in his ongoing and so far fruitless ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, just as it is a political choice by Hamas to refuse to make the concessions that might ease the horror being visited on their own people.If Netanyahu and Hamas lack the will to end this nightmare, that leaves the one man who can surely force an end to it: Trump. The US arms and sustains Israel. It is largely US-supplied weapons that, according to the Haaretz newspaper, allow Israel to rain “more than 1,000 bombs and missiles down onGazaevery week”, even now, when so much of the territory has been reduced to rubble. If Trump insists this war must end, it will surely end. If he insists that the children of Gaza must eat, they will eat. That is the power of his office, and of his particular hold on Netanyahu: unlike Joe Biden, this US president has no Donald Trump over his shoulder. There is no one else for Netanyahu to turn to.Gaza is starving. So are its journalists | Jodie GinsbergRead moreWould Trump issue that directive, telling the Israeli prime minister that enough is finally enough? We’re told that he cannot bear to see images of suffering on TV, that his aversion to US military entanglements partly stems from that revulsion. It’s also clear that his ego longs for the one trophy that has eluded him, and which, to his undying fury, was handed to his first predecessor. He wants to be like Barack Obama and win a Nobel peace prize.And yet, this is also the man whose plan for Gaza is toempty it of its people– “temporarily or could be long term” – and turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East”, boasting plenty of what his son-in-law memorably referred to as “waterfront property.” If that remains his goal, he will be in no hurry to rescue those he wants out of the way.What’s more, in his several days of White House meetings with Netanyahu this month, Trump placed no visible pressure on the PM to do a deal with Hamas, apparently preferring to engage in mutual backslapping over their joint military action against Iran a fortnight or so earlier. Gone was the Trump who enforced an end to that episode by instructing Netanyahu to stop bombing Iran and to turn Israeli aircraft around and return them to base, which the Israeli leader duly did.In the coming days, there is a chance to urge the dove within Trump to prevail over the hawk, and that chance falls to none other than Keir Starmer. The US president is visiting his golf courses in Scotland, but he will see the British prime minister. Starmer could be tempted to use that meeting to plead for mercy on tariffs, given that Trump has spoken ominously of wanting to “refine”the US-UK trade deal. He might want to talk about Ukraine or Nato. All of that is important. But Starmer should use his moment, and whatever trust and goodwill he has built up with Trump, to press him on Gaza.He might mention the Nobel; he might use flattery, telling Trump he is the only man in the world powerful enough to make a difference, which happens to be true. However he does it, Starmer should make that move. This is a crisis that can wait no longer.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionDonald TrumpKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahucommentShareReuse this content"

But there’s a ray of hopeMargaret SullivanThe Trump settlement is a bad omen for the Paramount-owned network. A new boss at the news show, however, could be a good signFri 25 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 10.38 EDTShareThe past few weeks have brought a torrent of bad news for those who care aboutCBSNews – the home of the legendary Walter Cronkite and a great deal of investigative journalism over many decades.Most notably, the network’s parent company, Paramount Global, capitulated to the Trump administration, unnecessarily – and wimpily – settling a lawsuit by paying $16m, purportedly for a future presidential library.Trump had sued over a story on 60 Minutes, the network’s flagship program, claiming it was deceptively edited to favor his then-rival for the presidency, Kamala Harris. After the settlement was announced, Trump crowed that the network had “defrauded the American people” and was desperate to settle; he also claimed that another $20m in advertising and programming was also coming his way.Days later, another troubling sign. The network decided to dump The Late Show WithStephen Colbert, the top-rated show on late-night television, whose host has been relentlessly critical of Trump. Network bosses claimed the move was financial, since the show was losing money. But it wasn’t hard to connect the dots and see this as part of an all-out effort to appease the president.The Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren called for answers in a Variety op-ed, asking: “Are we sure that this wasn’t part of a wink-wink deal between the president and a giant corporation that needed something from his administration?”That “something” is federal clearance for an $8bn merger between Paramount and another giant media corporation, Skydance. (The latter company is doing its kowtowing part, promising to “evaluate any complaints of bias” at CBS News, appoint an ombudsman to keep watch, and ensure there are no diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Paramount. The proposed merger gotapproval on Thursday from the FCC, which means that it’s essentially a done deal.)Colbert’s on-air commentary on the settlement was brutal: “This kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles. It’s ‘big, fat bribe’.” Could it be a complete coincidence that The Late Show was canceled three days later?Amid all this, one positive development this week shone through like a wan blade of light. A new executive producer for 60 Minutes – the top editorial role – got the nod. To the relief of many there, Tanya Simon is no outsider who might have been tapped to make the show more Trump-friendly.Simon has deep roots at the revered program – a 25-year veteran of 60 Minutes, she is also the daughter of the late CBS correspondent Bob Simon. She has been the acting executive producer since the previous executive producer, Bill Owens, resigned under pressure, saying he felt he no longer had the full editorial independence he had always enjoyed.Her appointment, of course, doesn’t mean no political pressure will be exerted from corporate bosses above her, who seem to be under Trump’s sway.“There is great fear about what comes next,” one CBS News staffer told CNN earlier this month. Simon’s appointment offers at least a modest measure of reassurance.She “understands what makes ‘60 minutes’ tick,” said the news division’s president, Tom Cibrowski, in a memo to staff. She’s also the first woman, in the show’s nearly six-decade history, to be at the helm.If the choice had been a right-leaning newcomer, it’s a good bet that top quality talent like Scott Pelley – a former chief White House correspondent and a former anchor of the CBS Evening News – would have quickly headed for the door.As for the future of CBS, once admired enough to be dubbed the Tiffany Network, the outlook is mixed.“I know that the C in CBS stands for Columbia, but … it ought to be called the Contradiction Broadcasting Network,” wrote Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch.That’s always been true, he argued, given the bright journalistic legacy of Cronkite and Edward R Murrow along with some ugly chapters in the distant past. That includes the time when – under fire from the FBI director J Edgar Hoover in the late 1940s – the network demanded that all its employees sign a loyalty oath to the US government.When it comes to integrity, that history of contradiction is bad enough.Capitulation, though, is far worse. And given recent events, it’s easy to make the case that CBS – or, more accurately, its parent company – deservesthatacronym even more.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCBSOpinionUS television industryStephen ColbertDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But that doesn’t mean Trump can’t be defeatedFri 25 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 13.02 EDTShareThe fracas over the Jeffrey Epstein files – and declining poll numbers on every issue that wonDonald Trumpthe 2024 election – indicate cracks in the Maga coalition and weakening support for the president’s self-proclaimed mandate.But reports of Maga’s death are probably exaggerated.Trump has cheated death, both physical and political, many times. And while every tyrant craves the adoration of the people – and claims to have it even when he doesn’t – no tyrant worth the title counts on public support to stay in power.Last week, when the administration pulled an about-face on releasing100,000-odd documentsrelated to Epstein – amid conspiracy theories of deep-state pedophile rings, which Trump promoted – it looked like Trump was on the ropes. “Trump can’t stop MAGA from obsessing about the Epstein files,” reportedNBC. “Trump meets toughest opponent: his own base,” declaredAxios. Trump was “on the defense”,NPRsaid.The Guardianreported on Maga hat burnings.Even after House RepublicansblockedDemocrats on a resolution to force a vote on releasing the files, even after the speaker, Mike Johnson,withheldfrom the floor a similar resolution, the far right would not be mollified. “Dangling bits of red meat no longer satisfies,” the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posted onX. “The People … want the whole steak dinner and will accept nothing less.”Now some of the commentariat are predicting that even if Trump survives, the damage to the GOP is done.Inthe Hill, Douglas Schoen and Carly Cooperman marshaled polls showing Trump’s sliding approval from before to after the Epstein affair and conjectured that it could sink the Republicans in the midterm elections.At the same time, the populace, including Republicans, is changing its mind on Trump’s master plans. Six in 10 respondents to aCNN polloppose the federal budget bill; approval of Trump’s handling of the budget is down 11 points since March. On immigration, aGalluppoll showed a steep drop in respondents who favor more restricted admittance, from 55% in 2024 to 30% this June. The most striking change is amongRepublicans, from 88% who wanted fewer immigrants in 2024 to 48% in June 2025. Meanwhile, the percentage of Americans who think immigrants are good for America rose to a record 79%.The flood of TikToks showing masked men kidnapping people from the streets and manhandling elected officials has turned many people against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Two YouGov polls showed the agency’s favorability plummeting from anet positive of 15points in early February to adeficit of 13in late June. During Trump’s first term, “Abolish Ice” was the chant at tiny demonstrations by fringe-left organizations. Now more than a third of respondents to aCiviqs surveywant to see the agency gone, including an uptick of six points among Republicans since November, to 11% .Trump is not backing down. In fact, he’s doubling down on every policyAnd as David Gilbert pointed out inWired, even before the Epstein flap, some of the president’s most prominent supporters were defying him. The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson condemnedthe bombing of Iran. Trump whisperer Laura Loomer dissed his acceptance of a $400mplane from Qatar. Elon Musk defected overthe One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And Joe Rogan deemedIce raids targeting ordinary working migrantstoo much to bear.But Trump is not backing down. In fact, he’s doubling down on every policy. The deportation campaign has grown more vicious by the day. Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” is being rightly condemned as a concentration camp. A recentHuman Rights Watchinvestigation of three Miami area Ice facilities found detainees denied food and medicine, held in solitary confinement, and shackled at the wrists and forced to kneel to eat, as one man put it, “like animals”.The president muscled his budget and rescission package through Congress without regard to the disproportionate harm they augur for red-state residents, much less the deficit, the public health, or the planet’s future. His tariffs are barreling ahead, exasperating economists, hitting crucial US economic sectors and tanking entire economies overseas.General Motorsreported second-quarter profits down by a third. In the tiny, impoverished nation ofLesotho, “denim capital of the world”, Trump’s threatened 50% duties have shut down the garment factories, leaving thousands out of work, hungry and desperate.Trump may feel insulted, which he does most of the time; he may temporarily lose his footing. But he’s not relinquishing power without a fight.Tyrants don’t need high approval ratings. They intimidate voters, rig elections, or stop holding them altogether; suppress protest and jail, deport or assassinate their critics. The Nazis achieved peak support in 1932, at37.3%. Of the 1933 plebiscite that ceded all power to Hitler, the German Jewish diarist Victor Klemperer wrote: “No one will darenotto vote, and no one will respond No in the vote of confidence. Because (1) Nobody believes in the secrecy of the ballot, and (2) A No will be taken as a Yes anyway.”Daria Blinova, of the International Association for Political Science Students,arguesthat autocrats cultivate approval while consolidating their own power through the “illusion of substantial improvements”, which are actually insubstantial. In 2017, for instance, nine in 10 Saudi youth supported Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman because of such reforms as allowing cinemas to reopen.The Trump administration has begun deploying some similar tactics. The justice department ispressuring state electionofficials to turn over their voter rolls and give it illegal access to voting machines. The Republican National Committee istraining volunteersto “ensure election integrity” – AKA harassing voters and poll workers. It is trying to banish the opposition press. Homeland security is trying to deport the widely followed Salvadorian journalistMario Guevera, who has covered Ice raids and protests. Migrants sent home or to third countries can face persecution, torture or death.Still, none of this means that Trump is invincible, even when his administration uses violence to achieve its aims and terrify its critics. First – simplest and most difficult –the resistance must show up. Get bodies into the streets. The second nationwide anti-Trump rallies were bigger than the first; the third, fourth and 10th can be bigger still.Gather bodies at the sites of injustice.Volunteers are swarmingto immigration courts, where migrants who show up for mandatory hearings are being released into the clutches of waiting Ice agents. The court-watchers – experienced organizers and first-timers, retirees, students, clergy, elected officials, artists – are distributing “know your rights” leaflets in many languages, writing down names and contact information to inform families of their loved ones’ arrests or to connect arrestees to lawyers later on. Immigrants’ rights groups are holding training sessions. Spanish speakers are giving immigration-specific language lessons.This nonviolent gumming-up of the government’s criminal machine draws press and social media attention, multiplying participation, amplifying anger and mobilizing greater organization. At every step, people are bearing witness, storing it up for future accountability.The Epstein affair shows that no loyalty is unbreakable. The polls show that discomfort with Trump’s policies is growing. Discomfort can mature to rejection of injustice, rejection to resistance, resistance to action. A tyrant does not need majority support to maintain power. But neither does the opposition movement need majority participation to take power back. No tyranny lasts forever.Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

This is Alice in Wonderland-style justiceAustin SaratThe president’s claims against his predecessor turn long-held ideals of American justice on their headFri 25 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 17.42 EDTShareAlmost every American knows that in our legal system, people accused of crimesare presumed innocent. The burden is on the government to overcome that presumption and prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Those simple but powerful maxims were once a source of national pride. They distinguished the United States from countries where government officials and political leadersbrandedthe opponents guilty before they were charged with a crime or brought to trial.In Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union, the Alice-in-Wonderland world of “sentence first-verdict afterwards”came to life in infamous show trials. Those trials lacked all the requisites of fairness. Evidence was manufactured to demonstrate the guilt of the regime’s enemies. Show trials told the story the government wanted told and were designed to signal that anyone, innocent or not, could be convicted of a crime against the state.So far, at least, this country has avoided Stalinesque show trials. But the logic of the show trial was very much on display this week in the Oval Office.In a now-familiar scene, during a meeting with the Philippines president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr,Donald Trumpwent off script. Heturneda reporter’s question about the unfoldingJeffrey Epsteinscandal into an occasion to say that former president Barack Obama had committed “treason” by interfering in the 2016 presidential election.“He’s guilty,” Trump asserted, “This was treason. This was every word you can think of.”Speaking after the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard,releaseda report on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election, the president said: “Obama was trying to lead a coup. And it was with Hillary Clinton.”Republican congressmen and senators, including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who investigated allegations of Obama’s involvement five years ago,found nothing to support them. But none of that mattered to the president on Tuesday.As Trumpput it: “Whether it’s right or wrong, it’s time to go after people. Obama’s been caught directly.” Not hiding his motives, Trump said: “It’s time to start after what they did to me.”Guilt first. Charges, trials and other legal niceties come later.This is American justice, Trump-style. He wants no part of the long and storied tradition in which presidentskept an arms-length relationship with the justice departmentand did not interfere with its decisions about whether and whom to prosecute for crimes.What Trump said about Obama is, the New York Timesnotes, “a stark example of his campaign of retribution against an ever-growing list of enemies that has little analogue in American history”. Putting one of his predecessors on trial also would take some of the sting out of Trump’s own dubious distinction of being the only former president to have beenconvicted of a felony.Some may be tempted to write off the president’s latest Oval Office pronouncements as an unhinged rant or onlyan effort to distract attention from Trump’s Epstein troubles. But that would be a mistake.A recent article by the neuroscientist Tali Sharot and the law professor Cass Sunstein helps explain why. That articleis titled: “Will We Habituate to the Decline of Democracy?”Sharot and Sunstein argue that the US is on the cusp of a dangerous moment in its political history. They say that we can understand why by turning to neuroscience, not to political science.Neuroscience teaches us that “people are less likely to respond to or even notice gradual changes. That is largely due to habituation, which is the brain’s tendency to react less and less to things that are constant or that change slowly.”In politics, “when democratic norms are violated repeatedly, people begin to adjust. The first time a president refuses to concede an election, it’s a crisis. The second time, it’s a controversy. By the third time, it may be just another headline. Each new breach of democratic principles … politicizing the justice system … feels less outrageous than the last.”Americans must resist that tendency. To do so, Sharot and Sunstein argue, we need “to see things not in light of the deterioration of recent years but in light of our best historical practices, our highest ideals, and our highest aspirations”.In the realm of respect for the rule of law and the presumption of innocence, we can trace those practices, ideals and aspirations back to 1770, when John Adams, a patriot, practicing lawyer and later the second president of the United States,agreed to defendBritish soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre.Adams did so because hebelievedthat everyone, no matter how reprehensible their act, was entitled to a defense. That principle meant that people needed to learn to withhold judgment, to respect evidence and to hear both sides of a story before making up their minds.That was a valuable lesson for those who would later want to lead our constitutional republic, as well as for its citizens. The trial of the British soldiers turned out,as the author Christopher Klein writes, to be “the first time reasonable doubt had ever been used as a standard”.Fast forward to 1940, and thememorable speechof the attorney general, Robert Jackson, to a gathering of United States attorneys. What he said about their role might also be said about the president’s assertions about Obama.Jackson observed that US attorneys had “more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America”. A prosecutor, he explained, “can have citizens investigated and, if he is that kind of person, he can have this done to the tune of public statements and veiled or unveiled intimations … The prosecutor can order arrests … and on the basis of his one-sided presentation of the facts, can cause the citizen to be indicted and held for trial.”Sound familiar?The president is not a prosecutor, but since he has returned to power, President Trump has behaved and encouraged those in the justice department to ignore Jackson’s warnings that a prosecutor should focus on “cases that need to be prosecuted” rather than “people that he thinks he should get”. Targeting people, not crimes, means that the people prosecuted will be those who are “unpopular with the predominant or governing group” or are “attached to the wrong political views, or [are] personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself”.Jackson restated a long-cherished American ideal, namely that those with the power to ruin lives and reputations should seek “truth and not victims” and serve “the law and not factional purposes”.Since then, presidents of both parties, in even the most controversial cases and those involving allies or opponents,have heeded Jackson’s warnings. They have said nothing about pending cases, let alone announcing that it’s time “to go after” people.But no more. The justice departmentseems ready and willing to do the president’s bidding, even though there is no evidence that Obama did anything wrong in regard to the 2016 election. In addition, he may have immunity from criminal prosecution for anything he did in his official capacity.Trump’s attack on the “traitorous” Obama may be predictable. But it should not be acceptable to any of us.Sharot and Sunstein get it right when they say, “To avoid habituating ourselves to the torrent of President Trump’s assaults on democracy and the rule of law, we need to keep our best practices, ideals, and aspirations firmly in view what we’ve done.” We need “to compare what is happening today not to what happened yesterday or the day before, but to what we hope will happen tomorrow”.To get to that world, it is important to recall the words of John Adams and Robert Jackson and work to give them life again.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionBarack ObamaTrump administrationUS justice systemUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

If we do not act now, there will be no one left to tell anyone’s storyFri 25 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 12.58 EDTShareIn May, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)wroteabout the desperate situation facing journalists in Gaza, who were having to report while dangerously hungry. My colleagues documented the gnawing hunger, dizziness, brain fog and sickness all experienced by an exhausted Palestinian press corps already living and working in terrifying conditions. Eight weeks later, that desperate situation is nowcatastrophic.Several news organizations are now warning that their journalists – those documenting what is happening inside Gaza – will die unless urgent action is taken to stop Israel’s deliberate refusal to allow sufficient food into the territory. “​​Since AFP was founded in August 1944, we have lost journalists in conflicts, we have had wounded and prisoners in our ranks, but none of us can recall seeing a colleague die of hunger,” an association ofjournalists from the Agence France-Presse wrote in a statement on Monday. “We refuse to watch them die.” Two days later, the Qatari broadcast network Al Jazeera said its journalists – like all Palestinians in Gaza– were “fighting for their own survival” and warned: “If we fail to act now, we risk a future where there may be no one left to tell our stories.”Al Jazeerashareda heart-wrenching post from the Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Anas Al Sharif in which he writes: “I haven’t stopped covering [the crisis] for a moment in 21 months, and today, I say it outright … And with indescribable pain. I am drowning in hunger, trembling in exhaustion, and resisting the fainting that follows me every moment … Gaza is dying. And we die with it.”Al Sharif’s story is one we have heard over and over again from reporters inside Gaza. On Sunday, Sally Thabet, correspondent for Al-Kofiya satellite channel,faintedafter a live broadcast on 20 July because she had not eaten all day. She told CPJ she regained consciousness in the hospital, where doctors gave her an intravenous drip for rehydration and nutrition. In an onlinevideo, she described how she and her three daughters are starving. The Palestinian journalist Shuruq As’ad, founder of the Palestine Journalism Hub, said Thabet was thethird journalistto collapse on air from starvation that week.This is systematic silencing by Israel. Starvation is its latest and terrible manifestationI have been a reporter for more than a quarter of a century. I know all too well that journalists have always faced risks in reporting in war zones. I have many journalist friends who bear the scars – both physical and mental – of covering such conflicts, and many whose colleagues have been killed in fighting from Libya to Syria, from Bosnia to Sierra Leone. Most take these risks knowingly. But this is not that situation. These are not the usual risks faced by reporters in conflict: a stray bullet, a landmine, ambush. This is something else. This is systematic silencing by Israel. Starvation is its latest and terrible manifestation, but we must be clear that the threats facing journalists in Gaza are not new – nor is the international community’s abject failure to address them. More journalists and media workers werekilledin 2024 than in any other year since CPJ began keeping records. Nearly two-thirds of all those killed in 2024 were Palestinians killed by Israel. There has been no accountability for any of these killings, despite evidence of numeroustargeted attacks.LivePalestinians mourn journalist killed in Israeli strike in Gaza – videoVery few of these journalists chose to become war correspondents. They are war correspondents because war is their daily, inescapable reality. They report because there is no one else to do so as Israel continues torefuse accessto journalists from outside Gaza to the territory, a refusal that is without precedent in the history of modern warfare. These restrictions on international access place an unbearable burden on those who are forced to remain and bear witness. CPJ has documented thedeliberate targeting of journalists; their offices have been bombed, theirhomes destroyed. They have been forced to move repeatedly, finding shelter inflimsy tents. They struggle with frequentcommunications blackoutsand damaged equipment. They arebarredfrom leaving Gaza and evacuation is all but impossible, even with life-threatening and life-altering injuries. Unlike in other ongoing conflicts, such as Ukraine, which also has a high number of domestic reporters who now report on and from a war zone, Gaza’s journalists have no colleagues who can replace them from elsewhere, who can provide them with much-needed rest and respite.Now these journalists are starving to death before our eyes. The international community has the information it needs to act to reverse this course. We know what is happening inGaza. We know because of the journalists who have documented the attacks at aid stations, who have filmed the starving children and the bombed hospitals, and who are now recording their own demise.There is an adage in journalism circles that explains reporters’ reluctance to write about themselves: No journalist wants to become the story. If we do not act now, there will be no one left in Gaza to tell anyone’s story. And that silence – those deaths – will be on us.Jodie Ginsberg is CEO of the Committee to Protect JournalistsExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionJournalist safetyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

The couple’s renovation should ultimately lift their home’s energy rating from 0.9 to 7.7 stars.But rather than following the trend of ripping the guts out of the house, they have elected to keep as much of the original building as possible intact and recycle the good parts, including elements of the back yard.The solar battery rebate has arrived – here’s how to steer clear of scammersRead more“This was a key philosophy of our architects too – we kept the same footprint with no massive rebuilds,” says Sweatman. “We realised it was time to freshen things up for our retirement and fix some key problems to improve the environmental performance of the house so this would be our forever home.”The couple started by identifying the features they wanted to keep including the flooring, framing materials and some plasterworks and renovate around them, minimising costs and recycling where possible. They also maintained some original features like the front door and stained-glass windows.“We wanted to maintain heritage aspects of the house instead of simply demolishing the whole home and keeping just a facade. We also decided we didn’t want to destroy the back yard to extend the home to be a mega house.”The Sweatmans are improving the homes energy efficiency by installing solar, batteries, and more efficient electric appliances. They are also installing insulation under the floor, in the walls and the roof, triple glazed windows and designing upgrades to maximising passive solar exposure.In this way they share architect Brave New Eco’s operating mantra of “minimum change for maximum benefit” in their approach to the project. “If you can minimise waste in this process it’s an extra benefit, you can do lots of amazing things with an existing building, you don’t need to demolish to get beauty just because home shows or designers tell you that it’s not possible,” Sweatman says.Embracing ‘circularity’ as a renovating principleLinden Thorley, a Sydney-based architect and chair of the Australian Passivhaus Association Retrofit Committee, says one of his top considerations is determining how much of a building can be kept intact in order to minimise construction waste, a principle called “circularity”.He says in some cases the costs and risks associated with taking buildings apart, storing the materials and finding new uses for them can be costly, but there are huge benefits in reusing parts of the existing building.How to reduce your food footprint: if it’s better for you, it’s better for the planetRead more“Many existing homes can be significantly improved to make them more comfortable and healthier to live in without completely demolishing them.”Thorley says he often renovates houses through incremental improvements rather than a complete rebuild, staggering work to target low-hanging fruit in a home and focusing on the potential for passive solar are key elements to consider. “There’s no point adding heaps of insulation if there is a draft blowing through it. We can test for improvements in air tightness before spending money on additional insulation that is harder or more expensive to install.”Maximising the use of available sunlight to warm the home in winter and exclude heat via well-placed shading is also a key consideration. “To support this we need a really well insulated, and relatively airtight building envelope that allows us to maintain our preferred inside temperature. This includes really well sealed windows when they are closed and excellent ventilation.”“Learning to reuse materials instead of always using new ones is something we have to learn to do in a finite world,” he says.Explore more on these topicsHousingChange by degreesArchitectureShareReuse this content"

King Philippe of Belgium, whose direct political statements are rare,condemned the grave humanitarian abuses in Gaza as “a disgrace to humanity”.In atelevised addressto mark Belgium’s national day on 21 July, Philippe said: “I stand with all those who denounce the grave humanitarian abuses in Gaza, where innocent civilians, trapped in their enclave, are dying of hunger and being killed by bombs.” The monarch said he fully supported the calls of the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to end “this unbearable crisis”. From the royal palace in Brussels, the king added: “The current situation has dragged on for far too long. It is a disgrace to humanity.”After a weekend in whichat least 100 peopleacross Gaza were killed as they sought food and water – violence that elicited no formal EU response – the monarch’s message stood out. He spoke of a recent meeting withRami Elhanan and Bassam Aramin– two fathers, one Israeli and one Palestinian, who had each lost a daughter in earlier outbreaks of violence in the Middle East. “They have put aside any desire for revenge and have chosen to transform their pain into a message of peace,” he said. “It is always human dignity that is at stake.”The king’s speech resonated beyond Belgium. The Dutch national broadcaster NOSopenly questionedwhy King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands had not made a similar statement.As a constitutional monarch, Philippe has limited formal powers. His two annual addresses – on Belgium’s national day and Christmas Eve – are reviewed by the prime minister before broadcast. But this year’s remarks stood in sharp contrast to the federal government and the prime minister, Bart De Wever, a Flemish nationalist. His party, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), Belgium’s largest, includes several outspoken defenders of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. De Wever hasresisted callsto impose sanctions on Israel. He even questioned whetherBelgium would arrest Benjamin Netanyahu, as international law would require if the Israeli prime minister were to visit the country.Transcending domestic politics, Philippe issued a broader call to action: “Europe must assert its leadership even more strongly. It must stand as a bulwark against – and a worthy alternative to – the brutal power struggles we are witnessing today.”Given the EU’s intolerable silence on Israel’s war crimes, human rights violations and the deepening humanitarian catastrophe, it was a relief to hear at least one head of state speak the truth out loud. EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels last weekfailed to take action against Israel, prompting an accusation of“cruel and unlawful betrayal” of Palestiniansfrom Amnesty International. Emmanuel Macron’sannouncementthat France would recognise Palestinian statehood in September, while important, remains symbolic in the absence of any economic, financial or diplomatic sanctions.The king, who was speaking just days after an audience with humanitarian organisations working in Gaza, highlighted the failure to uphold international law. “For decades, international law was the cornerstone upon which states could rely,” he said. “Today, that is being openly called into question. But when international law is trampled, the whole world suffers. Unpredictability and violence are then given free rein.”View image in fullscreenKing Philippe records his annual televised address for this year’s national day.Photograph: Didier Lebrun/APWhile praising collective efforts to meet challenges such as the climate crisis, digital transformation and defence cooperation, Philippe urged EU leaders to “remain true to our values: democracy, justice and the rule of law”. In a political landscape increasingly dominated by realpolitik, here was a voice insisting on the ethical foundations of the European project.The Belgian king has a consistent record of opposing discrimination and upholding human rights. After adeadly terror attackon the Jewish museum in Brussels in 2014, he made an official visit to the site. In 2015, he invited a large delegation of rabbis and Jewish community leaders to the palace after the dismantling of Islamist terrorist cells in Brussels and Verviers.His moral stance has deep roots in the Belgian monarchy. His great-grandmother Queen Elisabeth wasrecognised by Yad Vashemas one of the Righteous Among the Nations. During the second world war, she used her position as queen mother to intervene on behalf of Jews facing deportation. According to Yad Vashem, “these interventions by a member of a royal family in Europe on behalf of Jews were unparalleled”.Since its independence in 1830,Belgiumhas granted full civil rights to Jews – except during the years of Nazi occupation. Those rights, including freedom of religion, expression and the press, are enshrined in the Belgian constitution.More recently, in 2022, Philippe undertook his first visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the former Belgian colony that was founded and brutally exploited by his ancestor Léopold II. While visiting DRC, the king expressed his “deepest regrets” for the suffering inflicted by Belgian colonialism. “The colonial regime itself was based on exploitation and domination,” he said. It was “marked by paternalism, discrimination and racism”.The fact that Philippe’s defence of international law and his remarks on the suffering in Gaza felt like news shows how timid Europe’s elected leaders have been. He was saying only what they should have said months ago.Of course, his remarks won’t end the war. But they should remind Europe – and the world – that silence in the face of injustice amounts to complicity.And that in times of political cowardice, a constitutional monarch can still be a moral leader.David Van Reybrouck is philosopher laureate for the Netherlands and Flanders.

Resident doctors in England (formerly known as junior doctors) are on the picket line from 7am today until 7am on 30 July, a fullfive-day walkout.And I’ll be joining them, in solidarity. Though I’m a resident doctor by grade, I currently work forNHSEngland on a freelance (locum) basis, so I’ll be supporting my colleagues by electing not to work on the aforementioned days, despite the sauteed carrot of “enhanced strike rates”.Whenever doctors are engaged in a public pay dispute, our status as “heroes” is lost to accusations of shirking and self-interest. These attitudes even play out within different generations of doctors.Discussing money in the sector has historically been taboo. When I was in medical school between 2011 and 2016, I can remember students being reprimanded by established doctors for any suggestion that they were pursuing medicine “to make money”. Those with “pound signs in their eyes” were advised to seek a career in the City instead. There was no need to discuss finances, as the understanding was that being a doctor was a challenging and noble vocation that, while it may never make you rich, would leave you more than financially secure.You could look to consultants as examples of such financial security. After years of arduous training, they’ve arguably reached the top of their profession, the pinnacle. Many of them are covering for resident doctor colleagues over the weekend so residents can strike safely, reportedly advised to demand up to £6,000 a shift. Some may balk at such fees, but how much would a top lawyer charge to work out of hours?With becoming a consultant no means a guarantee, debts of more than £100,000 and a rota that can be unforgiving, conditions for resident doctorsare challenging. Then you throw in pay –20% less in real termscompared with a doctor in 2008. Then, potentially, you can understand why morale is low among resident doctors.Last year, a study found that at leasthalf of the British publicthought new junior doctors, as they were still known then, were paid too little. Yet public support is now slumping, with49% opposingthe walkout, and a slew of tabloid headlines since the strikes were announced have painted us aswilfully hamperingthe NHS just to addmore moneyto our bank accounts.Such concerns wouldn’t be high on the British Medical Association’s agenda, as it is its job to deliver the best deal for its members, and90% of the resident doctorswho cast their ballot voted in favour of industrial action. Not even the current government received such support at the last general election.A friend of mine coined the term “gen Z BMA”. While I have no data on the generational makeup of BMA resident members, I would argue they’re gen Z in their approach – they’re fearless and resolute in their aims, and taboos around discussing money are a thing of the past. This current iteration of the BMA will probably shout: “We are paid X and we definitely aren’t worth less than colleagues of yesteryear who were paid Y.”This attitude is at odds with some older members’. We have had retired doctors publicly relinquish their BMA memberships, as they disagree with the approach of resident doctors. Of course, there are consultant and senior colleagues who do support their resident colleagues, but I do feel these generational disagreements are in line with wider societal disputes.The doctors’ strike threatens to scupper the NHS’s big turnaround – this time, the BMA has overreached | Polly ToynbeeRead moreGen Zs and, to an extent, millennials, are often called workshy, and accused of not being willing to sacrifice or put in the graft their colleagues of yesteryear put in. But it could be argued that these younger generations know their worth and aren’t willing to merely “get on with it”. They are prepared to take a stand for what they believe in. Shouldn’t that be commended?Some members of the public certainly don’t think so. A cursory look online reveals a lot of criticism: what about other public servants? What about nurses, teachers or firefighters? Do they not deserve a pay rise?That, I would say respectfully, is a concern for those professions and their respective unions. Unions exist to represent their members and act in their best interests. Why would the BMA consider the interests of nurses, teachers or firefighters?That said, there should be solidarity among public servants – not a race to the bottom.Strike action is meant to be disruptive. However, studies have foundno evidencethat strike action has any significant impact on in-hospital patient mortality. Patients are no more at harm than on non-strike days.Some argue that doctors shouldn’t be allowed to strike due to our vital role. So we are too valuable to strike, but not valuable enough to be paid appropriately? How does that make sense?Michael Akadiri is an award-winning standup comedian and resident doctorExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionIndustrial actionNHSHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

How did this happen?Zoe WilliamsMost people believe Muslim values are incompatible with British ones, a new poll has found. It makes for bleak readingFri 25 Jul 2025 03.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 04.35 EDTShareAccording to YouGov, more than half of people do not believeIslamto be compatible with British values. I’m often dispirited by these polls, as much by the timbre of the questions as by the responses (how many times do we need to ask one another whether we can afford to avert a climate catastrophe, for instance?) But I can’t remember the last time I was stunned.Thislatest pollfound that 41% of the British public believe that Muslim immigrants have had a negative impact on the UK. Nearly half (49%) think that Muslim women are pressured into wearing the hijab. And almost a third (31%) think that Islam promotes violence. Farhad Ahmad, a spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, which commissioned the poll, was surprised that I was so surprised. Things had been really bad for ages, he said, directing me to not dissimilar numbersin 2016and 2019.This is the first year the community has included the question about the hijab, which strikes its own particularly depressing note. The hijab was a hot talking point in the early to mid-2000s, when military support for the US in its interventions in Afghanistan was often rhetorically justified by the toxic misogyny of the Taliban. Veils of all kinds came to represent the subjugation of women, to the dismay ofmany at the time.But 20 years have passed, during which time we’ve seen Boris Johnson use the burqa in what was condemned as aracist calloutto Telegraph readers, and the French experiment with banning full face veils – such as a niqab or burqa – in any public place, a chilling curtailment of, if not technically a human right, then what instinctively feels like any woman’s birthright to wear whatever the hell she pleases. Understanding has deepened, in other words – of the racism that anti-veil rhetoric often disguises, and the fact that to make a judgment about who’s controlling a woman and the extent of her autonomy, you have to know her pretty well. Or at the very least, have met her.If the figures aren’t striking to those who have been paying attention, they remain shocking, particularly when you compare the numbers with those who have a negative view of other religions: 7% have a bad opinion of Christians, 13% think poorly of Jewish people, 14% of Sikhs and 15% of Hindus. This has been a 25-year slide, from the idea that “Muslim extremists have views incompatible with British life” to “all Muslims”; and if people were making that elision already, it was not previously sayable. Sayeeda Warsi said in 2011 that Islamophobia was becoming socially acceptable – at the Conservative party conference she said it had “passed the dinner-table test”. The can’t be right, I remember thinking then – she must just be meeting too many Conservatives. Now we’re at the point where it’s not only socially acceptable, but socially dominant.In 2015, the US thinktank Center for American Progress publishedFear, Inc 2.0: The Islamophobia Network’s Efforts to Manufacture Hate in America, a revision of an earlier report by the author Wajahat Ali. It presented a forensic account of how post-9/11 feelings of grief and threat had been weaponised to produce a prejudice that had barely previously registered, and it made for depressing reading for several reasons.First, it revealed the amount of money pouring in to the creation of this narrative and from what sources (most of it was quite easily traceable back to billionaires and banking interests, which were simultaneously hosing cash at climate crisis counter-narratives among other conservative agendas). Second, it showed how coordinated and organised so many incredibly well-financed thinktanks were, amplifying one another’s messages and keeping a stable of ready commenters for broadcasters hungry for a hot-button issue. Third, the report laid bare how incredibly effective this network was in turning what were once “fringe, extremist views” (in Ali’s words) into mainstream talking points and wedge issues.The UK, however, seemed to lack a few core components of this campaign. There weren’t any obvious funders with deep pockets; evangelical Christians weren’t a strong voice in politics; and it had stronger regulation of hate speech in broadcasting (though weaker regulation in print). As it turned out, it didn’t matter. The US lab created this virus, and we caught it.Never have the effects of Islamophobia been so obvious, or so bleak. To read the domestic news, you would think that no grooming gang had ever contained a non-Muslim. In the rolling news cycle of even our public service broadcasting, Muslim lives are consideredless valuablethan non-Muslim ones, their loss less tragic. It would be functionally impossible to stand up in parliament and justify arms sales to Israel, small boats hysteria and inhumane treatment of asylum seekers, were it not for the groundwork that Islamophobia has laid.In subtler ways, this casual demonisation puffs up a notion of “British values” that are nowhere in evidence, nowhere defended, except in the supposed dichotomy with a Muslim worldview. Truthfully, if anyone cared to pin down a Muslim value that’s incompatible with a British one, it would be unlikely to flatter in the way this framing assumes. Last spring, I met a young woman who had been caring for her autistic brother since she was tiny. She said, in passing, that her faith had helped a lot, because in Islam, people with disabilities were prized, as were their carers, and their treatment as equals was a prerequisite for faithful Muslims. I hadn’t heard anything less like a modern British value in my life.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This year, more than ever, I have started to question what the purpose of it really is. Though I’ve been celebrating companies that took a stand against Donald Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders, under the radar I have noticed an insidious censorship rearing its head.Since 2023 we have been witness to one of the worst atrocities of our lifetimes. Livestreamed to our phones, we have seen the slaughter ofat least 58,000 Palestinians, more than17,000 of them children, and many of them in hospitals, schools, refugee camps and food queues. We have seen the denial of water, electricity and medical supplies, the obliteration of communities,mass manmade starvation, and continued calls by Israeli ministers for the permanent expulsion or eradication of Palestinians in Gaza. Israel’s plans for a so-calledhumanitarian cityto be built on the ruins of Rafah has been described by the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert as a “concentration camp”.Yet, althoughmore than 200 companiesreleased statements after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 – wholeheartedly condemning it and donating money to relief funds – since then, there has been a relative silence in the face of the ongoing destruction in Gaza.One senior manager I spoke to said he had received an email telling him to remind staff they weren’t allowed to wear “political” badges during the Gaza conflict. Another company leader firmly stated, “We’re an apolitical company. Our staff need to remember that.” Last year, 50 employees werefired by Googleafter protesting against its and Amazon’s $1.2bn (£900m) Project Nimbus cloud infrastructure contract with the Israeli government. And just last weekend we saw an official at the Royal Opera Houseattempt to snatch the Palestinian flagfrom a cast member who unfurled it on stage after a performance.All these organisations have DEI agendas. They say they are committed to inclusion and equal opportunity, and to enhancing business growth through diversity. Yet it seems this commitment is conditional on people’s silence. You can belong, as long as you don’t make us uncomfortable. We value your identity, as long as it’s not political.Yet the companies themselves are not devoid of politics. Arecent reportby the UN special rapporteur for Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, backed by a number of high-profile economists, exposes the vast number of businesses who have been enabling or profiting from the Israeli military operation in Gaza. “The report shows why the genocide carried out by Israel continues … because it is lucrative for many,”it says, highlighting not just arms manufacturers but also the complicity of big tech, household brands and even educational institutions.Booking.com and Airbnb have beenlisting propertiesin illegal Israeli settlements, enabling profit from stolen land. And, in the most stark cases of corporate hypocrisy, companies such as BAE Systems, which is directly tied to theIsraeli military machineand dehumanisation of Palestinians, proudly brand themselves as champions ofdignity and respect.For the first time, I have found myself questioning not just how we do DEI work, but whether it means anything at all. If DEI is about rewiring unjust systems, how can companies silence staff who speak out or, worse, actively profit from a brutal war machine, and still claim to be inclusive? What is the role of DEI, if not to embed values and basic humanity within the company?British ministers are betting they won’t face justice for complicity over Gaza. It’s a big risk to take | Owen JonesRead moreWhat is even more frustrating is that we have a direct blueprint of how business leaders can approach this. Since the invasion of Ukraine, more than1,000 companieshave voluntarily curtailed operations in Russia as a recognition that they don’t stand for war crimes, the murder of civilians or the ensuing humanitarian crisis. They hung Ukrainian flags on their buildings, donated tens of millions to humanitarian organisations, offered housing and created fast-track hiring schemes for Ukrainian refugees. The Royal Opera House itself published a statement insupport of Ukraine, lit up its building in the Ukrainian flag colours, and for a period of time played the Ukrainian national anthem before every performance.For many staff, this contrast makes the corporate silence onGazafeel even more pointed. It’s not “apolitical”, it’s a choice. And it is a failure of DEI, which at its core is about challenging systems that breed inequality. It is rooted in values of fairness, dignity and respect for all. This isn’t simply about respecting racial or religious difference on an interpersonal level, it’s about who you invest in (or divest from), what you choose to speak out on, how you balance profit with purpose. To stay silent in the face of mass violence sends a clear message: some lives don’t matter.What gives me hope is the people-powered movements within companies. Staff are holding their leaders to account. Be that employees at the Boston Consulting Group who shared a letter to the company’s top managementdemanding an endto its involvement in the development of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, staff at the Berlin-based retail company Zalando protesting against the dismissal of an Arab employee who criticised its support of Israel, or the more than 100 BBC staff who spoke out against censorship in its reporting of Israel/Palestine. These ordinary workers are taking up the mantle where DEI is failing.We need to move away from this current sanitised, apolitical version of DEI towards one with meaning. Core values of dignity, humanity and fairness need to be integral to business decisions, not just corporate buzzwords. If you stand for nothing, you will fall for anything. And that’s not a DEI I want to be part of.Jinan Younis is the founder of diversity, equity and inclusion agency WeCalibrate and former assistant politics editor at gal-dem magazineExplore more on these topicsDEI policiesOpinionGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

Now I hope to reclaim my freedomFri 25 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 05.22 EDTShareWhat criminal organisations fear most is the written word. That is what a court in Italy has established for the first time. It has taken 17 years for me to see justice done, but it finally came on 14 July. The court of appeals in Romeupheld a 2021 verdictin which the mafia boss Francesco Bidognetti and his former lawyer were found guilty of mafia-related threats against me.Bidognetti is the head of one of the most powerful and violent Camorra clans: the Casalesi. He is already in jail, serving a life sentence. Yet far from being merely symbolic, the new sentences (Bidognetti got a year and a half, his lawyer Michele Santonastaso a year and two months) are momentous.They are punishment for a case that involved no ordinary act of intimidation, but one that was unique in the history of organised crime. It was performed in public in March 2008, during the 10-year “Spartacus” maxi-trial, which involved 115 defendants and resulted in 27 life sentences including Bidognetti’s.That day, through his lawyer, Bidognetti publicly expressed his own criminal truth by singling out two journalists – myself and Rosaria Capacchione – to be held responsible if he were convicted. Santonastaso read a document aloud in court – a “proclamation” that we later learned echoed statements made by terrorist organisations.It was an unprecedented act in the history of mafia trials. The message was chilling: if the two mafia bosses in the dock, Bidognetti andAntonio Iovine, ended up in prison – as they did – the guilt would be ours. Our reporting, our complaints and our influence on prosecutors would be to blame.After reading out the document, Santonastaso removed his robes. It was a symbolic gesture to say from that moment on, the game would be played outside the walls of the court. The proclamation had served a specific purpose: to silence me and other journalists, and inform people outside the court that those responsible for Bidognetti’s conviction had names.At the time, a murderous Camorra hit squad operated a reign of terror in Campania. It reported directly to Bidognetti. This armed gang,led by Giuseppe Setola, committed a vast number of heinous crimes intended to demonstrate that the power of the clan persisted, despite trials and convictions. In September 2008, for example, Setola spearheaded the Castel Volturno killing, in which six African migrants, who had no involvement in criminal activity, lost their lives.To understand the scope of the proclamationagainst me it is important to also understand the history and savagery of its author. Bidognetti, nicknamedCicciotto di Mezzanotte– because anyone who stood between him and his business would seemezzanotte(midnight) descend on them – heads an organisation that built its power on blood, fear and the devastation of its territory through theillegal dumping of toxic wastefrom all over Italy.In 1993 he ordered the murder of Gennaro Falco, an innocent doctor who had been treating Bidognetti’s first wife, Teresa Tamburrino. Falco was accused by the Bidognetti family of failing to diagnose a tumour in timeto save her life. The doctor was murdered by Bidognetti’s son, Raffaele.But the violence did not start there. In December 1980, during a shootout, Bidognetti used Filomena Morlando, 25, as a human shield. She was killed in the crossfire. In another incident, Antonio Petito, a young man who had no involvement with the Camorra, had an altercation with another of Bidognetti’s sons, Gianluca. Petito was killed for “lack of respect for the boss’s son”.After the proclamation in court, my protection was immediately strengthened, from level three (an armoured car and two agents) to level two (two armoured cars and five agents). Life under protection means existing in an eternal armoured present, in a home that is both a refuge and a prison. It means losing not only your freedom of movement, but also your interpersonal and emotional freedom. Every encounter is behind closed doors. There is no privacy. Intimacy evaporates. Spontaneity is erased.The consequences are not only practical, but profound. My romantic relationships have been compromised. Friendships have dwindled under the weight of my situation. Anyone who interacts with me feels the need to protect me, to absorb some of my tension. That is unbearable for anyone.For 17 years I have faced trials, hearings and efforts to smear my name. Not only by the clans, but also elements of the state that were meant to protect me but instead made my isolation worse.Anti-mafia reporting has been isolated, criminalised, dragged through tribunals. In this silence, the mafia has won. It has disappeared from public discourse, but not from reality. It has morphed into an economic power, a form of criminal capitalism – invisible but pervasive.The 14 July verdict goes beyond symbolism: it was an act of judicial recognition that Bidognetti’s 2008 proclamation was athreat, and directly related to his mafia enterprise. We can further deduce that it wasa “fatwa”, a signal to anyone in the clan who might want to climb the ranks by eliminating a named target.For the first time in a trial involving a crime organisation, we can see that the mafia considers investigative journalists to be the main cause of its defeats. According to this criminal logic, to write, report or investigate means to interfere with justice. And so those who write about the mafia have to be punished. It is an acknowledgment that anything that might happen to me from now on will bear its signature.I emerge from this ordeal in pieces. I have sacrificed my life to an all-consuming battle. My existence is a form of life sentence, suspended between fear, isolation and surveillance. Solitude is the added punishment for courage.It is likely that nothing inItalywill change, but I can at least say I helped expose the ways in which the mafia operates. And believe me, it is not limited to Italy – it is a network that targets global financial centres, including London.I will remain under police protection indefinitely, because the judges confirmed that the mafia bosses fear what I write. But I don’t want to go on living like this. Little by little, I will take responsibility for reclaiming my freedom – for taking my life back, even at my own risk. Enough of this half existence: neither fully alive, nor dead.Roberto Saviano is an investigative journalist and the author of GomorrahDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But Ozzy felt more like my discovery, in 1981 or so. I was six years old, a neighbour had Blizzard of Ozz and I would just would stare at that album cover. I fell in love. The Randy Rhoads guitar solos, and then you would see footage of Ozzy and he looked as if he was having the time of his life up there. For a kid, he almost seemed like a cartoon character; the joy he was experiencing was infectious, but also the music was visceral. He became my favourite musician. I had a boombox next to my bed with the Tribute live album on at a low volume so nobody in the house would wake up, and I’d go to sleep to Ozzy every night.There’s something about his vocal phrasing, a timbre that’s so perfectly matched with the music that’s playing underneath. He had the ability to emote and tell a story and draw you in, and the melodies he chose were really special. I don’t think he got enough credit as asinger– to the layperson he was this madman, and to them, the magic lay there and not in his abilities. But the way he sang was so unique and powerful. It’s so ingrained in my mind that when I listen back to stuff that I’ve done in Mastodon, when I sing, I can tell that it’s so heavily influenced by him. I like big, heavy riffs with an almost evil-sounding, dark, high-pitched vocal tonality: that’s Ozzy to a T.I met him at Ozzfest in 2005: I had got a Randy Rhoads [tribute] drum kit made, and he, Sharon and Zakk Wylde came over in a golf cart to look at it. But I usually kept my distance just because I’m such a huge fan and didn’t want to get in the way.Then Mastodon got to play Back to the Beginning [Ozzy and Black Sabbath’s farewell concert on 5 July]. Some icons of music, they didn’t know when it was their last show – take Prince, for instance. And so it was really, really special [for them to perform a definitive final show]. Mastodon were on first and I was unsure if it was going to be just a couple of people in the crowd when we played. But we were driving to the stadium, passing all the pubs, and they were filled with people and you could hear Sabbath blasting out of them at 9.30am. And then we got there and all the bands, from Metallica to Slayer to Anthrax, are at the side of the stage, they want to see us do our thing. It was this really palpable energy, this big feeling of love forBlack Sabbath, to honour them the proper way.View image in fullscreenPure energy …  Ozzy Osbourne (left) and guitarist Zakk Wylde.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesBut then you knew that the big moment was looming: Ozzy’s gonna play. This is the last time you’re gonna hear Crazy Train.[Dailor begins crying.]Mr Crowley, the beginning, the organ, it was so powerful. Everybody was crying. It was just like, oh my God, this is the last time we’re going to see this. Then Tony’s guitar, Geezer’s bass – he was ripping, it was insane – and Bill’s drums. Those four super-special guys doing their thing. The gravity of the moment hit everybody at the same time, that this is it. It was a beautiful moment to be in.Sabbath were so influential because they were so riff-centric, and that just really didn’t exist before. You had some bands that were close to it – but nobody really took that leap into the sound of horror. Like with Led Zeppelin, it got kind of dark; with Deep Purple, there were some moments. Something was swirling around in the air – but Black Sabbath realised it. They knew people were lining up to go and see these scary movies, these Hammer films, and they wanted to get scared. They knew that could be a real wealth of inspiration, to really tap into this darkness that exists out there and inside of everyone, but also in a playful way.That darkness that you chase, that thing that resonates inside of you, it’s the devil’s chord – it just makes you feel something. If we’re composing something [in Mastodon], and it’s not evil enough, I’d rather it be more evil, please; we need to find different notes because this sounds too happy and I don’t like that. I lovebeinghappy, but the darkness makes me happier, somehow. Like Ozzy, I grew up in an industrial area – Rochester, New York – and it’s not all sunshine and happiness and roses. That’s not what’s happening in real life. And if you’re writing about sunshine and rainbows all the time, you’re kidding yourself. [Heavy metal] helps to try to unpack it and understand why some of the terrible things happen in the world, and it helps you get through it.‘I adored how much he loved the Beatles’Sam Carter, vocals, ArchitectsOzzy Osbournewas such a beautiful soul. He basically created metal as a genre, and we’re all so grateful to him for that. I also adored how much he loved the Beatles – as a Beatles superfan myself, I always used him as proof that without the Beatles, there would be no Sabbath and no Ozzy.He gave people like me the belief that I could become a touring musician, too. He showed us that if you care enough and work hard enough, you can make it – and you can do it without being a dickhead, but with a smile on your face. I will always be grateful to have had him as an idol.Ozzy Osbourne’s final performance revealed fragility was the metal god’s true power | Lauren MartinRead more‘They call him the Prince of Darkness, but maybe he’s a bit bigger than that now’Lita Ford, guitar, the RunawaysThe first concert I ever saw in my life was Black Sabbath at the Long Beach Arena in California, in 1971, when I was 12. The place was packed, just unlike anything I had ever seen. The guys in the band had this long thick black hair – you couldn’t even see them for all the blackness, though you could see these big gold crosses that they would wear. Along with the music and the power that was coming off the stage, they were the coolest thing ever. It absolutely carved my future out for me. I thought: I want to make people feel like these guys are making me feel right now.I had already been playing guitar for two years, but I started to live and breathe it. When I turned 14, I hitchhiked across California to go to the California Jam [festival]. The last thing you need to be doing as a young girl is hitchhiking, but I had to go. I was able to work my way into a hole through the fence, next thing I know I’m right in front of the stage. Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Emerson, Lake & Palmer … A lot of the things you hear Ozzy sing are not easy, but some of the high notes, he seemed to hit them effortlessly. His voice has so much character, it’s haunting, almost a cry.And then I ended up having a hit solo single with him in 1988. Sharon Osbourne was my manager and she came by the studio I was recording in, in North Hollywood, with Ozzy. Ozzy and I went into a little side room and just started pinging ideas back and forth. Nothing was pre-recorded; he didn’t have a title, I didn’t have a riff. We were in there all night, because when we came out of that room, the sun was coming up. That was Close My Eyes Forever: magic was created in that room, and who would have thought it would have been such a huge song [reaching No 8 in the US charts].With Sharon being my manager, Ozzy was always there. They were crazy. The stuff they did to each other – it wasn’t like any other relationship I’ve ever known. They were perfect for each other, that’s for sure, because he could dish it out and she could dish it out even bigger. She and Ozzy would play games with each other to let the other know they’ve pissed them off. You’d walk through a hotel and you’d see a pair of shoes out in the hallway, and you’d think: I wonder why Ozzy’s shoes are there? Well, Sharon had had enough of him, and she’d crapped in his shoes. And then of course he would crap in her shoes at a later date. He’d get her back.They came to my parents’ house one day for Easter dinner, and my mom had roasted a leg of lamb. Sharon and Ozzy come in, and Ozzy chugs a bottle of wine. He doesn’t drink the wine in a glass, he just drinks it out of the bottle, like it’s the last little bit of fluid he’s ever going to taste. And he starts sinking lower and lower into the chair until the wine’s gone. And then my father asks Ozzy to cut the lamb. Ozzy starts, but it slips off the plate and goes underneath the table. Ozzy says: “I’m sorry, I don’t eat meat!” My dad laughed his ass off.He’s the biggest, greatest rock star in the world. Right up to everything he did in the past month, doing the concert. Whether he could stand up and walk or not, he still delivered the songs, and the band killed it. I hate to say it, but it’s kind of the way to go: like a king. They call him the Prince of Darkness, but maybe he’s a bit bigger than that now.‘It’s absolutely disarming, the way he’s delivering his truth’Joe Duplantier, vocals/guitar, GojiraThe way he departed this world was absolutely magnificent. Raising all that money for charity with Back to the Beginning, bringing the whole scene together like this – and then he’s gone. It is very sad and at the same time, so perfect in a way.Back to the Beginning was like taking a picture of what the metal scene is. Of course Iron Maiden weren’t around; a lot of English bands were missing. But Slayer, Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax … all these people that mean so much. We’ve played thousands of shows, had so many important shows, but this one takes the cake. It is way more powerful than eventhe Olympic Games performance that we did last year. There was no competition involved like in the Olympics – this was art, spirituality, emotions. And everybody knew they were seeing Ozzy for the last time. I cried.There’s a purity to the lyrics he sings, and to his attitude. It’s absolutely disarming, the way he’s delivering his truth and saying that he’s going to do whatever he wants to do. The world is yours – you just have to decide it. The song Under the Sun that we covered at Back to the Beginning was very much like that, and I’m pretty sure he influenced a lot of the punk and thrash scenes with that speech, which is basically: fuck you, I’m going to be myself. It’s so basic, but so needed in our societies. Whenever [Gojira] talk about environment or equality between people or doing the right thing, it’s with this attitude, an attitude that is typical Ozzy.Before we knew he had died we were playing a show in Istanbul. It’s almost impossible to catch us playing a cover version – we’re proud like that, we’re French, we want to do our thing. But that day in Istanbul, we had decided to play Under the Sun. During the show, one of the fans in the front row put “Rest In Peace Ozzy” on his phone and held it up to me. That’s how I learned that Ozzy died. I checked with my tour manager on the side of the stage and they confirmed it. So I went to the microphone and told 9,000 people the news. Everybody stayed completely silent. The whole show shifted to a very deep tone. And at the end, we played the cover and there was a lot of emotion and a lot of people crying. It’s beyond words what I felt: one of the most epic moments in my life. I have children, I witnessed their birth, that would be number one for sure. But being on stage and playing a Black Sabbath song with everybody as one … in the lyrics he says: “I don’t want no one to tell me where I’m gonna go when I die.” I believe in a sort-of afterlife, and I was imagining him on his way there as I was singing that line.View image in fullscreenBoundless energy … Ozzy during a photoshoot for the cover of Diary of a Madman.Photograph: Fin Costello/RedfernsAt Back to the Beginning, it was amazing to see people being so supportive of this guy and this lifestyle and whatever it generates and communicates. There’s something in this genre that brings people together and gives hope. It’s a secret code: I see a metalhead in Japan or Turkey or Greece and we just know: we’re rooting for truth and we’re rooting for power. But the good power, the power that you find in a volcano or in a wave. And pointing at things that society won’t look at, but metal does.Metaltalks about pain, suffering, blood, and death: the one thing we all have in common. It’s not a political party, it’s not a religion, it’s this thing that we share, and we think more people should join and share that.‘I was in a room with him just 10 days ago’Randy Blythe, vocals, Lamb of GodThe guys in Sabbath didn’t walk around saying: we created heavy metal. But those of us who play music in this genre pretty universally point to Black Sabbath as the first metal band. We had toured with the original lineup before, we toured with Ozzy before, and we were very cognisant of the fact that we were invited to play with the creators. So getting to play their final show was just a tremendous honour and pretty overwhelming for all the band.His death is a very odd thing because all of us are still very much on a high from the concert, and I was in a room with him just 10 days ago, at Comic-Con, his last public appearance. He was really full of life and happiness over the whole Back to the Beginning thing. I was thanking him for the show, for having Lamb of God, and I’m like: “Oh, we went by 154 Lodge Road.” Because me and my lady and Ozzy’s agent went to see Ozzy’s childhood home: a tiny little terrace house in Aston. I told Ozzy and he gave me a big smile: “I bet that fucking guy who lives there is sick of hearing about me!” And he just busted out laughing. He was in a really good mood; he went out on a high note. His death is very sad, but my heart is full, because I got to witness him say goodbye to his fans. He said it a few years ago: if I can just play one more show and drop dead at the end, I’ll die as a happy man. So he got to do that.In 2012, I was in prison in Prague [Blythe was charged with manslaughter after a Lamb of God fan died from a fall off stage, and he was later acquitted]. I had paid bail, over $200,000. But the prosecuting attorney apparently did not like the fact that I had been given bail, he made some sort of objection, and I wasn’t released. So Ozzy and Sharon both said things via social media in support of me, but more importantly, they wrote a letter to the judge attesting to my character and offering to throw an Ozzfest concert in Prague, the proceeds from which would go to any desired charity. They didn’t ask them to find me not guilty, they just wanted them to honour my bail. It’s not cheap to put on an Ozzfest, so the fact that they were willing to do that, and stick up for a member of their extended musical family, speaks volumes to their character.When I was in prison, I didn’t have access to English newspapers or the internet. I came out into the prison yard one day, and all these dudes came up to me, speaking in broken English, very excited and impressed. “Ozzy Osbourne says good things for you.” When you’re in a foreign prison, and people are stoked that Ozzy is speaking up for you, it makes a difference. I’ll always be grateful for that.View image in fullscreenFinal bow … Ozzy on stage at the Back to the Beginning show at Villa Park.Photograph: Black Sabbath/Ross HalfinOzzy was not a pitch-perfect singer. He was not some Auto-Tuned product; there was a great humanity to his voice. The most important thing is his voice was singular, and a bit unhinged. A couple of times I’ve even confused a Led Zeppelin song with someone else because the vocals were similar enough. That has never, ever happened with any Ozzy song.‘Sabbath and Ozzy were a lesson in being yourself at all costs’Lzzy Hale, vocals/guitar, HalestormI remember a very early conversation with my parents about the difference between the music that you might hear at the grocery store where it’s kind of meant to fade in the background and not really be noticed, and rock’n’roll, and specifically Black Sabbath, that is meant to stop you in your tracks. From a very early age, that was the kind of music that I was attracted to. There’s a rite of passage, specifically for a woman who is attracted to that type of music: I lost a lot of friends, but Sabbath and Ozzy were a lesson in being yourself at all costs. You’re not doing it to be well liked, but because it is essentially a part of who you are. So many of the mission statements for our songs go back to that foundation.It’s actually been a shock to find out that he is mortal, because Ozzy was meant to live for ever. He’d survived so much in the business and been through drugs, alcohol, the quad bike accident [that nearly killed him in 2003] and illness, but he had so much love in his heart up till the end and was still hungry for it and doing it for the right reasons. When we played the Back to the Beginning final show, he was visibly frustrated that he couldn’t get out of the chair. There was a moment where it looked as if he was going to get up as if he was thinking: “Dude, I have wings.” Ultimately it’s about what we leave behind, how many many smiles we create and how much love we pass on, and what a wonderful man Ozzy was for all of that.‘I was a little worse for wear but in comparison to the Sabbath guys I was an Olympic athlete’Rick Wakeman, keyboards, YesYes ended up supporting Sabbath on a big American tour, and I hit it off with them right from the beginning. We were drinkers and kindred spirits in that we loved the social aspect. I ended up – much to the disdain of the Yes guys – travelling with Ozzy, Tony, Bill and Geezer on their own plane, surrounded by beer crates. It was brilliant. Ozzy said: “We’ve got some Minimoog lines that need doing, will you come and do it?” That’s how I got to play on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973).Yes were recording in studio three at Morgan Studios in north London and they were in studio two over the road. When I went over at about one o’clock in the morning I was a little worse for wear but in comparison to the Sabbath guys I was an Olympic athlete. The word “comatose” comes to mind. The only person who wascompos mentiswas the tape op, who was sort of terrified. He set the track up and I played what I thought was OK. Ozzy opened his eyes, said: “Fucking brilliant!” then he closed his eyes again. I think I ended up crashing there as well. There was even talk of me defecting to Sabbath but someone said: “We’ll lose what we have,” because at the time metal bands were all guitars and didn’t have keyboard players. I said: “One day that will change,” and it did. My son Adam ended up playing [keyboards] with Ozzy for 20 years and when he joined he asked me what I’d played on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. I said: “I can barely remember being there – can you let me know?”Some years after that I played on Ozzy’s Ozzmosis album (1995), which is still one of my favourite albums to this day. It’s almost prog metal. I certainly think most prog bands would have been delighted to have written a track like Perry Mason. That time, in the studio he was a lot more on the ball and much more knowledgable about what he wanted than people give him credit for. He was very clever at being the caricature of himself that the media wanted when they wanted it, but when it came down to music, he was a bright boy.I honestly think Sharon saved his life. I met them when they’d first got together on Ozzy’s first solo tour back in 1981 or something, which Sharon was production managing or something. I knew she was [the infamous music manager] Don Arden’s daughter and Ozzy said: “Rick, I can tell you because you’re a mate, but we’re an item.” I asked Sharon: “What does your dad think?” and she said: “He doesn’t know yet.” I wouldn’t want to have been in the room when they told him, but years later he said the only person that ever got one over on him was his daughter, because he’d taught her well. I’d never seen Ozzy so happy. Very few marriages don’t go through some sort of turmoil and theirs was very public, but they genuinely loved each other.View image in fullscreenLife saver … Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne were married for 43 years.Photograph: DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/ShutterstockI feel honoured to have worked with him. Ozzy sang Buried Alive on my Return to the Centre of the Earth album (1999) and did a fantastic job on it. I had the London Symphony Orchestra and he just thought it was great fun. A journalist asked him what he thought of the track, Oz went: “Fucking brilliant,” and that was the end of the interview. Ozzy could be hilarious, but had so many different sides and one of his endearing qualities for me is that he did a lot of really good things for charities and such, but didn’t wave a flag about it. Sharon was the same. They just got on and did it, which is how it should be. I’m going to miss him a lot even though I didn’t see him that much, but in a strange way he’ll never go away. People will always keep telling stories about him and I think that’s the legacy he’d like to leave.‘The riffs, the solos, the songs – it just oozed metal’Scott Ian, guitar/lyrics, AnthraxWhen Anthrax came together in the early 80s, we had all grown up with Sabbath – no Sabbath, no Anthrax. And then Ozzy comes out with these two genre-defining and -expanding solo records, with this new hot guitar player Randy Rhoads, and the riffs, the solos, the songs – it justoozedmetal. Everything he did was such an influence on us.I wouldn’t have even become a guitar player if it wasn’t for Sabbath. After taking guitar lessons for six months and being bored with my teacher trying to make me learn theory, all I wanted to do was listen to Sabbath and Zeppelin and learn how to play those songs. And so when he wouldn’t help me do that, I stopped lessons, and I would sit and listen to Sabbath records and learn the chords by ear. That’s literally how I learned how to play guitar.Ozzy was right up at the top of our list of guys we wanted a singer to sound like. Most of our peers, they all had vocalists who were shouters or yellers: James Hetfield, Tom Araya, Dave Mustaine, Paul Baloff, you could even put Lemmy in that category. The vision we always had for Anthrax was we wanted a singer, more in the vein of someone like Ozzy or Bruce Dickinson or Rob Halford, a voice that could be really aggressive but also really melodic at the same time.View image in fullscreenAnthrax pose for a photo after playing at the  Back to the Beginning concert, with Scott Ian in the centre.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesSabbath’s lyrics, people think of witches and demons, but so much had to do with the horrors of war. They grew up in postwar Birmingham, one of the most bombed places in the country. They had front-row seats to that, the savagery of it. On that first Anthrax record I wrote lyrics for, Spreading the Disease, there are lyrics about war, about being a disenfranchised teenager and having to fight for everything you have, about organised religion, which was all in me from listening to Sabbath records. I saw that there was a bigger world than my mother’s apartment in Bayside, Queens, and Sabbath was one of those things that opened that door for me, along with Stephen King or Marvel Comics. It opened my mind and it helped me use my imagination.Just so much of Sabbath still holds up, lyrically. They all saw, at a very young age, that the world was not a friendly place. And the powers that be are only in it for themselves. War Pigs: that song came out when Vietnam was still raging, but could itbemore prescient now?I met Ozzy in 1988 when he took Anthrax on tour in the US for two months. Every band that would open for Ozzy on these giant arena tours would then blow up in popularity – Mötley Crüe, Metallica, and it was the same for us. I’d say the deepest conversation I had with him was about AC/DC’s Bon Scott – it’s very rare to meet somebody who actually got to hang out with Bon. I said: what was he like? He thought about it for a second, and goes: “Now, Bon, he was a drinker.” Coming from Ozzy, that sets the bar pretty high.We had a different experience than, say, seven years earlier when he was still the bat-biting, dove-head-ripper-offer. He would pop his head through the door of our dressing room backstage and go: “You alright, mates? You need anything? Don’t bother talking to the crew people, just come see me and I’ll take care of it.” And that was every day. His kids were running around backstage – the world was a different place for him at that point. It’s one of those amazing things that when you meet your hero and he’s better than you can hope for.For a Brummie like me, Ozzy Osbourne’s voice mattered | Adrian ChilesRead more‘He’d order a quadruple brandy and neck it’Mick Box, guitar, Uriah HeepHe always had top-notch players with him – he even had three members of Uriah Heep [Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake and John Sinclair]. So, when we were recording our 1982 album Abominog in the Roundhouse studios, he was constantly popping down there and having a drink with us at the pub across the road. He’d order a quadruple brandy and I’d think: oh, it’s going to be one of them nights. He’d leave it there on the bar for quite a while, going on talking and joking, and then he’d just turn around and neck it. He said: “I hate the taste of it, I like what it does to me.” When you’re in his company, you’re always laughing; he’s just one of those characters. He did take the world quite seriously, on conspiracy theories and things like that at one point – but generally, there was just a funny side in everything.I like his later stuff, like [his debut solo album] Blizzard of Ozz. It rocked the heavy metal world, knocked it on its breeches, because it was that good. Being fired from Sabbath, I guess there was a degree of floundering about, but when that lineup came together, it really did take him into the stratosphere.If you’re looking at great [rock and metal] singers, you’d say Ronnie James Dio: a beautiful, creamy, lovely voice. But Ozzy had an equal to that in his own way: very powerful, and very recognisable, which is almost as important as anything else in music. There’ll never be another character like him. He was the godfather of everything, basically.View image in fullscreenBlack Sabbath, with Tony Iommi, Bill Ward, Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler.Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImage‘He reminded me of a hobbit – he had this beautiful whimsical side’Eleanor Livingston, vocals/guitar, Die SpitzMy dad introduced me to Black Sabbath and Blizzard of Ozz when I was really young. I would run around in my underwear and listen to Crazy Train; Mr Crowley was my favourite Ozzy song when I was a kid. When I was 10 I saw him live at the Moody Amphitheater in Austin [Texas]. There was this giant bucket of water on stage and between songs he would dunk his head fully in and you’d see the water splash out. That image stayed with me.When we started a band at the first show we ever did we played Paranoid, because it was the easiest one to play, but I’ve probably learned the riffs to at least 15 Sabbath songs. We were hugely influenced by Sabbath and in terms of performance, I always wanted that crazy fun attitude that Ozzy had. It always felt he wanted to create a world that people couldn’t be part of, but his soul was very gentle: he’d always say “God bless you” during shows and he was always talking about his children. He reminded me of a hobbit, and had this beautiful whimsical side. The biggest thing he taught me was that it’s OK to look how you want to and do your own thing, and not to doubt myself.It surprises people that we make the music we do because we’re women, but I’m not going to present myself as a pretty, meek girl or whatever. He presented himself as a freak and as much as people hated him initially, he made that iconic. There was a video of ours that went kinda viral where I’m hopping like a frog, and then I rewatched this Sabbath show from Paris in the 70s and Ozzy was hopping like a frog and generally being insane, and I thought: “Ah, that’s where it came from.” He influenced my dad, then me and I’m sure if I ever have kids I’ll tell them about him. He truly was one of a kind.‘There was a childlike playfulness that he carried on stage’MattBaty, vocals, Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs PigsThe blueprint for our band was heavily influenced by Sabbath, in the way that we wanted to tread that line between something quite heavy and serious-sounding, but counterpoint that with something celebratory and triumphant. And have music that people could, when it’s performed live, just completely enter into another world with. There’s amazing mental health benefits to that – like even just being a member of an audience going to see like a band that I love, if they can make me switch off for an hour and just kind of trample down all of those like horrible racing thoughts on a day-to-day basis, that’s magic.I also like to add to balance out the doom with a bit of a bit more of a positive message, or at least the message of: we’re in this together. Even when you think about [Osbourne’s 1980 debut solo single] Crazy Train, there’s that line that I absolutely love: “Millions of people living as foes but maybe it’s not too late to learn how to love and forget how to hate”. How beautiful is that? And it’s in a metal song.I’ve thought about that final performance quite a bit in the past couple of weeks because one of the things that struck me about Ozzy was even though he was sat down, he was still commanding the stage. You would hear a huge cheer from the audience just via him pulling particular faces. The greatest performers are the ones that can express themselves emotionally in a genuine way like that. As soon as things kind of become huge productions in huge arenas, performances can become, well, performative. Whereas Ozzy, he always felt genuine; there was a childlike playfulness that he carried on stage that was very endearing.There’s a live in Paris video from 1970, and I absolutely love that performance – he’s out of this world as a vocalist on that. And then California Jam, 1974, it’s incredible. It looks as if they’re playing in front of like a million people. They play Children of the Grave and there’s a dichotomy to it – it’s called Children of the Grave, right? But it’s a really celebratory and uplifting song. I’ve just put it on now: Ozzy’s wearing some gorgeous tassels.His singing is just so expressive – especially in that the earlier Sabbath catalogue, there’s no tricks to it, like straight-up blues singing, in a way. Incredibly emotive and quite raw. Rock and metal today, I find quite a lot of it quite formulaic sometimes, both the performance and the production of it. It loses a lot of character – and you could never really throw that accusation at Ozzy.The catalogue’s there; Ozzy and Sabbath are never going to be forgotten. And they’ll keep inspiring future generations of musicians to pick up a guitar or microphone and express themselves. One of the important things was they were always very open about their background as well: they came from nothing. Today there’s not a lot of hope for people in certain areas of the country, and you don’t see a lot of breakthrough artists that are truly working class – that’s a shame. Access to instruments, lessons, rehearsal spaces and the affordability of all of those things; even a pair of drumsticks now is about 15 quid. But I hope that there are kids that could look at a band like Sabbath and think: “Well, they just did it. They just got together and did it.”Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneBlack SabbathPop and rockMetalMastodonGojiraRick WakemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rob Brydon takes us inside BBC travel game Destination X, where  viewers – and contestants  – try to find themselves in EuropeAlexi DugginsFri 25 Jul 2025 08.28 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 08.55 EDTShareOutside a cinema in east London sits an absolute beast of a bus. It is jet black from wheel wells to roof, the windows are obscured by metal plates and it is so massive rock stars might kip in it prior to hopping on stage and yelling: “Hello Milton Keynes!” Essentially, it looks like a gothic Megabus commissioned by Alice Cooper. It does, however, have one key design flaw: it’s impossible to see out of. Once you’re inside, you will have no idea where you are going.For the next five weeks, expect to see a lot of this vehicle. It’s the star of the BBC’s latest big reality series, Destination X. Based on a Belgian hit, it sees 13 contestants ferried around Europe in total ignorance of their location, with the worst at identifying it being eliminated. Viewers are encouraged to guess along as its OTT challenges see contestants locked in boxes in village squares, peeping through a tiny window to work out where they are, or being whisked up a snow-topped mountain and made to hunt for clues while dangling from a rope 2,000 metres above sea level. Given that they spend an entire month living and sleeping on a coach together, there are points where cabin fever-ravaged contestants become so suspicious of each other that heated arguments flare up. It is, essentially, The Traitors meets Race Across the World – hosted byRob Brydon.View image in fullscreenMountain to climb … contestants are whisked up to snow-capped peaks to find clues to their destination.Photograph: BBC/TwoFourToday, I am its newest contestant. For the next couple of hours, I will be joining Brydon and a handful of other first-time players onboard the “X bus” for a whistlestop blind tour of London following a quick screening of the show at Hoxton’s Curzon cinema. While this may lack the scale of a pan-European jaunt, the crew’s commitment to realism means that they have painstakingly recreated the kind of temperatures you’d expect from a summer in southern Spain. Well, that or the air-conditioning is broken.“Bloody hell! Is it hot enough in here?” exclaims Brydon as he gets on the bus. He takes a moment to remove his navy blazer and mop his brow, before leaping straight back into presenting mode.“The clues are there!” he announces as the coach rumbles to life and we drive off to the sound of the most Rob Brydon thing imaginable – an impression of a TV star whose best-known work came before the 1990s. “As David Frost used to say, the clues are there as we go through the keyhole …”Exactly how you play this game is a mystery. It seems really quite random. But there’s one thing that is obvious from even a quick watch: you need your wits about you, because this is one devious TV show. The first episode opens with the contestants waiting in a packed German airport. But all the other passengers are actors. The check-in staff are fake. It is littered with details that the unknowing participants will shortly be tested on in a game they have to survive to avoid being kicked off the show – from fake couples loudly arguing about the allowable weight of luggage to names read out over the PA system. Before the passengers are even allowed on the bus, they’re stuffed into a helicopter, blindfolded and disorientated by being flown around for an hour. Hopefully, they didn’t come up with this idea based on the fact that the East German Stasi used the same tactic with political prisoners being driven to jail.But there is sneakiness here that even the Stasi didn’t think of: to make contestants think they have landed in the same place as they took off, they employ three sets of identical twins as fake airport staff. One set are in the original location, the second at the landing site. All the contestants need to do to figure it out is read the microscopic names on their identity badges.“That is the nuts!” chuckles the executive producer Dan Adamson. “We just thought: wouldn’t it be funny?”View image in fullscreenGoing round in circles … contestants start their trip with a confusing ride in a helicopter.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/CREDIT LINE:BBC/TwoFourVery sly. But while they go to extreme lengths to confuse the contestants, presumably they don’t deliberately make them think they’re in completely the wrong place? For example, at one point in Destination X’s first episode we’re shown a teaser of a screen being driven up alongside the bus as it barrels down the road, and playing a video through the window. That’s not an attempt to show fake scenery, is it? “No, we’re showing them a clue,” says Adamson. So we can trust what we’re shown through this bus’s windows should they open?“We don’t have the budget to CGI,” says Brydon. “Otherwise I would have been a bit taller!”As if on cue, the bus window pops open. We’re crossing the Thames on Tower Bridge! Well, hopefully I can trust that. Not that it is particularly useful info. How on earth do you do this?“We had players who would try to track the sun,” says Adamson. “We had one player who every time we went in a tunnel would count to see how long it was. They were trying to work out the speed and the distance of the coach. And they would react to weather, you know: it’s getting warmer, it’s getting colder …”“I would be terrible at this,” says Brydon. “If I saw the sun, that would tell me it’s daytime.”The more you hear about the show, the harder it is not to be blown away by the logistics involved. The sheer number of staff and kit meant that, according to Adamson, they had to travel in a convoy of about 50 vehicles, all of which did 11,000km in 32 days, before the 190 staff retired to one of the 7,000 hotel rooms they booked during the shoot. Every piece of food or drink had to be removed from its packaging and put in an unmarked container. To give contestants a fresh air “safe zone” after a journey, they’d park other coaches alongside the bus to create a four-walled square, top it with a camo net to prevent them seeing out and install a carpet and running machine. When Brydon arrived on location, he said the sheer scale meant it was often like they had “built a new town”.It is, however, hard not to wonder: is this the most environmentally responsible way to make a TV show? At this point in our race towards climate catastrophe, isn’t it in poor taste to pump 11,000km worth of vehicle emissions into the atmosphere – particularly given that it comes from the channel behind The Traitors, who know only too well how to create astonishingly addictive TV while barely leaving one building?According to the BBC, “Destination X is certified by Bafta Albert, which encourages sustainable TV and film production, confirming that consideration of carbon emission reduction was given throughout the production.” They point out to me that they had a “carbon action plan” whose measures included crew taking big minibuses to reduce the number of vehicles and minimising the diesel generators used – meaning they were certified two out of a possible three stars by Albert. The coaches were also not petrol, but Euro 6 diesel engines. So choosing to do all these miles is less an issue with the climate crisis, andmore one of the air quality local kids breathed.Talking of air quality, that presented its own challenge for the contestants cooped up on a coach together. “We set ourselves one rule: no number twos on the bus. That gave us a problem. Suddenly it was like: why do these people have to go to the toilet so often?” says Adamson of the fact that they had to pull the coach over every time anyone needed to go.“Everyone had to be really open about it – you couldn’t be discreet. You’d be blindfolded, chaperoned, have someone waiting outside while you did your business … I can’t believe how much time we spent talking about toilets.”At this point, Big Ben starts chiming. For a brief moment I can’t work out whether it’s real or coming over the coach’s sound system, until I look at my watch and realise it’s 2.12pm – not a usual time for a clock to chime.“He shouldn’t have been allowed his watch!” exclaims Brydon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Production staff repeatedly insist that there are clues all over the bus even though all I can see are a couple of half-inched boxes of popcorn and some flyers from the Curzon, plus a few bags of rapidly melting mini Wispas.“Is it worth mentioning to the driver that the air conditioning is ineffectual?” asks a reddening Brydon. “We’re all sitting here like lobsters in a pot.”By now, he’s looking a tad dishevelled. Which is a shame, because one of the most fun things about Destination X is Brydon going all flamboyant with his sartorial choices: from dressing like an airline captain to checked blazers that wouldn’t look out of place on Toad from The Wind in the Willows to a moment he turns up dressed as Indiana Jones. “I did look to Claudia Winkleman on The Traitors,” he says. “I’ve gone for it!”At this point, the coach grinds to a halt. We’re ushered to a recreation of “the map room”: the cubbyhole that contestants use to make their guess by placing an X on a digital map. They normally get two minutes – I’m given one. Bearing in mind the Big Ben bells we were played, I try to scroll across the map to find where Big Ben’s bell was created: Whitechapel Bell Foundry. But I can’t find it on the map. So as I run out of time, I go for plan B: Westminster, home of Big Ben.“The person whose guess was furthest from the location is …” announces one of the show’s producers, once we’ve all placed our X, “… Alexi!”Great. Last place. If this were the actual show, I’d have been booted off the coach at a random European destination. But as I step off the X bus, I find that we are … back at the Curzon cinema where we started. Exactly what sort of clues were meant to tip us off to that being our destination?“Didn’t you see the tubs of Curzon popcorn and Curzon flyers?”I thought they’d been nicked from the cinema!“There were fake tickets hidden in the cushions as well if you looked.”Brilliant. Clearly, I’d be terrible at the show. But it’s not like I missed out on much.“The prize?” I hear Adamson reply. “Oh yeah, it’s excellent … have a bag of melted Wispas.”Destination X is on BBC One on Wednesday and Thursday at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionRob BrydonReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then we see a face, trying to eat moss on a log, and a tongue searching for liquid in rocks. When Caleb Landry Jones (Dogman, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) fully emerges, his blue cape flows like a toga or a Japanese courtier’s cape, close mics capturing every tiny sound – and then exhilarating Romanian prog rock kicks in.Harvest has been described as a folk horror film – one that has sharply divided the critics – but its trippy, haunting opening, inspired byJean-Jacques Rousseau’s unfinished book Reveries of the Solitary Walker, introduces something far stranger than that. It’s been a “very personal film” for itsgenre-hopping Greek new wavedirector Athina Rachel Tsangari, whose previous work includes an avant garde commentary on Greek society (Attenberg), a twisted male friendship comedy (Chevalier) and a BBC Two series about a throuple (Trigonometry).Today, the 59-year-old is presenting a retrospective of her movies at the New Horizons film festival in Poland, where Attenberg won best film in 2011. “It’s full of people in their 20s,” she says, smiling. “Really hardcore film buffs, who come for 10 days and watch like five, six films a day.” Harvest was a project brought to her by Joslyn Barnes, who was Oscar-nominated this year for the screenplay for US reform school drama Nickel Boys. “She had a script and a mood board already, so there was a world there. I just needed to figure out how and if I fitted in.”View image in fullscreen‘He is someone who does not really belong and never will’ … Caleb Landry Jones as Walter Thirsk in Harvest.Photograph: © Jaclyn Martinez/Harvest Film LimitedAdapted from Jim Crace’s 2013 Man Booker prize-nominated novel of the same name, Harvest tells the story of the descent and destruction of a village over seven days. The cast is made up of local people from Oban in Scotland, where Harvest was filmed, and outsiders slowly enter the fray: two unnamed men who get put into stocks, a woman who is suspected of being a witch (Trigonometry’s Thalissa Teixeira), and Quill (Arinzé Kene), a map-maker tasked with charting the land.Tsangari “completely identified” with two of the lead characters, she says: Walter Thirsk (played by Landry Jones) and Quill. Why? “[Walter is] such a tragic, tragic character. You know, someone who does not really belong and he never will.” And Quill? “Because he’s the artist – his job is to draw and describe and name things. I suppose I was fearing that in the end. As an artist, you are going to be complicit with some kind of system that’s going to try to co-opt you, devour you, or employ you to its service.”Two Harry Potter alumni also put in haunting appearances: Harry Melling is the town’s weak-willed mayor and Frank Dillane, as his city cousin, arrives with a terrifying Witchfinder General vibe, as well as tall hat. Keen to preserve the novel’s peculiar mood, Tsangari turned to her “treasure trove” of favourite films, she says, including Peter Watkins’ 2000 docudramaLa Commune (Paris, 1871)and wayward 70s westernsMcCabe and Mrs MillerandThe Missouri Breaks. She doesn’t buy that Harvest is a folk horror. “It’s more pastoral … yes, there is paganism in it, but I’ve called it a nihilist western.”The passivity of its characters as dread encroaches has a contemporary power, while Crace’s setting of the story in an unspecified era – albeit with echoes of theHighland Clearances– adds to its allegorical sheen. “The last thing I wanted to do was locate it and lodge it in a specific time,” Tsangari says. “Especially since the dissolution of communities, and the bordering up of land, the ghettoes, are happening literally everywhere now.”View image in fullscreenAn outsider entering the fray … Arinzé Kene as Quill.Photograph: © Jaclyn Martinez/Harvest Film LimitedThis is Tsangari’s first full-length film as a director in nearly a decade. Greek cinema is in a dire state, she says. “There is not enough support by our government, especially after the big exodus Greek cinema has had in this century.” She often worked with Yorgos Lanthimos before he found Hollywood success with The Lobster and The Favourite (she co-produced his Greek-language filmsDogtoothand Alps), but says the problems have been longstanding, citing one man as Greek cinema’s saviour. “[Producer] Christos V Konstantakopoulos single-handedly financed half of theGreek new wavefilms. That’s actually a fact.”She is now part of Visibility: Zero, a campaign launched with an open letter from nearly 2,000 signatories in June, demanding institutional reform within the Greek arts. Or as Tsangari puts it: “It’s a revolt against the total disregard for the Greek cinema community by our state.” Part of the problem is a cash rebate programme for non-Greek film-makers working in the country, she explains, that has prioritised movies with bigger budgets and squeezed indie productions.“It’s an issue happening more and more in Europe – the whole industry is getting overextended, and then it becomes prohibitive for our very modest films to be made. It’s also becoming more and more difficult to make films in my own language.” A few days after we speak, 176 international actors, directors and producers, including Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe, signed a letter demanding that the Culture Ministry and the Hellenic Film and Audiovisual Center – Creative Greecetake immediate action.View image in fullscreenTwisted … Chevalier.Photograph: BFIBut back to Harvest, loved by some critics and hated by others. I ask if Tsangari likes making films that produce extreme reactions. “I’m not the right person to respond to this,” she says. She doesn’t read reviews, she adds, but admits to readingthe Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw’s negative take. “It was the first one … a bit traumatic”. Now she is focusing on travelling, she says, to present the film “out in the world”.She is much happier talking about the film’s epic sound design. The fabulous opening track, byRomanian experimental one-man band Rodion GA, was made on cassette during the culturally punitive rule of Ceaușescu; she tells me excitedly that she got the masters from bandleader Rodion Roșca’s daughter. She also loved building up a Harvest Family Band, which included Landry Jones (who is also a musician) and experimental recorder player Laura Cannell, with support from ethnomusicologist Gary West and Gaelic musicians Sarah and Anna Garvin.Sound of Metal’s award-winning composer Nicolas Becker and sound engineer David Bowtle-McMillan also bolstered the film’s extreme sensory intensity, the latter often using 20 mics at one time, “buried in the mud, when it was raining, like a Zen Buddha, as if he was mixing jazz,” Tsangari says with a laugh. Whatever your take on it, Harvest is a film that envelops you in its noise, that lingers, that you can’t extract yourself from, I say. Tsangari smiles, perhaps with relief. “That is literally music to my ears!”Harvest is in cinemas on 25 July and on Mubi from 8 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsWesternsGreeceEuropeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she has a slate of upcoming projects, including a bold new venture at the fringe. Will one of them be the next big thing?Best of the fest: 10 sensational Edinburgh fringe comedy showsKate WyverFri 25 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareFrancesca Moody’s name is a sign to pay attention. The Olivier-winning producer discovered the plays that led to two of the most successful TV shows in recent memory: Fleabag andBaby Reindeer. If a show has Moody’s backing, it has a higher-than-average chance of soaring to success.But as Moody’s recognition has grown, so has the pressure to create a hit. “That is exciting,” she cautions as we slip into a small glass-walled room in her office off London’s Leicester Square. She looks surprisingly calm given the restaurants’ worth of plates she’s spinning. “But it’s also terrifying. The stakes are higher than they used to be.” She’s busy unleashing a new set of shows across the US and UK – including an entire miniature festival at the Edinburgh fringe – and has another Netflix show in development.Risk is part of the producing game, and Moody’s threshold is high. She hadn’t raised the money for Richard Gadd’s Baby Reindeer until the week it was due to go on at the Edinburgh fringe in 2019. At that point, she didn’t have much of a buffer for the money not coming through. “I don’t know what I would have done,” she concedes. These days, she has greater financial stability. But there’s also more hanging in the balance. “It’s our company’s money,” she says, “our investors’ money, and ultimately my name.”View image in fullscreen‘A great example of trusting your gut’ … Phoebe Waller-Bridge in Fleabag in 2013.Photograph: Jane Hobson/REX/ShutterstockMoody now runs her own production company, Francesca Moody Productions, which has a knack, as she puts it, for “finding unusual, kooky, sometimes auteur-led work that doesn’t always immediately feel commercial”. It currently has nearly a dozen scripts at various stages of development, plus a film in the works and a first-look deal with Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s production company. “There are a few ideas on our plate now that we’re just itching to get in the room,” Moody says. The list sounds exhausting, but she seems energised.Failures do happen. “Things go wrong every day,” she says, “on the good stuff, too.” But some mishaps are more marked than others. “We had a musical called Berlusconi,” a cautionary tale about the former Italian PM, “which was universally panned by critics.” She says it casually; this job demands rolling with the punches. “I stand by the boldness of the idea, and it was such a collegiate group of creatives, it was almost comical that it didn’t hit in the way we were expecting it to.”Good or bad, the role is all-consuming. Moody admits to an “almost unhealthy relationship” with her work. “It’s so much more than a job,” she explains, searching for the right description for what fuels her. “‘Vocation’ sounds horribly wanky, but it’s so all-defining. It would be really hard for me to unpick who I am without this.”View image in fullscreenSeiriol killer … How to Win Against History.Photograph: Pamela RaithAnd how does she spot a hit? She talks about intuition. “I always thinkFleabagis a great example of trusting your gut.” She first met Waller-Bridge and Fleabag’s director Vicky Jones in Soho Joe, a now-defunct pizza place next to London’s Soho theatre, to discuss producing a play they had commissioned. “I remember it as a whirlwind of ideas,” says Moody. She was nervous and Waller-Bridge made her laugh. When she later heard about a short piece Waller-Bridge had written, which eventually became Fleabag, she leapt at the chance to work with her. “I knew that Phoebe was an incredible actor who could spin comedy and tragedy on a dime,” she says. She locked Waller-Bridge in a room until she finished Fleabag.Edinburgh festival 2025: 20 golden comedy shows to see this summerRead moreHer nose has continued to serve her well. She first read the script for Baby Reindeer on a train and didn’t get off until she’d reached the last page. And it only took one song for her to fall in love with Jon Brittain and Matthew Floyd Jones’s comedy musical Kathy and Stella Solve a Murder!, which leapt from the fringe to the West End. “You have to start with: Do I love this show? Is it like anything else I’ve ever seen before? You have to be 100% all in.”As with most of her hits, the Edinburghfringe was the birthplace for Weather Girl, Brian Watkins’ unsettling climate-comedy, which sees a weather reporter smiling her way through the apocalypse. This prophetic eco-monologue played in Edinburgh in 2024, sold out at Soho theatre earlier this year, and is soon transferring to St Ann’s Warehouse in New York. On first reading, Moody says, “it hooked me”. But she knew it needed work. Her team helped to guide it into what it is now: an absurd comedy that quickly tumbles into giddy climate disaster.View image in fullscreenGreen initiative … Ohio.Photograph: Oliver Rosser“I always try to think about the audience and whether they will connect with a character, so my notes on Weather Girl were largely bound up in that – but it was all there at the beginning,” she says. The show is currently in development with Netflix – and may well be another next big thing.On the other side of the world at the Edinburgh fringe, Moody is ushering in a new roster of shows. “Edinburgh’s not a place to be making money,” Moody says. “It’s a place to be investing.” This year, her investments include three shows and an entire month-long festival-within-the-festival. The first show is Ohio, an autobiographical folk drama by married couple and award-winning musicians the Bengsons, which gathered a keen following in the US and already has a transfer to south London’s Young Vic planned. She’s also bringing Seiriol Davies’ camp historical musical How to Win Against History back to the fringe. (It started there nearly a decade ago.) Her third show is Garry Starr: Classic Penguins. “It’s the best version of clowning I’ve seen,” Moody says, “and the most beautiful holding of an audience through quite exposing audience interaction.” She compares it to Julia Masli’s cult hit, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.In recent years, Moody’s name has become synonymous with success at the festival. “We understand the conditions you need to facilitate a sense of something being exciting,” Moody asserts. “That’s 25% of the way there, in terms of building a bit of a hit.” A producer has to create more demand than a show can satisfy, she says. That means choosing a small enough venue that you can sell a show out and create a buzz.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The eye-catching marketing image, of the lead actor’s grinning face drowning in a pool of bright red, did a lot of work to make the new show recognisable.Perhaps most exciting is Moody’s upcoming collective endeavour. As her company grows, she worries about “not being in the weeds in the same way I used to be, creatively”. To rectify this, she wants to get back to her roots in fringe theatre and support artists in this prohibitively expensive climate. “I came up through the fringe at a time just before it started to get really difficult to make work there,” she says. “You couldn’t make a show any more in the way we made Fleabag in 2013. Our two-bed flat was like £2,000 for the month. You’d be hard pressed to find that for less than six or seven grand now.”After many conversations about the difficulties of producing work, Moody decided to “put our money where our mouth is”. The result is Shedinburgh. Originally conceived with writer and performer Gary McNair and producer Harriet Bolwell during the pandemic, it started as a digital festival where shows were livestreamed from two small sheds in London and Edinburgh. This year, they’re turning the idea into an intimate, 100-seat live venue for the duration of the fringe. “It was too good an idea to let go of,” she says.View image in fullscreenFringe concern … Richard Gadd in Baby Reindeer in 2019.Photograph: Andrew PerryThe programme is eclectic, with the “shed-ule” consisting of one-off performances of old and new work from the likes of Sophie Duker, Maimuna Memon and Christopher Brett Bailey. Paying artists’ travel, accommodation, plus a fee or a box office split, whichever is higher – an inversion of the typical method at the fringe – the project is made possible by investors who believe in its ethos. “We wanted to imagine a bit of a utopia,” Moody reasons. “It’s a love letter to the fringe.”The fringe used to feel like a level playing field. “Once you’re there, the literary manager at the NationalTheatrecan see your show. The theatre critic at the Guardian can see it.Ican see it. Now, it’s so much harder to just get there.” She places these struggles against wider concerns about the “death of fringe theatre” – particularly with the recent cancellation of London’s Vault festival – where so much emerging work begins. Shedinburgh is determinedly creating opportunities in spite of these difficulties. “Theatre is my first love,” Moody says. “We want to reinvigorate that sense that the next best play can come from anywhere, and inspire others to do the same.”Shedinburgh runs 1 to 24 August; Ohio is at Assembly Roxy, Upstairs,30 Julyto 24 August; How to Win Against History is at Underbelly, George Square,30 Julyto 24 August.Explore more on these topicsFringe theatreEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalTheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)FleabagfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But does this approach contradict what Peyo’s original Smurfs stood for?Philip OltermannFri 25 Jul 2025 07.04 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareSmurfs, a new Paramount Pictures CGI-spectacle directed by Chris Miller, has received an all-round critical panning and faltered at the box office. But it does a serviceable job reminding viewers of the utter strangeness of the three-apples-tall characters originally conceived of by Belgian comic artist Pierre “Peyo” Culliford in 1958.In the film, James Corden voices No Name Smurf, who experiences existential angst because unlike the other inhabitants of Smurf Village – Brainy, Grouchy, Hefty etc– he does not “have his own thing”, a skill or character trait that makes him stand out. This special trait is eventually identified as “magic” and No Name is pressed – by a serenading Rihanna-voiced Smurfette – to realise his inner USP and “don’t let anyone ever say you are not anyone” and accept that “you were born great”.An identity crisis might be a relatively novel experience for the motormouthed British actor, but it is certainly a first in the 67-year history of Peyo’s blue cosmos. In fact, it may be a contradiction in terms: to be a good Smurf, in the proto-communist vision of the original comics, was to never elevate your own personality above the collective.Of Smurf Village’s original 100 inhabitants, says French sociologist and Smurfologist Antoine Buéno, “About 90% were totally indistinguishable. They all looked the same, they were all dressed the same.” While some Smurfs were identified by name, he says, this was usually through a skill that is related to how he (all of the original Smurfs were male) is useful to the community. “The Smurfian society is an archetypal corporatist society, meaning that each Smurf that is identified represents a social function.”In Miller’s latest reboot of the franchise, unleashing your true inner self is presented as the key to overcoming a problem – in Peyo’s original book, it is the root of all evil. “In the comics, each time a Smurf tries to be an individual, it creates a catastrophe,” Buéno says.View image in fullscreenHidden ideological underpinnings? Papa Smurf and No Name in Smurfs.Photograph: Paramount Animation/PAFor instance, in the second book of the original series, 1965’s Le Schtroumpfissime (King Smurf), the inhabitants of the village hold a vote for an interim leader in the absence of Papa Smurf, but democracy does not become them. One nameless Smurf realises he can play the system by making promises he can’t keep to each of his potential voters, and wins. But once elected, he rules as an autocrat, installing an oppressive regime marshalled by Hefty Smurf and forcing the other Smurfs to build him a palace. The book was translated into Dutch as De Smurführer.“All bad comes from individuality, which is also linked with private property”, says Buéno. “Each time private property is claimed in the village, it ruins the whole balance of the society.”The 2011 book in which Buéno explored the hidden ideological underpinnings of Peyo’s fictional world,Le Petit Livre Bleu: Analyse Critique et Politique de la Société des Schtroumpfs, triggered a bitter backlash from true blue fans, and is wilfully polemical in the way it spells out political allusions that the comics never make explicit. The revolutionary connotations of the Phrygian caps (red for Papa, white for all the rest) are plausible, the identification of bearded Papa Smurf as Marx and bespectacled Brainy as Trotsky perhaps less so.The search for messages hidden in the books may even have distracted from how genuinely original an exercise in storytelling the Smurfs were on the surface: a series of tales with 100 protagonists, of whom most look exactly the same, in which heroism lies in collective action.Smurfs review – Rihanna is star turn of the new generation of floppy-hatted blue elvesRead moreSpeaking more than a decade after the publication of his Little Blue Book, Buéno sounds more balanced in his assessment. “My theory was always that Peyo was not into politics at all”, he says. “But his genius was in creating a utopia that drew from our joint political history and coming up with images that spoke to everyone.”Using Smurf Village as an example of working socialism did not just die with the new reboot, it was washed out of the Smurfverse after Peyo sold the rights to his creation in the 1970s. “For me, what we witnessed in the Smurfs is a perfect demonstration of Guy Debord’s analysis of capitalism”, says Buéno. “Capitalism’s strength lies in never frontally destroying its enemies, but taking them in and digesting them.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmComics and graphic novelsFamily filmsCommunismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just like his British contemporaries Constable and Turner, Georges Michel worked in the open air. He mostly painted landscapes near Paris. He had a lot of imitators, hence the uncertainty about his attribution. You can see why this approach was popular. Even though the countryside spread out under those massive clouds is ordinary, even a bit nondescript, the artist finds sublimity in two archetypally Romantic themes: ruins and storms. The raised hill in the foreground is bleak and barren, and it’s crowned with the shattered, eroded shell of a great house that time has reduced to little more than a fireplace and stumps of walls. Above it, low, dark storm clouds whip up to unleash brutal rain. It’s an exciting blast of bleakness to hang in a cosy room.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had no idea she was such a big deal! Once I finished it, I sought out the books that she recommended. That’s how I ended up readingElizabeth Strout,George Saundersand Gustave Flaubert – which was a very good place to start.The writer who changed my mindI didn’t read biographies until I stumbled upon Dana Stevens’s book about Buster Keaton,Camera Man. She changed my mind about the genre, and now I can’t watch Keaton’s films without thinking about scenes from the book.The book that made me want to be a writerReading short stories at university made me want to become a writer. Extra by Yiyun Li, A Temporary Matter by Jhumpa Lahiri andRecitatifby Toni Morrison stand out as early examples that got me to think differently about reading and writing.The book or author I came back toI didn’t getHeart of Darknessat all when I first read it, and was too quick to judge it. Thankfully, I revisited it and now count Joseph Conrad as one of my favourite writers. I love his prose style and the scale of ambition in his novels.The book I rereadTeaching courses on the short story allowed me to regularly revisit some favourites. Two stories that never left my syllabus were Pet Milk and Paper Lantern by Stuart Dybek. After dozens of rereads, Dybek’s writing always feels new – I get swept along every time.The book I could never read againI listened to Karl Ove Knausgård’sMy Strugglewhile training for a marathon. I think if I read it again, it would invoke some kind of Pavlovian response.The book I discovered later in lifeI have myself to blame for reading Daniel Defoe’sRobinson Crusoelater than I should have – it was on my university course but I missed the lecture. Since reading it, I struggle to get on with novels that don’t have any oomph to them.

We will all miss her terribly. The family wish to be given space to grieve and ask for privacy at this very difficult time.”She was well known for a longstanding collaboration with her late husband, the composer and reed player John Dankworth, singing with his jazz bands from the mid-1950s onwards. But she also had a stellar solo career, including in the US, where she became the only female artist to be nominated for Grammy awards in pop, jazz and classical categories; few singers have the versatility to deliver atonal Arnold Schoenberg pieces and to have duetted with Ray Charles.View image in fullscreenStarting at the top ... Cleo Laine and John Dankworth performing in 1963.Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsLaine was born in Uxbridge, west London, in 1927, the daughter of a Jamaican father and an English farmer’s daughter (her original name was Clementina Campbell, though she was registered at birth as Clementine Bullock, her mother’s surname). She was raised in nearby Southall and had an unassuming youth, working at various jobs after leaving school including as a hairdresser, librarian and pawnbroker. Still a teenager, she married George Langridge and had a son, Stuart.She sang in clubs after work, but became a professional singer in her mid-20s after successfully auditioning for Dankworth’s band the Dankworth Seven. “In a sense, with them, I started at the top,” she later said. She earned £7 a week, and changed her name to the snappier Cleo Laine. Her marriage faltered – Langridge “thought my career was a pipe-dream”, she said – and Laine left him for Dankworth, marrying him in 1958.She developed her voice, eventually reaching a four-octave range and becoming one of the most esteemed proponents of the scat singing style. She acted in plays and musical theatre in London, as well as performing with Dankworth and his band; in 1961, she crossed over into the British pop charts with You’ll Answer to Me reaching No 5.She and Dankworth achieved further recognition with their jazz arrangements of poetry by Shakespeare, ee cummings, WH Auden and TS Eliot. Emboldened by a successful Australian tour, they began live performances in New York. US reviewers received her rapturously, and Laine cemented her American career with concerts backed by her husband at prestigious venues such as Carnegie Hall, alongside musical theatre on Broadway. She recorded anacclaimed album of Stephen Sondheim numbers, duetted with Ray Charles for a recording of Gershwin’s opera Porgy and Bess, and made collaborative albums with the guitarist John Williams and the flautist James Galway. In 1992, she supported Frank Sinatra for a five-night residency at London’s Royal Albert Hall.In 1970, she and Dankworth founded the Stables venue in the grounds of their home in Wavendon, Buckinghamshire, which has gone on to present concerts by Dave Brubeck, Amy Winehouse and many others, and hosts music education projects.In 1979 she was awarded an OBE and in 1997 she was made a dame. Dankworth was knighted in 2006.View image in fullscreenJoined at the hip ...

Laine performed later that night, alongside their musician children Jacqui and Alec, for a scheduled concert celebrating 40 years of the Stables;she only announced her husband’s death at the end of the concert. “It wasn’t so much ‘the show must go on’ – I’m not that committed to the stage,”she saidin 2010. “I instinctively knew Johnny would want it to. That if I had died he would have gone on. Johnny and me – we were joined at the hip.”She is survived by Jacqui and Alec.

Hawes just gets better and betterLucy ManganFri 25 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Jul 2025 10.19 EDTShareAmenopausal assassin has been a long time coming, even though there is literally no more perfect pairing in the world than a woman rapidly emptying of oestrogen and a gun. I blame the patriarchy, but I understand its unwillingness to confront the truth that if women were free to express themselves instead of raised in mental straitjackets, then armed at 40, the world would look very different indeed.Keeley Hawes, who just gets better and more impressive with every outing, is that menopausal assassin, in the aptly named six-part series The Assassin. Julie is her name and trying to live quietly in Greece and spurning every overture of friendship in the village is her game. Alas, she is called by her handler Damian, after 10 years of quietude, to perform one more time. This happens just as her son Edward (Freddie Highmore, absolutely shining in what is essentially a light comic part in a bloody, murderous caper) comes to visit for the first time in four years too! Even hitwomen have to juggle home and work demands. Oh, and Edward’s gone vegan since they last spoke and she got wagyu steaks in for tea. Handlers and kids, eh? Anyway, Edward’s here to ask her about the fortune that landed in his account when he turned 30 and if it’s anything to do with the father she has always refused to tell him about. She, more or less, tells him to shut up and eat his goddamn tofu.View image in fullscreenFamily business … Keeley Hawes and Freddie Highmore in The Assassin.Photograph: Amazon Prime VideoThe Assassin is perfectly crafted preposterousness. It is stylish, witty, tightly written, even more tightly paced and takes the job of massively entertaining us at every turn with the proper amount of seriousness. It establishes its various plotlines swiftly and has us looking forward to their intersection whenever we have enough attention to spare, given that excellent things – from barbed exchanges between unmaternal mother and exasperated son to endless action sequences – are always happening in front of us.Obviously the main plot revolves round Julie. She soon realises the man calling is not her real handler (just in time to stop her killing the woman he has given as the target, which turns out to be doubly lucky for her, in a twist which adds much to the preposterousness and, I hope, the gaiety of the viewing nation). Then, after a massacre of almost the entire village by a very bad sniper trying to kill her, she sets herself the task of finding out what’s happened to the real Damian and hopefully finding out why she is now a marked woman and more and more people are trying to kill her.This first involves pretty much commandeering the yacht belonging to her former target, Kayla (Shalom Brune-Franklin) and her berk of a brother Ezra (Devon Terrell), scions of a mega-rich mining family owned by a man called Aaron Cross (Alan Dale. One day “Him from Neighbours! My God, he’s doing well!” will not be my first thought when I see him, but that day is not yet here), and trying to get to Albania. An old colleague, Sean (Jack Davenport), arrives on a jet ski. Is he here to help or hinder? We, and a variety of weapons, soon find out.Meanwhile! Another plot strand is unfurling in a Libyan prison. Its newest inmate is a Dutch man called Jasper (David Dencik), who possibly has dirt on Cross that will get him out of said Libyan prison but not before he has added – with the help of the terrifying Russians who “adopt” him in jail – his quotient of gory set pieces to the series. He, or most of him at least, eventually escapes and disappears into the desert to find Plot A.Meanwhile again! Plot C begins in London, with the astonishingly unexpected but always welcome advent of Gina Gershon as a mysterious woman called Marie who attends an art class in order to draw a picture of someone we recognise as Edward and a speech bubble coming from his gobsmacked gob the narratively fertile phrase “You’re my father?” Aaaaand scene!It’s so much fun. Hawes is so good, so funny, Highmore so nimble and perfectly pitched and everyone else – including Gerald Kyd as villager Luka, who survives the massacre and follows the woman who is clearly his best hope of safety to the yacht, where they bond over middle-aged medication – turning in brilliant performances. Do not come looking for realism or social commentary or anything else that clearly has no place here – or I will smash your head in with a rock, like Julie does to her adversaries, especially if I’ve not replaced my HRT patch on time.

Set in 1997, it follows the case of 14-year-old Reena Virk, who was beaten up and drowned by a gang of teenagers after a party. Gladstone plays a police officer on the case, and Keough a writer following it – both trying to get inside the minds of these teens.Hollie RichardsonInside Britain’s Poshest Bakery7pm, Channel 5Nice buns! This snapshot of the aggressively expanding bakery Gail’s wants to have its cake and eat it by raising an eyebrow at the eye-watering prices while also drooling over mouth-watering produce.

Onwards, and Lisa has a new dilemma: her work crush is getting out of hand. Meanwhile, Harry is recovering from his cancer operation, Miranda is putting off telling Joy that she is an alcoholic, and Carrie continues to … not do much at all.HRWhitstable Pearl9pm, U&DramaAfter Life’s Kerry Godliman returns as the seaside restaurant owner and private detective Pearl Nolan for a third series.

Knocked by Sony’s repeated duff attempts to create a universe of Spider-Man baddies, none of which actually featured Spider-Man, the film was so poorly anticipated that the director was reduced to begging people to give it a chance. The good news is that Kraven the Hunter is actually a decent film. It’s less silly than Madame Web and less wild than Morbius. Come expecting nothing more than a sturdy action film and you shouldn’t leave disappointed.Stuart HeritageHappy Gilmore 2 (Kyle Newacheck, 2025),out now, NetflixThere is a huge portion of the world that treats Happy Gilmore like a foundational text. A 1996 sports comedy about a short-tempered ice hockey fanatic who finds a surprising affinity for golf, this is arguably the archetypal Adam Sandler performance: loud, profane, occasionally syrupy. Almost 30 years later, it’s time for the sequel. Here, Gilmore is forced out of retirement to pay for his daughter’s ballet school. Expect lots of shouting, a billion cameos and – most intriguing of all – a turn by Sandler’s Uncut Gems director Benny Safdie.SHBlade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017),11.25pm, BBC OneIf you need to get acquainted with the manwho’ll lead James Bond into the future, this is a decent place to start. Denis Villeneuve’s sequel to Ridley Scott’s original Blade Runner is monumental in every way. It moves slowly but loudly, and every frame is a maximalist spectacle. Ryan Gosling plays a replicant who discovers that his kind are able to biologically reproduce, leading him down a dark path that will take him to the fringes of society and make him question his own identity. If the next Bond is even a 10th as ambitious as this, we’re in for a total treat.SHExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightRiley KeoughTrees and forestsAnd Just Like ThatDramaFactual TVPromsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When we first meet Ka’iana (Momoa) he is something of a loner, capturing a shark with his bare hands and some rope. But he is coaxed back into armed service by the prophecy of an invasion that will lead to the unification of Hawaii. The drama is based on true events and great care has evidently been taken to present an authentic version of this undertold story. It is steeped in Polynesian cultural practices but it is also full of universal, action-adventure staples – namely, political machinations that periodically dissolve into prolonged outbreaks of expertly choreographed, frequently blood-curdling violence.Phil HarrisonApple TV+, from Friday 1 AugustHurricane Katrina: Race Against TimeView image in fullscreenTraumatising … Malik Rahim in Hurricane Katrina: Race Against TimePhotograph: National GeographicTwenty years have now passed since the horrifying events surrounding Hurricane Katrina, but this gripping series brings the trauma back to life in visceral style. What began as an appalling natural disaster soon became a national crisis then an outrage of governmental negligence and structural racism which came to embody – and irrevocably taint – the final years of George W Bush’s presidency. To watch the footage now is to be reminded of how close even the most seemingly advanced societies are to breakdown and chaos. Essential.PHDisney+, from Sunday 27 JulyFacebook Honeytrap: Catching a KillerView image in fullscreenJustice … Lehanne Sergison in Facebook Honeytrap: Catching a Killer.Photograph: Amazon Amazon Amazon undefinedThis documentary, delayed from June, explores the death of British woman Christine Robinson who was raped and murdered at a safari lodge in South Africa in 2014. After the local police drew a blank, Robinson’s niece Lehanne took it upon herself to hunt her aunt’s killer remotely. She located the suspect online and began a long-distance relationship with Andrea Imbayarwo, who had, by this time, fled the country. Her actions led to his arrest and conviction. Harrowing but also a remarkable story of crime and punishment in the social media age.PHPrime Video, from Sunday 27 JulyTrainwreck: Storm Area 51View image in fullscreenOut of control … Trainwreck: Storm Area 51.Photograph: NetflixThis Netflix series is turning out to be an engaging source of quirky, marginal human interest stories. Its latest documentary explores the 2019 Storm Area 51 Facebook event, which was started by Matty Roberts as a joke but soon became dangerously real. The nominal idea was to see if anyone fancied uncovering the truth about alien lifeforms held in the US airforce facility Area 51. However, by the time the event had attracted the (virtual) attention of more than three million people, Roberts realised he’d created a monster he could no longer control.PHNetflix, from Tuesdayskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

StuGo introduces six gifted students tricked into attending a fake summer camp by eccentric scientist Dr Lullah, whose propensity for swishing her gown around like she’s on a catwalk should have been a dead giveaway. Once the youngsters arrive on her island, they find an environment that is rife with danger but also full of perilous fun. It’s a world of mind-reading manatees, huge fighting fungi, human cacti and a crocodile wearing jeans, and soon the kids are having a blast.PHDisney+, from Wednesday 30 JulyLeanneView image in fullscreenSisters … Leanne (right) and Carol (Kristen Johnston).Photograph: Patrick McElhenney/NetflixThe southern belle stylings of Leanne Morgan meet the sitcom smarts of Chuck Lorre (The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men) to create this comedy. Morgan plays Leanne, who discovers that Bill (Ryan Stiles), her husband of 33 years, has cheated on her. The devastating blow launches a flurry of gags about menopause, midlife crises and recovering your dating mojo, as Leanne – with her sister Carol (Kristen Johnston) – looks to move on.

A rollicking, deliberately dumb action movie about the US president and the British prime minister, Heads of State looked as if it was going to be the weirdest political film of the year. Turns out it wasn’t even the weirdest of the summer, because here is Rumours. With three writer-directors, including Guy Maddin, it’s a film about a G7 summit that finds itself being terrorised by marauding bog-zombies and, odder still, a giant brain. The fact that Cate Blanchett plays the German chancellor and Charles Dance the US president makes it stranger still. Highly silly and very funny, it’s not something you are likely to forget in a hurry.Stuart HeritageSaturday 26 July, 1.15pm, 10.15pm, Sky Cinema PremiereLyle, Lyle, CrocodileView image in fullscreenJaw dropping … Javier Bardem shines as Hector in Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile.Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/REX/ShutterstockLast year’s vaguely nightmarish Harold and the Purple Crayon is an example of the pitfalls of attempting to stretch a children’s picture book to feature length. With that in mind, 2022’s Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is a miracle. Based on a slight 1965 kids’ book, Will Speck and Josh Gordon’s film is an unexpected delight. There is a crocodile, he can sing, and all hell breaks loose. Not only are the songs (by The Greatest Showman’s Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) genuinely good, but Javier Bardem gives one of the performances of his life as Lyle’s unreliable owner, Hector.SHSaturday 26 July, 2pm, BBC OneFallen LeavesView image in fullscreenFinnish point … Alma Pöysti and Jussi Vatanen star in Helsinki-set Fallen Leaves.Photograph: Malla Hukkanen/SputnikAs is to be expected – nay required – from the master of dour, deadpan humour, in Aki Kaurismäki’s latest romantic comedy his two lonely, Helsinki-based central characters struggle to express their feelings. The potential match of Ansa (Alma Pöysti) and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen) is further stymied by him losing her number, his struggles with alcoholism and their shared inability to hold on to a job. Not a laugh-a-minute plot description, admittedly, but being immersed in the director’s peculiarly Finnish world makes you wish the pair the best of an imperfect life.Simon WardellSaturday 26 July, 9.45pm, BBC FourBenjaminView image in fullscreenGrowing feelings … Phenix Brossard and Colin Morgan play Noah and Benjamin.Photograph: Laura Radford Photography LtdSimon Amstell’s first film, Carnage, was a heavy-handed satire about the generational guilt of eating meat, but he really found his footing a year later with Benjamin. A sweet love story between an aspiring film-maker and a French musician, it feels as if it often leans into autobiography. Like Amstell, the lead character (played by Colin Morgan) finds it hard to move on after early success, and repeatedly second-guesses his way out of potential connections. It’s a tender, sharply observed film that makes you excited about the rest of Amstell’s career.SHTuesday 29 July, 2.35am, Channel 4skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A startling, ferocious depiction of the aftermath of a nuclear attack on Sheffield, the film’s impact cannot be overstated. The terror doesn’t just come from the initial firestorm, but the illnesses and societal breakdown that follow. Threads put the fear of God into people right when it needed to the most and, quite frankly, the upcoming remake can’t get here soon enough.SHWednesday 30 July, 11.15pm, BBC FourMy Oxford YearView image in fullscreenA fine romance … Jamie (Corey Mylchreest) and Anna (Sofia Carson) fall in love in My Oxford Year.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyMy Oxford Year comes with a terrific pedigree. Based on Julia Whelan’s partly autobiographical novel and directed by The Inbetweeners’ Iain Morris, this is a romantic comedy drama about a pretty American who moves to the UK to study at Oxford, and finds herself being swept up by a handsome Brit. But what will derail their love first – her moving back home or his dark, tragic secret? Starring Sofia Carson and Corey Mylchreest, the film is a slightly generic but admirably sincere exploration of relationships that come with expiration dates. And it’ll do wonders for the Oxford tourist board.SHFriday 1 August, NetflixMiracle on 34th StreetView image in fullscreenSelf-declared Santa … Richard Attenborough plays Kriss Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/AllstarSince Christmas in July is becoming more and more mainstream, it only makes sense that Film4 should get in on the act. A Christmas Carol is on today, as is Jingle All the Way, but the real gold lies in Les Mayfield’s 1994 remake – which is charm personified. Co-written by John Hughes, the star attraction is Richard Attenborough at his twinkliest as Kriss Kringle, a man dragged into a court case after declaring himself to be Santa. What’s so remarkable is just how utterly festive the film is, despite being a courtroom drama about a potentially deluded old man.SHFriday 1 August, 1.05pm, Film4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe seven best films to watch on TV this weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She recalls, for example, finally feeling that she has made it as a translator when she is invited to speak at the London Book Fair; years later, she returns to tell the audience that she has plenty of work, but only £30 in her bank account because so many of the organisations in the room are behind on paying her. “Out of the frying pan of grifting,” as she acidly notes, “into the fire of contempt”.But it is not simply a question of spiralling workload, dwindling rates of pay, insecure employment or even the spectre of AI. Translators are additionally required to go along with their own erasure: to sign up to the idea that invisibility is hard-wired into their value, and that a truly great translation is the one that the reader fails to notice. Maintaining this fiction might take obvious forms – neglecting to give a translator their rightful billing on the text itself – or it might be subtle and insidious, as in the insistence that translators suppress their regional identity by rendering everything in homogeneous southern English. Departing from such strictures has not hindered translators such as the inestimable Deborah Smith, who introduced Yorkshire dialect into her versions of the novels of Korean Nobel laureate Han Kang.In fact, as Calleja demonstrates through several fascinating and detailed translations in progress, shepherding a piece of writing from one language into another requires so many minute responses, thought processes and decisions that the translator would find it impossible to suppress their own voice and experiences; and that if they managed it, the result would probably be worse, inert and undynamic. Her relationship with the manuscripts on her desk, for example, is informed by her life-changing encounter with Bernhard Schlink’sDer Vorleser(The Reader), a novel that she selected at random in a Munich bookshop when she was a teenager, over time allowing the chasms in her understanding and appreciation of the prose to slowly fill in and resolve. “Looking at this first page now, it feels so strange to know how I would translate it, how only I would translate it,” she writes. “Even stranger to think that now I pick up novels in German, open them, read them, and know how to translate them into books you buy in shops. That people trust me to do this.”Fair is so titled in part to reflect its qualities as a manifesto – not only an improvement in pay and working conditions, but a demand that literary translation as a practice and profession should be a viable aspiration for a far greater number and type of people. It also describes the book’s puckish structure, in which we wander the stands, stalls and hallways of a notional trade fair, and where the illusion of cosy intimacy and friendliness – the decorated cubicles for meetings, the drinks receptions, the musical performances – are at odds with the corporate reality of such gatherings, which are essentially transactional rather than poetic. It can be a somewhat distracting and disorientating mechanism, which is perhaps the point. Stripping away the industrial structures of creating art is far easier said than done, but as she repeatedly tells us, you have to start somewhere.Fair: The Life-Art of Translation by Jen Calleja is published by Prototype (£12.99).

He considers stepping back from the game as his years and wealth stack up, but keeps going at the encouragement of his dear Virginia (Julie Bowen). But when Happy accidentally kills her with a shanked tee shot, a shock that comes in the first two minutes, his world is even more upended than it was when we met him as an orphan in 1996.This time, instead of having to abandon his first love (hockey) to chase down a couple hundred grand in cardboard checks to save grandma’s house, he abruptly retires to be more present for his kids and assumes the bills are covered until the feds circle back to take grandma’s house – and the Ferrari. With his four boys old enough to fend for themselves, sort of, he moves into a ramshackle triplex on the sketchy side of town with his young daughter, Vienna (played by Sunny Sandler, Adam Sandler’s youngest daughter), and falls into alcoholism. It isn’t until Vienna’s ballet instructor (played by Jackie Sandler, Adam Sandler’s wife) tells Happy that Vienna has the talent to study at a prestigious company in Paris that he becomes motivated to pick up his club bag and try to raise the tuition money. But the comeback gets complicated when Happy picks up a DUI in a municipal course karting accident and an energy drink hustle bro offers him pride of place in an upstart golf tour that’s purpose-built to take down the establishment. (Sound familiar?)The Fantastic Four: First Steps review – Marvel regains buoyancy with wacky superhero family sitcomRead moreLike most sequels, Happy Gilmore 2 doesn’t quite live up to its predecessor, the spiritual successor to Caddyshack. But it won’t matter to diehard fans who never stopped quoting lines from the original. I still can’t let a limousine pass without reflexively muttering “must be Burt Reynolds”, the line that introduced McGavin. That’s not to say the yarn Sandler and co-writer Tim Herlihy stitched together is no fun. They still manage to get in their share of recurring gags (Happy making flasks out of anything that comes to hand: a club brush, a TV remote) while divvying up those other comedy moments among their SNL pals (Kevin Nealon, Jon Lovitz) and cherished Sandler company regulars (Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi). They even manage to pay tribute to the actors who died between films – not least the late great Carl Weathers, AKA Chubbs the one-handed golf pro – by staging a fight between Happy and McGavin in a cemetery, itself a tribute to the gameshow host Bob Barker’s iconic original cameo.But where the first Happy Gilmore was the story of a rank outsider’s takeover of the game, in this installment it’s the other way around. Happy isn’t just a king of the long ball, but a peer to rival Tiger Woods and other greats. Lee Trevino, the only pro golfer who appeared in the 1996 film, finds himself in the sequel surrounded by greats of today (Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele) and yesteryear (Jack Nicklaus, Fred Couples). John Daly, whose actual rollercoaster life no doubt inspired Happy’s second act, lives in Happy’s garage. Scottie Scheffler sends up his bizarre arrest at the 2024 PGA Championship and Will Zalatoris finally gets to dine out on his uncanny resemblance to Happy’s very first caddie. If the original Happy Gilmore was intended as a love letter to the game, it’s clear 30 years on that the professional golf community got the message.The most interesting thing about the sequel is its commitment to defending the game and its traditions – a cause Happy eventually takes in addition to helping Vienna realize her ballet dream, while reckoning with the fact that everyone can smash the long ball now. All the while, the scenes of Happy teeing off on a pro shop simulator and weekend warriors busting chops speak to the franchise’s contribution to making the game more approachable. Now, the unwavering focus on this theme doesn’t completely redeem the film’s woolier elements – the endless sports cameos (from Travis Kelce to the WNBA’s Kelsey Plum), the rampant nepotism (again: every member of Sandler’s immediate family is featured), the forced integration of Call Her Daddy and other digital media platforms, and a batshit third act that draws out the film’s two-hour runtime. But it does make them chafe a bit less. All the while, Bad Bunny provides more salve in the role as Happy’s busboy turned caddie, Oscar, and proves to be a surprising and delightful laugh riot.For those who aren’t into golf or weren’t around for SNL at the turn of the century, Happy Gilmore 2 could well sail overhead like a drive from the man himself. But for the generations who still quote summer comedies from eons ago (ahem), Sandler’s second round offers a refreshing trip down memory lane – to see what new hijinks the assisted living orderly (Ben Stiller) and the IRS agent (Robert Smigel) are up to, and if McGavin, the greatest villain in sports movie history, ever gets his revenge. Everything else – relics of a simpler, less serious time perhaps – is par for the course.Happy Gilmore 2 is out now on NetflixThis article was amended on 25 July 2025.

Several performers slip and fall during the ensemble opening number – Puttin’ on the Ritz. The show is stopped, the stage mopped up (its wetness apparently caused by unexpected condensation), and then the show really does proceed to put on the ritz.Adapted by Matthew White and Howard Jacques, its drama of mistaken identity faithfully follows the 1935 movie starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers but it has more Irving Berlin tunes, each more divine than the last. Phillip Attmore plays Jerry Travers, the avowed bachelor and Broadway star whose head is turned by the independently minded fashion model Dale Tremont (Lucy St Louis). She, in turn, mistakes him for the older, married Horace Hardwick (Clive Carter) and the whole thing plays out like an American Restoration drama but with added tap dance and swing.It is ravishingly directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, who was behind the winning 2021 revival of Cole Porter’sAnything Goes at the Barbican theatrein London.View image in fullscreenEasy on the eye … Attmore leads a dance on the revolving art deco set.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe twinkly eyed Attmore brings sublime tap all the way through but especially in the titular Top Hat, White Tie and Tails, complete with an immaculate dancing ensemble. There is incredibly silky singing from St Louis in songs such as Wild About You and Better Luck Next Time, and the central couple have a natural chemistry on stage.Meanwhile, Horace and his wife Madge (Sally Ann Triplett, very amusing) bring anti-marital comedy, some of it predictable but entertaining nonetheless. Horace’s British valet, Bates (James Clyde), who refers to himself in the royal “we”, is a dryly comic highlight, as is Italian fashion designer Alberto Beddini, hammily played by Alex Gibson-Giorgio.It is a show that is extremely easy on the eye with gorgeous ostrich-feathered costumes (designed by Yvonne Milnes and Peter McKintosh) and a revolving art deco set (also designed by McKintosh) which gestures to the elegant opulence of the film. Some of the costumes honour the film too, especially Dale’s silk and feather dress during her duet with Jerry in Cheek to Cheek.Choreography goes from natty, bouncing tap to smooth, floaty numbers, and the latter have a swirling, romantic quality while the ensemble give the illusion of a far larger chorus line. LikeCrazy for You, which played at the same theatre in 2022, this show seems raring for a London transfer. It stretches on for too long, and is not quite as spectacular as that musical, but the whole thing oozes style and wit.

There are also jokes that you will only fully appreciate if you understand ancient antagonisms between Yorkshire’s West and North Ridings and why “Cadbury’s” (in a place built around Rowntree’s) is a punchline.Yet writers Misha Duncan-Barry and Bridget Foreman have plundered this most local of stories and found something universal, relevant and powerful.Antony Jardine, one of two professional actors in the production (the other being Amelia Donkor playing Gulie Harlock) plays Seebohm Rowntree, the son of Joseph Rowntree, chocolatier, philanthropist and modest man (unlike Titus Salt who named a whole village after himself; a joke that acts as a litmus test of whether or not you will get this story).Seebohm grew up in privilege and emerged a social reformer, conducting three comprehensive studies into poverty in York during his lifetime. We meet him burning his last study, having arrived at the end of a lifetime of work believing nothing has changed, despite introducing the concept of the “poverty line”, below which nobody, he believed, should fall.View image in fullscreenAmelia Donkor and Jardine, foreground, with the community cast.Photograph: SR Taylor PhotographyDirectors Juliet Forster and Paul Birch give a sense of dynamism to this history lesson by employing tricks including a literal trapeze artist swinging from the rafters.The history of Seebohm Rowntree becomes increasingly interrupted by meta-intrusions – at one point we watch actors playing the writers and directors of the play we’re watching, rehearsing the play we are watching. As we watch Seebohm attempt to raise people out of poverty, we also see a performance of a King Lear speech, which transforms into an enormous pageant and celebration of the power of art itself.By the end, when the modern world of zero-hour contracts and clogged GP telephone lines have completely bled into Seebohm’s early 20th century, it all gets a little Boal and Brechtian, to moving effect. With his resolution that he has “so much to do” you can’t help but also hear a little of Alexander Hamilton in Seebohm Rowntree. This is a big play with big ideas, but one which has been well contained within the city walls.At YorkTheatreRoyal until 3 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a sharp opening to a fresh, ferocious third album from Editrix – an experimental trio founded in Massachusetts’ DIY scene – which explores forms of frustrated, imbalanced communication via a musical language all their own.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Big EFrom rock’s foundations and various genres – blues, jazz, punk, prog, hardcore, indie, metal – Editrix carve a style that is articulate and crushingly exhilarating. With galloping interplay between Steve Cameron’s bass and Josh Daniel’s drums (which alternate between cavernous and deadened, sometimes as if he’s simply drumming his fingers on a plastic tabletop), the band fall in and out of togetherness; musical conversations begin, get interrupted and pick up somewhere new.What’s Wrong uses uneasy, skipping polyrhythms to warn of the dangers in projecting your desires upon someone else (perhaps a lover, or an idol) while Eisenberg’s vocals and electric guitar compete for the same melody. “Help me figure out what inspires me to say no,” asks Eisenberg (also a member of Bill Orcutt’s Quartet) on the blurrily heavy No, and the second half of the track does just that – toying with repetition before running headlong into a concrete wall of noise.Editrix make complex music feel organic, like the natural thing to do, and imply that sound succeeds where words often fail us. So let me say it plainly: Editrix rock.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

You get what they mean. The winners of this year’s Glastonbury Emerging Talent competition are the product of a burgeoning new Manchester underground scene but started out performing Hank Williams and Bob Dylan covers in drummer Paddy Murphy’s bedroom. While the vocals locate them firmly in the UK, there’s a distinct country/rockabilly undertow to their sound.But equally, Britainicana feels like a slightly ungainly term for music that seems so natural and spontaneous. Recent single Alright Alright Alright rattles along at high speed, its influences buried under a layer of fuzz and feedback and punky vigour, the guitar lurching from the central riff into bursts of noisy abstraction: it sounds like a snatched recording of a band playing live, complete with the thrilling sense that their performance is seconds away from collapsing.The quartet’s debut EP is forthcoming, and the first tastes of This Better Be Something Great are more sedate. I’ve Never Met Anyone I Thought I Could Really Love (Until I Met You) lopes in time-honoured slacker style; Shells starts out as a hushed ballad before unexpectedly bursting into life 90 seconds in. But they’re equally marked by a mood of ramshackle invention at odds with the studied, polished air of a lot of current alt-rock. The name, incidentally, comes from the horse riders employed to ensure trains didn’t exceed a certain speed in 19th century America: another weird choice, given the velocity Westside Cowboy currently seem to be travelling at.Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenAcoustic meditation … Flock of Dimes AKA Jenn Wasner.Photograph: Elizabeth WeinbergFlock of Dimes – Long After Midnight“People say it’s not my problem / They say that actions have a consequence,” Bon Iver collaborator Jenn Wasner sings on a beautiful acoustic meditation about offering help against your better judgement.Kieran Hebden + William Tyler– Spider BalladFour Tet shatters the Nashville guitarist’s arid playing into kaleidoscopic fragments, creating a tense, near-breathless strobing effect that evokes glimpsing horror in half light.Confidence Man x Jade – GossipGossip’s delicious, destructive power is brandished like a weapon on this icy double threat, decorated with enjoyably unexpected acoustic guitar and Jade spitting averyrude word in pure South Shields.Joanne Robertson – GownThe sometime-Dean Blunt collaborator leads her new album with a song that evokes Sinéad O’Connor’s Celtic hymnals heard through Grouper’s damp-forest haze – with stirring cello byOliver Coates.John Also Bennett – Ston ElaiónaFar from his formative years in the Ohio noise scene, Bennett channels the stillness and swoop of the view from his new Athens home, in gorgeous, consciousness-tweaking ambient bass flute oscillations.Daniel Avery – Rapture in Blue ft Cecile BelieveThe wildly underrated Canadian singer – and former Sophie collaborator – gets a deserved showcase leading this anguished, expansive and surprisingly pop turn by the British producer.Chuquimamani-Condori – LRC withPueblo De Dios Capo E DJ editOne half of one of 2025’s best records – Los Thuthanaka – blesses us with a 24-track collection of edits.

Bye bye.” At that moment, the awesomely virtuosic and intellectually formidable multi-reeds improviser and composer had probably heard one too many carps from traditionalists that his ideas were too cerebral and unswinging for jazz.View image in fullscreenAnthony Braxton Quartet: (England) 1985.Photograph: IA FreemanNow 80, Braxton’s cross-genre visions have since fascinated jazz bands, symphony orchestras, opera and experimental modern-dance companies, and the influential imaginations of younger admirers including John Zorn andMary Halvorson. Feigin’s Leo Records label, and Switzerland’s Intakt, have kept the immense resource of his influence simmering for years. Now the enterprisingBurning Ambulance Music(which has also brought much of the now-retired Feigin’s invaluable Leo Records catalogue to Bandcamp) releases Quartet (England) 1985, catching the sound of one of Braxton’s most skilfully intuitive groups on that year’s UK tour.Salvaged by state-of-the-art tech methods from former Wire magazine writer andBraxton chronicler Graham Lock’s original lo-fi cassette recordings, the set celebrates Braxton’s conviction that triggering loose improv through tightly challenging compositions can mirror the everyday flux of living. On the Sheffield gig, Braxton’s alto sax (the constructions of Charlie Parker, Warne Marsh, John Coltrane and many more fly by) over jostling four-note patterns takes off into flying avant-bebop. Leicester’s show similarly launches on stop-start bop-reminiscent figures that stretch into free-collective passages powered by bassist Mark Dresser’s pizzicato and bowing skills, drummer Gerry Hemingway’s muscularity and mercurial pianist Marilyn Crispell’s cauldron of delicacy andCecil Taylor-esque intensity. The Bristol takes emphasise that the audio quality of quieter subgroups survives better than the band’s full-on jams, but the brief soundchecks on standard songs are enchanting, and Lock’s notes on Braxton’s methods are essential reading.Also out this monthPianistFred Hersch(an early teacher of Brad Mehldau) has long been one of jazz’s undercover maestros. Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans are his guides, but almost everything he plays sounds fresh.The Surrounding Green (ECM)shares originals and covers with bassist Drew Gress and drummer Joey Baron – including a spirited account of Ornette Coleman’s Law Years and pieces by Egberto Gismonti, Charlie Haden and the Gershwins.Shifa (Discus Music)joins the quirky and inquisitive UK tenor saxophonistRachel Mussonwith eclectic pianistPat Thomasand free-jazz drummerMark Sanderson a straight-through improv set showcasing Musson’s free-blowing ensemble power and spacious lyricism.

Not a tourist trap but an island where people actually live, it’s a delightful slice of unhurried Italian life. The island is small enough to be explored on foot or by bicycle, though there is a bus service too. There are many pretty little beaches for swimming, sunbathing and picnicking – our favourite was Il Postino, where scenes from the movie of the same name were filmed. As people still fish for a living, there’s no shortage of wonderfully fresh seafood in the restaurants. A local delicacy is lemon salad, made from the enormous, thick-skinned lemons unique to Procida.Villa CaterinaB&B’s orchard of lemon and orange trees provides fresh juice and marmalade for breakfast, and the rooms have wonderful views of the island and the bay, with Vesuvius looming in the distance and Naples only 45 minutes away by ferry.Bernie GSeafood and sunshine in SwedenView image in fullscreenThe Styrsö coastline.Photograph: Maximiliane Wagner/AlamyWhen life gets too much, I dream of Styrsö in the Gothenburg archipelago. Big open skies, nature trails and heaps of swimming spots make this car-free island the perfect summer escape. It’s topped off by a brilliant seafront restaurant,Tångbaren, where you can have a plateful of fresh seafood and a cold glass of wine, and watch the sea bob away.HannahTranquillity among the dunes, GermanyView image in fullscreenThe dunes of East Frisia’s Spiekeroog.Photograph: Image Professionals/AlamyI was 21, living in Germany for a year to improve my language skills, and decided on a whim to visit the tiny East Frisian island of Spiekeroog (yes, it was the fantastic name that first attracted me to the place). I spent a happy couple of nights at theHotel Inselfriede, a small family-run hotel just a 10-minute walk from where the ferry arrives from the mainland. The island is car-free and a beautifully peaceful place to explore the dunes or simply sit with a coffee and watch the sea.LizzyA Balearic beautyView image in fullscreenSa Dragonera viewed from La Trapa monastery on Mallorca.Photograph: Kris Hoobaer/AlamySa Dragonera is a tiny but utterly beautiful uninhabited island that lies just south-west of Mallorca in the Balearics. It is brimming with history (there are 18th-century watchtowers built to observe pirate activity). Supposedly named after the lizards that inhabit it, the island is a hugely popular walking and birding spot, and is only accessible by small ferries from the nearby Sant Elm. It is best to go first thing to beat the heat and pedestrian traffic – you won’t regret it when you see the views from the top.TomA tiny Greek island with great beachesView image in fullscreenChora, the main village on Kythira.Photograph: Napa/AlamyEveryone knows that Greece has some of the most beautiful Mediterranean islands. But few foreign tourists have heard of Kythira and that’s just the way the locals like it. For most of the year only about 3,500 people live on the island. In summer, however, thousands of Greeks come for holidays, many back to homes that have been in their family for generations. There are no major tourist resorts – it’s a Greek island rich in history and tradition, with dozens of beautiful beaches.Andy MoffatExplore old world Ireland in Galway BayView image in fullscreenRuins and stone walls on Inisheer.Photograph: Juan Carlos Munoz/AlamyInisheer (or Inis Oírr), one of the three spectacular Aran Islands in Galway Bay, is my favourite small island by far. The ferry from Rossaveel on the mainland takes just under an hour, but you feel as if you’ve been transported back in time – this is a tiny island of stone walls, fishing boats, old cottages, and more ponies and traps than cars. You can walk or cycle across the island in an afternoon to explore shipwrecks and ancient ruins. At the end of the day, enjoy some traditional music in the charming pub.

Setting foot on the island, you’ll meet a welcoming committee of friendly sheep. The only indication you’re in a bustling European capital is the skyscrapers across the water. To get to Kuusiluoto, start from the city’s technology museum (itself well worth visiting, and just a short bus journey from the city centre) and walk a couple of miles along well-marked paths through reed beds. The island has a sauna, woodland trails, free postcards and those most valuable attributes – peace and quiet.ArranSnorkel in the coves of Silba, CroatiaView image in fullscreenSilba has quiet coves and is car-free.Photograph: Jure Gasparic/AlamyI didn’t know much about Silba before I arrived – it’s a small, car-free island with no hotels, just family-run guesthouses. The catamaran from Zadar takes roughly 90 minutes, with several sailings a day during summer. Once there, you can walk on shaded paths through olive groves, find quiet pebble coves with clear water for swimming, and climb the Toreta tower at sunset for great views of the Adriatic. My tip: bring a snorkel, stay at least two nights, and make sure you book your return ferry in advance as the schedules are limited.ElaineStunning vistas in Scotland’s HebridesView image in fullscreenLon Liath bay on the Isle of Eigg.Photograph: Arch White/AlamyOn the community-owned Isle of Eigg, the constantly changing light is so enthralling that you don’t need to do anything else during your stay but say “Look!” and point out beautiful variations of rainbows, sunbursts or cloud formations. Stay at theLaig Beach Bothyand gaze out of the beautiful big windows at the sky, sea and mountains. As Virginia Woolf wrote: “One should not let this gigantic cinema play perpetually to an empty house.”AnnaWinning tip: France’s wild westView image in fullscreenNividic lighthouse on Ouessant (Ushant).Photograph: Jekaterina Sahmanova/AlamyThe island of Ouessant (Ushant) is the most westerly point of metropolitan France. It’s a short ferry ride from the mainland, and as wild as it gets. Visit for a day as part of a longer holiday, or stay on the island for your entire trip. You can hire bikes as soon as you step off the ferry. There are beautiful beaches, such as Plage du Prat; impressive lighthouses; and bars and restaurants in the main village of Lampaul.AirelleExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysReaders' travel tipsBeach holidaysWalking holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s no reason not to have bothBenjamina EbuehiFri 25 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareIdon’t make doughnuts very often, but few things are better than the first bite of a freshly fried, pillowy-soft one, sugar-coated lips and all. When it comes to fillings, custard just about beats jam for me, but who’s to say you can’t have both? So, to satisfy everyone, I’ve filled these doughnuts generously with a thick vanilla custard and a speedy strawberry jam.Strawberry and custard doughnutsPrep15 minProve1 hr 45 min+Cook1 hr 45 minMakes9For the custard4 egg yolks50g caster sugar25g cornflour400mlmilk½ tspvanillabean paste100ml double creamFor the strawberry jam250gstrawberries, hulled and roughly chopped100gcaster sugar1 tbsp lemonjuiceFor the dough360gbread flour,plus extra for dusting7gdried instant yeast55gcaster sugar,plus extra for sprinkling½ tsp salt100mlmilk1 large egg40gunsalted butter,softened1 litre vegetable or sunflower oilMake the custard by beating the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour in a bowl until smooth. Put the milk and vanilla in a small saucepan and heat gently until steaming. Pour a big splash of the hot milk mix on to the eggs, whisk well, then whisk in the remaining milk. Pour back into the saucepan and cook, whisking constantly, over a medium heat, until thick and bubbling. Pour the custard into a clean bowl, cover with clingfilm so it touches the surface, and leave to cool completely before chilling in the fridge.To make the strawberry jam, put the strawberries, sugar and lemon juice in a small pan and bring to a boil. Simmer for seven to nine minutes, until softened and jammy, using the back of a spoon to mash any large pieces of fruit. Set aside to cool, then spoon into a piping bag.To make the dough, put the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix to combine. Make a well in the centre, pour in the milk, water, egg and softened butter, and knead on low speed for six to seven minutesrest uncovered in the bowl for five minutes.Knead again for five minutes, until the dough is smooth and supple and isn’t sticking to the sides of the bowl, then transfer to a lightly greased bowl, cover and prove in a warm place for one or two hours, until nearly doubled in size.Knock out the air, turn out the dough on to a well-floured surface and roll the dough into a rectangle about 1¼cm thick. (If it keeps springing back, let it rest for a few minutes before rolling again.) Use a round cutter to stamp out nine doughnuts, re-rolling the dough if needed.Put each doughnut on a small square of greaseproof paper, cover with a damp tea towel and prove for 30-40 minutes, or until puffy.Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan until it reaches 175C. Fry two or three doughnuts at a time (no need to peel off the greaseproof paper; it will float in the oil so you can pick it out) for a minute and a half to two minutes per side, until deeply golden. Transfer the cooked doughnuts to a plate lined with kitchen paper and repeat with the remaining dough.Once they’re cool enough to handle, put some caster sugar on a shallow plate and roll each doughnut around until covered. Remove the custard from the fridge and whisk well to remove any lumps. Lightly whip the double cream to soft peaks, then fold into the custard; transfer to a piping bag.Using a skewer, make a hole in the top of each doughnut and fill with custard and jam. Serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBakingDessertSnacksFruitEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Strain out the ginger solids, return the liquid to the jar, then stir in the honey and 13ml cold water (about two and a third teaspoons), until the honey dissolves (the water helps smooth out the consistency). Seal and store in the fridge for up to four weeks.To build the drink, measure all the liquids into a shaker, add ice, then hard shake. Double-strain into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice, garnish with the lemon strip, and serve.Richard Lopes forCorrochio’s Cinco, London N16Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodMexican food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s made with Tesco Finest extra virgin olive oil, produced by a family mill in southern Sicily, which makes the cake extra moist. It also adds a delicious layer of flavour and offers a healthier, dairy-free alternative to butter.In the summer, I want cake I can serve after barbecues with a ball of ice-cream. This easy recipe works really well for that. Simply boil an orange then blend it into a silky cake batter, and you’ll have a deliciously light and fragrant cake where the citrus notes really come alive. And, of course, it’s even better served with an indulgent scoop of Tesco Finest pistachio ice-cream or pistachio gelato, for a velvety and nutty flavour.Prep15 minCook1 hr 30 minServes103 oranges4 Tesco Finest free-range chestnut maran eggs200ml Tesco Finest Sicilian extra virgin olive oil70g Tesco Finest Greek yoghurt200g caster sugar100g ground almonds200g self-raising flour1 tsp baking powder½ tsp fine sea salt30g flaked almonds2 tbsp icing sugarTo serveTesco Finest roasted pistachio ice-creamorTesco Finest pistachio gelatoSuggested wine pairingTesco Finest sauternesShop buttonView image in fullscreenHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.
