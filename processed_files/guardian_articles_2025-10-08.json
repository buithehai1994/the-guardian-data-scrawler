And at one point, it feels like you’re witnessing like the last pure moment in history. BeautifulLucy ManganWed 8 Oct 2025 17.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 17.51 EDTShareThis review, being a review and all, contains information on a programme that has already been on television – specifically, the first episode of TheCelebrityTraitors. If you have not seen the first episode of The Celebrity Traitors and do not want to read information about the first episode of The Celebrity Traitors then please! Look away now.I’m sorry to have to labour the point but every critic had to sign the Official Secrets Act before screeners were released to us and I am racked with paranoia. Which is the ideal state in which to approach any series ofThe Traitors, of course, so well-played, BBC marketing/psyops team.All the essential elements are present and correct. The Winkleman. The castle. The dramatic Winkleman cloaks. The dramatic Winkleman sleeves. The boots. The round table around which the Winkleman stomps in her boots to mark out Traitor from Faithful. The eight kabillion first-round contestants.The only difference is that it is a bit easier to keep track of those first-round contestants because they are all familiar faces, designed as a group to pull in punters from all possible demographics and keep the BBC’s current greatest hit as popular as ever. There are national treasures (Celia Imrie, Stephen Fry, Clare Balding) and people for the kidz (YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, TikToker turned actor Ruth Codd, singer-songwriter and frankly mesmeric screen presence Cat Burns), TV presenters (Jonathan Ross, Alan Carr, David Olusoga, Kate Garraway), actors and comedians (Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Nick Mohammed, Joe Wilkinson, Lucy Beaumont), singers (Charlotte Church, Paloma Faith) and sportspeople (Joe Marler, Tom Daley). “He’s a diver,” Empson says fondly of the last as they send him running back over hill and dale to find a missed clue during the first task, “but we use him for everything.”The first task, before the traitors have been chosen, is to dig through their own mock graves for shields that will protect a handful of them against being murdered first time round. Mohammed immediately abandons his own to help Imrie. Why? “Because,” he says, beaming helplessly, “I love her!” I have thought about this from every possible angle and can only conclude that we may just have witnessed the last pure moment in history. Or at least on The Celebrity Traitors, which is all I have the capacity to care about for the next few weeks anyway.View image in fullscreenWho will make the perfect traitor?Photograph: Cody Burridge/BBC/PAThree traitors are appointed by the Winkledomme. They are well-chosen (look AWAY, I’ve TOLD you once): calm, controlled Burns who surveys all with a coolly appraising gaze, avuncular Ross, the safest pair of hands – and Carr, who does not know how to whisper, maintain a straight face or keep a secret. “It’s burning me!” he gasps, and you can feel it. He could drop the lot of them in it at any given moment and I love it.The first task involves pulling a two-and-a-half-tonne Trojan horse, everyone’s favourite symbol of duplicity, through the Scottish Highlands and four gates that have to be unlocked by solving problems or sacrificing a shield. Mohammed proves himself not just to be a parfit, gentil knight but also a puzzle ninja, and Balding makes a terrible mistake which she does not actually apologise for – although if she did and it was left on the cutting room floor, she needs to get on to her agent forthwith. Church proves herself to be the absolute queen we already know her to be. Then they have to reach a fire pit and set it alight, all within 30 minutes, to win £15,000 towards a maximum prize of £100,000 for charity.Next it’s time for the first murder. It requires teamwork from the treacherous trio and speed and discretion from Carr. We’ll find out how it went in the next episode. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to find the second instalment opening with a shot of Carr weeping in Ross’s arms while Burns rolls her eyes.Roll on the next few weeks. Mohammed for the win. Burns for the career pivot. Ross and Fry for a lie-down and Imrie for a possible psychopath. Keep an eye on her.The Celebrity Traitors aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now. New episodes will air on Wednesdays and Thursdays.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTV reviewTelevisionClaudia WinklemanGame showsCelebrityreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what you need to know.Why is the UK steel sector so worried?The EU is the UK’s biggest customer: 78% of all UK steel exports, or 1.9m tonnes, went to the bloc in 2024. The prospect of punitive tariffs on a large chunk of that would make many British products uncompetitive overnight.UK steel production chartThe reason for that reliance is partly geographical proximity: of the EU countries, Ireland is the biggest buyer. But from 1973 until 2020 the UK was part of the EU, whose forerunner was theEuropean Coal and Steel Community– a single market giving easy access to other members of the trade bloc. Brexit has left the UK out in the cold.The European Commission has said Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, who are not in the EU but are integrated into the single market via the European Economic Area, will not be affected by the tariffs or quotas.Why has the EU imposed tariffs on steel?Its steel industry is struggling. The EU’s steel industry “is as good or as bad as the UK’s”, with plants that have not been modernised for 40 years, one diplomatic trade expert told the Guardian. Steelmakers have been struggling for years with high energy costs – Germany’s are among the highest in Europe (althoughstill smaller than the UK’s).However, the big threat in recent years has been the glut of Chinese steel forcing down global prices, along with the devastating50% tariff imposed by Donald Trump on US imports of the metal in June.Current “safeguard” measures to prevent steel dumping are due to expire in June next year, giving the European Commission the perfect opportunity to try to save the sector, which industry commissioner Stéphane Séjourné said on Tuesday was threatened with “collapse”.A key aim for EU steel industry body Eurofer is to increase the utilisation of its plants, which makes them more profitable. Capacity utilisation has dropped from nearly 80% in 2008 to 65% in 2024; the lobby group wants that figure as high as 85%.What is Brussels proposing?The main measure is an increase in the headline EU steel tariff to 50%, up from 25%.However, there will still be tariff-free import quotas. That will allow in 18.3m tonnes a year – a steep reduction of 47% compared with 2024 steel quotas.Top EU sources chartThe key question for Britain and other EU trading partners is how that much smaller quota will be allocated. If the UK were to receive a quota equal to its planned exports (once Tata Steel and British Steel’s exports areback up and running at full tilt after upgrades) then the damage would be limited.Top EU importers chartUK steelmakers on Wednesday told industry minister (and former steel executive) Chris McDonald that the UK must push for country-specific carve-outs from the tariffs, and for the UKto quickly replace its own expiring “safeguards”andprevent a flood of diverted steel.The EU will also add a condition that only steel “melted and poured” in exporters’ markets will count. For instance, that would mean that any steel imported from India to south Wales by Tata Steel would count as Indian, not British, for quota purposes.Is the EU playing a Donald Trump card?Yes and no. The EU has spent all summer railing against Donald Trump’s tariffs as “lose-lose” and “bad for everyone”. But senior officials and Séjourné said they have no choice but to step in to protect an industry that employs 300,000 directly and more than 2 million others indirectly.Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič told reporters on Tuesday that he disagreed with suggestions it was “hypocritical” of the EU to impose tariffs as – unlike the US – the tariffs will comply with World Trade Organization rules and are open to negotiations on quotas, rather than simply being imposed on all and sundry.Who is the target of the tariffs?Without doubt, China – and it isn’t even the biggest supplier to the EU after earlier trade measures targeting direct imports. Eurostat data shows India is the biggest direct supplier, exporting almost €4bn to the EU in 2024, followed by South Korea (€3.6bn) and the UK (€3.2bn). EU data shows, in fact, that imports from India went up by just under 90% between 2019 and 2024.China in global steel production chartBut the rate at which China is producing steel is fuelling global overcapacity. EU officials say the over-supply has “worsened” and become “absolutely untenable”. Not to introduce safeguards would be “extremely damaging” and “possibly fatal”, officials said.China steel production chartThe EU is less concerned about India because it hopes to do a free trade deal by the end of the year. China, however, remains outside any formal trade regime, and the EU feels that, as one of the few open markets left, Beijing is guilty of unfair practices. Pointedly, officials said on Tuesday: “With this proposal, we are again reiterating the invitation to have a serious conversation about that. Regardless of what the Chinese say, we don’t think that this problem of overcapacity is going away.”Where else could UK steelmakers look?The top five steel export destinations for the UK in 2024 were all within the EU. The sixth was the US, where buyers must pay 25% tariffs on imports from Britain – after the two countriesabandoned a zero-tariff dealagreed by Trump and Keir Starmer. That gives the UK some advantage over other countries who pay 50%.Aside from the US, British steel exports would have to contend with the same global glut of Chinese steel seeking a buyer at any price. That is not an attractive prospect.Another place the UK could look is inwards: Britain imports twice the steel it makes. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, pledged at Labour’s party conference last week to direct government spending on steel – such as for warships and railways – to British steelworks.How did Europe’s industry react?Thyssenkrupp, one of Europe’s biggest steel producers, said in June that itfeared the industry was facing “wipe out”, so investors welcomed the protection. Its share price rose by 5.5% on Wednesday, while Sweden’s SSAB rose 4% and ArcelorMittal gained 5% in pre-market trading.However, carmakers – who use millions of tonnes of steel – were not happy. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said it was “most concerned about the inflationary impact”, and that the tariffs go “too far”.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryEuropean UnionTariffsEuropeInternational tradeGlobal economyIndianewsShareReuse this content"

This is why I did itOmid DjaliliThe headlines focus on money, but the gigs were great and I think there are different ways to achieve progress.  Art, especially comedy, can be part of thatWed 8 Oct 2025 11.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 11.40 EDTShareAfter 15 years of turning down offers to perform standup comedy in Saudi Arabia due to the country’s human rights record, this time I tookthe gig. Why?There’s a push for change in Saudi, and signs are discernible. Yet many from the outside would rather comedians in the west stayed away. At a time when freedom of speech is under attack, the backlash against comedians who participated in the Riyadh comedy festival reflects our ongoing struggle to find consensus on this and many issues affecting humanity.I am no stranger to cancel culture. I was cancelled after 9/11 simply for being Middle Eastern, as Arab terrorists were behind the attacks on the twin towers. This is despite the fact that I am not Arab, nor am I, contrary to popular opinion, a terrorist.US comedians defend decision to play in Saudi Arabia: ‘They’re paying me enough to look the other way’Read moreIn certain circles there have been calls to boycott my UK tour Namaste, a show in which I try to explore the nuances of the complex geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. After explaining that the restrictions on performing in Saudi were exactly the same as in Dubai – basically no jokes about the royal family, no disrespecting Islam and no humiliation of the government – a concerned friend texted me, “I think you’re at risk of invalidating your right to make jokes about anything important.” My show in Riyadh had a lot of material about the Saudis themselves. The perception that we, as comedians, were all being paid to be silent was as laughable as the idea that Dave Chappelle, a hugely successful comicwith an estimated worth of $70m(£52m), was doing his show in Riyadh for the money.This perception, it should be said, might have its roots in comments made by an American comedian/podcaster who, prior to the festival, mentioned a figure that he was apparently receiving.He says this led to him being uninvited. Whether it was his material about the regime or just mentioning money in public, we do not know. The comedy guide Chortleerroneously reportedthat the pay was “between $375,000 (£278,000) and $1.6m (£1.2m) for those doing solo shows”. One thing east and west can agree on is don’t talk about your fee publicly, because it is likely to cause consternation among the other performers – most of whom received a significantly smaller amount than the American podcaster was purportedly set to receive.It’s worth remembering that governments are not their people. Especially in Iran, where the chasm between the people and the regime is perhaps wider than ever before. If I’d had an inkling that changes similar to those emerging inSaudi Arabiaright now were happening inside Iran, and a comedy festival was taking place in Tehran (and pigs were flying), I can assure you I would be on the first pig over. As it is, expecting behavioural change from the Islamic regime in Iran would be like being attacked by zombies and politely asking them if they would consider a vegan diet.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: visitsaudi.comSo, for those who are interested, some reflections:Allowing international performances in Saudi, especially comedy, subtly broadens what’s thinkable and sayable in a society. Every laugh at a taboo subject shifts norms, albeit slightly. Bear in mind “slightly” is a seismic movement in the Middle East. Dubai is a very different place now to what it was when I first performed there in 2008.When artists perform in the Middle East they don’t just face “the regime”. They face real people, many of whom are reform-minded, quietly disillusioned youth who want to embrace new ideas without betraying their own culture and beliefs.As an international performer I like to connect with local artistes. As a Middle Eastern comedian I am of the view that a blanket boycott tends to dismiss and patronise ordinary Saudis, often those eager for exposure to diverse culture.There’s a saying in the Middle East: “It’s not about what you hear, it’s about being here.” And the truth is, if you’re sitting behind a keyboard on the other side of the border lecturing on a social media site owned by a billionaire, then your capacity to contribute to positive change might be somewhat compromised.One significant sign of progress in the Middle East is how women are treated. In Saudi, women were not even allowed to drive until 2018. Seven years later I am on stage in Riyadh doing jokes about it. A routine at the expense of the men who get frustrated with women who actually abide by the traffic laws went down well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Performing is not selling out. Rather it is about sharing laughter and a chance for cultural exchange as a force for social transformation. And we underestimate the transformative power of comedy at our peril. So I went.And the gigs were great. Packed houses, young crowds, popcorn, standing ovations, even heckling. About 80% of the audiences were locals, many of whom had never seen a live comedy gig. I saw theNorthern Irish comedian Jimeoinspeak about getting older and suffering varicose veins, on his nether regions. After the show, a discussion broke out between Saudis discussing remedies they could suggest, such as pomegranate juice. If that’s not a step towards east/west relations then I don’t know what is.I’ve waited years for something like this to happen – millions of us with links to the region see it as a miracle of change. And privileged individuals either privately or online instructing me on what I should or shouldn’t do regarding gigs in the Middle East is symptomatic of the worrying ignorance that continues to exist. Not all parts of the region are the same – and should not all be given the same blanket treatment.One American comedian not invited to the festival wrote of the comedians who went to Riyadh, “your hypocrisy will never be not noted.” Another American who turned down the offer was reported to have said, “I said no because I won’t do a show in a country responsible for 9/11.” Two funny guys I like very much. But maybe go there first before judging the region, its people and the motives of those who choose to travel there?Saudi Arabia – I’ll be back there soon.

The American pop pioneer dedicated his long career to cakes, sweets and gumball machines, a visual world of treats and candies laid out in American diners and on deli counters, tempting viewers to commit the ultimate crime and take a big, juicy bite.But he didn’t just paint for the sake of getting you salivating. His work (here at the Courtauld in his first ever UK museum show) is both an ultraserious take on the material history of painting, a sort of update on the long legacy of the still life, and a deep dive into burgeoning consumerism and the capitalistic euphoria of the mass-produced, mid-century American dream.His background offers the biggest clue to how he created his kitschy universe of pastel pastries and gloopy cherry pies. He came to art via illustration and animation, becoming an apprentice at Walt Disney Studios before going on to work as a cartoonist and motion picture animator. When you paint for a huge, mainstream audience, you get a firm grasp on directness and legibility, on how to get your ideas across immediately, like a cream pie to the face.View image in fullscreenDelicious … Thiebaud’s Cakes, 1963.Illustration: National Gallery of Art, Washington/Wayne Thiebaud VAGA at ARS, NY and DACSThen in the 1950s he metElaine and Willem de Kooningand a bunch of other abstract expressionists and hey presto, you’ve got a flavour combination that works: a background in art for a big audience, and a knowledge of modern, conceptual experimentation. Delicious.The earliest works here, from 1956, are of a butcher’s counter and a pinball machine – quintessential Thiebaud themes – but the marks are thick and grubby. It’s all dark, filthy, almost pushing towards abstraction. They’re not quite there, too muddy to get their ideas across properly.But within five years, it all clicked. By 1961, it looks like Thiebaud. A bowl of cereal, some candied apples, a row of oozing cakes, five hotdogs, a cup of coffee – all captured in cold whites, steely greys, and the luminous yellows and pinks of lemon meringues and berry coulis. They are staggering still lifes, beautifully and thickly painted. They’re also exercises in painterly precision, in exploring the geometry of consumable goods. Pies are just triangles, cakes are cylinders. It’s very, very art historically aware, a series of riffs on Cézanne and Chardin. Look at those gumball machines, spheres within spheres, uncountable, precise, beautiful. It’s still life painting at its modern best.View image in fullscreenA slice of American life … Four Pinball Machines, 1962.Illustration: Acquavella Galleries/Wayne Thiebaud VAGA at ARS, NY and DACSIt is also hugely conceptual. This is a slice of American life, it’s the economic boom of a world power, it’s all of the consumerism and postwar capitalism of the US expressed in lush images of delis and diners and the goods they were flogging. He is elevating the mundane side of American life to an unprecedented level of historical, aesthetic importance.That is why pop artists loved him, and why he was included in so many pop exhibitions: it’s consumerism as subject and medium. But it’s not slick and detached like Warhol, it’s not tossed off and reproducible, it’s something more serious than that.View image in fullscreenA visual world of treats … Delicatessen Counter, 1963.Illustration: Julia Featheringill/Wayne Thiebaud VAGA at ARS, NY and DACSAnd that mixture, that conflict, is a blank slate into which you can read endless ideas. These paintings are so easy to interpret, but so beautifully done that they can be about almost anything. Want them to be about consumerism and commercialism? You got it. Want them to be about America? Easy. Geometricism, art history, the physical nature of paint? Go for it, it’s all of these things and none of them.The show only goes up to 1969, which means you’re somehow left hungry for more of his sickly sweet and waist-bulgingly calorific painting. That’s what Thiebaud does, he makes gluttons of us all.Wayne Thiebaud: American Still Life is at theCourtauld Gallery, London, from 10 October to 18 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even around midnight, the humidity was still so oppressive he spent the final 20 minutes of histhird-round match against Tallon Griekspoorcramping, panting and in considerable pain. Eventually, he could not even walk properly. Midway through the final set, the 24‑year‑old hobbled slowly to his chair using his racket as a crutch and terminated the match.Emma Raducanu retires from first-round match at stiflingly hot Wuhan OpenRead moreThose scenes were representative of the Shanghai Masters so far as, throughout the past week, so many players have wilted in brutal conditions. Terence Atmane and Hamad Medjedovic both retired after struggling with the heat. Francisco Comesaña appeared close to collapsing and he had to be helped mid-match by his opponent Lorenzo Musetti. Despite the benefit of competing at night,Novak Djokovic repeatedly vomitedin two consecutive matches and there were times in his fourth round win over Jaume Munar where he too looked as if he had reached his limit.Five hundred miles away in Wuhan, the weather has also been challenging for the top female players. Emma Raducanu and Jelena Ostapenko both retired in hot, humid conditions. Alongside a social media video that showed her wringing out sweat from her socks, Bianca Andreescu wrote: “Wuhan weather really said: ‘Go play tennis in a sauna.’”As startling as these scenes have been, this is hardly uncharted territory. Every year players are pushed to their limits in a sport that chases the sun. However, tennis has failed to ensure players’ safety by tackling the danger of competing in such extreme conditions.The most immediate and glaring problem was illustrated by Holger Rune during his medical time out at the weekend. Speaking with Gerry Armstrong, one of the men’s Association ofTennisProfessionals supervisors in Shanghai, Rune asked: “Why doesn’t the ATP have a heat rule? You want a player to die on the court?”View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic towels away sweat during his match against Jaume Munar at the Shanghai Masters.Photograph: Andy Wong/APWhile the grand slam tournaments and the Women’s Tennis Association have extreme‑heat policies, the ATP still does not. The ATP entrusts the supervisors, in coordination with its medical staff, to manage the players in stifling conditions. As such, Armstrong’s response to Rune was even more damning. “I don’t know, it’s a good question,” he said.In a statement, an ATP representative said: “Under ATP rules, decisions regarding the suspension of play due to weather conditions – including extreme heat – lie with the on-site ATP supervisor, in coordination with on‑site medical teams and local authorities. In parallel, the ATP medical services team implements several measures in cases of extreme heat, to help protect player health during competition.“This remains under active review and additional measures including the implementation of an official heat policy are currently being evaluated in consultation with players, tournaments, and medical experts. Player safety remains a top priority for the ATP.”In a well-governed sport, a standardised extreme‑heat policy across all tournaments would have already existed for a long time. Tennis, however, is split uncomfortably between the four grand slam tournaments, the ATP, WTA and International Tennis Federation – organisations that are often too focused on protecting their own interests.View image in fullscreenHolger Rune feels the heat at the Shanghai Masters.Photograph: Andy Wong/APIn August, players similarly struggled in hot and humid conditions for two weeks at the Cincinnati Open before the tournament concluded withSinner retiring against Carlos Alcaraz in the finaldue to illness. Global heating will lead only to further difficulties, so governing bodies should already be investigating how to adapt the calendar to avoid these unbearable conditions.This is a challenging subject considering physical preparation and stamina is a key part of excelling at the top of the sport. Elite players pride themselves on being able to handle the elements and still find a way through. Everyone, however, has a limit.“I think there should be some kind of rule,” Rune said on Tuesday. “We can handle a certain amount of heat because we are fit, we’re strong, we’re mentally strong as well, but there’s always a limit. I think it’s also important to take care of your health. We need to survive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Back in Cincinnati, as the heat wreaked havoc on the tournament, Iga Swiatek said she would like to see more flexibility with the time limit between points on warmer days: “This kind of heat is like something that we just need to survive, and it’s not like we can’t,” she said. “Maybe giving us five more seconds to use the towel or to have more time to breathe, because it is a bit harder, would be nice.”This latest issue of managing extreme heat comes at the end of another gruelling, long season, and player welfare has been a significant talking point.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka came through the extreme heat to beat Rebecca Sramkova at the Wuhan Open.Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesThe number of retirements, withdrawals and injuries this year has been shocking. With seven retirements or walkovers at the Shanghai Masters over the past week, there have now been 41 retirements and walkovers at the ATP Masters 1000 events this year, including nine in Madrid and eight in Cincinnati.On Monday last week at the China Open in Beijing, a combined WTA 1000 and ATP 500 event, five of the 12 matches ended in retirements. This does not even account for the injuries, physical pain and mental strain that many players on both tours are continuing to push through. It is increasingly difficult to argue that the tours have done enough to prioritise player welfare.The length of the tennis season has been a significant talking point for decades with minimal change, but recent initiatives from the ATP and WTA tours have only seemed to accentuate these issues.Over the past two years, the WTA has enacted stricter scheduling controls for its top players and there is a growing consensus that the ATP-driven push to extend so many of the ATP and WTA 1000 events into protracted two-week affairs have come at the cost of the players themselves. With even more “on” days at tournaments and more time away from home, their growing physical and mental difficulties are clear.In the final weeks of another campaign, as the injuries pile up and few competitors seem content, it feels like the tour is reaching breaking point. It is still unclear, however, if the governing bodies are ready to recognise those issues and take meaningful steps towards fixing them.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As this famous painting of Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy goes under the hammer, the surviving sitter looks backStephen SmithWed 8 Oct 2025 11.19 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 13.44 EDTShare‘Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh!” Laughter explodes down the line from California. “It was a very long time ago!” says the painter Don Bachardy. His voice is high and rasping. Listening to him, you could be forgiven for thinking that the late Truman Capote was still with us. As for what happened “a very long time ago”, Bachardy is referring to the parties he threw with his partner, the British novelistChristopher Isherwood. Their home in Adelaide Drive, Santa Monica, was a salon thronged by movie stars and writers as well as Bachardy’s fellow artists.“Yes, we had a good time back then, but you can’t expect me to remember exactly who was here!” he says. It’s a fair point. Isherwood has been dead for almost 40 years and Bachardy, who is 91, suffers from some of the conditions that typically afflict people of his age. But the famous names they entertained in the 60s and 70s read like a wishlist for the guest bookers on the Johnny Carson show: Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich, Laurence Olivier, Rock Hudson, Igor Stravinsky, Elton John, Tennessee Williams and Capote, too.David wasn’t in any hurry – you don’t get a beautiful picture in half an hourThose heady recollections have been prompted by the forthcoming auction of David Hockney’s celebrated “double portrait” of Isherwood and Bachardy. It’s a monumental work, measuring more than six feet by nine feet, and it could fetch up to £45m. Bachardy has no difficulty in remembering that, he says. “How could one forget it? It’s a beautiful picture.”Hockney depicted the couple in their living room, sitting in matching chairs. Isherwood, whose writing inspired Cabaret and the acclaimed film A Single Man, is seen on the right of frame, looking over at Bachardy. The foreground is filled by a large, low table set with stacks of books and a fruit bowl. The pieces of fruit are almost luminous in the west coast sunshine that infuses the room despite the closed shutters behind the two men. My call to the Los Angeles-born Bachardy finds him anticipating another scintillating day. “It’s a sunny morning here, the ocean is calm,” he confirms. He is speaking from the house on Adelaide Drive. Next year, Bachardy will have lived there for 70 years.View image in fullscreen‘No one held a candle to him’ … Bachardy with Isherwood, left, in the 70s.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyPainted in 1968, Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy is like a storyboard for an interiors magazine or a sober, even bourgeois, portrait of a marriage, one that could almost have come from the studio of a Gainsborough or Joshua Reynolds. You might never know that “homosexual acts” were criminalised in the California of the 60s and that out gay men and women were beyond the pale of mainstream America. Needless to say, Isherwood and Bachardy weren’t married. They spent their first night together on Valentine’s Day 1953 when the artist was 18 and the writer 48. They lived with each other, not always frictionlessly, until Isherwood died in 1986.Hockney’s study of a gay couple living a settled middle-class life – their improving books, their healthy snacks – is a landmark in queer art, according to critics. “It’s perfectly understandable that’s what it’s become,” agrees the surviving sitter. It’s also a significant work in Hockney’s own oeuvre, the first of only seven “double portraits” by the artist, which also include the much-loved Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, now in Tate Britain in London.Despite its title, Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy is really about three people: the third, unseen presence is the artist himself, who was a neighbour of Bachardy’s at the time and remains a friend. What does Bachardy remember about the making of the work? “David was relaxed, confident. He’s very talented, his results were always impressive. He wasn’t in any hurry. You don’t get a beautiful picture in half an hour.”I expected the best and I got it. I had no reservations about the painting at allHockney took photographs of his subjects and drew them in pencil before making the finished work in acrylic paint. At first, he intended that the pair would appear the other way round in the picture, but then he noticed that the writer often glanced over to his lover while they sat for him and so he swapped them over.Were they good models? “I sat still!” Bachardy said. “David and I are both painters. We know exactly how to do it and we’ve done it for years.” What about Isherwood? “He had lots of experience of sitting for artists and he was lucky to have such talented artists painting him.” Was Bachardy happy when he saw the finished product? “I expected the best and I got it. I had no reservations about it at all.”But some people are surprised or even shocked to see what an artist has made of them, even one as accomplished as Hockney. “The amateurs have amateur reactions,” says Bachardy with a note of asperity. “People who are doing this for a living are very experienced.” He is a considerable artist in his own right, with many gallery shows in the US to his credit. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum ofArtin New York and the National Portrait Gallery in London. For a time, he was court artist to Hollywood royalty. He painted Bette Davis at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Contemplating Bachardy’s likeness of her, the formidable star muttered: “Yes, that’s the old bag.”As well as sitting for Hockney, Bachardy returned the favour. He says: “I don’t think somebody in his position could be happy sitting for another painter but we sat for each other several times. I think this was really the start for him of doing portraits outside members of his family. We had friends who wanted to sit for us. We used to say to each other, ‘Hey, this is a pretty good business to get into!’” Their friendship survived Hockney moving back to Europe and they still speak on the phone from time to time, says Bachardy.View image in fullscreen‘I am still painting because that’s what I do’ … Don Bachardy in 2010.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverThe double portrait was a highlight of Hockney’s acclaimed exhibition in Paris this summer, David Hockney 25. It’s of its time and yet oddly contemporary: we could be looking at the green room of a literary festival somewhere warm, or the waiting room of an exclusive and open-minded adoption agency. It’s been in private hands for the past four decades and Bachardy is surprised to learn that it’s up for sale. Its eye-popping asking price elicits another rasping laugh. “Oh really? Well let’s see. I’ll believe it when I see it!”Do you think it’s a lot of money for a painting of you and Christopher, I ask. “It’s a lot of money for anything!” he says, with that voice like an emery board from Tiffany’s.David Hockney 25 review – so moving I had tears in my eyesRead moreBachardy painted Isherwood many times over. Was that difficult? “It’s always difficult to do something that’s worth doing, whether it was Christopher or a hundred other people. If you live with a painter, it’s hard to go on being painted by him, but he was a good sport.”Isherwood died at Adelaide Drive. He was 81. Some of Bachardy’s most penetrating and affecting images of him were made as he was dying and immediately postmortem. Though the artist has not wanted for company in the past 40 years or so, Isherwood was a great loss, he says. “He was irreplaceable, one of a kind. I never met anyone who could hold a candle to him. I probably miss him more than ever because it’s been such a long time since he went another way.”Why has Bachardy chosen to stay in the house after so many years? Doesn’t he get itchy feet? “Oh, I think my feet are as itchy as any other person’s! But this is a precious, wonderful house. I love it and would hate to leave it. Isn’t that what most people feel about their home?”Bachardy tells me that he continues to paint. “Yes, I am painting because that’s what I do. The same things I’ve always done: paintings of people, portraits. It can be difficult but not enough to stymie me,” he says. You’ve been lucky with your eyesight, I suggest. “I think I’ve been lucky in quite a few departments,” he shoots back.I wonder what’s become of the furniture which is such a feature of Hockney’s painting. Bachardy thinks that he still has the chairs. His friend, a younger man called Tim, takes the phone. He says: “The chairs are rattan. They were deteriorating so they’re in storage.”Somebody would probably pay a lot of money for them, I suggest. “That’s why they’re in storage,” Tim replies. He says the chairs may be restored to the property at a future date. Could the house become a museum? “It belongs to a trust. It might become a residence,” thinks Tim, perhaps a base for writers and painters as it was in its 60s pomp.At the beginning of the year, the house was threatened by the wildfires that raced through the neighbouring district of Pacific Palisades. “We were only moderately endangered,” says Bachardy. “The fire wasn’t really close.” Did he evacuate? “No, I stayed. I thought, ‘If the house burns down, I prefer to stay in it.’”Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy will be auctioned by Christie’s in New York next month. It can be viewed at Christie’s, London, 17-22 OctoberThis article was amended on 8 October 2025.

They would “allow an open all hours free-for-all in the availability of alcohol”, said Dr Katherine Severi, the chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies thinktank.But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said that “a new and improved licensing system that is fit for the 21st century will be a huge boost to the nation’s pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels”.Nick Mackenzie, the chief executive of Greene King, agreed, adding that existing licensing regulations “provide a clear example of how well-intentioned legislation can inhibit economic growth, with excessive restrictions often limiting premises’ ability to respond to changing circumstances and customer demand”.Local authorities and police and crime commissioners fear that extended late night opening will lead to more noise, nuisance and antisocial behaviour blighting the lives of residents who live near licensed premises.“These proposed reforms, developed without adequate input from policing, ambulance services, local licensing authorities, health experts or citizens are a charter for chaos,” said Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Change UK.“One of the biggest things that people across the country are desperate to see is safer streets with less antisocial behaviour. Yet these proposals – little more than an alcohol industry wish-list – would deliver the opposite.”“Allowing petrol stations, off-licences and corner shops to sell alcohol even later into the evening, or the early hours, will inevitably mean more victims of crime, including domestic violence, more antisocial behaviour and disturbance, more police time spent dealing with drink-fuelled incidents and both ambulance and A&E staff having to deal with even more people who have come to harm as a result of alcohol,” he added.View image in fullscreenThe move was criticised by health experts as a ‘charter for chaos’Photograph: Sergio Azenha/AlamyThe plans centre on major reforms of the Licensing Act 2003, under which local councils grant licences to 224,000 pubs, clubs, restaurants and supermarkets to sell alcohol within set hours. Council licensing committees of elected councillors base their decisions on four “licensing objectives”: the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, prevention of public nuisance and protecting children from harm.But the government-appointed taskforce behind the plan has suggested the creation of a new fifth objective – promoting economic growth – which councils would have to take into account when deciding on applications for new premises or longer opening hours. That has sparked claims that the government has become too close to the alcohol industry.“Adding a new objective focused on economic growth is completely ludicrous and undermines the purpose of licensing”, said Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance.“Licensing exists to protect people, not business profits. To push this through while alcohol deaths are at record highs raises serious questions about who this government is really working for.”The taskforce was co-chaired by Mackenzie and Gareth Thomas, at the time a business and trade minister. It also included representatives of UK Hospitality, the Night Time Industries Association and live music industry as well as from the National Police Chiefs Council and greater London Authority. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, has been granted powers to overrule licensing decisions by the capital’s 32 local councils if he judges that that will boost the city’s night time economy and appeal to tourists.When the proposals were first floated earlier this year the government said that it was “calling ‘last orders’ on red tape choking pubs, clubs and restaurants in [a] major boost to the British night out”.Severi warned ministers that the push to help the hospitality sector could backfire as off-licences, corner shops and supermarkets, which already sell 75% of all alcohol, would also take advantage of easier access to longer opening hours.“Using licensing to deregulate alcohol sales in the name of business growth is misguided and irresponsible”, she added.“While the government may be wary of introducing public health measures that could be seen as unpopular with Reform UK voters or criticised as ‘nanny state’ policies, polling shows strong support among Reform voters for government action to protect and promote health, particularly when it helps reduce preventable disease and ease pressure on the NHS,” she added.The plan will also restrict local councils’ long-held freedom to control licensing in their area by creating a new “national licensing policy framework” which would enhance the role of unelected licensing officers and diminish the power of elected representatives.“These reforms would hollow out the power of local licensing authorities, giving decisive influence to unelected officials and unaccountable bodies”, said James Nicholls, an expert in alcohol policy at Stirling University. They will also make it harder for residents to object to applications from operators to open new premises or extend opening hours, he added.His colleague Prof Niamh Fitzgerald said: “These proposals are completely contrary to any intention to deliver safer streets or reduce violence against women. The Home Office’s own analysis has found that alcohol is a factor in half of all intimate partner murders.”A government spokesperson said: “We are looking to rebalance the licensing system, to one which both protects local communities and gives businesses the flexibility they need to invest and adapt to changing consumer trends.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryPubsEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It calls for a ceasefire, the return of hostages still held by Hamas and a surge of aid into Gaza “without interference … through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent”.Dr Akihiro Seita, the Unrwa director of health and an author of the study, said more malnourished children would die unless there was an end to hostilities and “unimpeded, competent, international humanitarian nutritional, medical, economic and social services”.The study found two years of war had led to “enormous nutritional consequences” for tens of thousands of children across Gaza.Researchers used measurements of the circumference of the arms of 220,000 children aged between six months and five years old in Gaza between January 2024, and August 2025, when famine was declared in parts of Gazaby a UN-backed panel of independent experts.In January 2024, 5% of children screened showed evidence of wasting, rising to nearly 9% six months later, researchers found. After Israel imposed severe aid restrictions from the end of 2024, the prevalence of wasting had almost doubled by January 2025.When a six-week ceasefire allowed more aid to enter Gaza, wasting declined significantly before Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade in March. Though these restrictions were eased in May 2025, levels of wasting among screened children soared to nearly 16%, with almost a quarter of these suffering severe acute malnutrition, the most dangerous form of the condition.Among the estimated total population of Gaza, this is equivalent to more than 54,600 children up to six years old who need emergency nutrition and medical care, including 12,800 severely wasted children, the researchers said.Israel has accused Hamas of looting much of the aid reaching Gaza, but has not provided evidence of any significant amount of theft by the Islamist militant organisation. Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls the entry of aid into Gaza, alsoaccused Hamasof deliberately preventing civilians accessing aid by firing rockets at aid distribution sites.View image in fullscreenPalestinians, including children, wait with pots to receive hot meals distributed by charity organisations on 25 September.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBetween May and July, more than 1,400 Palestinians were killed seeking humanitarian assistance in Gaza, 859 in the vicinity of sites run by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and 514 along the routes of food convoys,according to the UN, which said that most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.Aid agencies say Israeli restrictions prevent much of the aid getting into Gaza, and conditions created by the war and Israeli strategic decisions have made it almost impossible for them to operate.Dr Masako Horino, nutrition epidemiologist at Unrwa and lead scientist for the study, said that evidence from before the war indicated that children in Palestinian refugee families in the Gaza Strip were already “food insecure” but were only marginally underweight.“Following two years of war and severe restrictions in humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality,” Horino said.Leading child health experts and paediatricians said the study was particularly “notable and important” because it was the first major medical study to reveal the extent of malnutrition among children in Gaza after two years of war.Writing in a comment piecein the Lancet, Zulfiqar Bhutta, Jessica Fanzo, and Paul Wise, who were not involved in the research, said: “It is now well established that the children of Gaza are starving and require immediate and sustained humanitarian assistance. The study by Horino and colleagues provides some of the most definitive evidence to date of this effect.”Bhutta, of the Hospital for Sick Children in Canada, Fanzo, of Columbia University and Wise, of Stanford University, also praised the researchers for using scientific evidence “to show grievous, preventable harm to children”.“These temporal data strongly suggest that restrictions on food and assistance have resulted in severe malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip, a reality that will undoubtedly impact their future health and development outcomes for generations.”Although attention has mostly focused on the short-term outcomes of starvation, there should also be “serious concern” over its long-term health effects, which included “inordinately high risks of non-communicable diseases”, they added.On Tuesday, Cogatsaidit “continues to support international organisations facilitating food delivery and production for Gaza’s civilian population”.The study found that in Rafah, the southern city in Gaza, there was a fourfold increase in wasting malnutrition after Israel launched a massive offensive into the city and levelled it. There was then a sharp decline in April 2025 after the short-lived ceasefire.In Gaza City, prevalence of wasting malnutrition rose more than fivefold from March 2025, reaching almost 30% in mid-August 2025.James Elder, a spokesperson for Unicef, said last week that there was “a lot of panic, a lot of very hungry people” in Gaza City.“It is very difficult to describe the levels of desperation there. There are tens of thousands of children. About two-thirds of people just can’t leave. There are pregnant women eating a meal a day. More aid trucks are coming in but it is a fraction of what we need,” Elder said.Unrwa, which was founded in 1949 to provide essential services for Palestinian refugees who had fled or been expelled during the wars surrounding the foundation of Israel, has been accused by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, of being “perforated by Hamas” and banned by Israel. Unrwa denied the allegations and was cleared by UN investigators.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaMalnutritionIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

It has also emerged that he appears to have had Islamic marriages to three women in towns across the north of England at the same time, fathering two young children to one of them.The 38-year-old, who cannot be identified, described how Shamie was “controlling and manipulating”, admonishing her for drinking energy drinks, encouraging her to go to the mosque, read the Qur’an and pray with him, and later refusing her requests for a divorce.However, she said that he had never appeared radicalised and was a “normal” practising Muslim, adding that he had barely mentioned Israel’s attack on Gaza – which counter-terror police are examining as a potential motive for his attack. One witness heard him shout: “This is what you’re going to get for killing our children” as he tried to force his way into the synagogue armed with a knife last Thursday.She said: “Was he this terrorist all along or was he crying out for help? Who knows? Maybe [he did it because of] his messed-up life, because he’s playing too many people. Apparently he was up for rape with the police. There’s so many questions.“Did he do it because he knew he was going to get found out about these other women and he was up [on police bail] for [rape]? Or was he just mentally fed up and drained because he couldn’t carry on living the lifestyle?”Police said on Wednesday that Shamie pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a call to 999 during the attack but reiterated that he was not known to counter-terror officers. However, he is known to have a criminal past and was under investigation for an alleged rape.The Guardian revealed this week that police officers attended his family home earlier this year, believed to be in relation to safeguarding concerns. He lived at the property in Prestwich, north Manchester, with his mother and one of his wives and their two children, aged one and three. After the police visit, he told neighbours that his wife had left and would not let him see their children.In an hour-long interview on Wednesday, a separate wife described how Shamie had led a double life and initially kept his Manchester family secret. She said they met on the Muslim dating app Muzmatch (now called Muzz) in December 2021 and married in an Islamic ceremony the following month.Shamie is said to have used multiple online personae, frequently using the name “Jay” and in one profile calling himself Dormammu Seven – a reference to a comic-book devil. His interests included anime and the Marvel series, working out, playing football, praying at the mosque and attending Islamic talks, she said, adding that he did not drink or take drugs.0:35Voice message from Jihad Al-Shamie to one of his wives – audioThe woman, a Muslim convert, said she last spoke to him in April this year, shortly after he passed his driving test. Speaking about their relationship, she described how he had been nice at first but then became “controlling, manipulating” and “intimidating and aggressive”, adding: “He would be slating me and my children and would say ‘Who would want you and your baggage?’”She said Shamie had raped her multiple times but that she did not report this to police until after the synagogue attack. The woman said she had now given a first witness account and handed over her mobile phone to investigators.Text messages seen by the Guardian show Shamie refusing her request for a divorce when she discovered he had children with another woman at his home in Manchester. In another he tells her: “I can do better … don’t need someone with your baggage,” and to “stop being silly and paranoid”. He wrote: “I’ve already taken u back as my wife u don’t get to just dissappear [sic] and block me [it] doesn’t work like that.”In a voice note, he said: “I’m crazy about you. I can’t stop thinking about you. You’re the only woman I want in my life.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterGreater ManchesterAntisemitismEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re going to a country, India, where they’ve already done ID and made a massive success of it. So one of the meetings I’ll be having is about ID, in relation to that.”View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer speaks to the British high commissioner to India, Lindy Cameron, and the British deputy high commissioner for western India, Harjinder Kang, in Mumbai.Photograph: Leon Neal/ReutersThe digital ID system in India is far more extensive than that announced by the UK government and holds biometric data as well as residential and contact information. Government sources said there was no intention to copy the system, but to examine the way it was used and implemented, handling 80m transactions a day.It is considered a success, albeit with controversial implications, with estimates it has saved the Indian economy about £11bn in administration and corruption costs.Citizens are given a 12-digit identifying number, which replaces the need for multiple layers of paper documentation to prove their status when they take out bank accounts or apply for state benefits. Prior to the scheme, millions of babies would routinely not be registered at birth, leaving people struggling to access benefits or ways to prove their existence later in life.Critics of the Indian scheme said it was introduced with little protection for personal data, and has caused problems among the poorest citizens, with some said to have been denied medical care or benefits for not having the ID.Phone companies and banks have in some instances threatened to shut down accounts not linked to ID numbers, though a supreme court ruling has said it should not be mandatory for private services or education. Activists have also reported it being used to disenfranchise Muslim voters in the north of the country.Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was held because it was “useful to hear from the Indian experience; it has a very different inception and a different system, but it is used 80m times a day”.View image in fullscreenProtesters gather near Downing Street to voice their opposition to the plans for digital IDs.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAsked about some of the controversies with the Indian system, he said the UK system would have a different design – there are no plans to use biometric data so far. “One of core priorities is inclusivity and that’s what the British consultation will be about,” he said.Starmer said the scheme was essential to tackle illegal working, as the ID would be mandatory for employment, but that he hoped it would become a voluntary convenience measure for most British citizens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rightwing parties have put the spotlight on gig economy companies such as UberEats and Deliveroo, where migrant workers have been able to use false identities to work.“We have to have returns agreements with countries, as we’ve got with France, and we need to address the fact that too many people can come to this country and work illegally,” Starmer said. “And that’s why ID mandatory for working is really important.Starmer insists India trade deal will not affect UK visas as he heads to MumbaiRead more“There is a case to be made about the benefits for voluntary ID into other areas, and obviously we need to make that case. I think it’s a really important discussion for us to have. So on the one hand, it’s mandatory for work, but I actually think it would be a good passport.”The government has not identified any private provider that can take part in the scheme, with the tech companyPalantirsaying it would not do so because the plan was not in the Labour manifesto and therefore had no mandate.All opposition parties have said they would oppose the scheme, and there remain significant misgivings among some Labour MPs about the possibility of snowballing costs and data breaches.Net support for digital ID cardsfell from 35% in the early summer to -14%at the weekend after Starmer’s announcement, according to polling by More in Common.View image in fullscreenThe prime minister meets the Bollywood star Rani Mukerji during a visit to Yash Raj Films studio.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAStarmer will meet his Indian counterpart,Narendra Modi, on Thursday and make a keynote address at a fintech conference. The prime minister told a business delegation of more than 120 chief executives and cultural leaders that he hoped each one of them would have a deal to sign by the end of the trip.On a visit to a Bollywood production studio, Starmer announced three new Bollywood blockbusters would be made in the UK from next year by Yash Raj Films, creating more than 3,000 jobs.No 10 said deals signed during the trip would create about 7,000 jobs through Indian investment in the UK. Speaking at a visit to a football ground, Starmer denied business leaders had been pressing for liberalisation of visa rules.“None of them have raised with me the question of visas. That wasn’t part of the FTA (free trade agreement),” he said. “What this is about is providing opportunities for them to take advantage of the FTA, and even before it’s fully enforced, the mood is very, very strong between India and the UK.”Explore more on these topicsIdentity cardsKeir StarmerIndiaNarendra ModiTrade policySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

That shift helped propel the far-right party Alternative for Germany to first place in some polls.Explore more on these topicsEuropeMigrationGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

The £30,000 prize, which has previously been known as the Orange prize and the Baileys prize, has run since 1996.In a statement, Gillard said, “Reading fiction has always been my most treasured pastime. From the simple story books of childhood to the most vaunted works of literature, and every type of page turner in between, reading has given me refuge, expanded my imagination and cultivated my understanding.\"“There have been times in my life when I had too little time for reading, now I am delighted to have the opportunity to plunge headlong into many vibrant works of fiction by women and to work with a joyful panel of judges to highlight the books that really speak to us and shine.”Gillard has long had ties to the UK: she was born in Wales in 1961, and her family moved to Australia in 1966. Serving as Australia’s prime minister from 2010 to 2013, since 2021 she has been chair of the board of governors atthe UK health research charity the Wellcome Trust.Women’s prize for fiction goes to debut novelist Yael van der Wouden’s The SafekeepRead moreJoining Gillard on the judging panel will be the poet and novelist Mona Arshi; writer, poet and former BBC Radio presenter Salma El-Wardany; actor and comedian Cariad Lloyd; and DJ and broadcaster Annie Mac.The former Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire will serve as chair of judges for the £30,000 Women’s prize for nonfiction, which was first awarded in 2024.“There is so much quality nonfiction being written by women across a wide range of topics, and yet too often – and for too long – this writing has been ignored. After 26 years in work tackling violence against women, it is distressing to see women’s rights being rolled back,” Debbonaire said, calling reading and writing “hugely important tools for action”.The other judges on the nonfiction panel are the engineer and author Roma Agrawal; founder of wellness company Neom Wellbeing Nicola Elliott; novelist Nina Stibbe; and judge and thriller author Nicola Williams.Last year’s fiction prize was won by the Dutch authorYael van der Wouden for her debut, The Safekeep, while the nonfiction prize was won by the doctor and writerRachel ClarkeforThe Story of a Heart: Two Families, One Heart, and a Medical Miracle.The longlist for the 2026 Women’s prize for fiction will be announced on 4 March, and the shortlist on 22 April.

Trade unions responded with fury, labelling the idea a “disaster”.The Ministry of Justice declined to rule out implementing the proposal last week, saying only that “decision-making about the department’s spending and fees for the next few years following this summer’s spending review is ongoing”.But in a statement on Wednesday, Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, said: “It’s a fundamental principle that everyone, no matter their income, should be able to get access to justice to challenge unfair behaviour at work.“It’s not just a basic right, it’s also fundamental to this government’s plan to make work pay. That’s why it will remain free to bring a case to an employment tribunal, ensuring everyone, no matter their means, can stand up for their rights at work.”Making a claim against an employer had been free since the tribunal system was established in the 1960s, until David Cameron’s coalition government introduced charges in 2013. Fees were then scrapped in 2017, after thesupreme court ruled they were unlawful, after a case brought by the Unison trade union.Lammy added: “The Tory-Lib Dem coalition government tried to price workers out of justice with tribunal fees. Let me be clear, we will not.”Paul Nowak, secretary general of the TUC, welcomed Lammy’s announcement, saying: “No one should ever be priced out of enforcing their rights at work.”He added: “The Conservatives left the tribunal system and our courts in a mess with huge backlogs.Trade unionsare ready to work with the deputy prime minister and other ministers to deliver a system that is fair, accessible and fit for the future. This includes unions helping workers resolve problems in the workplace, not the courts.”Labour’s employment rights bill includes sweeping changes to workers’ rights, which the unions have welcomed, but some business lobby groups have argued will add to the costs of hiring workers. The changes are expected to lead to an increase in tribunal cases.The Conservatives, under the leadership of the then prime minister Rishi Sunak, proposed a£55 fee for workers to make an employment tribunal claim, in plans made void by Keir Starmer’s general election victory.With significant delays and a shortage of qualified judges, the UK’s employment tribunal backlog has ballooned, with a queue of45,000 single open casesat the end of March.In order to help tackle the backlog, the Ministry of Justice began recruitment for up to 36 employment tribunal judges in March, and it plans to hire another 50 next year.Explore more on these topicsEmployment tribunalsEmployment lawDavid LammyTrade unionsWorkers' rightsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I’m working hard here.”Parton added: “Anyway, I wanted to put everybody’s mind at ease, those of you that seem to be real concerned, which I appreciate, and I appreciate your prayers because I’m a person of faith.”Parton did not elaborate or specify on the “health challenges” that also forced her to withdraw from November’s Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Governors Awards, where she was set to receive the Jean Hersholt humanitarian award. But she made clear that she was undergoing medical treatments near her home in Nashville.“As I mentioned back when my husband Carl was very sick, that was for a long time, and then when he passed, I didn’t take care of myself, so I let a lot of things go that I should have been taken care of,” she said, referring to her husband of nearly 60 years, Carl Thomas Dean, whodied aged 82in March. “So anyway, when I got round to it, the doctor said, ‘We need to take care of this. We need to take care of that.’ Nothing major, but I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home, closer to Vanderbilt, you know, where I’m kind of having a few treatments here and there.”Rumors that Parton was seriously ill intensified on Tuesday when her sister Freida wrote in a Facebookpostthat she had been “up all night praying” for the 79-year-old superstar.“Many of you know she hasn’t been feeling her best lately,” she wrote. “I truly believe in the power of prayer, and I have been lead [sic] to ask all of the world that loves her to be prayer warriors and pray with me.”Freida later clarified that Parton was just “a little under the weather” and not seriously ill. “I didn’t mean to scare anyone or make it sound so serious when asking for prayers for Dolly,” she said. “She’s been a little under the weather, and I simply asked for prayers because I believe so strongly in the power of prayer … Thank you all for lifting her up.”Parton’s manager, Olly Rowland, confirmed that Parton had been treated for kidney stones, and added: “It looks like her sister posted, and it got quite a bit blown out of proportion.”Parton was supposed to begin a six-concert run at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace on 4 December – her first extended Vegas run in 32 years – but uncharacteristically withdrew, citing “health challenges” that required visits to the doctor.In a post to her Instagram at the time, she lightheartedly added: “As I joked with them, it must be time for my 100,000-mile checkup, although it’s not the usual trip to see my plastic surgeon!”Parton has regularly stayed in the public eye in recent years. Her 2023 album Rockstar reached the US and UK top five, on the strength of collaborations with the likes of Elton John, Debbie Harry, Sting and, on a cover of Let It Be, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. On her 2024 album Smoky Mountain DNA: Family, Faith and Fables, she collaborated with members of her family.In June, Parton collaborated with the rock band Mötley Crüe on a new version of their song Home Sweet Home. And a musical based on her life, Dolly: A True Original Musical, premiered in Nashville in July, aiming for a Broadway run.In her Instagram post on Wednesday, Parton – whotoldthe Guardian last year that she “can’t retire” – reassured that she was “not ready to die yet”.“I don’t think God is through with me,” she added, “and I ain’t done working.”Explore more on these topicsDolly PartonCountrynewsShareReuse this content"

Her problem is whether it will make any difference.Badenoch arrived in Manchester at the weekendamid gloomy warningsthat her party – languishing at just 16% in the polls and fast losing support to Reform UK – was facing oblivion.Political analysts reported that in focus groups across the country, barely anyone was able to name a single thing she had said or done since becoming leader. “The biggest risk for the Tories is that they are drifting into irrelevance,” one said.View image in fullscreenFringe events were sparsely attended and most shadow cabinet ministers found themselves addressing a half-empty hall.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOne disgruntled Tory MP has even set up a countdown clock on social media platform X of the days left until party rules allow rivals to mount a challenge. On the first anniversary of her leadership, 2 November, her critics will be able to submit letters to trigger a contest.Rivals are waiting in the wings. Foremost among them isRobert Jenrick, who has made little secret of his intentions. “He reeks of naked ambition,” says one shadow cabinet colleague. “It’s the sunk cost fallacy: he’s poured so much into it he can’t give up now.”The shadow justice secretary, who lost to Badenoch in last year’s leadership contest, packed out fringe events and the main conference hall as he expounded his Reform-lite brand of politics to the adoring Tory faithful.Tories will scrap stamp duty on primary residences, Kemi Badenoch tells conferenceRead moreYet he appeared to have learned the lessons of the Andy Burnham show at Labour conference in Liverpool last week, taking a marginally more subtle approach as he toured fringe events and parties, praising Badenoch’s leadership and insisting he was “right behind” her.Like Burnham, Jenrick emerged from conference a diminished figure, after his complaint about “not seeing another white face” in a part of Birmingham,revealed by the Guardian, led to accusations of toxic nationalism.Badenoch’s moment of greatest peril comes after the local elections in May, when the Tories face wipeout in Wales and Scotland, as well as in councils across England. There appears to be a consensus among her critics that trying to oust her before then would make little difference.“Kemi will survive until May at least,” one former government adviser attending the conference said. “People just aren’t interested in moving against her sooner. There is a lot of apathy.”View image in fullscreenConference attendance was down one-third on 2024.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAt a fringe event on Sunday, the polling guru Sir John Curtice questioned the wisdom of the Tories’ endless focus on migration: “The question I would pose to you is, does it necessarily make sense to try to out-Reform Reform?”But within 24 hours the conference had pivoted to the economy, which polls suggest is the party’s strongest card in a weak hand. “We had to tackle issues like the ECHR [European convention on human rights] early on, to give us the space to talk about what we wanted to,” one shadow cabinet minister said.Senior Tories believe they can beat Reform on the economy, and that Nigel Farage’s pitch to the left on issues such as welfare and state aid is his achilles heel.“Reform want to get back to the days of nationalisation and state control. They are marching to the left. Be in no doubt. They are the party of more spending and more debt,” the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, told delegates.Some Tories are sceptical the strategy will be effective, as voters won’t buy that the Reform leader is anything other than a Thatcherite. They also fear the party has a long way to go to restore its reputation for fiscal prudence after the damage done by Liz Truss’s mini-budget.In the conference bars, MPs and members openly debated whether the party had done enough to express contrition for the chaos unleashed on the country in the final years of the Tories’ time in power.View image in fullscreenThe shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, has made little secret of his leadership ambitions.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBadenoch opened the conference on Sunday with a speech that acknowledged they had lost the trust and confidence of the public. “This week we will set out how we have changed, how we will be different – and, most importantly, how we will make a difference,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Badenoch is not among them.A British Ice and more stop and search: Badenoch’s Tories set out new policiesRead moreBut while Reform tried its best to make hay – releasing a drip drip of 20 councillor defectors over the course of one day – the Tory leader was determined to ignore them.In one oblique reference in her closing speech on Wednesday, she appeared to encourage her party not to engage with Farage. “As George Bernard Shaw said: ‘Never wrestle with a pig. You both get dirty and the pig likes it.’”The absence of crowd-drawing Tory big beasts such as Boris Johnson was palpable. Jacob Rees-Mogg attended Reform UK’s conference in September but skipped the Conservative one.Overall attendance at the conference was down a third on last year, when the leadership contest attracted more members, according to party sources. The Tories had to give away business tickets for free for the first time.A security guard working at the entrance to the convention centre joked with journalists on Sunday: “It’s so quiet in there, I’ve been to busier dinner parties.”View image in fullscreenCabinet members Andrew Griffith, Victoria Atkins and James Cleverly singing the national anthem before Kemi Badenoch makes her leader’s speech at the Conservative conference in Manchester.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFringe events were sparsely attended and most shadow cabinet ministers found themselves addressing a half-empty hall. There was no sense of buzz or excitement around any senior politician, other than a dutiful following for Badenoch herself.“We’ll take that,” one shadow cabinet minister said when asked at the end of the gathering about the downbeat mood. “Kemi has done what she needed to and it will have bought her some time. It could have turned out very differently.”More experienced Tory politicians urged their colleagues to maintain their newly found restraint. “The shadow of recent Conservative governments may be too big for Kemi Badenoch to escape. But this conference suggests that the best course Tory MPs can take is to let her get on with the job,” the Tory peer Paul Goodman said.A shadow cabinet minister added: “We need to keep calm and carry on because what’s the alternative? If Kemi goes it means things are even worse than they are now, and anybody who takes over will be carrying an unexploded bomb.”“You can tell people not to touch the iron but some won’t listen. You might have thought ending up with just 121 MPs had burned them enough, but maybe they need to hold the iron tight to actually learn.”But Tory MPs, who have become addicted to regicide in recent years, do not appear to be in any mood to heed the advice. Badenoch’s team is aware of a 14-strong WhatsApp group of Tory MPs who are determined to oust her.“She wasted her first year and has had virtually no cut-through with the public,” one critical MP said. “If we stick with her it’s game over and we’ll be facilitating not just the end of the Tory party, but Nigel Farage in Downing Street.”Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochConservativesConservative conferenceRobert JenricknewsShareReuse this content"

One of them, Christopher Cash, was a parliamentary researcher for the Conservative backbencher Alicia Kearns, specialising in China issues. A trial had been due to start in October, but three weeks ago the Crown Prosecution Service dropped proceedings with little explanation until Tuesday.What did the DPP say?Parkinson revealed in a letter to two parliamentary select committees that the CPS had dropped the case becauseprosecutors had tried and failed to obtain a witness statement from the governmentstating that China posed a current “threat to the national security of the UK”. Without it, he said, the trial of the two men had to be abandoned.The prosecutor did not say who failed to make the assertion sought, but the focus is on Downing Street and, in particular, the national security adviser, Jonathan Powell. It had fallen to Matthew Collins, his deputy, to give witness statements in the case, part of evidence from the government setting out the harm alleged by the spying and the wider geopolitical context.“Efforts were made over many months,” Parkinson said, “but notwithstanding the fact that further witness statements were provided, none of these stated at the time of the offence China represented a threat to national security.” He concluded: “When this became apparent, the case could not succeed.”Why was it necessary to define China as an enemy?Cash, 30, and a friend, Christopher Berry, 32, a researcher based in China, were prosecuted under the now repealed 1911 Official Secrets Act. To be found guilty of spying, prosecutors had to prove that a person was passing on any “document or information” that might be “directly or indirectly useful to an enemy”.Legal experts question reasoning behind CPS dropping China ‘spies’ caseRead moreBritain is not at war with China, but case law had expanded the legal definition to cover “a potential enemy with whom we might some day be at war”. This was the law when Cash and Berry were charged in April 2024, and no problems seemed to have been raised at this stage.However, Parkinson said the case law had changed in July and he implied that the enemy requirement had become more stringent. A clarifying ruling in another spy trial, ofsix Bulgarians accused of spying for Russia, had concluded: “There is no reason in our view why the term ‘an enemy’ should not include a country which represents a current threat to the national security of the UK.”Legal experts argued the new ruling meant that the enemy definition had been expanded and the bar to prosecution in fact had been lowered.So is China a threat to UK national security?The UK’s overall policy towards China seeks to strike a balance between concern about Beijing’s authoritarianism and a desire to engage over trade and environmental issues.As a result, whether under Labour or the Conservatives, China has been carefully described. China was labelled a “systemic competitor” in the UK government’s integrated review of 2021 and an “epoch-defining and systemic challenge” in 2023. Labour, in a national security strategy released in June, went for “geo-strategic challenge”.Yet, when it comes to spying, the warnings have been much clearer. The former MI6 chief Richard Moore said China had become“the single greatest priority”for the foreign intelligence service in November 2021.In October 2023, Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, warned that20,000 Britons had been approached by Chinese agents on LinkedInin the hope of stealing industrial or technological secrets. Industrial espionage was happening at “real scale” and MI5 teams were detecting “massive amounts of covert activity” by China in particular.What about the defendants?The spying accusation was that Cash had allegedly passed on his knowledge about the workings of Westminster to Berry, a friend he had met while teaching in China. Berry used some of that information to inform up to 34 reports thatallegedly were written for a Chinese intelligence officer– who in turn reported to Cai Qi, a member of the country’s ruling politburo.Cash and Berry denied the charge and maintain their innocence. Cash made some public comments shortly after prosecution was abandoned, complaining of “an utterly unrestrained storm of media attention in which my character was attacked” and accusing critics of basing their arguments on “slender facts”. He has not spoken in the three weeks since, and he has been advised to focus on getting on with his life.It is understood Cash’s legal team argued in pre-trial proceedings that he believed he was passing on public domain information in good faith about the workings of parliament or his own political predictions to Berry. In turn, Berry’s lawyer said he was working for a corporate client based in China who wanted to break into the UK.Whose fault was it that the trial did not begin?The former director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald wondered if the CPS had been “a bit over-fussy” in asking the government to make a statement in open court “which would be embarrassing in some ways to British national interests”.Keir Starmer focused on the Conservatives, saying on Tuesday that alleged offending by Cash and Berry took place in 2022 and early 2023. “You have to prosecute people on the basis of the circumstances at the time of the alleged offence, and so all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then,” he said.However, the refusal to provide the additional evidence sought came under Labour.Explore more on these topicsLawForeign policyEspionageChinaUK security and counter-terrorismexplainersShareReuse this content"

A new podcast tells the wild tale of the US couple whose dream became a nightmareStuart HeritageWed 8 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 12.39 EDTShareThe death of John Bender mystified the world. A handsome American millionaire, Bender moved to Costa Rica with his wife, Ann, two years after they married, and set about building a 2,000-hectare nature reserve, centred on a mountaintop mansion that had neither walls nor windows. But despite moving to this vision of paradise, the couple’s mental health fell into sharp decline and in January 2010, Bender died of a gunshot wound to the head.Thanks to an unscientific forensic investigation by the Costa Rican authorities, the perpetrator remains unknown. Suicide is one option – John had written emails about wanting to die in the weeks previously – but the fact that he was shot in the back of the head, in bed, while wearing earplugs, suggests that Ann may have shot him. In the intervening years, the Costa Rican justice system (which has no double jeopardy law) has tried Ann Bender for murder on three separate occasions; of these, she was convicted once and acquitted twice.It is, by all accounts, a fascinating case – and it has been rigorously detailed in the new podcast series Hell in Heaven. In an effort to discover the events that led to Bender’s death, journalist Becky Milligan travelled to Costa Rica and conducted interviews with almost everyone involved.“It was quite full on,” Milligan says of the trip, over video call with her producer Poppy Damon. “Serendipity steps in when you’re on the ground. With some of the interviews, we didn’t know them before we got there, then it just flowered. In situations like that, you have to have your wits about you.”“We understood the story a lot more once we’d gone there,” adds Damon. “When we went into the jungle, the audio of all the different creatures and birds was so rich. It was like nothing I’d ever heard. My ears couldn’t really process the amount of sound. And going to the property just takes your breath away, because it’s this massive building with no walls, and it looks like a car park, but it’s also sort of beautiful.”The Benders’ mansion – Boracayan to them, The Benderdome to less impressed locals – did indeed represent a bold move. Having made a fortune on Wall Street, Bender set about building his paradise home to his exact specifications. But, as a neighbour points out in the podcast, a lot of people underestimate the noise and darkness and isolation of jungle life, and as such “a lot of people go kind of crazy”.View image in fullscreen‘It looks like a car park, but it’s also sort of beautiful’ … the Benders’ Boracayan mansion today.Photograph: Poppy DamonAnd so it came to pass. Ann’s psychiatrist at the time came to believe that the pair were psychotic, and diagnosed Ann withfolie à deux, a disorder where two people reinforce each other’s mental illness until it reaches extreme proportions. In addition, Ann was battlingLyme disease, and John – despite having no medical training – chose to shun conventional medicine in favour of injecting her with water from a local stream.The Benders’ decision to live this way does seem somewhat eccentric. Similarly, John’s decision to try to cure Ann with injections of untreated water sounds a little like abuse. And then there’s the fact that the initial crime scene pictures were such poor quality because they were lit by more than 500 Tiffany lamps that Ann had compulsively collected.It’s these outré details, combined with the lack of resolution, that tends to get people hooked. And they do get hooked. Carol Vaughn, an American journalist (and author of Crazy Jungle Love, a book about the case) who works in Costa Rica, has seen her fair share of grisly murders – in 2021, she covered the mass murder of an American coffee farmer and his staff, which was by all accounts unthinkably horrifying – but it was the death of Bender that plunged her into obsession.“Obsession is the right word,” she clarifies. “It was all things Bender, 24 hours a day. Didn’t comb my hair, didn’t brush my teeth. Dog barely got walked. I thought I was writing a love story. I thought, this is Shakespearean. This is biblical, the love these two people had for each other. And so I was writing it from that point of view. Meanwhile, the whole world was viewing it as a crime story and nothing more. At the time of his death, they were both deeply depressed. That chemistry, I think, made one of their deaths inevitable.”Set out like this, the death of John Bender sounds as if it might make the basis for yet another grubbily exploitative true crime podcast. However, the beauty of Hell in Heaven lies in the humanistic way Milligan and Damon approach the subject matter.“Visiting Costa Rica meant that we could meet people face to face, and be really fair and interested in the characters, rather than have the voyeurism which sometimes happens with these things,” Milligan says. “One of the most moving things was speaking to John’s parents, Paul and Margie. It just brings it home that this is a family tragedy, and any of us could go through this.”The podcast also takes a lot of care in following the aftermath of the death, not least Ann Bender’s subsequent woes. She weighed just 38kg when police arrived at the crime scene and, to quote a friend of hers, looked like “someone who had just walked out of a concentration camp.” Jewels of hers worth $16m (nearly £12m) vanished in the aftermath of John’s death. And she was tried over and over again by Costa Rican prosecutors. “First, she was acquitted,” says Vaughn. “Then, she was found guilty on all counts. The third time, she was acquitted again due to lack of evidence, but then immediately the prosecutor put in for a fourth trial.”View image in fullscreen‘This is biblical, the love these two people had for each other’ … Ann and John Bender.Photograph: Exactly Right MediaThis is where Vaughn’s story collides with Ann’s. “I was the representative for the American embassy, and I snuck her a new emergency passport the day she was acquitted,” she says. “I was sitting right behind her. I slid it under the chair. She put it right next to her heart, and was gone two days later. I mean, she was out of here and she’ll never be back. She’s lost her money, her property, her jewels, everything. She’s wiped out.”And yet the central mystery at the heart of the case – was it suicide or murder? – remains frustratingly out of reach. “The reason it hooks people in is because, if you pull a thread, more seem to come out,” says Damon. “There were things we just kept chasing, like a mercenary who we planned to meet, and he stood us up.”“John is forever fascinating,” adds Milligan. “So is Ann. They tried so hard to create something beautiful, and do something good. What stays with you is how it all went wrong.”To varying degrees, Vaughn, Milligan and Damon have been plunged into the core of a mystery that looks as if it will never be solved. With all the insight they have, do they have any suspicions of what the truth might be?“That’s what’s tormented me because I can’t honestly say what happened that night, and I’ve read everything that can be read about it,” says Vaughn. “When I visited Ann in jail, I found a woman so not playing with a full deck of cards that I didn’t even ask her, because I don’t think she knows. I honestly don’t think even she knew what happened that night.”“I almost always return to the key things that jump out,” says Damon. “Both of them were mentally really unwell, so it was a pressure cooker. I think it’s strange that he had a gun. It’s also very strange that he had his earplugs in. The details are strange and bizarre.”“There are so many details where you can say, ‘Oh, this means that, and that means this,’ but no, it doesn’t,” says Milligan. “You go backwards and forwards, yo-yoing all over the place. Maybe we will never know. Let’s just tell the story and talk about the love, the tragedy and the paradise they tried to create. That is their legacy.”Hell in Heaven is available on 9 October, wherever you get your podcastsExplore more on these topicsPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Going out alone, or sober? Rawdogging.So by extension, a rawdogging marathon must be running a marathon unprepared.People sometimes use the term that way, but that practice should be discouraged, and it’s not what we’re talking about here.Well then – does a rawdogging marathon mean doing anything for a long time?No. It means doing nothing for a long time.I’m very confused.Specifically, it means sitting still and staring into space for an extended period. Most importantly, without your phone.Can I listen to music?No.Can I read a magazine?No.Can I be in the shower, or in bed?No.Why not?Because you’re rawdogging!How long do I have to do it for?That’s up to you. A “productivity influencer” called Rowan recentlyfilmed himself rawdoggingfor an hour every day in a bid to improve his attention span.What did he do with the footage?He posted it onTikTok.So that other people could watch him do nothing on their phones?Don’t worry – he cut the hour down to a 30-second timelapse to make it less boring.Just so you know, the irony of that is not lost on me. What was the result?He found it helped his focus and his productivity, and many of his followers were inspired by his efforts.It sounds as if the TikTok generation has somehow invented meditation.That’s one criticism levelled at rawdogging, but young people are battling monumental levels of distraction these days: while older generations had to learn to tolerate boredom, they must learn to cultivate it.Who wants to be bored, though?Manyneuroscientists suggestthat boredom is not only good for you, it’s a critical stimulus required for creative thinking.Do say:“An hour spent without your phone is never wasted.”Don’t say:“Dude, just finished a rawdogging marathon – no headphones, no water, no shoes.

In a film that will hopefully be used as evidence in an upcoming lawsuit, a woman tries to keep her struggling local business alive as a big-brand competitor opens over the street while she secretly chats to a man online who just so happens to be her business rival. Scene where he tells her to fight for what’s hers, which leads her to a TV appearance? Check. Scene where he finds out who she really is as she waits for their first in-person date? Check. Ensuing scene where he shows up, doesn’t tell her the truth, and she blasts him for being a corporate sellout? Check. Winning chemistry, sharp wit and a buoyantly romantic ending? Oh, wait.Because as much as ChatGPT might be able to replicate the rough shape of a You’ve Got Mail rip-off (the film is allegedly written bythreehumans, Lacey Uhlemeyer, Roo Berry and Erin Falconer), it can’t capture any of that film’s humanity or even basic charm. The updates to the plot only make it that much worse – this time it’s not duelling bookstores but rather mechanics, and instead of meeting in a 1998-suited AOL chatroom, now it’s a Reddit forum for car enthusiasts – and only serve to show how ill-suited this particular story is for a more online age. There’s really no reason for Riverdale alum and Strangers reboot survivor Madelaine Petsch’s Charlie and British actor Jacob Scipio’s Beau to delay an offline meet in this iteration other than her being vaguely uninterested in dating and him kinda sorta seeing a poorly defined Bad Woman.They share inane tidbits over fixing cars online (which are, yep, easier than fixingpeople, apparently) and limply spar in person, but there’s no warmth to the former and no bite to the latter. The plot has no real sense of incremental build, making it unclear just how Charlie’s business is faring and what its collapse would truly mean to her (that sad crush one felt in You’ve Got Mail, as long-held memories faded into corporate anonymity, never coming). Like the one smash-hit romcom everyone is desperate to replicate, 2023’sAnyone But You(a film that did at least credit Shakespeare for the source material), casting is based less on likability and more on Instagram aesthetics, the two handsome actors looking well-styled and gym-trained but lacking any of the charisma sorely needed for the genre (Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were always closer to cute than sexy). It’s most jarring with Petsch, who is supposed to be playing a rough-and-ready mechanic who rolls her eyes at glamour (“I much prefer wheels to heels,” she says) but even when she’s busy working on a car, she’s as pristinely styled as an influencer posing with an Erewhon smoothie, with only the lightest grease stain carefully positioned on her forehead.In a smarter script, there’s something more to explore with the dynamics of the business feud, as a male-led conglomerate tries to crush a smaller female-led competitor in a field that doesn’t typically allow for much gender diversity, but the film has nothing on its brain beyond car puns. It’s also extremely hard to stomach the film’s anti-gentrification, anti-capitalism stance when it’s made in conjunction with the cartoonishly evil Amazon overlords and littered with product placement (a scene of the female mechanics raging against the system has one of them holding a bag of Smartfood white cheddar popcorn aimed toward the camera).There’s really nothing to see here, just another synthetic simulation of a film and a genre we used to love, less maintenance required and more complete overhaul.Maintenance Required is now on Amazon PrimeExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsComedy filmsAmazon Prime VideoComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

What should Taylor Swift do next?Swift’s 12th LP is set to dominate the charts – despite fans lampooning the lyrics and lamenting its quality. Guardian music writers discuss what it means for her careerShaad D'Souza,Elle Hunt,Alexis PetridisandLaura SnapesWed 8 Oct 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 20.19 EDTShareLaura SnapesTaylor Swift’s 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl (TLOAS), has been a smash statistical success. She’s broken records that she previously set, and in the US has now beaten Adele for the most sales in a single week. The cinematic release party this weekend grossed $34m in the US and an additional $13m worldwide. But it’s second only to her 20-year-old debut – written in her teens – as the worst reviewed album of her catalogue, with a 70% approval average on Metacritic. What are the successes and failures of this record?Alexis PetridisThe success part is obvious. It’s set to become the biggest-selling album of the year by a preposterously long chalk. In terms of shortcomings, I think the biggest one is prosaic – a lack of really memorable melodies. I think you’d be hearing a lot less about the cringy lyrics if it was packed with tunes that were up to the standard of Blank Space, Don’t Blame Me or Bad Blood.Shaad D’SouzaI’m less inclined to see the commercial victory of this album as any kind ofprofoundsuccess. Swift has been bigger than everyone else for years now, and I don’t think any achievement of hers will ever seem as big as the Eras tour, which was the kind of monocultural event a lot of people thought couldn’t exist any more.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl review – dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzledRead moreIf there’s overall success here, beyond a couple of individual songs, it’s in brand maintenance. A new album gives Swift a reason to charm late-night audiences and radio hosts, which she hasn’t done in a while, and I think after the moody-teen aesthetic of The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD), it’s fun to see her return to the kind of peppy, high-wattage aesthetic she explored on Lover, even if with a far inferior album. I think the main failure is the overall feeling of regression, which ties in to the same failure that’s dogged her for a good while now: she seemingly has no internal sense of quality control any more. There are some truly unforgivable lines on this album.Elle HuntThe lack of quality control struck me too. The way she talked about this project on Travis Kelce’s podcast New Heights, it seemed conceived in direct response to the criticisms of TTPD: a tight 12 tracks versus a variable 31, “infectious” pop bangers in place of wordy angst. Bringing on Max Martin, the producer behind most of this century’s solid-gold pop hits, including her own, seemed to underscore this ambition. There are some catchy melodies and the production is slick, crowd-pleasing, expensive-sounding.The big issue, as you say, Shaad, is the lyrics, which are often so clanging that they invalidate any pleasure you’re taking in the music. Eldest Daughter is the prime example, with the sparse piano focusing your attention on these horrible, meme-y turns of phrase: “We all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire” is just nonsense. “Did you girlboss too close to the sun?” from Cancelled! dates it immediately. Olivia Rodrigo, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter have all released smarter, funnier, more high-concept pop in the past two years. Does Swift know that, too? Or does she really believe she’s working at her best?View image in fullscreenSwift and Jimmy Fallon go deep on The Life of a Showgirl.Photograph: NBC/Todd Owyoung/Getty ImagesLSIn her intro videos to each song, in the dismal cinematic release party, she seemed very pleased with the record. But I think the playful, poppy sound is a play to re-establish herself as a major hitmaker – ie someone who has more than one major single per record, like Olivia, Sabrina and Chappell have had, after TTPD and Folklore only spawned one hit apiece. I also think that the mammoth Eras tour, as well as the shifting company she keeps – from artsy lovers and collaborators and pals like Boygenius, to the fairly normie sports world she’s now part of – may have recalibrated her desire to speak to as many people as possible. No more “esoteric” records, as she called everything from Folklore to TTPD. Whether that’s because those are periods of her life she’d rather leave behind or because she internalised criticism of how unwieldy her writing had got, who knows? And the biggest fans of this album that I know of, other than apparentlythe staff of Rolling Stone, are all under the age of 10. Having Shake It Off-style hits that play at kids’ birthday parties is good business, too.I also find it regressive. Although I don’t think 2019’s Lover is most people’s favourite Swift album, its spread-betting styles offer a really interesting document of a pop star fresh out of the contract she signed as a teenager, on the edge of 30, working out what an adult pop career might look like. Folklore and Evermore felt like her vacating that space; Midnights was largely a convincingly adult recalibration of it. But this feels like time-travelling back to the 2010s, pretending none of that ever happened.SDA lot of people were thrilled about Swift returning to Martin and Shellback, but neither producer has been on a hot streak over the past decade, or longer. Martin’s last true smash was the Weeknd’s Blinding Lights in 2020. Swift’s music has never exactly been in conversation with the rest of the pop world. She has always seemed more invested in pop’s business trends than its musical trends, and her choice of collaborators here is revealing: she’s at a point where she’d rather look back into her own archive than the world around her, for instruction. One look at the charts might have told Swift that her style of “centrist pop” isn’t really necessary any more – as streaming subsumes radio, it’s less necessary to appeal to all bases. That Showgirl has such an easy, all-encompassing sound makes this album feel weirdly old-fashioned – she could have taken bigger swings here, still within the realm of “pure pop”, and still dominated. Instead, we get Bruno Mars-y lite-funk and wan Abba pastiche.One question now is where she goes next, creatively. I’d love to see her work with a younger producer such as Leroy Clampitt, who’s made excellent sinister, synthy pop with Madison Beer and Sabrina Carpenter; or Carter Lang, who’s made pop that’s earthy, but still hooky, with SZA and Lola Young. My pipe dream is that she strips it all back and works with someone like Cass McCombs (check his Sky Ferreira collaboration, Sad Dream, for a proof of concept) on a back-to-basics album.APMore than anything, she probably needs to take a break. Her star is so big that the usual rules of streaming-era pop don’t apply. She doesn’t need to put out a constant stream of music, and she could easily take a few years off. That would make the level of expectation around her next album higher, and it’s probably worth it for her to recalibrate what she does, to come up with something different, to not feel impelled to keep pumping material out when she doesn’t have to. Folklore and Evermore were creatively different from the albums before them, and they came out of the enforced break of lockdown.View image in fullscreenA fan looks at copies of the album at the Target release party in Times Square, New York.Photograph: John Taggart/EPAEHMore than just a break from the public eye, it feels like Swift needs to live a little, venture out from the Taylor Cinematic Universe and have some new thoughts and experiences that aren’t already enshrined in her lore. Except for Ruin the Friendship, all these songs deal with either: a) her new relationship bliss; or b) her grievances with how she’s perceived. It’s not a surprise, given her schedule over the past few years, but it’s not particularly interesting or novel. Often here Swift feels like she’s rehashing musical and lyrical ideas that she’s already executed, often better. That’s why the album feels so non-essential: her creative well has not been replenished, forcing her to draw from the same stagnant, self-referential water. Imagine if she’d taken the time to actually reread Hamlet and made a concept album, The Life of Ophelia (rather than just reference it in the first track, The Fate of Ophelia). Or properly committed to the showgirl concept with a Broadway sound and story. Instead, it just feels as if she’s hedging her bets with the broadest possible, frequently banal pop, simply to hang on to the spotlight.LSI’d love to see her jettison the Easter eggs, “numerology” – at this point, essentially: “Hey kids, math is fun!” – and bits like putting her saddest song at track five. Naturally they generate terabytes of headlines as fans put the pieces together, but it’s such a constraining framework and the acrobatic self-referencing makes her output feel more and more claustrophobic. Sadly, I think there’s a gnat’s chance in hell of any of this happening. Next year is the 20th anniversary of her debut album, and her next record will be her 13th – her lucky number. There’s no way she won’t mark that, with either another new album or the version of her debut that she re-recorded for Taylor’s Versions but didn’t ultimately need to release once she got her masters back. It will be framed as a gift to fans, albeit one they have to pay to receive in various vinyl variants. You’d hazard a guess at her getting married next year, once her fiance’s final football season has finished – also, incidentally, his 13th – an event that almost no one is going to be able to act normally about.View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift performing on the Eras tour.Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/API’m interested in the phrase “too big to fail”, which I’ve heard a lot since Friday. None of the criticisms of the album have stymied its vast commercial success, for sure. But I am curious about how many of her fans are engaged, ardent Swifties, a number of whom have registered their disappointment with the album – plus the cost of paying for the numerous physical versions, and the evident use of AI in promo clips – and how many are casual consumers, otherwise unengaged in pop, who just know her as the default pop star of our age and don’t engage with the lore. In the US, she has an exclusive product deal with the supermarket Target, and her albums strike me as the kind of thing a kind parent would drop in the trolley for their kid. How many disappointing records would it take for them to stop automatically outstripping their predecessors? As with the shift from TTPD to TLOAS, will she adjust her next release in line with the many criticisms it’s received? Or is its proudly basic worldview (rich husband-lovin’ girlie who defends the family) a sign that she’s over her period of craving critical respectability? Are the hints of a backlash serious enough to flourish? Or is life now just an endless Eras encore?Taylor Swift’s Charli xcx hit job misses the point – and underscores her tedious obsession with conflict | Laura SnapesRead moreAP:I don’t think the backlash is serious enough to have any real impact, and I think the casual consumers you mention are the people any artist has to reach if you’re going to be huge. One thing Idothink is interesting about TLOAS is how much the “proudly basic worldview” may chime with her long-term fans’ own lived experiences. Say she does take time off, gets married, has kids, all that stuff she’s talking about on Wi$h Li$t – can she then write an interesting album about that? That’s a massive challenge. I’m trying to think of a mainstream pop album that successfully addresses those topics and I can’t come up with one. But it’s got to be more intriguing than stuff about internecine pop squabbles and internet backlash. She’s spent her career basing a chunk of her songwriting on the model of You’re So Vain. To extend the Carly Simon comparison, it would be interesting to hear her start basing it on Coming Around Again.EHI might be disappointed by this album/cash grab but my interest and investment in Swift will inevitably survive at least one more cycle. Ultimately, though, on her return I’d love to see her writing with self-reflection, imagination and rigour instead of this internet-addled defensive crouch or increasingly tedious, triumphant underdog shtick. Without being blind to the irony of noting this here, my other hope for her next album would be for a more proportional, measured response from the media. Nothing on TLOAS justifies or rewards the volume of coverage, depth of analysis, or cross-platform fanfare. It’s a pop album, and a mid one at that – not a ‘London Bridge is down’-levelglobal news event. I hope that, in future, Swift will be covered on merit, not just because she is too big to ignore.SDI choose to take a long view of this, perhaps foolishly: there were entire decades when artists like Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell didn’t make good records! With any hope, this is just an artistic down period, and she’ll wake up in a few years with some hunger to make an album with the integrity and specificity of Speak Now or Lover.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl is out nowThis article was updated on 8 October 2025.

Jilly visited our shop several times for signings and she was our favourite author visitor. She always spoke to all the staff, brought a gift for staff with her and always wrote us a note of thanks afterwards. Lovely with customers and just an absolute delight.Judith Denwood, retired bookseller, Hastings‘A week later, a gorgeous wooden postcard arrived’View image in fullscreenJilly Cooper’s postcard to Kitty.Photograph: Guardian CommunityI read Riders in the summer of lockdown after graduating in English from university and having moved to Putney. It reignited my love of reading for pleasure, and entirely changed my experience of living in London. Jilly Cooper’s writing is so vivid, the characters filled the lockdown drought of gossip, and her writing always brought me so much joy. I emailed her publisher’s office to say how much her writing meant to me, and how it had transformed my view of life and London to always find the fun, and they emailed back to ask for my home address as she wanted to write back (and didn’t like to use the computer).A week later, a gorgeous wooden postcard with woodland animals on the front arrived from Jilly. It meant so much to me that she’d taken the time to write back, and that a reader’s experience had meant so much to her. I’ve since read nearly all of her works, feeling lost without a Rutshire Chronicle on the go, and discovered her perceptiveness and clarity of expression in her columns in Turn Right at the Spotted Dog. Her depiction of her jury service experience is a particular favourite. Her writing always has the reader’s best intentions at heart, and reading one of her books brings a sparkle that extends beyond fiction into the reader’s real world.Kitty, Wiltshire‘She showed me one of her prized possessions’Jilly Cooper’s husband Leo was my godfather so I would meet her off and on over the years. The last visit was a long weekend in Gloucestershire in 2007 when the four of us chatted around the kitchen table until the early hours. She showed me one of her prized possessions – a signed shirt from England and Liverpool footballer Emile Heskey!Sebastian, Edinburgh‘No better quick fix for boredom, loneliness, anxiety or heartbreak’At a very low point in my then young life (1985/86), unhappy in love, broke, bereft and desperately job hunting, I bought a paperback copy of Riders on a whim, knowing very little about Jilly. I was enchanted, and spent the next few afternoons lying on the flea-ridden sofa in my shared flat reading; and when I got to the last page, I went right back to the beginning and read it all over again. Jilly Cooper’s ability to create a wholly believable fictional world, and draw readers in, has never been surpassed, and probably never will be. There’s no better quick fix for boredom, loneliness, anxiety or heartbreak than a few hours of escapism with one of Jilly Cooper’s satisfyingly weighty novels.

For a boarding school girl they provided a romantic escape and an expectation of the joy and excitement of love affairs that I hoped lay ahead. I met Jilly at a book signing in Oxford, in 1976. She was late and arrived flustered and on opening her handbag the chaos within was on display for all to see. I loved her for being like me, happily disorganised and untidy without a shred of embarrassment. She was confident enough to speak in that wonderful upper class voice with no wish to appear anything other than herself.Morag Coles, 72, retired secretary,Broadstone, Dorset‘My mother’s hero’Just yesterday I was going through a file of my late mother’s correspondence and found a series of letters between her and Jilly Cooper. My mother died in 2000, and the letters date from a few months before that when she struck up a brief pen-pal relationship with Jilly. I believe it started when she wrote to Jilly suggesting that the world of competitive gun dog trails might be a suitable subject for a book, as it contained the apparent Cooper prerequisites: animals, affairs, back-stabbing, and landed gentry. The correspondence came at a time when my mother had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer and I remember how much it cheered her up that one of her heroes took the time to reply to her.Tim, Hertfordshire‘She liked dog people’Aside from her well recognised literary talent she was also a great dog lover. I used to live in Bisley, where Dame Jilly lived for many years. If you ever met her out on a walk with her beloved dogs, you were guaranteed a cheery hello accompanied by her warm smile. As she was so famous you didn’t want to stop and chat too much. That changed, though, when I got my own dog.

And not a moment too soon. The coup de grace, the leader’s speech fromKemi Badenoch. Her first and almost certainly her last. Half her membership want her gone now. The other half are happy to give her until next year.But just for this hour, all hostilities were to be forgiven. No matter that this conference had been dead on arrival. A celebration of annihilation. This was to be a remembrance of times past. A collective narcosis. The Tories’ very own Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.A parallel universe where Kemi held the country in her hands. Where there was standing room only. Where everyone knew that nothing Kemi had to say was of any meaning. Because none of this was going to happen. And yet they cheered and clapped and gave her standing ovation after standing ovation. Come the end there were chants of “Kemi, Kemi” from the very people who want her gone. The very essence of Tory Little Britain.Kemi had prepared the ground in advance. The organisers were already packing up the hall long before the first delegates had entered the compound. And the main stage activity had been kept deliberately low key. Keeping everyone’s expectations subterranean. A panel in which a mayoral candidate declared that she had got her party back. Really? Was existential futility what she wanted? A group therapy session in which Alex Burghart – supposedly one of the brains of the Tory party – spoke of his love for flags in the marching season in Northern Ireland. Clearly a man who misses the Troubles.So the audience was more than ready to be entertained by the time Kemi took centre stage. And to be fair, Kemi didn’t let them down. Her speech was adequate. Which, by the standards of the past few days, could be considered a triumph. Better than anyone could have hoped for.She sounded confident. Though it was hard to know whether this was because she has reconciled herself to the inevitable or if she is so divorced from reality that she took the warmth of her reception at face value. Probably the latter. It wasn’t just Kemi who needed her speech to be a success. The audience did, too. To convince themselves the whole thing hadn’t been a waste of time. Which, of course, it had. An exercise in sub-par performance politics.There were jokes – some almost passable – and there were big-ticket announcements. And in between, some mindless filler. I’ve yet to hear a leader’s speech that couldn’t have been improved with a hefty cut. But we were there because we were there. This was a ritual to be endured. Mostly it just passed the time. And for the Tories it all made perfect sense. Just so long as you could suspend disbelief and try to ignore the fact it was all nonsense.“We are the party who can deliver a stronger economy and secure our borders,” Kemi began. Here I had to check that I was still alive. This was the party that had trashed the economy in 14 years. That had achieved zero growth and maximum austerity. This was the party that had opened the UK border to mass migration. And yet we were being asked to forget this. No apologies from Kemi. She never says sorry. It’s a sign of the abject desperation – and outright cheek – of the Tories that Kemi thinks the economy was her best selling point. She’s got nothing left in her locker.Nonsense followed nonsense. The Tories had had to rescue the country from fascism in 1940. Yup and we’ve got Robert Jenrick trying to take the country back in that direction. Yet there was no rebuke for Tories playing the race card. Precious few mentions of Reform, even though the party is haemorrhaging support to Nigel Farage. Almost all Kemi’s barbs were aimed at Labour. Go figure. The Tories are fighting Labour, while Labour is fighting Reform. You couldn’t help feeling that Kemi is just too timid to speak some home truths.“Young people used to be enthusiastic and hopeful,” Kemi said. Er, yes. Can’t think what government might have made them less so. The collective delusion was total. She even moaned about Poland being successful. Could be something to do with being a member of the EU. Just saying.Then came a recap of some of the madder policies that had been announced during the week. After Kemi had said she wouldn’t bother with any till 2027. Guess she might as well bring them out now. She doesn’t have a later. I am an engineer, she declared. She could fix computers. By switching them off and on. Or kicking them. Next up, a promise to cut university places by 100,000. Though not for any young people in the hall. This was for the little people. A plan so half-witted it hadn’t made it into last year’s Tory manifesto, despite having been dreamed up as party policy two months previously.Finally, we got to the economy. There would be an exciting newgolden rulethat would enable everyone to sleep well at night. A golden rule that she promptly broke within a couple of minutes bypromising to abolish stamp duty. Cue a spontaneous orgasm within the hall. The Tories like nothing more than an unfunded tax cut. It’s what keeps them going. Even if it’s a tax cut that’s never going to happen because the Conservatives are now little more than a death cult. Stand by for whoever is Tory leader this time next year to get rid of income tax. And whoever is leader the year after to do away with VAT. It’s all meaningless.“STAND TOGETHER TO BUILD A BETTER BRITAIN,” Kemi shouted. Believe that and you will believe anything. But this would have to do for now. She had survived the conference. Honest Bob wasn’t the leader yet. This was still her moment in the sun and she was determined to enjoy it. A Potemkin speech at a Potemkin conference. The applause would have to sustain her a lifetime. Sound and fury.

Only a particular type of visionary leader was fit for the task.More than a decade later, Blair has now joined forces with the pre-eminent reality-creator, Donald Trump, to draft a hallucinatory20-point planfor Gaza. It aims to turn the devastated Strip into what seems to resemble a colonial protectorate: cleansed of armed conflict, buzzing with development projects and a “special economic zone” through which foreign capital can flow, and overseen by an international “board of peace” with Trump himself as chair.The authors of the programme have not explained how they intend to impose it on a resistant population, or how they will persuade Hamas to disarm and concede defeat. So there is a high likelihood that the Blair-Trump fantasy will remain just that. Whatever its fortunes, though, it is a clear reflection of our historical moment, representing the most recent mutation of an imperial worldview that has already left a trail of destruction across the Middle East.For Blair, “the economy and foreign policy” have long been entwined. His military adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan tried to spread the virtues of the market to supposedly backward nations. The privatisation of resources creatednew investment opportunities, while a wide range of profiteers, from weapons dealers to security contractors,made a killingoff the wars themselves.Uponleaving office in 2007, Blairimmediately took up a postas Middle East envoy for theso-called Quartet: the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia. His work in Palestine displayed the same unerring faith in free enterprise. He proposed a series of “industrial parks” to attract foreign investment, advocated eccentric agribusiness and tourism schemes, and promoted other ventures that raised questions about possible conflicts of interest: while being paid £2m per year as a JP Morgan adviser, for example, he was accused of using his Quartet role toadvance the interestsof JP Morgan clients. (Blair denied the claims, insisting he did not know about the links between the bank he worked for and the companies it served.)The Kushner-Blair Gaza plan is a moral atrocity – and a policy catastrophe | Josh PaulRead moreAs envoy, Blair often bypassed or rejected political solutions –fighting vigorouslyagainst Palestinian attempts to win statehood at the UN – and instead treated economics as the route to progress. His diplomatic activities seemed to be based on the notion that peace would naturally follow prosperity. If securing the latter was the task of the intrepid statesman, then strong ties to the business sector could perhaps be framed as an asset.Yet Blair’s tenure in the Middle East brought no diminution of the conflict. In 2012, a senior Palestinian officialgave a succinct assessmentof his record: “Useless, useless, useless.” Still, undeterred by failure and fond of dramatic political comebacks, the former prime minister now appears to be seeking to apply the same logic to Gaza. Since the early months of the war, he has reportedly been crafting his plan for the “day after”.Staff from his thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI),participated in a projectthat appeared to endorse ethnic cleansing in the territory and outlined what could be built atop its mass graves: a “Trump riviera”, an “Elon Musk smart manufacturing zone”, “regional datacentres”. Although Blair’s organisation claimed it had no meaningful involvement in the plan, and rejected the idea of displacing Palestinians, there are a number of continuities with his own blueprint, details of which were soon leaked to the press.Drawn up with the help of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the 21-page document suggests reconstructing Gaza through “public-private partnerships”, forged by a “commercially driven authority, led by business professionals and tasked with generating investable projects with realfinancial returns”. Hamas would be demobilised and a small unelected executive would be installed. Thiswould include Blair himselfin aprominent role, plus “leading international figures with executive and financial expertise” and “at least one qualified Palestinian representative (potentially from the business or security sector)”. An international stabilisation force would meanwhile put down “threats to public order”.View image in fullscreenTony Blair and Jared Kushner attend a US-led workshop in Manama, Bahrain on 26 June 2019.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBlair met Kushner and Trumpin the White House on 27 Augustand his proposals got awarm welcomefrom the president. They have since been refined and repackaged as the Trump “peace plan”. As with previous versions of the initiative, the emphasis is on creating a Gaza that is “conducive to attracting investment”, and in which Israel will continue to reign supreme. Blair is primed to take charge of governing the Strip until some unspecified future point when day-to-day administration may be returned to a “reformed” Palestinian Authority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which states would be irresponsible enough tosend troopsto serve this novel dictatorship? How can it hope to sustain itself with no mandate nor legitimacy? Even more striking, however, is the extent to which the plan signals the overlap between Blair’s ethos and Trump’s.It is not unreasonable to suggest that Blair might see a business opportunity beneath the rubble of Gaza. To figure out who may benefit, we can look at his network of paymasters. Since 2021, Larry Ellison, founder of the tech company Oracle, hasdonated or pledged£257m to the TBI. The thinktank has, in turn, transformed into whatone commentator has calledan “Oracle dealership”: promoting the company’s software around the globe, including in impoverished countries where it has been criticised for potentially “trapping” and “indebting” users. Ellison is also a prominent supporter of Israel who hasgiven millionsto the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces and, according toHaaretz, once offered Benjamin Netanyahu a seat on the Oracle board. Were Blair to rule over Gaza – perhaps establishing “regional datacentres” in line with the TBI-linked plan – it is possible that Ellison could wield major influence.The TBI has also received huge sums from the authoritarian regimes ofSaudi Arabia,Bahrainand the United Arab Emirates, while Blair has been given a lucrativeadvisory contractby the UAE state-owned investment firm Mubadala. All three states havereadily endorsed the plan for Gaza. Once the besieged enclave is opened for investment, they may well be first in line. Blair’s work for these petro-monarchies tallies with his involvement in the fossil fuel industry, having taken cash from aBP-led consortium, the oil companyPetroSaudiand the South KoreanUI Energy Corporation, which has interests in the Middle East. Given that Israel has recently grantednew licencesto explore for oil and gas off the Mediterranean coast, such connections could prove significant later down the line.In one sense, then, this “peace plan” could simply be read as an extension of Blair’s belief in market-led development. Yet this chapter in the annals of colonialism also has a uniquely Trumpian twist. Visions of a new world order that underpinned earlier regime-change projects are gone. Here politics is reduced to dealmaking, grand strategy to crude self-interest. The fusion of public power and private profit is complete. Blair may be creating new realities, but few would want to inhabit them.Oliver Eagleton is an associate editor at the New Left Review and author of The Starmer Project: A Journey to the RightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index in the US rose by 86% in 1999 alone. Companies only had to announce a hopeful “internet strategy” to see their share prices soar. And the key point is that it went on for ages.Alan Greenspan, the then chair of the Federal Reserve, used the phrase “irrational exuberance” to describe the mood in stock markets as early as December 1996, more than three years before the bubble finally burst. Infamously, Greenspan himself went on to supercharge the latter stages of the mania by cutting interest rates three times, after a currency crisis in Asia in 1998 and the blow-up of a huge hedge fund,Long-Term Capital Management.Everybody at the time half-knew it had all gone too far too soon but the greater danger, career-wise, was often to sit it out. PoorTony Dye, one of London’s top fund managers, earned himself the nickname “Dr Doom” for predicting an imminent stock market disaster for about five years; he lost his job at Phillips & Drew just before his prophecies came true.Do OpenAI’s multibillion-dollar deals mean exuberance has got out of hand?Read moreThe turn-of-the-century experience explains the current crop of analysts’ notes asking where today’sAI bubble– because that’s what it clearly is – fits in a 1990s timeline. The broad parallels are genuinely close. The development of AI will clearly have society-changing effects, just as the arrival of the internet and mobile communication did. The impossibility lies in knowing the speed of adoption, and which lumps of capital will earn extraordinary returns and which will end up getting torched. Are we in the merely exuberant foothills of 1996? Does a last manic 1999-style “melt-up” come next? Or is 2000’s bell about to ring?Many of those notes end up being well-argued versions of “dunno, guv” because timing is impossible. But here are four points that suggest it’s getting late in the day.First, valuations are extremely stretched by usual standards. Everybody – includingthe Bank of England’s financial policy committee in its report on Wednesday– is staring at market historians’ favourite yardstick, the Cape ratio, with amazement or alarm. The Cape measures cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratios over the past decade taking account of inflation. On that score, we’re back at the peak dotcom bubble. The better news is that, on a plainer, forward-looking, price-to-earnings ratio, the S&P 500 index is at 25 times, which is not as severe as 1999 levels. But the overall picture is clear: prices are very high.Second, concentration risk in markets is off the charts. The “Magnificent 7” tech companies – Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft andNvidia– now represent slightly more than a third of the whole S&P 500 index. To varying degrees, all are bets on the future of AI. If, or when, the AI bubble bursts, there will be few places to escape the pop. One doubts the concentration is appreciated by US holders of tracker funds who look to invest in a diversified portfolio of companies. And, given the dominance of the US in global indices, the same applies to a lesser degree for your everyday global tracker, too.Third, the correlation risk is becoming worse given the AI firms’ obsession with cross-shareholdings and partnerships. The deal whereby OpenAI will pay Nvidia for chips, andNvidia will invest $100bn in OpenAI, has been criticised as circular because that’s exactly what it is. In the latest move, OpenAIhas pledged to buy lots of AMD chipsand take a stake in AMD over time. Fans of these arrangements see an alignment of interests for mutual gain. One can equally view the fancy financial footwork as a formula for ensuring capital is misallocated. Certainly, the strain of getting the AI infrastructure built – before returns are remotely clear – seems to be showing.Fourth, the wider economic backdrop for an IT revolution is not as helpful as in the 1990s. “Inflation wasn’t a problem in the 90s,” argued Dario Perkins of TS Lombard recently. “Outside the IT sector, there were powerful structural forces keeping prices down, such as rapid globalisation and the collapse of the Soviet Union.” As he says, that’s not today’s world of deglobalisation, supply shocks, anxiety about public finances and lurches towards populism. Conditions are less favourable for a sustained “melt-up”, he concludes.

Certainly, Nvidia puts Cisco, the leader in the dotcom years, in the shade. Yet, viewed the other way around, it’s actually more concerning that so much sentiment about AI revolves around a single stock. It’s not as if OpenAI is threatening to make profits soon.To repeat, timing is impossible and no two bubbles are exactly alike. But does it all feel as silly as last time?

It was a living nightmareAdrian ChilesImmersing myself in the programme’s seriously dark comedy loosened my grip on reality – and then a ventriloquist asked me for a selfieWed 8 Oct 2025 12.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareIwas on stage, alone, at a packed Alexandra theatre in Birmingham with no clear idea what to do or say for the best. And then I woke up. Except I didn’t because, to my horror, it was actually happening. This was the stage show of the television seriesInside No 9. And for one night only I was in it. Yes, I thought, this is a nightmare. But I had to concede this was wholly appropriate for a show that has a nightmarish quality written through it like a stick of rock.Inside No 9 ran on BBC Two for nine series over 10 years. It seems to me that the viewing public falls into two categories with this show. They either – like me, until a month ago – haven’t come across it. Or they know every line of all 55 episodes. This evening’s audience consisted entirely of the latter, and here I was standing before them, performing – if standing around looking frightened constitutes a performance – my cameo.My mind turned to whether I could remember the route back to the stage door for my escapeIt came about because I interviewed the show’s creators, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, on Saturday Live on BBC Radio 4. In preparation for this I binge-watched several episodes. After the first six, I had to give myself a break. Brilliant as they were, I was starting to feel as if my grip on reality was loosening. The comedy is seriously dark. After I’d had them on the show, I went back, enthused, and watched some more; and before long, real-world situations started feeling like an episode of No 9. Ordinary, blameless people – the chap serving me in Screwfix, the woman opposite me on the train, an award-winner at a local horticultural show – suddenly seemed invested with the potential for madness.I was flattered to be asked to make a cameo appearance. By the time it came around I’d formed the opinion that Steve and Reece were luminously brilliant writers and performers, but also quite mad. Still, how challenging could a mere cameo be? Answer: a lot more challenging than I might have hoped. As I was talked through the plan, at length, in my dressing room, my mind turned to whether I could remember the route back to the stage door for my escape.‘There’s magic, blood and gore!’ Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton on touring Inside No 9 – and being megastars in ChinaRead moreIt turned out I was playing a character in a story, with things to say and not say at specific times, cues to listen out for and all that kind of thing. Don’t worry, they said, which is what people always say when there’s something to worry about. There was a lot of detail to take on board. And I’m really not a details man.Backstage, many darkly dressed people moved around me doing their jobs, quietly, urgently, efficiently. Not for the first time in my life I got the feeling that everyone apart from me knew exactly what they were up to. Waiting in the wings, I thought two things very clearly: 1. This lot are good. 2. I’m going to cock it all up for them. Then, suddenly, I was on. Some stuff happened they deliberately hadn’t warned me about, but I just assumed I’d zoned out and missed that bit in the briefing. I think I did OK. And then it was over.I went back to my dressing room and noticed I was shaking. I shot out of the stage door and into the pub round the corner, which was quiet, eerily so. I got myself a pint and sat there wondering what had just happened. Then a bloke walking around in his socks carrying a ventriloquist’s dummy came up to me and asked for a selfie. I wondered if this was part of the show too, this scene perhaps being transmitted to the audience next door. But no, he and his dummy were appearing in a comedy show upstairs – one without much of an audience, by the sound of it. Poor bloke(s). Like I said, my whole world has gone a bit No 9 on me.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsInside No 9The Adrian Chiles columnTheatreTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Zephaniah died in 2023 but he would have had much to say about shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick’srecent commentsabout the diverse inner-city Birmingham ward.Jenrick complained that he “didn’t see another white face” on his visit there, saying the area was “as close as I’ve come to a slum in this country”. After highlighting the lack of white people, Jenrick claimed it was not about “the colour of your skin or your faith”, but that he wanted people to “be living alongside each other”.Waking up to Jenrick’s distorted comments as a British-Asian daughter of immigrant parents, I immediately felt like fodder in this latest salvo of our culture war, swept into “otherness” without a pause for thought about what those words would mean for millions of black, Asian and minority ethnic British people like me.My relationship with Handsworth is complicated. I was born and lived there until my late teens and my mother and close family members still live in the area. My parents both worked in the same cotton factory owned by a Gujarati family near our home, and I would sometimes sneak in for a visit; loving the whirr of the machines and watching my dad operating the big iron presses as my mum sat sewing uniforms with all the other machinists.Robert Jenrick has been on a bizarre political journey. It’s made him incredibly dangerous | Owen JonesRead moreWatching everyone at work would instil in me the strong work ethic that I still possess to this day. There were games of cricket in our cul-de-sac with neighbours of Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani heritage as well as those who were white. Many weekends and afternoons were spent on Soho Road, at the time a thriving artery, where kitchens simmered with samosas and Indian sweetmeats, and brides would buy their intricately embroidered wedding lehengas in the numerous fabric shops, while other residents headed to temples, mosques and churches located on the streets nearby. It was definitely, as Zephaniah wrote in his poem named after that road, a place for everyone.Handsworth is now and was then a melting pot of different ethnicities, including white British. Of the 12,000 people who live in Handsworth, 91.3% identify as BAME andaccording to Birmingham city council, the ethnicity of Handsworth is 25% Pakistani, 23% Indian, 10% Bangladeshi, 16% Black African or Black Caribbean, 10% mixed or other ethnic group and 9% white. In overall terms, the health of residents in Handsworth is worse than the average for England, and it is among the more deprived wards in the city, with employment rates much lower than Birmingham’s average. I have previously written about the complex relationship between some of the most deprived areas of Birmingham, integration and immigration, including during ourVoices and votes seriesand theBrexit referendum.Handsworth, as one of those areas with high deprivation, is not a place without its issues. In recent years, there have beengrowing reportsof prostitution, antisocial behaviour and alcohol and drug abuse. Many different communities do live side by side, but even during my childhood there were some factions that did not mix, though nothing on a level that would justify Jenrick’s allegation of a community living separate, “parallel” lives.Then there are the bins. Bin workers in Birmingham have beenstriking since Januaryand walked out indefinitely in March in a dispute over job and pay cuts. Piles of black bags in the streets and overflowing wheelie bins have led to an influx of rats in some parts of the city. Yet Jenrick described this as a “litter” problem, comparing the area to a “slum”, and seeming to imply that the issue was somehow linked to a lack of integration.Just a few weeks ago, I spoke to frustrated family members of thepostcode bin lottery. Those who live in the slightly more salubrious area of Handsworth Wood were having their bins collected, but those just across the border in Handsworth were left with rubbish piling up outside their homes, including my mother – who is one of the most house-proud people you’re ever likely to meet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But really, this wasn’t about Handsworth at all: it was a cynical attempt to out-Reform Reform, to stoke division and use the colour of people’s skin to make his point. The danger does not lie in places like Handsworth, but in Jenrick’s words.Jenrick said that in Handsworth he saw a country that he didn’t want to live in. In August, my mother had major heart surgery, and while I sat next to her hospital bed, visitor upon visitor walked through the doors; some family, but others friends from her local community. At that crucial time, her community had gathered around her, and as a child, I remember this happening time and time again.

Spiralling concert prices are a cultural disasterJohn HarrisTickets for big tours have vastly outstripped inflation, while smaller artists and venues struggle. The magic is in danger of being snuffed out entirelyWed 8 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 12.02 EDTShareThe 21st century may be a time of human estrangement, but the pleasures of watching our favourite band or singer play live surely unite millions of us. There is something about the whole ritual that crystallises what popular music fundamentally is: a profoundly democratic artform that will always soundtrack the lives of just about everybody.But perhaps all that is on its way out. When it comes to big names, gig-going is becoming absurdly expensive. The ticket market is now both byzantine and hierarchical, often carving up audiences into no end of tiers. Thanks to the exploitative absurdity of “dynamic pricing” and resale websites, it also charges people much more than even the original face-value ticket prices. To track what’s going on in terms of average price rises can therefore be very difficult. But in the face of an ongoing cost of living crisis, the eye-watering upward trend is crystal-clear, and driven by those artists in the commercial super league of music. That may suit them and the industry players who take a cut, but it is starting to look like very bad news for everything music is supposed to represent.The Manchester-based digital marketing agency Dark Horse recentlypublished a reportcentred on a large handful of big-selling acts, and the differences between the prices they charge now and charged in 2005. Back then, if you wanted to see an artist in either a stadium or indoor arena, your budget usually had to be somewhere between £30 and £50. But such gigs now routinely come in at way over £100, with plenty of acts charging fans who happen to be wealthy a whole lot more. If you want a vivid example of what has changed, try this:according to Dark Horse, in 2005 the face value of a ticket for “general standing” at an Oasis gig was the equivalent of three hours’ work at the median hourly wage. These days, you’d have to graft for pretty much a whole day: seven hours and 56 minutes, to be precise.Go back a decade earlier, and the picture becomes even starker. In July,analysis by the Yorkshire Postshowed that between 1996 and 2025, the average UK concert ticket price increased 521%. Back then, the relevant cost was £16.99. Today, that figure has zoomed up to £105.60. If ticket prices had gone up line with inflation, the average cost would now be £34.18. “This means fans are currently paying nearly three times more than what would be expected based on inflation alone,” the Post said. “The most significant jump in prices has occurred recently, with an 80.5% increase since 2021.”There are heroes here too. Hats should be raised to the former Housemartins and Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton, whorecently capped pricesfor his gigs at big indoor venues at £35. Last week, those gnarled veterans the Cure announced summer dateswith core prices starting at £77.50: their leader, Robert Smith, says dynamic pricing is a “scam” that is “just driven by greed”.View image in fullscreenRobert Smith, of The Cure performing in Hamburg in 2022.Photograph: Daniel Bockwoldt/APFor the most part, however, the sense of prohibitive expense is overwhelming. In 2022, a standing ticket for Billie Eilish’s run of shows at the O2 arena in Londoncost an average of £76. This summer, the price was about £245. Consider also the insane prices charged for the “VIP” tickets that are now a particularly depressing aspect of the live ritual. The most expensive “package” for Oasis’s Wembley concertscame in at £506.25per person. When Beyoncé played the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, places in the “Buckin’ Honey Pit” and “Sweet Honey Pit”, went for £858.10. Any two-bit economist will tell you what those elite prices tend to entail for the rest of us: in proving that there are people who will cough up that much (and more), they add to the general upward pull.There are some rising costs that musicians and venues cannot avoid: energy bills, the increasingly stupid prices charged by hotels, how muchBrexit has added to touring expenses. Perhaps understandably, the huge decline in sales of music as a physical product has focused the mainstream industry’s attention on wringing as much money as possible from live performance. But a concert market dominated by a single corporate giant – Ticketmaster, nowhas a 60% UK market share– is another part of the story.Connected with all this is a change in many people’s understanding of what a gig actually is. I am quite old. The best concert I have ever seen was probably the Smiths at Salford University in the summer of 1986 – when they were in their pomp, and aticket cost £4(£12 in today’s prices, according to the Bank of England website). Back then, the pinnacle of musical achievement for most musicians was symbolised by such legendary theatres as London’s Hammersmith Odeon (now the Eventim Apollo), Manchester Apollo and Newcastle City Hall. The embodiment of the modern gig economy, by contrast, is the kind of sterile indoor arena that entails maximum efficiency – playing to as many people as you can in as few nights as possible – or, for music’s aristocracy, those huge stadiums.These venues are a byword for astronomical prices, and contribute to audiences’ modern expectations of big screens and pyrotechnics – which drive up costs and prices even further – and with no allowance for rough edges or artistic funny business. If you are paying big money to get in, that is hardly unreasonable. Yet it is also bad news for music’s creative health, and how people are likely to judge the kind of grassroots gigs that happen in more modestly sized places. Part of music’s current transformation is the fact that so many of the UK’s small venues – where ticket pricesremain low, and are largely static – arestill closing down, at speed. But if they are competing with gigantic spectacles staged in arenas and sports venues, is it any wonder that they find themselves struggling? Worse still, the insane money people have to pay for big gigs surely limits their spend on smaller ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just to make this clear: plenty of music of substance is still being made (a tip: if you can, go and see one of the forthcoming tour dates being played by the Leeds-based merchants of magical realism English Teacher, for whichtickets are pricedat about 30 quid). But how does this music break through and achieve the dream of mass communication when the gap between the grassroots and music’s upper echelons now seems so impossibly huge, and success involves more of a surrender of ethics and creative bravery than ever?Perhaps the essential problem is laughably simple. The songs we stream into our earphones are effectively free; as a consequence, live music has reached the point where sheer expense is threatening to destroy what we love and treasure about it. I know: it’s only rock’n’roll, and all that.

TheCBSnews department had some of the best journalists in the nation, and the corporation itself exuded a sense of public mission.But on Monday, whenBari Weisswasnamededitor-in-chief of CBS News, it was the latest turn in the network’sconfounding departure from its roots.Given her lack of experience in news, “placing Weiss at or near the helm of a television news division makes no more sense than it would have, a generation ago, to have given such a role to William F Buckley of the National Review or Victor Navasky of The Nation,” wrote Richard Tofel, an astute media observer, formerly of the Wall Street Journal and ProPublica, mentioning conservative and liberal opinionators of their era.Bari Weiss’s ascension to top of CBS News highlights the political winds driving US media rightwardRead moreWeiss – a staunch Zionist and a fierce opponent of supposed wokeness and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives – famously left the New York Times opinion section, claiming she had beenbullied by her colleagues for her beliefs. She started a Substack newsletter and eventually founded the wildly successful website Free Press.Her rise has been meteoric. She “has ascended the mountain of journalism on a slingshot”, Jessica Testa of the New York Times put it this week.To her many critics, her appointment was just one more step on theshameful paththat CBS has trod sinceDonald Trumpwas elected to a second term.The network caved to the US president when its parent company,Paramount,settleda lawsuit it could have won, sending millions of dollars for a future presidential library. Trump claimed that he was harmed during last year’s presidential campaign by theediting(actually, quite routine) of a 60 Minutes interview of his then rival Kamala Harris. Not only did the company settle the case, but now it has decided not to edit taped interviews with political figures on its Sunday morning Face the Nation – a dubious idea at best, and another piece of capitulation to Trump.The longtime executive producer of 60 Minutesquita few months ago, saying he feared the loss of his prized editorial independence; and the network’s evening newscast ratings continue to lag their competitors. Recently, the company named an ombudsman for CBS News – someone with no news experience – tomonitor claims of bias, but with no arrangement to communicate regularly to the public, as normal news ombudsmen or public editors have.Others were much harsher than Tofel in their criticism, noting that Paramount paid an astonishing $150m for Weiss’s site, Free Press. Paramount is led these days by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, one of the world’s richest people, and Weiss is very much his pick to led CBS News; the corporate press release said she will, among other things, “reshape editorial priorities”. She will report directly to Ellison, rather than to the CBS News president, a more traditional arrangement.“Like Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, the deal can be understood as part of a broader elite project to smudge the lenses through which many people see the world,” wrote the Defector’s Patrick Redford. “By installing Weiss, the richest people in the world have taken another step toward ushering in the toothless, acquiescent future of mainstream media they’ve always wanted.”Certainly, that is something that Trump and his allies have worked relentlessly for.Redford called it “yet another victory of marketing over its natural enemy, journalism”.The real bias monitor at CBS is Donald Trump | Seth SternRead moreAs she took the helm, Weiss sent around a friendly-sounding note to the news staff that had one particularly notable line. Among her “core journalistic values”, she wrote, is “journalism that holds both American political parties to equal scrutiny”.Sounds good, but the two parties are far from equal these days.“CBS should brace for a heavy dose of bothsiderism,” wrote Oliver Darcy in his Status newsletter, observing that the Free Press has, as its central thesis, “that Trump and his supporters are largely right about the cultural rot of the woke-elite” and liberal overreach (wokeness) is a bigger problem than Trump’s existential threats to American democracy.As independent media gains influence, it may not matter very much any more who leads a major TV network. Certainly, it matters far less now than in the years when CBS ruled the airwaves.But it is telling that Weiss – such apolarizing provocateurherself – has been chosen to reinvent the most mainstream of legacy networks at this fraught and dangerous time in the US.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCBSOpinionUS television industryTelevision industryDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

On every other metric she is failing. She has not given a plausible explanation for her party’s defeat in last year’s election, and without one she has little prospect of recovering lost supporters or recruiting new ones.When she speaks of the Tories’ past record, her analysis is shallow and disingenuous. When she promises a better future, her prescriptions are outmoded and misguided. On the explanation for her present predicament – dismal poll ratings, a shrinking and demoralised membership, a trickle of defections toReform UKthat might yet become a flood – she is silent.Mrs Badenoch’s keynote speech closing the conference on Wednesday was a mix of denial, delusion and obsolete dogma. She bemoaned the state of Britain’s economy and public services with no hint of contrition for the harmful effect that 14 years of Conservative government might have had on the state of the nation.The twin causes of decline that she asserts with monomaniacal fervour are a bloated state and excess immigration. Her formula for renewal is to reduce public spending, fire a third of all civil servants, reverse all of Labour’s revenue-raising tax measures, cutother taxes, and repudiate Britain’s internationaltreaty obligationsas a precursor to mass deportation of unwelcome foreigners. She would also abandon Britain’s statutory commitments to reduce carbon emissions.It is a programme moulded precisely to the contours of a post-Brexit Conservative comfort zone. It contains no original thought. Nor is there any recognition that the world of 2025 requires policy solutions distinct from the ones that the radical right wing of the Tory party has been advocating for decades, and that were tried in office with disastrous consequences.Somewhat pathetically, Mrs Badenoch presents this stale rehash of old ideas as the product of her own diligent diagnosis of contemporary challenges facing Britain. This is a necessary fiction, because she cannot admit that her original timeline for policy development – nothing to befixed before 2027– has been abandoned. She has been bounced into premature announcements by colleagues who dread losing more votes and colleagues to Reform UK.The absence of sustained criticism of Nigel Farage’s party was the most revealing aspect of Mrs Badenoch’s speech. She mentioned the Reform leader only once, and in the context of public spending, a peripheral feature of his agenda.A leader who was serious about rehabilitating the Tories as a centre-right party that aspires to govern responsibly, and on behalf of all British citizens, would have addressed the rise of xenophobic nationalism that Mr Farage’s poll rating presages. But how could she do that when the same toxic tide is engulfing her own party? She cannot even rebuke Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary,for complainingabout his experience in a multi-ethnic Birmingham suburb on the grounds that he did not encounter “another white face”.Mr Jenrick’s comments,reported by the Guardian, were made earlier this year. At this week’s Tory conference he was striving to avoid undermining Mrs Badenoch, not because he has given up thoughts of replacing her but because potential supporters find his conspicuous posturing to that end off-putting.Besides, there is no need for ambitious rivals to destabilise a leader who is so adept at self-sabotage. A disastrous conference might have hastened defenestration. Instead, she is condemned to continue a while longer, recycling old ideas, hiding from present problems, and looking thoroughly beaten by the task of returning theConservativesto future relevance.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is a crucial moment. The UN’s scientists have yet to publish calculations based on the latest round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – as countries’ emissions pledges are known. But Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has called leaders together because it is already clear that the current emissions pledges are nowhere near enough. The Paris 1.5C threshold wascrossedlast year. Without stronger action, that temporary breach will become irreversible – with devastating consequences for people and planet.Lula’s diplomaticoutreachto Donald Trump, who calls the climate crisis a “con job”, suggests he is trying to bring key players into the fold ahead of Belém. Having heavyweights in the room can make all the difference. Ten years ago in Paris, world leaders’ presence proved crucial to securing an ambitious deal. That’s why it is important that Sir Keir Starmer attends. He may not be the most powerful world leader, but his presence is a moral and diplomatic imperative. If King Charles is able to, he ought to go too. Soft power can help to rebuild the spirit of cooperation to keep the hopes in the Paris agreement alive.The UK is one of the world’s biggest polluters historically, due to its earlyindustrialisationand itsempire. But the climate policies of the last two decades have been ambitious compared with other wealthy countries, and the UK’s NDC is one of the few that climateanalystsregard as helping to keep the 1.5C goal in view. All of which makes it even more important that Sir Keir should be in Brazil, in person, standing up for evidence-based policy in multilateral climate talks.Cop30 comes at a fraught moment for climate politics in Britain. The Tories’ promise torepealthe Climate Change Act was populist posturing, aimed at pandering to an anti-science, Trumpian right. Labour must not flinch. It has beenreportedthat Sir Keir’s aides are advising against going to Belém, fearing backlash from Reform UK. Retreat would be cowardly and wrong. Sir Keir should instead reaffirm his commitment to national targets and the Cop process – confident that shifting to renewable energy is both right andpopular.Sir Keir is, of course, not the only leader who should be making travel plans. The leaders ofAustraliaand Canada both made climate policies part of their pitches to voters in recent elections. They too should be heading for Belém, as should the leaders of the EU, China, India and Japan. As the former UN secretary generalBan Ki-moon noted, attendance is not ceremonial but a test of leadership. He warned that the world was watching – and said that history would remember who showed up.Mr Trump’s election win was adangerous setbackto the global green energy transition. But 33 years after the Brazilian Earth Summit that set the process going, he is also a reason for other governments to step up. Perhaps Lula could evenconvinceMr Trump to change his mind? If there was ever a time to show that the climate is a diplomatic priority, this is it. Sir Keir must not leave the question of his attendance hanging any longer. He must decide – and go.Explore more on these topicsCop30OpinionBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaDonald TrumpKeir StarmerClimate crisisKing Charles IIIeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromWarwick Hillman,Janet WalmsleyandDarryl TellesWed 8 Oct 2025 12.59 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 14.43 EDTShareOn Tuesday morning I woke up and saw news about my neighbourhood. I was hoping it would be positive – about our brilliant community organisations, our fantastic faith groups, our valiant voluntary associations. However, the news was that the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, had said that my neighbourhood was “as close as I’ve come to a slum in this country” and that he was concerned by “not seeing another white face” (Robert Jenrick accused of fuelling ‘toxic nationalism’ with Birmingham claims, 7 October).It is a shame that Mr Jenrick fails to see beyond his nose, though I’m sure the real narrative doesn’t suit the social media soundbites he’s chasing after. The UK’s pound-shop JD Vance swans into the neighbourhood, sees some fly‑tipping (yes we know it’s an issue), spots a couple of faces and then makes sweeping statements that would fail the most basic of sense checks.My grandmother came to Handsworth in the 1960s. Many people arrived before, and many since. Many who made their lives, built businesses, contributed to our community and country. I am committed to Handsworth.The irony is that the Conservative government of which Jenrick was a key part threw my neighbourhood and city into neglect. Disinvestment, destruction and destitution. And now he has the gall to come back and talk about issues.All this being said, I would welcome Mr Jenrick back to walk the famous Soho Road, enjoy some food (I’d recommend a samosa chaat, a dosa and a shawarma), and learn some of the positive values about community, which he so obviously lacks.I’ll see you on Soho Road, Robert – and hopefully you will leave a better man.Shuranjeet SinghBirminghamBeing somewhat older thanRobert Jenrick, I understand very well the racialised language that he did not invent but so ably employs. When Jenrick says he “didn’t see another white face” in an area of Birmingham and that it was therefore not “properly integrated”, he is saying that non-white people are not really British.I grew up in rural Lincolnshire, where it was memorably impressed on me in ways both direct and indirect that I did not belong in this country, the only one I had ever known.Outwardly, the result was that I took the free healthcare and education, did the BA, won a PhD studentship, wrote my thesis and left the country as soon as I could. Inwardly, the impact was that I never had a friend, a home or a vocation in Britain. And now, somehow, the racist prognosis has come true: I am not British.In so cynically scheming for his own paltry advancement, Robert Jenrick is sowing the seeds for tomorrow’s bumper crop of racial hatred and misery.Edward LindonTaipei, TaiwanWhat a delicious irony that Robert Jenrick chose Handsworth for his racist rant about integration. As well as Benjamin Zephaniah (I know the real Handsworth – it’s a far better place than Robert Jenrick’s toxic vision of Britain, 8 October), Handsworth can also claim as one of its own a Jamaican teenager called Bill Morris who arrived there in 1954 and rose to begeneral secretaryof the Transport and General Workers’ Union. He is now of course known as Baron Morris of Handsworth. Just how much more integration does Jenrick expect?Warwick HillmanPinner, LondonWhen I visit the slightly posh village in Essex where I grew up, I rarely see any faces of people of colour. Might Robert Jenrick think it is “one of the worst integrated places I’ve ever been to”? Or is he not concerned about that?Janet WalmsleySheffieldI recently went to Newark, Robert Jenrick’s constituency, and was appalled to find no other Black people there.Darryl TellesSt Leonards-on-Sea, East SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

No such policy or decision has been announced by the competent Iranian authorities.

Your brain simply can’t process two things at once, and I now I have a wealth of shows to choose from that have my attention and prevent the anxiety from creeping in.I still miss some sleep, but I enjoy the time that I have listening to all the shows I never have time to devote attention to during the day. And I often drop off again mid‑programme without the worry of finding my “page” again, as with an audiobook. It might be worth a try for others.Gillian GreenfieldHaydon Bridge, NorthumberlandBefore artificial light became commonplace, split sleep patterns were normal for young adults. At times when it was necessary for some people to be awake and watchful, adolescents would take the early watch and go to bed late. Older adults would go to sleep and get up early to take the third watch. Young adults would take the middle shift, waking up after a few hours sleep to keep watch in the middle of the night. They would then go back to sleep again.Real life is, of course, a lot more complex than that, but we still have natural biorhythms that change as we age. The answer is to follow your natural biorhythms rather than fight against them.Michael PeelLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I’m trying to video you.” It trundled a short way up the path, turned, and, singing Baby Shark, zigzagged back towards me.My video was hopeless.

The 40-year-old has been in charge for 11 months but is yet to win back-to-back league games and the team sit 10th.Which footballers defied a manager’s tactics – and what were the results? | The KnowledgeRead moreUnited have picked up 37 points from his 34 league games, finished 15th last season, andwere knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsbyin August. Amorim has faced questions over his 3-4-3 formation, which is yet to pay dividends despite a summer net spend of about £170m.Ratcliffe is regarded as a key supporter of Amorim but the head coach has admitted that if results do not improvehe will face the sack.“He has not had the best of seasons,” Ratcliffe toldThe Business podcast. “Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be. The press, sometimes I don’t understand. They want overnight success. They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow. You can’t run a club like Manchester United on kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”Ratcliffe has controlled football operations since purchasing an initial 25% of the club in December 2023 from the Glazer family, who maintain majority ownership. Asked what the response would be if the Glazers suggested Amorim needed to be dismissed, Ratcliffe said: “It’s not going to happen.”View image in fullscreenSir Jim Ratcliffe (left) feels the Glazers, his fellow owners, are ‘really nice people’ and ‘really passionate about the club’.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Glazers have been the subject of numerous protests over the years and are rarely seen at Old Trafford, leaving Ratcliffe and Ineos to run day‑to-day operations. “We’re local and they’re the other side of the pond,” Ratcliffe said. “That’s a long way away to try to manage a football club as big and as complex as Manchester United. We’re here with feet on the ground. They get a bad rap … but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.”Wide-ranging cost-cutting measures have been implemented by Ratcliffe, resulting in about 450 jobs being lost at United, Sir Alex Ferguson’s £2m‑a‑year ambassadorial role being ended and free lunches for staff being removed, leading to criticism of Ratcliffe.“The costs were just too high,” Ratcliffe said. “There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one’s ever given me a free lunch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The German stressed thatEngland, who have been losing finalists in two successive European Championships, should not get carried away given they have not won the men’s World Cup since 1966.‘We’re not here as tourists’: Bellamy insists Wales will go on attack against EnglandRead more“If you’ve never won Wimbledon you are maybe one of the favourites but you are not the favourite,” Tuchel said. “It is just how it is. There is Brazil, there is Argentina, Spain, France and they just did it recently. It doesn’t mean we have no chance. First we will qualify and then we will know exactly why we go there. We want to go all the way but the role has to be clear.“I don’t see why we should burden ourselves that we are the big favourites. When did we last win it? Let’s go step by step. We build a team that is ready to go step by step and no one wants hopefully to play against us.”It was put to Tuchel that pundits and bookmakers tend to raise hopes by making England favourites, to which he said: “How am I responsible? We will arrive with a clear target to try to win but I think there is a way to do it and a way people are not upset if it doesn’t happen.”Tuchel said attitudes towards him have shifted sinceEngland’s 5-0 win against Serbialast month. “I felt the reaction when I go to restaurants or sit in a cab,” he said. “Just speaking to people I felt a different reaction to this last match and I believe it is because of the way we played.“Before it was a different view but no one was upset with me. It was: ‘Bring it home and you will make it happen and by the way my team is whatever and nominate this player and you cannot play without this player.’ After the last camp it was: ‘Ah, that was amazing to watch.’”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel said he would be without Harry Kane in Thursday night’s game with Wales but that the captain should be fit to face Latvia.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesTuchel saw Steven Gerrard’s description this week of the Golden Generation as“egotistical losers”. Gerrard’s team fell below expectations and faced criticism after disappointing at the 2006 World Cup.“When I hear people talking about their titles in international football or their missed chances I hear always the same song: ‘We have been a team,’ or: ‘We haven’t been a team,’” Tuchel said. “I think the rivalry between clubs was huge in this moment and they obviously couldn’t find a way to buy into a bigger purpose, a bigger goal. A big, big opportunity wasted.”Tuchel was studying for his coaching licence in Germany in 2006. Was he aware of the media frenzy around England at their base in Baden-Baden? “I was maybe more focused on the football but we realised there was a bit of circus going on,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He loved the energy during the camp last month and saw no reason to bring Bellingham and Foden back into the squad. “We are not collecting the most talented players, we are trying to build a team,” he said.“Teams win trophies, no one else. We will try to bring the best players and the best squad with the best players but it can sometimes happen in the end that you don’t just collect the most talented players and hope it works out.“We build a team that cares for each other and supports each other, that accepts the hierarchy within the team, and this will bring us a long way.”Tuchel is not looking to make sweeping changes to his starting XI when England hostWalesin a friendly on Thursday night. Harry Kane is out with a foot injury but should return for the World Cup qualifier against Latvia on Tuesday. Declan Rice is competing with Jordan Henderson and John Stones to captain the side against Wales.

They phoned up, they said they wanted us to do it, so I said: ‘Yeah, fine. Make us an offer.’“I genuinely don’t do it for the money, although it’s nice, but I think I’m worth [more] than just over a quarter of the [salary of] other head coaches.“The money was one thing so I’m not quite sure they wanted me anyway, but then you also want to feel valued. I said: ‘This isn’t going to work for me,’ and they weren’t going to move on it.”Rashid, one of the team’s marquee players, told Flintoff: “You’ll be missed. I wasn’t expecting that.”Flintoff, who is also head coach of England Lions, may interest other Hundred teams as the influence of new investors is felt. London Spirit have lured Andy Flower away from Trent Rockets and further personnel changes are likely.Superchargers, meanwhile, are poised to change their name to incorporate the Sunrisers branding of their Indian Premier League and SA20 stablemates.Explore more on these topicsAndrew FlintoffThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

You saw at the press conference how much it means to her to be ‘playing in the Champo’ with the big dogs. She’s a great character. She had a real calmness to take that penalty, it just shows her mental acumen to control herself. She’s a rock for us and it’s fitting she got the first goal.”After Arna Eiríksdóttir’s handball, Le Tissier calmly sent Tove Enblom the wrong way and then ran to slide on her knees in front of the home supporters in celebration.It was a rare moment that got the crowd off their feet in an otherwise fairly flat first half, with the turnout perhaps not quite befitting the occasion of the club’s debut at this stage of the Champions League, albeit this is far from the glamour match in the league phase.Perhaps many home fans have decided to prioritise the visit in November by Paris Saint-Germain to Old Trafford or OL Lyonnes – the eight-time European championswho won at Arsenal on Tuesday– over the side sitting second in the Norwegian top division.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Jess Park (centre) battles with Ylinn Tennebø (left) and Olaug Tvedten.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAUnited were expected to win and they almost opened the scoring early on when Elisabeth Terland’s glancing header dropped narrowly wide of the base of the post. Melvine Malard also went close twice before Le Tissier’s goal.The captain’s resolute display could be timely before Sarina Wiegman names her England squad on Tuesday; Le Tissier, who has barely put a foot wrong this season, looks certain to feature prominently, as does Jess Park, who once again impressed.Park should have scored in the first minute of the second half, after a flowing team move involving Ella Toone and Terland, but Park’s one‑on-one effort was blocked by Enblom. What followed was a lengthy spell of United possession inside the Vålerenga half but with little to show for it, as the visitors tightened up their defensive lines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Real went in at half-time 3-2 up but pulled cleared with Weir, their captain, adding her second (pictured) before Alba Redondo completed her double, with Eva Navarro sealing a dominant victory in which they had 14 shots on target. Evelyne Viens and Emilie Haavi scored for Roma.Liga F teams occupy the top three spots in the table afterAtlético Madridoverwhelmed the Austrian clubSt Polten6-0 away from home.

They want it. They want it badly. However, their title credentials took a knock in the Netherlands, a 1-1 draw against Twente far from the ideal start to a tournament they long to dominate.Despite Chelsea’s dominance in possession it was the home team that took the lead through their captain, Danique van Ginkel, before Sandy Baltimore converted from the spot for the equaliser.Le Tissier realises WCL dream to earn Manchester United win against VålerengaRead more“It’s not a good result at all,” said Sonia Bompastor, speaking to Disney+. “We wanted to start the campaign with three points and a victory. Tonight, out of ­possession I am quite happy with the ­performance, even if we conceded a goal. In possession, when you play this game you need to show more desire especially when you are in the box.”Every piece of silverware is valuable but, for the team that has repeatedly won it all domestically, the desire for the final piece of the puzzle is strong. It eluded them during Emma Hayes’s tenure, defeat to Barcelona in the 2021 final the closest they came. Three back-to-back semi-final defeats to Barcelona, includinglosing 8-2 on aggregate to the Catalan giants last season, have stung each and every time.View image in fullscreenTwente’s players surround Danique van Ginkel after her opening goal.Photograph: DeFodi Images/Getty ImagesBompastor flexed the muscles of her squad for the trip to Enschede, with only four of the team that started their1-1 draw with Manchester Unitedon Friday night on the pitch, but it proved costly as they started their Champions League campaign in a new era of the competition – the group stage replaced by a league phase akin to the men’s tournament.These two teams met in last season’s group stage, Chelsea inflicting a9-2 aggregate defeaton the Dutch side. Van Ginkel suggested things would be different one year on. “I hope we’ve matured a bit and can address what we did wrong,” she said.At De Grolsch Veste that maturity showed. Twente did not try to match Chelsea’s press or compete one-on-one; they were an efficient unit, frustrating the visitors, who threw wave after wave of attacks at the home team, the Belgium goalkeeper Diede Lemey doing her bit to thwart the Women’s Super League leaders.Afterwards, Van Ginkel said: “We made big, big steps. We fought as a team, the plan was good. We defended a lot but I am really proud.”It was the home side who took the lead, having twice failed to make the most of opportunities to do so beforehand. Chelsea would rue their own profligacy when Jill Roord’s cutback found Van Ginkel and the captain shifted on to her right foot and lashed past Livia Peng – the goalkeeper handed a start ahead of the Yashin Trophy winner Hannah Hampton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Real went in at half-time 3-2 up but pulled cleared with Weir, their captain, adding her second (pictured) before Alba Redondo completed her double, with Eva Navarro sealing a dominant victory in which they had 14 shots on target. Evelyne Viens and Emilie Haavi scored for Roma.Liga F teams occupy the top three spots in the table afterAtlético Madridoverwhelmed the Austrian clubSt Polten6-0 away from home. The Brazilian midfielder Luany was the star of the evening with her assist and 23rd-minute strike helping her side build a comfortable lead. Atlético were 4-0 up by the interval with Gio Garbelini, Andrea Medina and Vilde Bøe Risa also finding their way past Carina Schluter. They had to wait until the closing moments for their next goals, however, with Fiamma Benítez hitting the target twice, the first from the penalty spot. Benítez’s double meant Atlético finished the first round of European matches above Real in second place, behind Barcelona, who beat Bayern Munich 7-1 on Tuesday.Wolfsburgalso made a strong start by crushingParis Saint-Germain4-0 at AOK Stadion.

They may not have delivered thrilling performances this term but they have delivered results and in the Netherlands they continued to fuel that narrative as they launched a comeback. Lynn Groenewegen’s step on the foot of Guro Reiten gave the visiting team a penalty, and they could arguably have had one moments earlier when a late boot went into Erin Cuthbert’s shin.

This is not enough when you play a Champions League game,” said Bompastor.Chelsea have opportunities to steady the ship against Paris FC and St Pölten before they play their old foes Barcelona, Roma and then the two-time champions Wolfsburg, but there is work to be done.Mentality will be “crucial”, said Bompastor. “Sometimes you talk a lot about tactics, but the main thing in football is to have the right mentality, the right intensity when you have the ball. We tried and tonight it’s tough, but we need to take the learnings from this game.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueTwente WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In a dramatic move theleading unions collectively made clear this weekthat players involved in the R360 competition would be ineligible for their national sides and have warned them to treat offers with “extreme caution”.Privately there is a widespread view that those pushing the R360 concept, fronted by the England World Cup winner Mike Tindall, now face a struggle to get the project off the ground if the world’s top male and female players are required to forfeit their international futures to join the rebel league.England among eight rugby nations vowing to ban players in rebel R360 leagueRead moreThe decision of the unions to issue a coordinated statement on Tuesday followed the announcement last week that the International Rugby Players Association – the global players’ union – was not backing the competition or any contracts offered to its members. R360 has also still to be officially sanctioned by World Rugby, the sport’s governing body.While World Rugby cannot comment for legal reasons relating to R360’s pending official application that will not be heard until at least next June, the mood of leading rugby officials and union representatives is hardening. It is also understood that some pre-contract player agreements with R360 may have had deadlines attached that have either expired or are reaching that point.Fin Smith, theNorthamptonand England fly-half who signed a new club contract last week, said he sympathised with players nearing the end of their careers who may have been tempted by the money on offer, but he said it was never an option for him.“[My agent] knew my priority was to stay in England and give myself a chance to play for my country and hopefully go to a World Cup,” he said. “Most players, when they finish with their contracts, there are options but I was pretty clear from the start I wanted to stay in England and I’m really happy with my decision to stay with Northampton.”Of the announcement on Tuesday, he said: “I don’t think it will change how things are looked at too much. There will be people in a position and at a stage in their career that it will probably make a lot of sense for, who have achieved a lot in the international game, have done it, are going to play less matches and making a pretty hefty sum of money is an attractive proposition.“I completely understand why for some people, at some stages of their career, it makes a lot of sense.”World Rugby has intimated previously that any new competition would need to complement the existing calendar and preserve the sanctity of international rugby, the financial engine of the sport globally that generates funds for grassroots development.The statement on Tuesday also highlighted the self-serving nature of the R360 model that ultimately would benefit only a few at the expense of many others. “[It] rather appears designed to generate profits and return them to a very small elite, potentially hollowing out the investment that national unions and existing leagues make in community rugby, player development, and participation pathways,” said the unions’ statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The RFU said: “We have invested millions into PWR [Premiership Women’s Rugby], central contracts, bonuses, and performance support to develop the women’s and girls’ game here and played a pivotal role in negotiating the structure of the new WXV global series. We cannot therefore support this proposition.”The RFU and other unions accept that “some players may choose to take opportunities in R360” and insist they will “bear no ill will with them” if they do. As things stand, though, the 2027 World Cup is just over the horizon and any world-class players who might be swayed by the attractive terms of an R360 contract would have to balance that against missing out on the ultimate tournament.A better scenario for the wider game, perhaps, would be for the financial backers of R360 to switch horses and support the sport’s existing competitions and teams instead. Sources suggest that World Rugby’s door remains open to any such investors, particularly with the 2031 men’s World Cup taking place in the US and the profile of the women’s game increasing rapidly.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionRugby Football UnionEngland rugby union teamNorthamptonSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A 4-0 win over regional rivals Vietnam not just kept theHarimau Malaya (Malayan Tigers) on course for the 2027 Asian Cup but well and truly confirmed they were dining back at the top table in southeast Asia. Four months later, they are still the talk of the region of 650 million people, but not in a good way.The story starts, as it does increasingly in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) football these days, with naturalisation. In January, the crown prince of Johor, Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, the owner of Johor Darul Ta’zim football club, and former president of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM),wrote on social media: “We have identified 6-7 heritage players … and hope the Malaysian government could assist in the process of obtaining Malaysian passports in order for them to play in the Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers.”Seven players from Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the Netherlands with a grandparent from Malaysia were naturalised. All seven played against Vietnam; two scored. The day after, we now know, Fifa received a complaint about their eligibility and started investigating.On 22 September, came sanctions. All seven players were hit with a 12-month ban from all football, which came as a shock, not least to La Liga club Alavés as their defender Facundo Garcés had played in all six games of the current season before that. Fifa also fined FAM $438,000 (£325,000). Details weren’t given, but the charges were that the federation “had submitted eligibility enquiries to Fifa, and in doing so, it used doctored documentation to be able to field the above players”.The reaction in Malaysia was split. Many were appalled, others took offence, suggesting the sanctions were a result of jealousy from rivals. The crown prince questioned the timing and said Malaysians should not bow down to “those individuals who are worried about the rise ofHarimau Malaya. Fight on. Be brave for being right”. Conspiracy theories blocking the rise of a team ranked No 123 in the world seem a bit far-fetched, especially as Malaysia has more political clout than its regional rivals with a member on the Fifa council. The general secretary of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is also a role historically reserved for a Malaysian as the organisation is officially based in Kuala Lumpur.View image in fullscreenMalaysia’s players celebrate scoring a goal against South Korea in the 2024 Asian Cup. Their participation in the 2027 tournament may now be under threat.Photograph: Thaier Al-Sudani/ReutersOn Monday evening came Fifa’s full 19-page report. It arrived as Malaysia slept and was some wake-up call, described by a source close to the organisation as “sensationally damning”. The highlight is a table in the document consisting of three columns. The first has the name of a grandparent, the second is headed “Birthplace (doctored documents)“ and listed states of Malaysia – Penang, Malacca, Johor and Sarawak – where FAM’s documents claimed they were born. The third column headed “Birthplace (original documents)” listed cities located in Spain, Argentina, Brazil and the Netherlands where Fifa said they were actually born, namely the same countries as their grandchildren.“Presenting fraudulent documentation with the purpose of gaining eligibility to play for a national team constitutes, pure and simple, a form of cheating, which cannot in any way be condoned,” stated Fifa’s report. “Such conduct erodes trust in the fairness of competitions and jeopardises the very essence of football as an activity founded on honesty and transparency.”In response, FAM said it would launch an appeal. “Claims that players ‘acquired or were aware of fake documents’ are baseless as no solid evidence has been presented so far,” read a statement, the governing body adding that while there had been an administrative error when submitting documents: “FAM would like to assert that the heritage players involved are legitimate Malaysian citizens.”Fifa has said it is confident in its ruling and so it remains to be seen what evidence FAM produces, if any, as part of its appeal. Sources close to Fifa say they believe the appeal will be aimed more at lessening the sanctions rather than overturning the decision.And there’s more: the AFC has said it will wait until Fifa’s action is resolved before involving its own disciplinary committee. The body runs the Asian Cup and, if Malaysia’s guilt is confirmed, there is a possibility of them not being at the 2027 tournament. The players should try to make the most of Thursday’s qualifier against Laos as there may not be many competitive games in the near future.After the full Fifa report was released, the reaction at home was fierce, not least because for people in most walks of life, acquiring Malaysian citizenship is a long and frustrating process. As the writer Haresh Deol put it when calling for heads to roll: “This fiasco goes beyond FAM and football. It strikes at the nation’s integrity. It’s a national embarrassment.”It certainly does not do any favours for a country that has for a long time been known more in football terms for match-fixing and betting syndicates than anything on the pitch. For a while it looked as if that was going to change.Explore more on these topicsFootballMalaysiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Players, coaches and staff had their lives turned upside down. Career paths were inevitably changed. What kind of an impact would a fit Trent Alexander-Arnold have had at Euro 2020 if it had been played that year? As it turned out he injured himself just before the postponed tournament in 2021 and had to withdraw from the England squad.Next Generation 2020: 60 of the best young talents in world footballRead moreMillions of footballers will have had their trajectories altered,including our Next Generation picks from that year. Theseriesstarted in 2014 and each year we select a first-year scholar from every Premier League club, as well as 60 of the best talents from around the world, and follow them for five years.In 2020, our players will have been about 17 years old, many of them hoping to break into their first teams. Some will have been better off because of the pandemic break, some worse.If the quality is there, though, they are likely to make it in the end. In 2020 we had four German players on our list of 60 of the best players in the world born in 2003. Two were Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz. They were at Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen and set for stardom.Musiala was born in Germany but moved to England at the age of seven. He played for several clubs in London before landing at Chelsea. He also represented Germany and England at youth-age groups before moving back to mainland Europe and pledging his allegiance to the country of his birth.As with Wirtz, there was never any doubt that he would make it to the top. He may have had a more settled path to the top – joining Cologne at the age of seven before moving to nearby Bayer Leverkusen 10 years later (although that was a controversial switch) – but he suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2022, which robbed him of almost a year of competitive football. In the end he came back better than ever and won the German double with Leverkusen before moving toLiverpool for an initial £100m this June.The other two Germans on the list, Luca Netz and Torben Rhein, have also done well with the former having racked up more than 100 Bundesliga appearances while the latter is plying his trade in the Dutch second division with Emmen.Eighteen months ago we may have placed Jhon Durán in the category of players who would have made it no matter what, but since having had his breakthrough at Aston Villa his career has taken an unexpected turn. Sold to Al-Nassr in January this year he is on loan at Fenerbahce but was recently castigated by José Mourinho and told to work harder in training.Bar chart showing the 20 picks who have played for their senior international teamsThe Colombian is sixth on our list of Next Gen 2020 players with most international senior appearances but has not appeared for the national team since the half-time whistle blew against Peru in early June, after which there were reports of a dressing-room bust-up.Just below Durán is Wilfried Gnonto, another player who has had an interesting journey but is now back playing regular Premier League football. He was born in Italy and joined Inter at the age of nine but then took the decision to move abroad as a 16-year-old by signing for Zürich.After two successful seasons in Switzerland he joined Leeds, where he has been on a rollercoaster ride. He had a fine debut season in the Premier League, playing 24 times but not able to prevent Leeds from being relegated. Then followed two campaigns of Championship football among persistent rumours of him leaving, which continued this summer despite the club’s promotion. He has now made more than 120 appearances for Leeds and his decision to move abroad at an early age has paid off.As for the20 Premier League players we picked in 2020, they too have had different journeys, with several moving countries to get the best out of their career. They may not have enjoyed quite the same success as some of our previous graduates – such as Alexander-Arnold and Bukayo Saka – but have still amassed more than 100 top-flight appearances between them.Bar chart showing players with top-flight games playedAntwoine Hackford, who was with Sheffield United in 2020, and Michael Ndiweni, then at Newcastle, are the only players to have featured in the Premier League but several players have gone on to forge careers around Europe. Not on the above list but still worth a mention is Charlie Patino, who was with Arsenal five years ago but is now playing for Deportivo La Coruña in the Spanish second division. He joined them in 2024 and this season he has featured in all league games as Deportivo are undefeated and top of the league. La Liga for him next season?List showing where our 2020 Premier League batch are playing nowA look at where the 20 players are now reveals a big spread of leagues, from the Premier League 2 (Reece Welch at Everton, Luke Mbete-Tabu at Manchester City and Leicester’s Kian Pennant) to the ninth tier of English football.It goes to show that nothing is guaranteed in football, even though with Musiala and Wirtz their talent was so substantial it would have taken a remarkable series of events for them not to reach the top.Explore more on these topicsFootballNext generationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, 25% said that they believed theUS militarycould be used for other purposes and 18% said that they were not sure.The survey, which comes asDonald Trumpcontinues to send or threaten to sendarmed national guard troops to major American cities including Portland, Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles – much to public outrage – found that 72% of Democrats agreed with the sentiment.Notably, only a slight majority, 51%, of Republicans said that they agreed and 53% of respondents with other political affiliations said the same.Texas national guard troops head to Illinois after judge fails to block moveRead moreThe survey also found that only 37% of all Americans believed that the president should be able to send in troops into a state even if its governor objects; 48% of responders said they disagreed and 15% said they were unsure.Among those who agreed with Trump’s deploying of armed troops to a state despite a governor’s objection, 70% of Republicans said yes while only 13% of Democrats said the same.Additionally, the survey found that 83% of all Americans said that the US military should remain politically neutral. Among Republicans 78% agreed with the sentiment, 93% of Democrats said the same and 80% of respondents with other political affiliations agreed as well.Last month, Trump faced widespread backlash from Democratic lawmakers after he suggested the US military use American cities as training grounds.Addressing a room of more than 800 military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, Trumpsaid: “Last month I signed an executive order to provide training for quick reaction force that can help quell civil disturbances. This is gonna be a big thing for the people in this room, because it’s the enemy from within, and we have to handle it before it gets out of control.”He added that he told the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military”.On Wednesday, Trumpcalledfor the jailing of Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and Illinois’s governor, JB Pritzker, as armed national guard troops arrive in the Chicago area under Trump’s orders.Both leaders, whom Trump has accused of failing to protect Ice officers amid their immigration raids, have refused to budge. Johnson said, “I’m not going anywhere,” while Pritzker said: “I will not back down.”A federal judge on Saturdayblockedthe Trump administration from sending national guard troops to Portland, Oregon. The judge’s decision came after Trump threatened to authorize “full force, if necessary” in the heavily liberal city which he has claimed to be “war-ravaged”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “It is utterly shameful that so many universities have spent time and resources surveilling students who are engaged in peaceful protest against a genocide, and that some have seemingly done so on the say-so of defence companies.”There have been large-scale pro-Palestinian protests by students on campuses across the UK in the past two years and demonstrations at careers fairs against companies with Israeli government links.The Association of University Chief Security Officers (Aucso) launched a coordinated effort to prevent protests “affecting our students’ career advancement”, according to notes released under FoI laws from a January 2025 presentation by Aucso to Universities UK, the body representing vice-chancellors.Aucso, which has security staff at more than 140 universities, wrote that its members “monitor[ed] media/social media” and deployed “static officers (at entrance points near the targeted company) and mobile officers (to monitor surrounding areas and for rapid response)” during events.Aucso security staff also used bodycams to capture video for “legal/disciplinary proceedings”, among other measures, the email said.Aucso was approached for comment.Defence companies that individually raised concerns with institutions before careers fairs about the potential for protests were offered reassurance, emails suggest.Loughborough University told a recruitment firm running a “Rolls-Royce roadshow” that its security team were conducting “active monitoring of social media … to provide early intelligence about protests”. It was doing so, it wrote, as “protest has been a concern for employers in recent times”.A Loughborough University spokesperson said previous masked protests by Loughborough Action for Palestine (LAFP), a group that says it is made up of staff, students and alumni, had caused some students to feel unsafe amid allegations of antisemitism.“We observe the group’s public feed occasionally so as to forewarn those who may be affected in advance of any protests. We are unapologetic for this. We do not surveil students’ social media,” they said.LAFP responded in a statement: “We are extremely concerned but unsurprised that a few peaceful protests on campus have been perceived as threats to student safety and have been weaponised to ‘justify’ surveillance of students by university management.”Rolls-Royce declined to comment.Emails fromHeriot-Watt University(HWU) suggest Raytheon UK asked the university to “monitor university chat groups” on its behalf before a careers fair, prompting the university to agree to “implement the measures you have suggested”.A HWU spokesperson said the university “strongly refuted” any claims it monitored students’ private correspondence, adding that safeguarding staff did not have access to any student chat groups or online discussion forums. The university did not provide further explanation for its response to the arms company. Raytheon declined to comment.Further emails suggestBAE Systemsrequired Glasgow university to complete security questions before agreeing to attend events. A “university security questionnaire” sent to Glasgow by the defence company asked if the institution was “aware of any social media protests posts or videos”.In May this year, Glasgow university’s careers service staff met the arms firm Leonardo, whose employee afterwards wrote: “It’s reassuring to know that we’re not going to have the [sic] step back because we can’t find a route to engaging with students and keep [sic] our staff safe.”Leonardo was approached for comment. TheUniversity of Glasgowdid not respond to a request for comment.In February 2024,Cardiff Universitymoved its career event online “in agreement with BAE” after staff spotted a social media post calling for a protest, emails show.A Cardiff University spokesperson said: “We reject the suggestion that we’ve put students ‘under surveillance’. The protest was posted on a public-facing social media account. This was picked up as part of our day-to-day media monitoring.“We routinely monitor mentions of Cardiff University, including those made on social media platforms, to measure engagement with our communications activity and in relation to reputation management. This type of activity is not unique to Cardiff University and is used by other universities and organisations.”BAE Systems said it did not directly sell weapons to Israel.

He said he was deeply sorry for the attack in which he punched Lawrence on the back of his head while he was crouched on the ground.He refused, however, to name the four or five attackers who were with him on the night of 22 April 1993. He is making his first appearance at a Parole Board hearing that was video-streamed to a room at the royal courts of justice.At the public hearing on Wednesday,Doreen Lawrence,72, said: “The only person he feels sorry for is himself. As far as I am concerned he is a coward. He refused to show his face. He needs to look me in the eye and tell me exactly what he did and why he did it.”View image in fullscreenStephen Lawrence was murdered in London on 22 April 1993.Photograph: Family handout/PATwo days of proceedings have been held in public, but the final day will take place in private on Friday. Lawrence also spoke outside the court, saying it had been “incredibly painful” to listen to the proceedings but that it was vital the hearing was held in public.“He says he’s sorry for the pain he caused me and my family, I don’t believe him,” she said.All of the witnesses to the hearing except one said they did not believe Norris was ready to be freed. Lawrence said: “The evidence to me is crystal clear. He is not safe to be released. He is a danger to the public and a danger to people like me. He was a violent racist and is still a violent racist. He has not changed.”Norris admitted his involvement in Lawrence’s murder in 2018 when he confessed to a Catholic priest.Doreen Lawrencecalled on the Metropolitan police to urgently investigate after he said he would not name the others involved in the killing because of fears for his family’s safety.“This person can name the other killers and says he would love to do so,” she said. “The police must do everything in their power to obtain that evidence and bring all of Stephen’s murderers to justice. This man owes me the truth and the Met owe me justice.”Before Norris was questioned on Tuesday, he read a statement in which he said he wanted to “express my genuine remorse for the death of the victim in my case”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The court was told that the teenager complained of struggling to breathe when she accused the officer of using a “stranglehold” on her.The girl and her friend were seen pushing through the barriers after a station employee refused to let them pass for free.Young has been a part of the BTP for 19 years but during the trial on Wednesday said the two teenagers were “hysterical” and said he only grabbed the girl’s clothing.But Mark Gadsden, prosecuting, told the court: “He swung her around and got hold of her in a headlock with his arm around her neck. She was a 15-year-old child, and we say that degree of force was unnecessary, not reasonable in the circumstances, and not proportionate.”An Independent Office forPoliceConduct spokesperson said: “The court heard that on 22 September 2024, BTP officers responded to a request for assistance from railway staff after a child pushed their way through ticket barriers at Camden Road overground station.“After PC Young approached the child, CCTV footage showed the officer restraining her by placing her in a headlock. The child remained in a headlock for approximately 30 seconds before PC Young pushed her back through the ticket barrier and placed his hand around her throat while pushing her up against a ticket machine.“PC Young handcuffed and arrested the child, and she was later de-arrested at the scene.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This included in a letter signed “Madeleine x”.“That was an example of a thing that was getting to me,” McCann said. “It’s obvious the thing I want the most … is for Madeleine to be back and for Madeleine to be calling me 'Mum. And that was really stressful for me. Referring to me as ‘Mum’ is hard.”The court was told that Wandelt and her co-defendant, Karen Spragg, 61, from Cardiff, bombarded McCann with messages and calls and waited for the family outside their home on the evening of 7 December 2024.View image in fullscreenMadeleine McCann was three when she disappeared while on a family holiday in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz in 2007.Photograph: Metropolitan police/AFP/Getty ImagesMcCann described getting out of her car alone and hearing a voice in the darkness saying “Kate”. “I knew it was someone behind me but I didn’t know who it was,” she said. “I got a fright.”Turning round, she recognised Wandelt “pretty quickly” from the pictures she had sent, she said. “She was quite vivid in my mind anyway because of all the communications,” she said.“I got a fright and when I realised who it was I felt quite distressed. I think I’d been on edge anyway with all the communication and it just bubbled up.”She said she managed to get inside the house despite Wandelt “putting her hands out trying to stop me closing the door”.The pair had been asking for a DNA test, something McCann said she would have been unable to do without the involvement of the police, who had already ruled out the possibility that Wandelt was her daughter.She said she had not wanted to indulge the womenbut admitted she had a moment of doubt.“I think because [the alleged harassment] was getting to be so much, a little bit of my brain was saying ‘what if?’, even though I knew …“I guess having seen a photograph of her, and she’s Polish, none of it made any sense. I can’t say what Madeleine looks like now, but if I saw a photo of her, I would recognise her. When I say there was a niggle, it was tiny.”Madeleine’s father, Gerry McCann, was asked about the same evening in court on Wednesday afternoon. He had come home after his wife to be confronted by the defendants, which he described as “pretty horrible”.He talked about being sure Wandelt was not his missing daughter and said that at one point he answered the phone to her. “I can’t remember my exact words but I said something like: ‘You’re not Madeleine, please stop calling,’” he said.He struggled to speak through the emotion as he talked about trying to protect his other two children from the spotlight brought by Madeleine’s case.“Social media can be really damaging, all the horrible things that have been written about us and nasty stuff online, so obviously we wanted to try to protect them from that,” he said.Kate McCann had also been emotional earlier in the day when she said it was only when Wandelt contacted their grown-up daughter Amelie that they decided to pursue things through the police. Her voice broke as she said Amelie and her twin brother Sean had had to deal with a lot.Wandelt began sobbing from the dock in what appeared to be an effort to ensure McCann could hear her. She was ushered to the back of the dock where she shouted: “Why are you doing this to me?” She was led through the door leading towards the cells and her crying could be heard echoing in the corridor.Wandelt and Spragg deny the charges against them. The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

This could be exacerbated in the near future, the defence experts have warned, with the UK over-dependent on imports.Other industries will also be affected by ecosystem collapse in places such as the Amazon and by the worsening impacts of extreme weather around the world. These impacts will not be encountered far off in the future as some had complacently assumed, ministers have been told, but are already being felt and will grow in significance as temperatures rise beyond 1.5C above preindustrial levels.The hard-hitting report was to be published on Thursday at a landmark event in London. But the Guardian understands that the report, prepared by experts over many months, has been halted.One source told the Guardian they feared it was being suppressed because the government was unwilling to face the issues raised. Overseas aid, formally known as official development assistance (ODA), which could help to stabilise countries most at risk from the climate crisis and avoid some of the impacts warned about,has been slashed.“This is a very stark warning,” another source familiar with the contents told the Guardian. “It is very clear that the impacts on national security are very worrying.”Food is thebiggest riskas the UK imports an increasing proportion of its food from overseas, some of it coming from areas known to be at risk of climate disaster and ecosystem collapse. The clothing and fashion industry is alsoalready feeling the strainas many fabrics come from areas at risk.Migration from countries worst affected by theclimate and biodiversity criseswill also have an impact on society and the economy. Some of thecountries worst affectedare likely to see governments fall and the rise of social disorder, leading to political instability that in turn will have an impact on the UK’s security.Defence chiefs have been warning about the climate crisis for two decades, and the UK was the first country to force a discussion of the issue at the UN security council in 2007. But little has been done since to address the impacts of climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse on national security.Defence experts have grownincreasingly concerned at the lack of action, and some have called forclimate finance to be considered part of national security spending.The UN’s Cop30 climate summit, to be held next month in Brazil, is likely to show that most nations are well behind on targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions drastically, in order to prevent global temperatures exceeding 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Prime minister Keir Starmer was expected to go to Cop30, where the UK can boast about some of the world’s mostambitious targets and solid achievements in cutting emissions. But the Guardian understands thatsome of his advisers want him to stay at home, fearing that the Reform Party will attack him for going.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Illegal miners use dredges – floating machines that chew up and spit out riverbeds – leaving the toxic mercury used to extract gold from sediment in their wake.Ultra-high resolution aerial images allowed MAAP, part of AmazonConservation, to identify dredges alongside deforestation for the first time, enabling them to identify goldminers and revealing that the environmental crisis once confined to the south of the country was creeping north.View image in fullscreenThe Amazon Rainforest in Peru.Photograph: mariusz_prusaczyk/Getty Images/iStockphoto“We used to only see it in the Madre de Dios region but now we’re seeing it everywhere”, said MAAP’s director, Matt Finer.Theprice of gold topped $4,000for the first time this week on the international markets as global anxiety increased about financial fragility. Indigenous groups have sounded the alarm that as the price of soars, armed groups were increasingly tearing down their forests and poisoning their rivers in pursuit of the precious metal.MAAP’s aerial imagesshow that once dense swathes of green jungle are being transformed into lifeless moonscapes of grey earth pocked with stagnant pools of green water.Bullion bonanza: why is gold hitting record highs?Read more“This little square is just a tiny sample,” Finer says, pointing to a small section of the vast red patchwork of deforestation mapped in the report. “Imagine this multiplied to 140,000 hectares.”The mercury residues build up in fish and pass to the people who eat them, leading to neurological and developmental problems such as birth defects and learning difficulties.A recentstudy of riverside communities in Peru’s northernmost region of Loreto found the median level of mercury was nearly four times the World Health Organization’s recommended limit.MAAP’s analysis found that 225 rivers and streams have been affected, with 989 dredges spotted in Loreto since 2017 – including 275 this year alone on the Nanay River, a tributary of the Amazon that is the lifeblood of ecosystems anddozens of Indigenous communities.“They are poisoning our rivers – it’s the water that we drink,” said Roberto Tafur Shupingahua, a representative of several riverside communities in Loreto.View image in fullscreenA miner in Peru extracts gold using mercury.Photograph: Nacho Doce/ReutersShupingahua said local communities began blocking miners from advancing up the River Tigre in Loreto 40 days ago, leading to gunfights with armed intruders. “We have no choice but to fight back but we are alone. The state is nowhere to be seen,” he said, his voice raising in anger.Mining remains concentrated in the Madre de Dios region in southern Peru but new hotspots are emerging farther north in Loreto, Amazonas, Huánuco, Pasco and Ucayali.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

These included Banggai cardinalfish, clarion angelfish and azure damselfish.International trade in endangered species is regulated under the Cites convention, an agreement designed to ensure that trade in wild animals and plants does not harm their survival.“But many threatened species slip through global trade rules or aren’t even listed as traded in authoritative databases, and still end up on the market,” Lin said.For species already imperilled in the wild, unsustainable or unnecessary trade could make things worse, he said.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ivy ShihLin said many common aquarium species – including wrasses, clownfish and gobies – were usually collected from tropical reefs, and could be an important source of income for local communities. Greater support for well-managed wild fisheries could ensure that biodiversity was protected while retaining economic opportunities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prosecution in the case at Preston crown court alleges that they are Islamic extremists with a “visceral dislike” of Jewish people.The pair are alleged to have “arranged for the purchase and delivery of firearms, conducted reconnaissance and made plans of attack” on a mass gathering, before the plot was foiled by an “undercover operative” who they thought was a fellow extremist.Harpreet Sandhu KC, prosecuting, alleged the pair had “identified areas in Greater Manchester with a large Jewish population to attack”.The judge Mr Justice Wall said the trial was “coincidental” to last week’s attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester, and that it was “no part of the prosecution’s case” that the defendants had anything to do with it.Opening the prosecution case on Wednesday, Sandhu showed footage that allegedly featured Saadaoui standing by the open boot of a car in a hotel car park in Bolton, Greater Manchester, before he ran away from approaching counter-terrorism police officers.Sandhu said: “In the car he ran away from were two assault rifles, a semi-automatic pistol and almost 200 rounds of ammunition.”He said the defendant was awaiting delivery of two more assault rifles, another pistol and at least 700 more rounds of ammunition.“Those firearms are fierce weapons,” he said. “The assault rifles are capable of firing several hundred rounds of ammunition per minute. They are the type of firearms used in many terrorist attacks, including attacks in Paris in 2015 when approximately 130 people were killed and hundreds of people were injured.”A third defendant, Walid’s brother Bilel Saadaoui, 36, is also on trial over an allegation he failed to disclose information about acts of terrorism on the same dates.Walid Saadaoui, of Abram, Wigan, Bilel Saadaoui, of Hindley, Wigan, and Hussein, of no fixed abode, deny the allegations.Sandhu said: “Walid Saadaoui was about to receive those firearms and that ammunition because he and Amar Hussein were planning terrorist attacks. In particular, they planned to kill as many members of the Jewish community as they could, especially those in the north-west of England. In addition, they intended to kill any law enforcement or police officers who got in their way.”The trial is scheduled to last 12 weeks.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump and big pharma. Just one more way he’s menacing Britain | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe Liberal Democrats immediately criticised the move, first reported by Politico, asking how much it would cost and whether it would lead to cuts elsewhere in theNHS.The science secretary, Patrick Vallance, haspublicly acknowledgedthat the UK’s spending on new medicines needs to rise from 9% of overall NHS spend, which is below drug spending in the US and many other European countries.The main element of the plan is thought to include raising the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) cost-effectiveness threshold by 25%, which has been unchanged since 1999. Under current rules,Nice considers a medicine costing between £20,000 and £30,000for every extra year of good-quality life it provides a patient to represent good value for money for the NHS.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry on Tuesdayreiterated its callfor “urgent action” on drug pricing, saying the Nice threshold should be increased as soon as possible in line with inflation to between £40,000 and £50,000, and index-linked thereafter. Making this change would, over time, lead to a greater share of the NHS budget being allocated to medicines, and additional funding would be needed to support this.In talks over the summer, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, proposed a deal that would save the pharmaceutical industry £1bn over three years, with billions more promised over the coming decade.But the industry argued that it was forecast to make repayments totalling £13.5bn over the same period and has been demanding about £2.5bn a year extra.A government source said ministers were prepared to spend more on medicines as they increasingly became more ​innovative and preventive. They cited the example of weight loss injections – which are forecast to save the NHS billions of pounds in treating obesity and associated health problems – and trials for cancer-preventing vaccines.The patient-led campaign group Just Treatment called it “deeply troubling news for patients and the NHS”, adding: “We are at risk of importing America’s disastrous drug pricing crisis.” It called on the government to “take steps to establish a system for developing and manufacturing medicines that puts patients first”.TheNHS spent £20.6bn on medicinesand medical devices in 2023-24, up from £19.2bn the year before.Trump has put pressure on pharma companies to lower their drug prices in the US and increase them elsewhere, accusing other countries of “freeloading” on high US prices. Nearly two weeks ago, he threatened to impose100% tariffs on pharmaceutical imports from 1 Octoberto ramp up the pressure, although these did not materialise.In response to pressure from Trump, Pfizer and several other US and European companies, including the UK’s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, have started to cut their prices in the US and to sell directly to patients to cut out costly middlemen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They should also lay their plans before parliament without delay so they can be properly scrutinised. It increasingly feels like this government puts the whims of Trump before everything else – even our precious NHS.”The pharma sector’snegotiations with the UK government over drug pricing under a voluntary scheme broke downwithout an agreement in late August. Since then, MSD has abandoned plans for a £1bn research centre in London and AstraZeneca and New York-based Eli Lilly have paused projects, taking total pharmainvestments that are on hold or cancelled to nearly £2bnsince the start of this year.One industry source said: “We are relieved to see a recognisable change in sentiment and language from August.”Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryNHSTrump administrationHealthUS politicsDrugsTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

He had been subject to a drink-driving ban following a fourth drink-driving conviction over a three-year period.”Longhorn said that on the evening of 19 January 2024, CCTV footage captured James returning to the marina shortly before midnight after spending the evening at the Blue Anchor pub.She said: “He can be seen to walk unsteadily towards the pontoon on which his boat is docked before falling over a railing. He is then seen to stand up and stumble over to another pontoon before vanishing.“I find it likely when he fell over the railing, James hit his head on the pontoon, causing a head injury before he attempted to make his way back to his boat and fell into the water.” His body was found in the marina next morning.In a statement, James’s wife, Margaret Monahan, said she met him while she was working as a teacher at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, where he was being held. She later visited him at a prison in Nottinghamshire. They fell in love and married.After his release, they lived in East Sussex and north Wales. James bought a boat called Faithful, which was berthed at Brixham.Monahan said James’s mother died in a car accident when he was seven. She said his father was a drinker and James left home when he was 10. He began stealing sweets and fruit, and was taken into care. His offending escalated and in 1982 he and another man carried out two robberies in which two men were killed.James then left the UK and joined the Foreign Legion. Monahan said his father had convinced James to return and he was jailed for the murders.In prison James used his time productively, the inquest heard. He studied and wrote a column for the Guardian, reading his words over the phone to a copytaker. After being released, he spoke to schools and went back into prison to talk to inmates serving life sentences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Talks would be difficult, he said, but “the prospect of a dissolution [of parliament] is fading”.Lecornu, who resigned on Monday after 27 days in office but was given 48 hours by the French president to try to rally support for a new government, presented his conclusions to Macron at the Élysée Palace earlier on Wednesday.Macron was re-elected for a five-year term in 2022, but since snap parliamentary elections last summer, a hung parliament has ousted two successive prime ministers who failed to find a majority for austerity budget plans, plunging France into one of its deepest political crises since the foundation of the Fifth Republic in 1958.Lecornu became the third to go when he tendered his government’s resignation just 14 hours after his new cabinet had been announced, saying opposition to the lineup from allies and opponents alike would make it impossible for him to do the job.The Guardian view on political chaos in France: the gift that keeps on giving to Marine Le Pen and the far right | EditorialRead moreHe said earlier on Wednesday that reducing France’s ballooning budget deficit – projected to exceed 5.5% of GDP this year, almost twice the EU’s permitted limit – was “vital, including for France’s image abroad and for our capacity to borrow”.Lecornu said he was “quite optimistic” progress could be made. “We’re only missing the final metre,” he said, calling on the parties to show a “capacity for compromise” and suggesting that a non-political technocratic government could be a way forward.The former defence minister, who met leftwing parties including the Socialist party (PS), Greens and Communists on Wednesday, told France 2 that every political group he had talked to except the far right and radical left had “told me that it would be too dangerous not to have a budget by the end of this year”.Lecornu said he was “not running after the job” of prime minister and it would be “up to the president” to decide whether his successor should come from the moderate left, which has repeatedly said any government headed by a Macron ally would be doomed to fall.He had appeared to offer a possible olive branch to the PS and moderate left on Tuesday by suggesting Macron’s unpopular pension changes, pushed through in 2023, may be “suspended”, partly meeting the left’s demands that they be scrapped.However, the leader of the PS, Olivier Faure, said after meeting Lecornu on Wednesday he had “not received any guarantees” that the reform, which raised France’s retirement age from 62 to 64, would indeed be suspended.Lecornu told France 2 that the question was “a real blocking point” and “one of the most difficult” to resolve. It would be “up to the president” to make the final decision, he said.If the PS and moderate left can be won over, a left-led cabinet backed by Macron’s centrist allies and centre-right MPs could be an option, but it would be fragile – and is not guaranteed the support of the centre-right, for whom changing the pension system is sacrosanct.The Greens leader, Marine Tondelier, whose party is allied with the PS, said after meeting Lecornu that France had “never been closer” to getting a new leftwing prime minister, adding that another appointee from Macron’s camp “wouldn’t last a minute”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a need for transparency and clarity for the consumer and recognition for the work of our farmers.”She argues the proposal is in line with EU rules that already ban the use of terms such as“milk” and “yoghurt”for non-dairy products.The European parliament rejected a ban on meaty names for plant-based productsin 2020, but the 2024 elections shifted the parliament to the right, bringing in more lawmakers who seek close ties with farmers.Opposition was led by Green MEPs, who decried what they saw as a populist move to rename plant-based foods. “Veggie burgers, seitan schnitzel and tofu sausage do not confuse consumers, only rightwing politicians,” Thomas Waitz, an Austrian Green MEP, said after the vote. “This tactic is a diversion and a pathetic smokescreen. No farmer will earn more money or secure their future with this ban.”Even Imart’s centre-right European People’s party (EPP) is divided on the issue. The EPP’s group leader, Manfred Weber, said before the vote that the issue was not a priority for him and lawmakers had more important things to deal with. “Consumers are not stupid when they go to the supermarkets and buy their products,” he said.The proposal is opposed by leading German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, which fear that banning familiar terms would make it “more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions”.Germany is the largest market for plant-based products and these businesses fear they would be particularly affected by any move to change the names of plant-based foods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Theoriginal French decreeintroduced a ban on 21 terms used by butchers, including “ham”, “filet” and “prime rib”.Consumer groups say the measure has little support among shoppers. A 2020 survey of 11 EU member states by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) found that most were not concerned about the use of meat-related names as long as a product was clearly labelled as vegetarian or vegan.Irina Popescu, a food policy officer at the BEUC, said the vote was disappointing and made little sense. “Almost 70% of consumers understand these names as long as products are clearly labelled vegan or vegetarian. Policymakers should focus on making packaging clear and understandable with trustworthy labels,” she said.The Austrian MEP Anna Stürgkh, a member of the centrist Renew group, said consumers were unlikely to be misled. “A beef tomato doesn’t contain any beef … Ladies’ fingers are not made of actual ladies’ fingers. Let’s trust consumers and stop this hotdog populism,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionFood & drink industryEuropeVegetarian food and drinkFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Six people, including two nine-year-old children and two teenagers, were shot, according to the Kingston Central police superintendent Beresford Williams.It was later reported that one of the teenagers died on Wednesday morning.A separate shooting occurred on Sunday north-west of the capital, when five people, including a four-year-old, were killed just outside the town of Linstead in St Catherine parish.Murders in Jamaica drop but activists alarmed at rise in fatal police shootingsRead morePolice have not said what motivated the killings.Andrew Holness, the Jamaican prime minister, who visited victims’ families in Linstead, described the attack as “criminal terrorism” that was “designed to bring on the people of the community the highest level of fear”.“And so my presence here as well is to highlight that we must also focus on the victims: the three children who are left behind by the murder of an innocent mother; the father who was just crying a while ago, [that] his son didn’t get to give him a grandson; the grandmother who was crying in her room,” he told the grieving community.Condemning the “tragic, senseless killing”, the police commissioner, Kevin Blake, appealed to the community to support the police in bringing the perpetrators to justice. “It is time that we as a people exercise intolerance of this type of senseless behavior, we do not need to give them shelter. These guys are somewhere, somewhere being sheltered by someone,” he said, adding that the Jamaica constabulary force would leave no stone unturned to ensure that the perpetrators were brought to justice.A curfew was imposed in Linstead from 6pm on Monday and will continue until 6pm on Wednesday.The island of 2.8 million people reported 522 killings as of 4 October, a 41% drop compared with 883 killings reported in the same period last year, according to police statistics.Holness warned that “though we are making progress”, the mission to create a peaceful Jamaica “is not complete”.He added: “We’re still on a good track. And we can do even better if every Jamaican were to agree that the criminals must be dealt with. They must be brought to justice. We will not protect them.”Much of the violence in Jamaica and elsewhere in theCaribbeanis blamed on guns illegally smuggled from the US.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsJamaicaAmericasCaribbeanGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

I want to say to victims to never be ashamed of what was imposed on them, because they’re never responsible.”Pelicot, 72, became an internationalfeminist heroafter she waived her right to anonymity in last year’s rape and sexual assault trial of 51 men. Her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot,one of the worst sex offenders in modern French history, was found guilty of crushing sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her food and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her while she was unconscious in their bedroom in the Provence village of Mazan between 2011 and 2020.The50 other menon trial alongside him were also found guilty. One of them, Husamettin Dogan, 44, a married father who was sentenced to nine years in prison, has appealed against his conviction for rape. He is being retried at the court of appeal in the southern French city of Nîmes.The court on Wednesday was shown video evidence of what police investigators said was Dogan raping Pelicot several times when she was unconscious in her bedroom. The head judge said Pelicot had been at risk of suffocating. Dogan was shown smiling in the videos.Despite Pelicot snoring loudly and appearing in a comatose state, Dogan said the videos showed “sex scenes” and denied it was rape. He said what he did was “a sexual act”, not rape. He told the court: “I never raped.”Pelicot said of the video evidence: “This is not a sex scene, it is rape. And without a condom.” She said having to watch this video evidence during the investigation meant “these scenes are imprinted into my memory for ever, and I’m trying to rebuild myself”.She said she had never met Dogan, and never given consent.She said: “I’m trying to understand how this individual has never accepted that he raped Madame Pelicot. I would have thought that in one year, he would have reflected on it and not been in denial.”Pelicot said that, while she was unable to make herself watch the 13 pieces of video evidence, Dogan had watched intently. She said: “I saw him enjoy [watching the videos]. He didn’t lower his eyes for one moment.”Turning to him, she said: “You haven’t understood. When are you going to recognise you raped me? It’s a crime to rape an unconscious woman. When did I ever give you consent? Never.”The court had heard that Dogan had told police investigators in one of his interviews that Pelicot had looked “dead” when he arrived in her bedroom. Pelicot said to him: “You say you left quickly. Well, I would have left quickly before raping. I’m ashamed for you because I put myself in the place of the victim.”Dogan had told the court that he felt he himself was a victim because Dominique Pelicot had “manipulated” him.Gisèle Pelicotsaid: “You say you’re a victim. The only victim in his room is me … I’m ashamed for you.”Testifying to the trial earlier this week, Dominique Pelicot told the court he would seek men on a chatroom called “without her knowledge” and tell them by phone: “I’m looking for someone to abuse my wife after I’ve put her to sleep without her knowledge.”On Wednesday, Pelicot told the court she had had no idea that for almost a decade her husband was drugging her and inviting strangers to rape her. She said she had been drugged into a “state of general anaesthetia”. For years she suffered constant memory lapses that she feared were the start of Alzheimers. She consulted neurologists but her husband always went to the appointments with her. No doctors thought of investigating whether she was being drugged.Pelicot said she now lived with the lifelong consequences of four sexually transmitted diseases from the years of rape, which require constant treatment and monitoring. She told the court that recently doctors found “an anomaly”, conducted a biopsy and she was waiting for results to find out if she needed surgery.Pelicot told the court: “When these individuals came into my room, they saw this woman who was inert. They said they thought I was pretending, but at what point did they ask me if I was OK with it or not? At no point did they ask my consent. Never did I give my consent. They are totally responsible for their acts.”When Dogan’s defence lawyer, Jean-Marc Darrigade, told Pelicot she was an icon, she said: “Stop saying I’m an icon. I’m an ordinary woman who lifted her anonymity in a trial. I’m not an icon.” She said the defence’s line of questioning about whether she had consented to naked photos or films in her married life was “absurd”. She said “It’s always for the victims to justify themselves.”Pelicot said the revelation of the crimes, after police searched Dominique Pelicot’s phones when he was caught filming up women’s skirt in a supermarket in 2020, had been “a tsunami, an explosion” for the whole family.She praised and thanked her daughter,Caroline Darian, for creating an organisation that now raises awareness on drug-assisted rape and gives victims support. Darian believes she was sedated and sexually assaulted or raped by her father over a period of potentially 10 years between 2010 and 2020, when she was in her 30s.Pelicot said: “It’s much harder for my daughter and I hear that and understand it. She’s in doubt and has never had answers … I know she has filed a legal complaint. I hope she’ll have the answers I couldn’t give her.”Pelicot said she hoped the family, which she said had always been very close, could overcome the ordeal.The verdict is expected on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotFranceGisèle Pelicot rape trialEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Banks appear to be on the hook for significantly less compensation than had originally been indicated.What is the latest on this?On Tuesday the City regulator publishedits long-awaited proposalsfor an industry-wide scheme to compensate millions of people who were treated unfairly when they took out motor finance to buy a new or secondhand car.This is to do with the alleged mass mis-selling of car loans – a scandal that involved “secret” commission payments by lenders to car dealers, and millions of car buyers unknowingly paying more for their finance than they should have.The proposed scheme would cover motor finance agreements taken out between 6 April 2007 and 1 November 2024 where commission was paid by the lender to whoever sold the loan – usually the car dealer.The FCA said it estimated that 14.2m loan agreements – 44% of all those made since 2007 – would be considered unfair and therefore due compensation.However, that probably does not translate into 14.2 million people getting a payout, as some motorists bought several cars in the period and could therefore be eligible for multiple payouts totalling thousands of pounds.The vast majority of new cars and an increasing number of used vehicles are bought with motor finance, typically either a personal contract purchase plan or a hire purchase agreement.Final point: this is a consultation exercise, so some (or a lot) of this could change.Who is in line for compensation?The scheme the regulator is consulting on will largely focus on people whose deal included a “discretionary commission arrangement” (DCA), a particularly controversial type of car financebanned in 2021.With , lenders gave dealers the power to set the interest rates, with dealers getting more commission the higher the rate. This allegedly gave dealers an incentive to overcharge customers. It is the lenders – typically banks – who are on the hook for the compensation. The FCA estimates that 11.4m such loans are likely to be eligible for a payout.However, there are also two other main types of case. The second-biggest category – accounting for 3.2m loan agreements that are likely to be in line for compensation – is where there was an arrangement between the lender and the dealer that gave the lender exclusivity or first refusal when it came to providing credit, which was not properly disclosed.The third type – accounting for 2.9m eligible cases – involves unfairly high commission (where the commission was at least 35% of the total cost of the credit and 10% of the amount borrowed) that was not properly disclosed.Some of the loan agreements will fall into more than one category, which is why adding up those three figures comes to more than 14.2m.How much money might I get?The FCAsaid in Augustthat it estimated “most individuals will probably receive less than £950 in compensation per agreement”. Now it expects eligible consumers to receive an average of about £700 an agreement, with many receiving more than that “and a large number receiving less”.FCA documents suggest that for DCAs, the mean proposed payout (the arithmetical average) would be £665, while the median figure (the middle value in a dataset) would be £517.For the second category named above, the figures are £686 and £526, and for the third they are quite a bit higher: £1,108 and £960.On average, people’s payouts will be boosted by 2% of interest.The regulator said this was a complex issue and “not everyone will get everything they would like”.When might I get my money and how?Some people could get their payout as early next year; for others it will probably be later in 2026. Payouts will depend on whether people have complained already and how prepared their lender is.It is estimated there have already been more than 4m complaints lodged with firms, though many have been “paused” since 2024.The FCA said that when the scheme goes live, “we expect firms to resolve promptly those complaints they already have – so customers who have already complained are likely to have their case dealt with sooner”.The scheme will be free to access for consumers. It is proposed that those who have already complained will be included unless they opt out. Those who have not yet complained, or have had their complaint rejected by their firm but not taken it to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), will be asked to opt in.Lenders will need to contact people who have already complained within three months of the scheme starting. Those who have not already complained would be contacted within six months.Those motor finance customers who do not receive a letter, for example, because the company no longer has their details and cannot trace them, will have a year from the scheme starting to make a claim to their lender.People who have already been compensated would be excluded. Meanwhile, those who have a live complaint with the FOS will have their case resolved by the FOS and not through the scheme.“If consumers don’t know who their lender was, there’s information on how to check on the FCA website,” said the regulator, which will run an ad campaign to raise awareness.Should I use a claims firm? What if I’ve signed up with one already?Those who choose to use a claims management company (CMC) or law firm could lose a significant amount of any compensation owed, said the FCA.“There’s no need as people cansubmit their own complaintusing atemplate letteron the FCA’s website,” it added.If you signed up with a claims firms and now want to opt out and use the official scheme to seek a payout, you may face an “exit fee” – but UK regulators this week revealed they areclamping down on “bad practice”in this area. For example, two FCA-regulated CMCs have agreed to change their exit-fee policies.What happens now?If you have not complained and you think you are affected, you should probably do so now,say consumer experts.The FCA’s consultation on its proposed compensation scheme closes on 18 November. It expects to publish the final rules “by early 2026”. The scheme would launch at the same time, with consumers starting to receive their money over the subsequent weeks and months.Explore more on these topicsMotor financeMotoringConsumer rightsConsumer affairsFinancial Conduct AuthorityFinancial sectorBankingexplainersShareReuse this content"

He told the Guardian: “We were the first global tour operator to adopt a science-based target through the SBTi and now we’re owning the fact that it’s not working for us. We’ve always been real and transparent, which is how we build trust.”He said the fund and a new target to cut the “carbon intensity” of each trip had been developed by climate scientists and would be verified by independent auditors.Part of that attempt would be to reduce the number of long-haul flights taken by customers, Thornton said, by prioritising domestic and short-haul trips, and offering more flight-free itineraries and walking or trekking tours.Environmental campaigners have long dismissed offsets and focused on cutting flying.Doug Parr, the Greenpeace UK chief scientist, said offsetting schemes had allowed “airlines and other big polluters to falsely claim green credentials while continuing to pump out emissions”.He said Greenpeace backed a frequent flyer levy, with a first flight each year tax-free to avoid taxing an annual family holiday but rising steeply with subsequent flights to deter “the binge flyers who are the main engine of growth for UK flights”.Thornton said he had seen “first-hand how important meaningful climate action is to our founders and owners, who see it as part of their legacy”, but added: “We need to be honest with ourselves that travel is not sustainable in its current format and anything suggesting otherwise is greenwashing.”Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The plan also includes a voucher worth about 600 miles for use at public chargers.Ovo says the changes are a “new, easy way of paying”, but customers who drive fewer than 700 miles a month claim they will be left with larger bills. The monthly allowance cannot be carried over and the vouchers are not valid for all public charging providers.To qualify for the deal, drivers must be an Ovo customer, have a compatible EV charger and a smart meter.EV owner Chris Goddard was informed of the changes a week after switching his energy supply to Ovo to make use of the Charge Anytime deal. “It’s an insult,” he said. “One of the things that persuaded me to buy an electric car last month was Ovo’s charging rates. The cheapest monthly payment plan will work out at more than a 100% rise for some.”Customers onOvo’s forumsaid the company had “lost the plot” and accused it of misleading them with an email announcing “a great opportunity”. The monthly plans are priced according to average miles rather than kilowatt hours, unlike the current tariff, making it difficult for drivers to compare the costs.A range of energy providers offer pay-as-you-go charging deals for less than 9p a kWh, but the cheap rate only applies to night charging during specified hours.Consumer campaigners are concerned the new tariff will disadvantage drivers with low monthly mileage at a time when the government is seeking to encourage more households to shift to electric vehicles.“Any increase in electricity rates is unwelcome news, particularly at a time when energy prices remain staggeringly high,” said Andrew Capstick, utilities editor at MoneySavingExpert.com.“Ovo’s Charge Anytime tariff was one of only a very few that let you charge your vehicle for cheap at home at any time of the day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Part of the competition involved visiting places where violence had happened. “If we don’t reclaim them,” she said, “it’s like we don’t exist”’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 8 Oct 2025 10.08 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 12.48 EDTShareIhave always been interested in gender and identity stories. InSouth Africa, we have a strong liberal constitution on paper for queer rights, but the reality on the streets – the hate crimes, the animosity in the workplace and in social settings – is very different. I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. That led me to the drag pageant scene.I would go to photograph pageants every weekend, and every Monday I would get messages from the people I’d photographed asking me to send the pictures – so I had a lot of instant feedback on the work I was making. I was using harsh lighting to play with the idea of masculine and feminine, to emphasise the contrast between the strong jawlines and the feminine personae. But there’s no one more honest than a drag queen, and very early on, someone told me they really didn’t like the picture I’d taken of them.It was hard to hear, but letting go of my ego I asked this person why. They said it was because they didn’t look beautiful. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. I changed my approach. And if I hadn’t had that knock to my ego, the work wouldn’t have become what it needed to be.We met at a petrol station. We moved quickly and didn't lingerOver the next year and a half, making the work became a conversation with the drag queens. I put it out there that I wanted to do a collaborative project. Belinda, who is in this image, came to me and told me she was applying for the Miss Drag South Africa pageant; part of the competition involves doing a project. The idea was to work with other drag artists and visit places where acts of violence had happened, and to reclaim these places. I told Belinda to think about who should tell this story – I wanted her to consider carefully if I was the right person. Two weeks later, she came back and said she wanted to work with me.I was concerned for the drag queens’ safety, not only while going to these sites of violence and making the images but also after, as some of them lived in the townships where the portraits would be made. I sat with it for a while. But one thing Belinda said stuck with me. She said: “If we don’t go, if we don’t reclaim these spaces and make these pictures, then it’s like we don’t exist.”The entire series was shot in four hours. We met at a petrol station on the day, so the drag queens could get ready – everyone had specific ideas about what they wanted to wear. We moved quickly and didn’t linger. I was definitely nervous – it made me realise how these people feel every day, you can never fully relax.I photographed Belinda at theshisanyama– a community space where women cook and sell meat – in Khayelitsha, a township located on the Cape Flats, near Cape Town. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was the end of the day and the light was really good – everything came together, with the lady in the background staring. If you look carefully, you can see my shadow – I love that I’m a part of it, that always makes me smile. Belinda has such a regal, enigmatic presence. There’s something about her – I hope it comes across in the image.Afterwards we organised a show at a community hall in Khayelitsha. It was a small gathering but people were really engaged, and came to ask questions, and the artists shared about themselves. It’s amazing to have global exposure for the issues we care about, but none of that is as valuable as showing the work in the space it was created.Lee-Ann Olwage’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lee-Ann OlwageBorn:Durban, 1986Trained:“I’m a self-trained photographer but studied film directing at AFDA film school in Cape Town.”Influences:“My peers, life, the stories I work on, and other forms of storytelling: painting, music, weaving, textile art.”High point:“Winning theWorld Press Photo award in 2020.

Despite this, Perry is still a much-loved star in many camps, with her own brand of kooky iconography adopted by her fans tonight –like J-Lo at the 2019 Met Gala, I also run into a woman dressed up as a burger in the venue toilets. The tour is not the disaster that some have reported, but it does suffer from Perry not allowing herself to have as much fun as her audience are having.The show starts with a video setting up a convoluted storyline: a video game about Perry trying to save the world by rescuing stolen butterflies from AI overlords. This good v evil story would be more effective if Perry’s visuals didn’t share such an AI-style aesthetic. After a stilted start with 143 single Artificial, Perry settles into the show with 2013 single Dark Horse. Its high drama is an early highlight, with Perry shouting “I’m a Scorpio bitch!” over its deep womp-womp beats.It’s clear that Perry is most at ease when she lets the hits speak for themselves, but too often we’re distracted by the frankly excessive visuals and staging. During the maligned singleWoman’s World– which is much more fun and silly in a live setting – she’s surrounded by hunks draping themselves over scaffolding, but plays second fiddle to a blow-up statue that takes the attention away from her entrance. She’s almost constantly doing far too much: hanging off props, spinning upside down, and wearing a glove that shoots fireworks.View image in fullscreenDystopian narrative … Perry battles her foes.Photograph: Martin Grimes/Getty ImagesShe loosens up for a run of California Gurls, Teenage Dream and Hot N Cold, proving she doesn’t need a theme park’s worth of apparatus and fireworks when she has an intimidating imperial phase to fall back on. This infectious attitude infuses 143 tracks Crush and Nirvana, but the momentum is cut short for another costume change, another convoluted video, some more extraneous dystopian narrative. During Part of Me and Rise she battles dancers with shields, and her projected image has an overlaid target – the defiant multimillionaire against her feeble critics – yet when she breaks away to sing alone, she displays more energy and charisma than she has had all night. She’s at her most natural playing The One That Got Away in a cute Josie and the Pussycats-esque setup with her keyboardist and guitarist, chatting in a chaotic but charming way to fans and getting a few up on stage.This quiet(er) moment aside, watching the show is akin to being an overstimulated, sugar-loaded child. It’s not surprising that a large percentage of the audience are young children, brought along by millennial parents who grew up with Perry’s music. Her candy-coloured nudge-wink aesthetic does adapt well to children’s entertainment – if only she had the confidence in the strength of her best material to allow it to speak for itself, then Lifetimes could be better enjoyed by people of all ages and attention spans.Katy Perryplays AO Arena, Manchester, on 8 October; Utilita Arena, Sheffield, on 10 October; Utilita Arena, Birmingham, on 11 October; and the O2, London, on 13 and 14 OctoberExplore more on these topicsKaty PerryPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The 88-year-old Pulitzer-winning journalist has an impressive résumé. It was Hersh who broke the story, in 1969, of the horrific US army massacre of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai, invigorating the US anti-war movement; 35 years later, his reports for the New Yorker revealed thegruesome extent of US military tortureat Abu Ghraib.It’s also not hard to see why it took Hersh a full two decades to agree to make Cover-Up, Poitras’s new documentary, co-directed with Mark Obenhaus, on Hersh’s six-plus decades digging up the stories buried by those in power. An old-school reporter who has courted controversy for his extensive use of anonymous sources, Hersh is a prickly and resistant subject, reluctant to relive the past yet eager to excoriate abuses of power with a torrent of reporting.Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere review – solid biopic both embraces and avoids clicheRead moreBut he makes a wry, undaunted and absolutely scathing guide through 60-plus years of US government abuses, from indiscriminate killing in Vietnam to underwriting Israel’s massacre of civilians in Gaza. As inAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed, Poitras’s outstanding 2022 film on artist Nan Goldin’s efforts to remove the Sackler name from the prestigious art galleries that managed to weave together the opioid crisis, Aids activism and personal history into a singular narrative, Cover-Up demonstrates Poitras’s genius for structure. The 117-minute film, which premiered at the Venice film festival, proceeds chronologically through Hersh’s most significant scoops and scattershot through his personal life, masterfully integrating his tart personal accounts with over half a century of shameful US history.Cover-Up smartly spends large sections enmeshed not just in Hersh’s process of reporting, but the reporting itself. It often plays, to its benefit, like a straightforward history documentary, relying on sharply edited and restored archival footage to evoke and educate on some of the US government’s most ignominious recent chapters. Among them: My Lai, in which US soldiers raped and murdered hundreds of Vietnamese civilians, including infants; the CIA’s illegal surveillance of the US student movement against the war in Vietnam; the CIA’s illicit and ultimately failed attempts to breed their own Manchurian candidate via LSD; covert US involvement in the installment of the fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet in Chile; the slow-motion executive car crash that was Watergate.All the while there’s Hersh, a consistent gadfly to the people in power, be they US presidents or executives of Gulf+Western orNew York Timeseditors with a direct line to Henry Kissinger, feeding “official source” information to the daily pages like the Kris Jenner of foreign policy. (As Richard Nixon described Hersh in a call to Kissinger: “This son of a bitch is a son of a bitch, but he’s usually right, isn’t he?”) Restless, kinetic, energized by the word no, he’s quick to recite the facts and loath to put himself in the story. “In case anyone cares, this is less and less fun,” he says in what appears to be two sit-down interviews at his home office, surrounded by mountains of faded yellow legal pads. Soon after, fearing leaks of his anonymous sources, he (temporarily) quits the project entirely. Poitras coaxes out details of his upbringing – born to Jewish refugees from Lithuania and Poland, raised in an “unthinking” family on the south side of Chicago, expected to take over his father’s dry cleaning shop – like pulled teeth.That ironically makes for a pleasurable viewing experience, despite the utter atrocities at hand, though it does leave some trickier aspects of his career unexplored. The bulk of Hersh’s career post-New York Times, in the 80s and 90s, go unmentioned, other than brief clips on the controversies surrounding some of his 11 books. Hersh, who now has a Substack newsletter (retirement seems like a foreign concept) is quick to admit when he was wrong, but the film is light on context. At one point, he acknowledges underestimating the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s cruelty, but the film barely lingers on why that merits a mention (for years, Hersh maintained that the regime’s sarin gas attacks on civilians were misattributed).But whether inaccurate or, mostly, scarily accurate, Hersh’s dogged pursuit of truth serves to underscore the film’s point, framed by man’s prolific ability to rationalize evil, to metabolize or celebrate or numb to unimaginable violence. In the past: a map of My Lai annotated by a US soldier – “observed approx 50 bodies” next to “ate lunch”. In the present: Hersh on the phone with a source in Gaza, poring over photographs of Israeli military plans on destroyed homes in Gaza, showing they know exactly where civilians are before they bomb them. Cover-Up adeptly illustrates the patterns of official cruelty: deny, downplay, quibble, destroy. Justify on the grounds of “national security”. Repeat. “We’re a culture of enormous violence,” Hersh remarks. “You can’t just have a country who does that and looks the other way.” Brisk, lucid and sweeping, Cover-Up assures that some, at least, will not.Cover-Up is screening at the New York film festival and will be released on Netflix at a later dateExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsFirst look reviewLaura PoitrasNew York TimesNewspapersVietnam warreviewsShareReuse this content"

George Lucas really missed a trickStuart HeritageWed 8 Oct 2025 06.43 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 12.05 EDTShareTheStar Warsprequels were not particularly enjoyable to sit through. All the matinee adventure serial action of the first three films were gone, replaced by long scenes about impenetrable galactic taxation systems, as performed by characters that seemed to have been designed purely for their potential to sell toys.So bad were the prequels in fact, that realistically there is only one thing that could have possibly improved them. Of course, I am talking about the sight of Ray Winstone tearing around the set in a silly costume, drunk off his face. Only now do we understand how close this came to be.Talking to Far Outrecently, Winstone revealed that he auditioned for the part of Ruwee Naberrie, the father of Padmé Amidala, inStar Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. And he would have got it, too, except for the fact that he turned up a little worse for wear. Or, as Winstone puts it, he was “pissed” and things “didn’t go well”.In Winstone’s telling of the story, he rocked up to the audition having been up all night drinking, and immediately realised that he was “wrong for the part”. To make matters worse, Winstone claims thatGeorge Lucasyawned throughout the duration of the audition, prompting Winstone to declare “Why don’t we both have a 15-minute sleep and then I’ll fuck off?”In the end the role went to the storied Australian actor Graeme Blundell, whose scenes ended up being deleted anyway. But would this have been the case had Lucas been brave enough to do the right thing and redrawn Naberrie as a hoarse, red-eyed, slurring cockney? Obviously not.View image in fullscreenMissing something … Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.Photograph: Lucasfilm/AllstarYou have to remember that we’re talking about the Winstone of the early 00s here. Today he is best known for sleepwalking through television commercials for gambling sites and delivering legendarily inept Russian accents in forgettable Marvel films. But the Winstone of a quarter of a century ago was a fearsome presence indeed. This was the Winstone who had made Sexy Beast in 2000, and Nil By Mouth three years before that.Imagine what that Winstone could have done with Star Wars. Far from being a side character so forgettable that people didn’t even notice when he briefly turned up in Episode III, Naberrie could have ended up being the undisputed king of the galaxy. He could have sauntered around outer space without a top on, sunburned and blistered from overexposure to the yellow sun of Naboo. He would have almost certainly called Anakin Skywalker the C-word.And, clearly, given Disney’s current obsession with giving every imaginable Star Wars character their own spin-off series, Winstone’s Naberrie would have enjoyed a life that stretched far beyond the prequels. Chances are, had the audition gone his way, then we’d currently be in the middle of an entire Mandalorian-style franchise about a 70-year-old Naberrie roaming the wilds of the galaxy, stinking of whisky and chips, head-butting a ton of stormtroopers. His series would be called Ruwee Naberrie: Have It You Fanny, and it would be the best television show ever made.But it wasn’t to be. At least the tale does have a somewhat happy ending, though. Despite missing the chance to turn a minor Star Wars character into an aggressively dribbling drunkard, Winstone did eventually get the chance to work with Lucas, in the role of George McHale in the film where Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion by hiding in a fridge.View image in fullscreenRay Winstone and Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.Photograph: David James/Paramount Pictures/ReutersWinstone says that his casting in that film might be down to the fact that Lucas “didn’t remember” his drunk Star Wars audition. But perhaps he did. Perhaps this was his attempt to correct a historic wrong. And if that’s the case, then it still isn’t too late to act on it.Because, if Lucas is known for anything at all, it’s for tinkering with his films long after they’ve been released. Who’s to say that, right now, he isn’t sat in an editing bay in Nicasio, painstakingly grafting CGI footage of a drunk Winstone into the background of every single shot of the Star Wars films? Winstone stumbling around on the Death Star. Winstone vomiting down himself as he does a loop the loop in an X-Wing. Winstone trying to hump the back of R2-D2’s head. This is the version of Star Wars that the world deserves, and it cannot come quickly enough.Explore more on these topicsRay WinstoneStar Wars: Attack of the ClonesGeorge LucasFilm industryStar WarsScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In September,Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show wastaken off the air, under pressure from theTrump administration, after Kimmel’s comments after the killing of Charlie Kirk, while Donald Trump has launched multiple lawsuits against TV networks and news organizations.Four pilot episodes, each of which has been watched by the Guardian, were made of the rightwing chatshow. It was promoted by the Ziklag group, a secretive Christian nationalist organization, which aims toreshapeculture to match its version of Christianity. In an email in 2022, Ziklag – which ProPublica reported spent $12m to elect Trump last year – urged its members to stump up money for the project, called the Talk Show With Eric Metaxas.“For too long, the late-night talkers on network tv have filled the airwaves with progressive rants and outright mockery of anyone who espouses traditional American values,” the Ziklag email read.The Talk Show With Eric Metaxas, Ziklag wrote, will “change that forever”. The email said the show needed $400,000 to $500,000 to film five pilot episodes, “which will be presented to digital distributors, networks and tv ownership groups”.The Guardian sat through nearly four hours of the Talk Show, and found it to be an almost exact copy of existing late-night shows, just worse: with hack jokes about tired issues and has-been, conservative guests. The show was never picked up, presumably to the chagrin of Ziklag and its investors, who had lofty expectations.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

It lauded Metaxas, a conservative radio host and author who wasan eager proponentof the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen, claiming: “His comedic bent has gone largely unnoticed until now that is…”Unfortunately, across the four pilots, Metaxas’s comedic bent was noticeable only by its absence.“Big news in the world of show business,” Metaxas began the first episode. “Harrison Ford will be returning for a fifth Indiana Jones movie. Yeah. In this one Harrison will find an ancient artifact … by looking in the mirror.”There were a few titters from the audience, and scattered applause. Metaxas, appearing nervous, continued with the one-liners:“Barbie’s longtime companion, Ken, just turned 61 years old. Yeah. And he said the perfect gift for his birthday would be to finally get a prostate.”This time there were some audible groans. Metaxas stuck at it.“In India, doctors removed 526 teeth from a seven-year-old boy’s mouth,” he chortled. “The boy is recovering nicely. However, the Tooth Fairy declared bankruptcy.”Ziklag claimed the show would welcome “guests who are routinely shadow banned on other talk shows”, and quoted Metaxas as saying: “It’s kind of like Stalin has air-brushed these people out of the culture.”But the common theme among the guests was that they had been naturally phased out of existing talkshows due to their irrelevance.The first episode featured an exclusive interview with Carrot Top, the 60-year-old prop comedian. Carrot Top showed Metaxas some of his props, including a bottle of Bud Light that had a torch in the bottom of it and a dinner plate that had a hole in it. Carrot Top managed to say absolutely nothing of interest during the three-minute tête-à-tête, before Metaxas cut back to the studio.“Tonight’s show is loaded with talent,” Metaxas announced to the live audience. The guests included a TikToker – “for our generation, Tic Tac was a breath mint”, Metaxas quipped – Tammy Pescatelli, a comedian who has been absent from the limelight for at least a decade; and Danny Bonaduce, best known for his work on the 1970s sitcom the Partridge Family.Throughout the episodes – as Metaxas sang a song with a terrified-looking Victoria Jackson, a self-described conservative Christian who was a cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1986 to 1992 andhas claimedBarack Obama is an “Islamic terrorist” – and as he continued with awful jokes about some scientists who had developed a robot that could build furniture but “cannot promise that the robot won’t swear”, it was hard to see what the point of this was.In its email, Ziklag said it was offering the opportunity to invest as part of the “Media Mountain”, a reference to the Seven Mountain Mandate, a theology popular among the Christian right. The theology proposes that Christians should seek to take over seven spheres of influence in public life: religion, the government, the media, education, culture, entertainment and business.Chris Himes, who produced the Talk Show, said the show was not intended to be a “rightwing late-night show”. The aim, Himes said, was “to create a broad, throwback late-night program for the entire country – not just one side”.“These are not partisan or ‘right-wing’ shows. Think Letterman or Dick Cavett in tone: humor first, with no space for snark or ‘clapter’,” he said in an email.“Sadly, much of late night over the past decade has shifted from being genuinely funny to becoming a vehicle for tribal signaling – even occasionally straying into messaging far beyond comedy. We believe the country deserves something better.”Himes added: “To be clear, a ‘right-wing’ late-night show would be a terrible idea. What we’re building is something more essential: a genuinely funny, unifying alternative.”In the pilot episodes, there were guests who were known for rightwing politics, but Metaxas largely didn’t ask them about those politics. In episode three, he seemed to decide he needed to at least say a bit of something to satisfy the rightwing donors funding this enterprise, but that came in the form of going over well-trodden ground about liberals.“Botanists have discovered a meat-eating plant in Canada,” Metaxas said in his intro. “Researchers determined that the plant started eating meat because it just got tired of explaining its vegan lifestyle.”He continued: “Detroit’s sanitation workers – I just read this – they’re threatening to go on strike. Detroit’s mayor said not to worry, because Detroit will continue to look and smell exactly the same.”Another quip ventured into current affairs: “Gas costs a fortune. It’s insane how much it costs. And who would have thought that the best deal at the Shell station would ever be the $3 microwave burrito?”Ziklag’s pitch to investors had promised big-name guests. It didn’t deliver apart from an interview – heavily touted by Metaxas – with film-maker Ron Howard. The interview turned out to be from a press junket, where directors or actors sit in a room for eight hours and basically anyone with a press pass can schedule time to question them.It’s unlikely Howard knew he was appearing on what Ziklag described as a “faith-friendly, late night alternative”, but that’s perhaps irrelevant, given networks clearly passed on what is a confused, drab copy of shows that are actually successful.But while Metaxas’s effort to shoehorn a conservative show into the mainstream may have been lamentable, the fact that wealthy rightwingers are attempting to do so should be cause for concern, given the threat television is under from Trump.Earlier this year, CBS scrapped the Late Show withStephen Colbert– Colbert had repeatedly mocked Trump – weeks after CBS’s parent companysettled a lawsuitwith Trump. Trump has also called for late-night show hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, who have both criticized the president, to be fired, while the president has overseen NPR and PBS being stripped of funding, having decried “biased media”.The Talk Show was a terrible product, memorable only for dreadful humor and snooze-inducing interviews. In the current climate, however, it serves as a reminder that the right wing is waging a well-funded war on the media that is unlikely to end soon.Explore more on these topicsMediaTelevisionUS politicsStephen ColbertJimmy FallonJimmy KimmelTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Veljo Tormis, Ester Mägi and Erkki-Sven Tüür are just the tip of the iceberg, whileArvo Pärt, 90 this yearand the subject of this celebratory concert, regularly tops lists of the world’s most popular composers. Who better, then, to present his work than two of the country’s finest ensembles: the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir.Tõnu Kaljuste, who founded both, led authoritative performances, opening with an unusually impassioned account of the austerely meditative Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten. String players leant into hypnotic musical lines urged on by the conductor’s’s fluttering left hand. Fratres received similarly insistent treatment,Harry Traksmann’s solo violin performing death-defying variations over orchestral iterations of the work’s modal melody.Mägi’s defiantly tonal Vesper tapped into a similar vein of hopeful simplicity.Two substantial works demonstrated the choir’s preeminence in this music. Written in 2009,Adam’s Lamentexplores the father of humanity’s anguish following the expulsion from paradise. The music seems to hang its head one moment before bursting out in wodges of adjacent harmonies the next. Basses and tenors were especially powerful in a confident and disciplined reading.View image in fullscreen‘Holding the audience spellbound’: soprano Maria Listra with conductor Tõnu Kaljust perform at the Barbican.Photograph: Mark AllanThe masterly Te Deum was composed in 1984 for three choirs, strings, prepared piano and wind harp (here represented by an electronic wash). Some of its reverberatory resonance was lost in the dry acoustic, the piano sounded tame, and the choirs could have been better separated for spatial effects. Nevertheless, committed singing ensured the sinuous medieval lines and pungent harmonies worked their magic.The London premiere of L’abbé Agathon, a haunting tale of a hermit put to the test by a leper who turns out to be an angel, was a chance to hear a different side of a composer rarely credited as a musical dramatist. Trudging strings conjured a desert trek and pizzicatos a bustling market, with biting dissonances accompanying the needy outcast. Maria Listra held the audience spellbound throughout, her ethereal soprano spiralling higher and higher as the divine messenger disappeared into the heavens.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicArvo PärtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Should we take him seriously?Farrah JarralWed 8 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 06.51 EDTShareAt 83,Werner Herzogis a living legend who can and does do precisely what he wants.Like the strange, enchanting films for which he is best known, Herzog’s seventh book defies the usual conventions of structure, narrative arc and the delineation of fact from fiction, even as it addresses the very subject of truth.This slim volume sets out Herzog’s views on truth in a world where technologically enhanced falsehoods proliferate. These appear to be an elaboration of Herzog’sMinnesota Declaration, the 12 statements he made in 1999 at the Walker Art Centre in Minneapolis. Much like the declaration, The Future of Truth contains strong, gnomic opinions which include despising cinéma vérité because it obscures more than it illuminates, as well as a plethora of surprising sentences such as “rather die than wear a toupee”.Two principles are central to Herzog’s idea of truth. First is the notion that seeking truth is a greater goal than finding it. As he puts it, “the quest itself, bringing us nearer to the unrevealed truth, allows us to participate in something inherently unattainable, which is truth”. The second is that bare facts can provide little more than a boring “accountant’s truth” that is less useful than what he calls “ecstatic truth” in helping people understand what’s really going on in life.If anyone else had written The Future of Truth, I suspect they would come under critical fire for taking the piss out of the readerIt’s like listening to a fireside monologue from an entertaining uncle. The weirdest and most compelling tale, among some stiff competition, is the story of the Palermo pig. Once upon a time, according to Herzog,a pig got stuck down a straight-sided sewage pipe in Palermo, Sicily. It remained wedged in there for years,surviving on scraps of food thrown down to it.Eventually the pig took on the shape of its container. It became a kind of translucent block, “ghostly pale … wobbly as a great hunk of Jello”, taking in nourishment from above, ejecting waste below.Herzog uses this story as an allegory, linking the Palermo pig to the perils of long-distance space exploration. Should humankind embark on a voyage to our nearest habitable planet, it would take centuries. During this time Herzog envisages the intrepid travellers would be forced to inbreed, becoming “mutants” with no comprehension of the purpose of their mission. Eventually the astronauts would morph into pale, maggot-like beings rather like the Palermo pig, capable of little more than eating and shitting.This morbidly fascinating and unintentionally hilarious handbrake turn from Sicilian sewers to space mutants offers a lesson in Herzog’s concept of ecstatic truth. Because, as I discovered to my dismay after spending quite some time trying to track down any record of this intriguing and biologically implausible cuboid swine, the Palermo pig appears to be apocryphal. I had been pursuing the miserly “accountant’struth”, a reality grounded in mere facts. What did it matter whether an incarcerated Sicilian farm animalactuallyturned into a quivering square jelly? The real point of Herzog’s story suddenly hit home: penning animals into small spaces for long periods is unwise and creates monsters.If anyone else had written The Future of Truth, I suspect they would come under critical fire for odd choices in structure, rambling, contradictory statements, and, to put it bluntly, taking the piss out of the reader. After all, Herzog devotes five whole pages to the histrionic plot of an opera just to demonstrate that when art forms contain concentrated, intense emotion, we “invest this preposterous kernel with the full array of our own feeling, so that it seems mysteriously genuine”. However, because this book is a collection of uniquely Herzogian mindfarts, it resists a panning. Michael Hofmann’s sparkling and inventive translation from the original German – a crypto-zoologist is described as “a ham sandwich short of a picnic” – somehow makes Herzog more Herzog in tone.While much of the The Future of Truth will be familiar from his previous books, films and interviews, one relatively new element is his meditation on deepfakes. Herzog refers more than once to anAI-generated perpetual conversationbetween fake audio versions of himself and Slavoj Žižek online. Since his own methods of getting at ecstatic truth have included inventing quotes by famous figures and casting actors in his documentaries, there is a risk of hypocrisy. The distinction, he argues, is that an intelligent mind would be reasonably able to discern lies in older forms of media, while AI is so new and so powerful that our ability to identify them is seriously impaired. “We have grown up with radio and photography.

As a teenager I was a passionate fan of gothic literature; I love a haunted house novel, and believe The Little Stranger, Sarah Waters’s masterpiece of the genre, is yet to be bettered. It’s an admiration that Leon Craig shares. She also cites Donna Tartt’s The Secret History as an influence, which gives some clue to the setup that greets the reader in The Decadence. Namely, privileged university friends retreat to a haunted country house – inherited, naturally, by one of the group – to indulge in an array of illegal substances and sexual configurations. Bring it on, I thought.But though I tried very much to care about them, the twists and turns in the characters’ relationships did not make much of an impression. The Decadence is written in a close third person that means we spend the story with Jan, a brittle, self-loathing PhD student whose dissatisfaction with the two female friends she’s been sleeping with preoccupies her to a tedious degree. As for the others, the characterisation is shallow. None of the dialogue feels authentic (“Ursie, you brought the Pimm’s, right?”), there is too much exposition, and the political arguments that the friends keep having feel shoehorned in.On a sentence level, the book is overwritten, a veritable festival of adverbs and adjectives that left me feeling almost queasy – decadence indeed. “The faint mothball smell that emanated from the light-raked silk curtains cast her back into the realm of memory.” “To love her now felt not unlike being the last adherent of a secret religion, tending to a dwindling sacred flame in hope of the return of a ravenous and uncaring god.”By the time Jan is having an unwitting threesome with an antisemitic ghost, Craig had completely lost meIt’s really hard to write about being high on drugs in a way that is interesting, and The Decadence does not buck that trend, although I’ll admit I did laugh when Jan gropes the “curves and divots” of an air mattress while “thinking about Diana of Ephesus, wondering what it would be like to have sex with a many-breasted nature goddess”. It was meant to be funny, I think? Then there are the errors. I was able to overlook wisteria being in full bloom at the same time as hollyhocks – conceivable, I suppose, though distracting enough for this gardener to be yanked from the narrative. I could even forgive a man peeing being referred to as “ablutions”. But a reference to a character “lying prone on the flowery bank with her hair strewn about her face, as if she were hoping for Millais’ Ophelia comparisons” was almost the final straw.For a fan of gothic literature, Craig does the genre a disservice in her failure to offer any real psychological complexity. She has intriguing ideas about the violent imprint that the past can leave on a place, and the history of the persecution of Jewish people in this country and beyond, but her exploration is surface-level. By the time Jan is having an unwitting threesome with an antisemitic ghost, having already had a threesome with the antisemitic ghost’s descendant, Craig had completely lost me.Craig can be really scary when she tries, but these moments are too rare and come too late to truly captivate. The Decadence seems to have been written while in thrall to an algorithm: in her author’s note Craig cites a range of fascinating and important texts, but the influence that looms largest is the social media trend of dark academia. I felt as though I was reading a book comprised solely of vibes, and while vibes can be great, a gothic novel requires something a little more profound to leave the reader chilled, as opposed to relieved, at its end.The Decadence by Leon Craig is published by Sceptre (£18.99).

Instead of buying albums and films, most of us pay for a few subscriptions depending on what we want to watch, and maybe supplement that with the odd vinyl or special-edition Blu-ray. This has been pretty terrible for musicians, who earn approximately $0.004 per play on Spotify, while Spotify itselfmade $1bn in profitlast year (admittedly after many years of operating losses). On the TV front, it’s increasingly annoying for customers: in my household we have to carefully bounce around between five different TV subscriptions depending on what series we’re into, to keep costs down.This model hasn’t really caught on in video games. Apple has its Arcade service that offers premium mobile games for £6.99 a month, but free-to-play games are the norm on phones and tablets and make gigantic profits through ads and in-game purchases. (Fun fact: around 85% ofallrevenue in the entire games industry comes from free-to-play games, mostly in territories such as China.) Netflix packages games as part of its subscription,but not very many people play them. PlayStation and Nintendo both have subscription services, but they only include older games, rather than brand new ones. And then there’s Game Pass, the Xbox subscription service, which has offered a library of 200+ gamesincludingall of Xbox’s brand new exclusives for an eyebrow-raisingly generous price. Until now.Microsoft recently announced that a Game Pass Ultimate subscription was going up from £14.99 to £22.99 a month. (This is the version that includes all the latest releases – cheaper options remain available). And while subscribers in some countries (mostly in Europe) received an email last night delaying the price hike, subscribers in the UK and US will still pay more. The hike has seemed inevitable for some time; nobody could quite figure out the economics of Game Pass given that blockbuster games cost hundreds of millions to make, and Microsoft has also been paying other developers to host their games on its service.Bloomberg estimatesthat putting Call of Duty on Game Pass last year cost Microsoft the equivalent of $300m in sales.Does this suggest that Game Pass is not proving as successful as Microsoft would like? I asked Christopher Dring ofThe Game Business newsletterfor his very informed opinion. “Game Pass is profitable,” he says. “But it’s clearly had an impact on the premium sales of games. It’s most notable with games like Halo Infinite and Starfield not charting as highly as you’d expect … Xbox bought Activision Blizzard for $70bn. That comes with scrutiny from the heads of Microsoft, including chief financial officer Amy Hood. It’s not just about profitability, it’s about growth – Microsoft expects a strong return from its Xbox division for that kind of investment. Not to over simplify things, but that’s why Xbox has been cutting costs, projects and even studios, and why it’s raising prices across the board.”Xbox will be relying on Game Pass for growth, because its actual console sales have been in freefall for years. Microsoft stopped reporting how many Xboxes it was shifting, preferring instead to talk about revenue and engagement, but it is estimated that the Xbox Series S/X has sold a few million less than 2013’s Xbox One, putting it in distant third place behind Nintendo and PlayStation. Xbox’s own executiveshave saidthat console sales aren’t a priority: that’s why Microsoft has started putting all its games on PC and PlayStation, too, and why it’s been investing so heavily in buying up studios to make content for Game Pass.View image in fullscreenA promotional image of Call of Duty Warzone.Photograph: ActivisionBut here’s the bigger picture: do we evenwanta subscription-based future for video games? And what does it mean for developers? One possible future follows the pattern of the TV industry: prices creep up, streaming services proliferate and gamers have no choice but to pay a fortune every year to play the latest titles. Meanwhile, developers will find it increasingly difficult to make the money needed to support big titles as direct sales dry up, forcing a consolidation of talent – which ultimately makes it harder and harder for original art to emerge. Millions of gamers are still happy to pay £70 for games on release day: Mario Kart World and Assassin’s Creed Shadows were two of the bestselling games in Europe in the first half of this year. Why would the big players seek to undermine that?“For [smaller] developers, it comes down to whether you’re in it or not,” reckons Dring. “Right now, Game Pass is a strong discoverability tool in an era where that is a real industry issue. It’s also a way for players to access games at an affordable cost (well, it used to be), which in the current economy is important. But there are concerns for what the future might hold.”Different business models can coexist, of course. In video games, free-to-play now coexists with premium games: they largely serve different audiences, and the data suggests that they do not cannibalise each other. Some people prefer to buy high-end consoles and high-end titles, and that market has remained pretty stable for the past decade; many more people engage casually with free-to-play games, a market that has been growing hugely, and has massively increased the overall gaming audience along with it. It’s possible that subscription services like Game Pass – if managed well – could offer an in-between option that doesn’t completely ruin the entire industry’s business model. But given the precedent elsewhere in the arts, and the rapacious hunger for profit and growth of big corporations likeMicrosoft, maybe that is overly optimistic.Despite the price rise,XboxGame Pass still represents good value for the most time-rich customers. “Xbox is asking its biggest players, those who engage the most, to pay more. That’s who Game Pass Ultimate is for,” Dring points out. “I suspect a large number of these players will accept it, if they can afford it, because, according to statistics, they get good value out of it. The average Game Pass Ultimate player plays $550 worth of games a year.”Editor’s note: due to an editing error, last week’s edition referred to the new Nintendo of America president Devon Pritchard as “he” when she is in fact the first woman to hold the position. Apologies to Devon, and thanks to the people who wrote in to point this out.What to playView image in fullscreenBaby Steps.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThere were so many good games in September that I’m still catching up with them (and I’m still very much stuck in Silksong’s web). EnterBaby Steps, a surreal slapstick comedy game that I’ve been looking forward toforever. It opens promisingly, as pathetic man-child Nate is zapped from his parents’ basement to a bewildering wilderness hike for which he is woefully unprepared; using the triggers to lift his pallid feet and the control stick to lean his weight, you stumble out of a cave and up to a camp at the foot of a mountain.What follows, though, is one of the most painful gaming experiences you’ll ever have, as you slip and flounder and slide down sections of terrain that you already spent twenty minutes trying to climb. I misplaced one of Nate’s feet on a wooden beam across a gap and tumbled so far down that it took me several minutes to even make it back to the campsite I’d started at an hour before. And yet! I still stayed up until 2am playing this because it’s extremely weird and funny and obstinate, and because I finally feel like I’m getting somewhere with controlling Nate’s useless body. It’s a real “suffer for your art” situation but if you’re into novel suffering, give it a try.Available on:PS5, PCEstimated playtime:10 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenEA headquarters.Photograph: Terry Schmitt/UPI/ShutterstockIf you want to know more about the ethical dubiousness ofSaudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund– which will soon co-own EA, as we talkedabout last week–Eurogamerasked Human Rights Watch for some insight: “This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We’ve found it’s been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country … We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country’s human rights abuses.”My household’s summer obsession was the Netflix animated filmKpop Demon Hunters(iykyk), a movie so explosively popular that it is nowtaking over Fortnitewith new modes and character cosmetics. This has sparked an interesting debate between me and my partner: he does not want our still-quite-young kids engaging with Fortnite at all; I am willing to overlook it because of how delighted they will be by it. Either way,Iwill be playing it.Pour one out forRock Band, the once popular plastic-instrument game that soundtracked my uni days. Its last instalment, Rock Band 4, wasdelisted from storeslast Sunday on its 10th anniversary, as the music licenses for its songs expired. If you own the game, there’s still time to bulk up your library of tracks before they are all removed from sale. Now that developer Harmonix ismaking music for Fortnite instead, we’ll certainly never see another Rock Band game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It tells the story of a sixth-century peasant-born soldier who brings order to the Byzantine empire of which he is eventually crowned ruler.The piece offers narrative challenges for the director, some of which Joe Hill-Gibbins and his colleagues overcome with sensitive simplicity, scaling down the scene changes in favour of a largely bare, ochre-painted stage, across which lamps oscillate gently and mesmerisingly. Other moments, including Giustino’s encounters with a bear and a sea monster, feel more arbitrary and just a bit daft. For all that it contains fine scenes, you can see why Handel did not revive it.View image in fullscreenAlways vocally intereresting… Mireille Asselin with Jonathan LemaluPhotograph: Marc BrennerThe playing of theLa Nuova Musicaensemble in the pit is scintillating, however, and the interest level remains very high, thanks in part to Handel’s requirement for a virtuoso oboist (here the Academy of Ancient Music’s Leo Duarte). Horns and trumpets play on stage, to great musical and theatrical effect. The continuo is superbly varied in tone and timbre, even generating a Rheingold-like sonority at the start of act two. The Guildhall School of Music students shine in choral passages. David Bates’s conducting grips the piece from the start.The problem is that it takes a long time for Giustino himself to emerge as the protagonist of the opera bearing his name. For much of the first half (the first two acts are here played without a break), Giustino is one of several principals all vying for a share of the action and control of events, and whose motives are not always clearly demarcated or terribly compelling. By act three, though, Polly Leech’s Giustino takes centre stage more decisively, with impressively burgeoning mezzo vocal range, and with violence at the opera’s end.Until then, most of the fast-moving action revolves around the unhappy empress Arianna, her suitors and her enemies. With four female voices and a counter-tenor among the seven principals, and with Jonathan Lemalu’s Polidarte given little to do, the opera’s overall vocal colouring is at times too constrained. Benjamin Hulett’s Vitaliano provides some welcome tenor relief, incisively sung. Like her fellow principals, Mireille Asselin’s impressively acted and always vocally interesting Arianna grew more subtle and authoritative as the evening went on, as well as doubling up as a glittering Goddess of Fortune. Keri Fuge was an accomplished Anastasio, Esme Bronwen-Smith a sensitive Leocasta, and Jake Arditti stood out as a formidably sung Amanzio, the villain of a stimulating but uneven piece.At theLinbury theatre, London, until 18 OctoberExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

Simon Evans and Debris Stevenson do not try to emulate the radical genius of that show in their adaptation. The genius here is in honouring the old rather than radical reinvention.Their modern-language script distils the spirit of Rostand’s drama, set in the French golden age, albeit in the midst of war. The heart and poetry is all here, and the sincerity too, which sometimes spills into schmaltz (for example, a silently smiling child Cyrano roams through the production to tug at our heart-strings). But it is all underpinned with emotional authenticity and neat, quipping wit.View image in fullscreenHonest intelligence … Levi Brown as Christian  in Cyrano de Bergerac.Photograph: Marc BrennerIts biggest highlight is Adrian Lester’s Cyrano, who gives this production its sublimely wounded soul. He plays the Gallic nobleman, soldier and poet with a perfect balance of braggadocio, gruffness and closely-guarded vulnerability; you believe all his torments, forgive every deceit. Lester wears a large prosthetic proboscis as he channels his tortured love for Roxane (Susannah Fielding) through handsome young soldier Christian (Levi Brown) and it gives him an old-school, slightly comic aspect.There is plenty of musketeer-style sword-play and entertaining humour, all the bolder and fresher in modern language, while Grace Smart’s set mixes 17th-century elements with a timeless expressionism. The script, aside from adding an unnecessary framing device featuring the baker, Ragueneau (Christian Patterson), tempers the grandiose Alexandrine verse of the original without removing its soaring flights of lyricism (Stevenson is a poet as well as playwright).It gives subtle new spins on each of these iconic characters, too. Cyrano is still a libertine, outsider and idealist but he is squarely an antihero now rather than the paragon of heroic masculinity. His fear of admitting his love to Roxane is generated by self-loathing, all the more pronounced here, and he bears a kind of moral grubbiness as he passes his words off as Christian’s in the love letters he obsessively writes.There is an evident class difference between him and Christian, who is yokel-like, with a Black Country accent and a love of the soil. He might be awkward with words but there is an integrity and honest intelligence about him that makes Cyrano’s violations clear: the latter is using words to woo Roxane for Christian but also taking ownership of the romance (“I have my own feelings sir,” Christian protests). Roxane, for her part, is a widow, desperate for a second chance at romance, and much more clearly in love with the poetry of love than the thing itself. “I love you,” Christian pleads, but it is not enough for her. She wants high-flown verse, rhyme, simile. Although every character’s flaws lie exposed here, they are still imbued with a humanity that makes them all likable.The staging is nifty, too. Under the direction of Evans, the over-theatricality of the play-within-the-play in the opening scene, at the Paris theatre where Cyrano makes an enemy of Comte de Guiche (Scott Handy), bleeds into the rest of the production. So Cyrano later stamps his foot to mark a sudden change in lighting and his band of musicians bring knowing winks.The playfulness sits in stark contrast to a France that is battle-worn by 20 years of war. The gunfire and thunderous bombs make the romance all the more life-affirming – an assertion of love over hate.Yet Rostand’s interrogation of love remains alongside. Is love located in the physicality of Christian himself or through its abstract expression in Cyrano’s letters? Possibly both, for Roxane. Language is not to be trusted even while being the truest reflection of passion. It is all Cyrano has until the very end, when it is words that fail this tragic wordsmith.At the Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAdrian LesterRoyal Shakespeare CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereJason OkundayeWed 8 Oct 2025 07.49 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 07.57 EDTShareWhat distinguishes modern Nigerian art from its traditional form? I had this question in mind when I attended a private viewing of Tate Modern’s new exhibition, NigerianModernism, which traces artwork from the period of indirect colonial rule to post-independence.Walking through the gallery with the curator Osei Bonsu, learning about the incredible ways in which modern Nigerian artists sought to define, shape and rebel against the beautiful but contested state, I found answers.‘The arrival of an independent Nigeria’Osei Bonsu, the curator of international art at Tate Modern alongside assistant curator Bilal Akkouche, tells me that Nigerian Modernism is around three years in the making, though his initial research began as early as the Covid pandemic. “I was able to research the collections of the Universities of Birmingham, York and Chichester, all of which have really rich African collections.” He found that modern Nigerian artists were often categorised within ideas of “traditional” African art, which he felt decontextualised the work and severed its links to modernity.View image in fullscreenIntricate textile design … Nike Davies-Okundaye’s adire pieces place the mythological into the right context.Photograph: Guy Bell/Alamy Live NewsMany of the artists in Nigerian Modernism grappled with this question of cultural nationalism and identity, which had been shaped as much by interactions with European colonial culture as by their heritage. This was an especially pressing question in the build up to independence in 1960. That is immediately apparent in the first room of the exhibition, which features the work of the modern arts teacher and painter Aina Onabolu. Bonsu draws my attention to his 1922 oil painting of an elite Lagosian woman, Charlotte Obasa: “Commissioning her portrait was a way of signifying her wealth and importance within Lagosian society. If you look at her dress and how she’s framed, there’s a sense of the British upper class.”Portraiture was a kind of artistic realism that helped define class structures. But realist art also served more democratic purposes. Akinola Lasekan, a student of Onabolu’s, took a very different approach to painting. “Instead of engaging in the honorific language of portraiture, he was more invested in portraying scenes of everyday life, but also scenes of Nigerian mythology,” Bonsu explains. In Onabolu’s works, we see watercolour paintings of Hausa traders at Lagos market, as well as a depiction of the creation story through Obatala, the orisha who descended from the sky to create the Earth. “You could say these artists were revolting against the grain of Christian missionary culture that discouraged the representation of daily Nigerian realities.”View image in fullscreenCultural dichotomy … the exhibition features pieces by Ben Enwonwu and Aina Onabolu.Photograph: Ben Uri Gallery and Museum/Yemisi Shyllon Museum of ArtBeing half Bini (the ethnic group of Nigerian descendants of the Benin empire), I am especially interested in a vitrine containing photographs by Jonathan Adagogo Green, which depicts Ovonramwen, the Oba of Benin, just after the sacking of his kingdom in 1897. Bonsu included such work because they provide “a mini retrospective of his photographic practice that was, at the time, interested in traditional rules, and these transitions of power”. Though he notes that Green was employed by the British colonial government and operated as a double agent, representing both traditional Nigerian culture and the sweeping changes of colonial rule.These changes are also recorded in one of the exhibition’s most remarkable acquisitions: a panel of doors by the sculptor and innovator of Yoruba visual language Olowe of Ise, which was gifted to the British Museum. The carving depicts a meeting between the ogoga (king) of Ikere and a colonial officer, Captain William Ambrose. Bonsu says: “We often think about traditional Yoruba carving as being used to represent honorific dynastic culture. But this spoke to a social critique and depicted the captain as a supplicant of the king, which in a sense used sculpture to politicise a national event.”Despite this exploration of colonial relations, you won’t find stolenBenin bronzeshere, or any other plundered art. “It was important to start where that narrative leaves off,” Bonsu explains. “These are the artists who emerge on the other side of that violence, grappling with a loss of tradition and trying to relocate forms and techniques.”One of the show’s stars is the sculptor and painter Ben Enwonwu, who is often described as the most influential African artist of the 20th century. His work Negritude is the lead promotional image for the exhibition; it depicts a woman dancing, and in the galleries I find a series of similar pieces. Bonsu explains that these were inspired by Enwonwu’s attendance of the legendary Nigerian nightclub Caban Bamboo: “You can see he’s trying to catch movement through the brushstrokes, and the layering of limbs to depict the performance of dance in a painterly form.”View image in fullscreenTechnical brilliance … the talented Ben Enwonwu’s Seven Wooden Sculptures make a star turn in this exhibition.Photograph: Jai Monaghan/© TateThere is technical brilliance in Enwonwu’s work, but he is also an interesting study in contradiction. One of his most famous sculptures is, in fact, of Queen Elizabeth, commissioned to inaugurate a state visit she made to Nigeria in 1956. “He’s heralding this arrival of a newly independent Nigeria,” Bonsu says. “But he’s also embodying a lot of the virtues of the Commonwealth through his presence as a Black artist who received a great deal of privilege and access.”Even where Enwonwu depicted Nigeria’s struggles, they were sometimes at a remove. His epic oil painting Storm Over Biafra, portraying the devastation and loss caused by the Nigerian civil war, was painted five years out from the conflict, because he was able to flee to the UK during it. Other modern Nigerian artists were less of the establishment, such as those of the ZariaArtSociety, who came together in 1958 to decolonise arts education in Nigeria. “Unlike Enwonwu who was a kind of national figure, these were figures who were questioning the politics of nationalism but also trying to create art that embodied the possibilities of independence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

British university collections were generous, and there was good cooperation from Nigerian authorities. What proved more difficult was accessing private collections. Restoration was another issue, with about 50 works needing treatment, including Enwonwu’s Negritude, which was aided by conservators from the Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) in Benin City, Nigeria.View image in fullscreenA remarkable acquisition … wooden door panels by the sculptor and innovator of Yoruba visual language Olowe of Ise.Photograph: Guy Bell/Alamy Live NewsI have to ask Bonsu what made him pursue Nigerian modernism specifically, considering that there are non-Nigerian artists in the show. (Bonsu himself is Ghanaian.) “I ask myself that question every day!” he says with a laugh. “In this period in particular, Nigeria was a melting pot for so many west African cultures. Lagos in the 19th century was a crossroads for formerly enslaved Afro-Brazilians who returned, Victorian Britons who were coming to create industry, and there were enterprising Nigerians creating economic networks across west Africa. So I think this is a west African story.”He expands, saying: “Many of these artists deal with the idea that Nigerian culture has to be taken as a multinational and multi-ethnic question, in which artists are free to disrupt and redirect different narratives in service of their own artistic vision. So when we talk about independence in this exhibition, it’s not just about political independence. It’s about the freedom of artists to choose what kind of narratives they want to absorb or reject.”Bonsu also wants us to think of Nigeria as an international hub for artists in the way that Paris, New York and London are: “People such as Ibrahim El-Salahi from Sudan, Naoko Matsubara, who’s Canadian-Japanese, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, who’s German, they were all coming to Nigeria to be part of this cultural renaissance.”Bonsu is hoping to tour the exhibition to other cities after it concludes its run at the Tate, focusing on locations where you can find the Nigerian diaspora. “If the show does anything, I hope it encourages local museums everywhere to really think, ‘What does it mean to preserve your national heritage?’” Bonsu also wants custodians of these works to figure out how they can offer access to the public domain. “Artists have always resisted exclusion,” he says, and so “the more ways to create access to these works, the better”.Nigerian Modernismis at Tate Modern, London, until 10 May.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaThe Long WaveAfricaSculptureArtPaintingModernismnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Not so for Common/Wealth’s Demand the Impossible. Described as part-performance, part-punk gig and part-sensory experience, this is a striking work.Structured around Taylor Edmond’s text of short episodic monologues, it resists an easy poeticism, instead focusing on the objectively descriptive. This is of the everyday, where injustice occurs around the peeling of apples, the making of sandwiches and the eating of crisps. Threading together the narratives of a Black Lives Matter activist, a blacklisted construction worker and an environmental campaigner, its characters have all been directly affected by police violence and undercover operations, the latter explicitly – as a victim of the spycops scandal. They’re played by Bianca Ali, Soul Roberts and Hussina Raja respectively, and there’s a smart frisson in how these well-known stories are articulated through everyday details before becoming symbolic of other lives ruined by state violence.‘We wanted to tell the wider story’: play highlights impact of ‘spycops’ scandalRead moreUnder Rhiannon White’s direction, the production is perfectly calibrated. Set almost entirely to music performed live by Ollie Emanuel, Ruari Floyd and Jassen Summogum, it has an accumulative and sometimes almost oppressive power. One imagines this is the point. Performers are surveilled and, in a space designed by Nathaniel Mason, Studio of Mark Gubb and Andy Purves, both they and the audience are illuminated by projected live images, as if only through narrating oppression might it be rendered visible.These individual transgressions accumulate into a catalogue of injustices, individual texts into a polyphony of voices. Throughout, it simmers with an indignant rage at the obscene scale of such abuses and particularly at their insidiousness. Beyond the targeting and ruining of individual lives, it draws attention to the manner in which family and home, and even love itself, is weaponised by the state.The real world continues to rumble on outside. But at a time when legitimate protest (and repeated protest) is increasingly criminalised, the mere affirmation of activism feels significant, dramatised or not. This is potent and urgent theatre.At Corn Exchange, Newport, until 13 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 2,721 books surveyed, only 51 (1.9%) featured a Black main character, down by 21.5% compared with 2023.The charity described the findings as a “catastrophic decline in Black representation”, and said the report revealed “stark inequalities” in UK children’s publishing.It also reported that about 6% of children’s books featured marginalised main characters, and just under half (49%) of those were created by authors or illustrators from those groups.Representation was low across a range of identity groups. Just 35 books (1.3%) featured south Asian main characters, while about 12.5% of children in English nursery and primary schools have south Asian heritage.Only seven books featured disabled main characters, with most created by non-disabled authors or illustrators, and six featured neurodivergent main characters.Earlier this year,a number of leading Black literary figures told the Guardianthat UK publishing is less accessible to Black authors now than it was five years ago. While the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020 led to many publishing houses making commitments to address racial inequality in the industry, a number of industry figures said there has since been a noticeable downturn in the number of Black writers being published.Analysis by the Bookseller in 2023also found that the boom in Black authors being published after 2020 “failed to result in the promised broadening of publishing’s output”.Jasmine Richards, founder of inclusive fiction studio Storymix, said: “The steep drop in books for five-to-nine-year-olds featuring Black main characters is not just disappointing – it’s further evidence of the quiet rollback that has taken place over the last two years. And if you’ve been paying attention, it’s not a surprise.”The survey also arrives against a backdrop of a wider reading crisis: the National Literacy Trust reports that reading for pleasure is at an all-time low, with onlyone in three childrenaged eight to 18 saying they enjoy reading in 2025, a 36% drop since 2005.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ahead of The Celebrity Traitors, we head to Ardross Castle for the inside scoop on what it’s really like to sit at the round tableElle HuntWed 8 Oct 2025 05.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 10.21 EDTShareAll I can hear, above my thunderous heartbeat, is thestomp … stomp … stompof Claudia Winkleman’s boots as she approaches the round table to determine my fate. It sounds as if she is treading unevenly, maybe even skipping slightly, to throw us off – but maybe that’s just my nerves, fraying by the second.I became a fan ofThe Traitorswith the first UK season in 2022. I’ve since watched as many of the 30 international adaptations of the (originally Dutch) format as I’ve been able to track down. Though I know better than to apply myself, I’ve naturally debated whether I’d want to play as a Faithful, tasked with flushing the Traitors out; or a Traitor, with more control but vulnerable to backstabbing. Now, I’m going to find out.Ahead of the BBC’s first celebrity season, a small group of journalists have been invited to the Scottish Highlands, to go behind the scenes and – the real sweetener – play a game overseen by Winkleman herself.Ardross Castle is a 19th-century, privately-owned mansion, a 30-minute drive from Inverness. For most of the year it’s a wedding venue, but since 2022 it’s been booked up for three to four months for Traitors business.Even the tree-lined drive leading up to the castle is instantly familiar from the players’ conspiratorial convoys to and from the challenges off-site. Our minivan falls into jittery silence, at odds with the serene parkland.We pull up beside a line of foreboding black 4X4s with TRAITORS numberplates. Any semblance of journalistic neutrality is flung off like a Traitor’s cloak as we pile out of the van, emitting squeals of delight.To the left are the formal gardens, featuring the fire pit where the last players standing cast their final votes, and the bush into which UK season three fan favourite Alexander famously careened.To the right is the terrace, looking out over verdant rolling hills, where players convene to forge alliances. I can even hear the caw of the resident peacocks. “They always go to the catering tent,” executive producer Mike Cotton tells me.The castle is a hive of activity as the production team – having just wrapped The Celebrity Traitors – prepare for a fresh batch of civilian players. At this very moment, they are meeting each other for the first time, being filmed on the train for the first episode of season four.Tomorrow they will descend upon the castle, and a select few will be shoulder-tapped to be Traitors by Winkleman at the first round table. Today, however, it’s our turn.We’re led into the breakfast room to find the table laden with the same spread laid on for those players who survive each night: pastries, deli meats, dried fruit, some cupcakes. Watching at home, I’ve always thought it looked somewhat wooden, but I take a plate, hoping to settle my nerves, and sit down with my fellow players.We size each other up. Our professional headshots are framed and mounted on the wall just like the contestants’ on the show, reminding us of the treachery to come.View image in fullscreenClaudia Winkleman and Elle Hunt with the giant, gleaming pile of gold AKA the prize pot.Photograph: Ruth Roxanne Board / BBC“It’s all friendly now,” says one man darkly, between bites of ham.We continue on our castle tour to the library, where players gather their allies for cosy chats, and the billiards room, wallpapered in tartan, where Winkleman conducts her interviews, which is a secret room – concealed behind a bookcase in the bar.I’m more surprised to find the bar stocked with real booze, including mini bottles of wine and a brandy decanter. Cotton won’t be drawn on the rules for contestants, saying only that there are limits and they’ve “never had an incident” with drunkenness.Paintings throughout, of skulls and cloaked figures, aren’t just spooky set dressing: they conceal mirrors that would otherwise reflect cameras. More cameras are integrated within the set, such as in the roundtable room: the castle’s Great Hall, made smaller with extra panelled walls, enables crews to move around undetected.The table’s centrepiece conceals a camera and rotates like a lazy Susan, capturing players’ fleeting reactions. The goal is to create as immersive an experience as possible, to encourage the players to live the game. The groundwork is laid with casting, says Sarah Fay, another executive producer: “We want people who purely want to play the game.”They are sorted into Faithfuls or Traitors based on what they say in their interviews with Winkleman and players’ individual preferences – if only to avoid an apathetic villain. “You’ve got to want to be a Traitor,” says Cotton.View image in fullscreen‘We still can’t believe we got Stephen Fry to come to the castle’ … the star in The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryOnce roles are assigned, producers let the action unfurl. Only the challenges and certain set-pieces, such as the“death match”card game from last season, and season two’s funeral, are prepared in advance, says Cotton. “We’re really hands-off … Once we’ve set it up, we just let them go.”Players sleep off-site and are kept apart when not on set, but are otherwise free to roam the castle. Cotton shakes his head exasperatedly, recalling their frequently futile attempts to find a private corner to scheme: “I often think: ‘Just go outside!’”There was no special treatment for The Celebrity Traitors –despite the big nameson the cast, among them Stephen Fry, Charlotte Church, Tom Daley, Jonathan Ross and Alan Carr.Some were approached to take part, but there is such buzz around the series, “there were some people who did come to us,” says Cotton. (He won’t name names – but Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York,reportedlydeclined an offer.) “We still can’t believe we got Stephen Fry to come to the castle,” adds Fay.The only difference from the civilian series, they say, is that the celebrities had their public personas and in some cases preexisting relationships to play with, creating more opportunities for subterfuge. “I don’t know what beasts lie within me,” muses Fryin the show’s first trailer.“It’s designed to be psychologically intense,” says Cotton. The entire production is set up to minimise interactions with the contestants, lest they risk giving a Traitor away. Their only regular connection on-set is with the welfare team, with whom they meet twice daily.“The cast are looking for clues all the time … who we interview; how long we interview them for,” says Cotton. The worst-case scenario, Fay adds, would be for a production slip-up to be brought up at the round table as evidence. “We shouldn’t ever be a player in the game.”They are summoned to the nightly round table remotely, by a song – The Hanging Tree, the theme from The Hunger Games films – playing through the castle.The Big Brother-style “diary room”, where players record their bits to camera, is also unmanned. Just outside, he points out a grille in the ground: the dungeon, where players were held during a season-two challenge – I can glimpse the dingy cell beneath my feet.The producers didn’t even know it existed during season one, Cotton tells us. He is more vague about the location of the “Traitors’ tower”, no doubt wanting to keep some secrets back – rumour has it, it’s closer to ground level (and potentially not even at the castle).Cotton has also heard the speculation online that the roundtable room is deliberately kept cold, so tempers run hot. “It’s just a big castle – it’s really hard to heat!” he says.All this reflects the frenzy surrounding the show. About300,000 people appliedto take part in series three, v just 20,000 for the first.Last season, the Faithfuls were fixated on the Traitors likely being predominantly women after criticism of the “boys’ club” of season two. (They were right.) Cotton denies that it was a deliberate course-correction – but you can see why the players would come to that conclusion, having so little else to go on.Now it’s my turn, as “ah-yoo, ah-yoo” sounds through the castle: The Hunger Games song, summoning us to the round table. One of our group instantly has to go for a nervous pee.On our way into the Great Hall, we pass the gleaming pile of gold coins – the prize pot – take our seats and don our blindfolds.View image in fullscreen‘I feel a stab of disappointment not to be chosen’ … Elle at the iconic round table.Photograph: Ruth Roxanne Board / BBCI have rarely ever felt so nervous nor, as Winkleman’s footsteps draw closer, so ambivalent. My assumption has always been that I’d make a great Traitor – and that I’d immediately be targeted, even as a Faithful, for my resting bitch face. Do I want to feel her tap my shoulder?But Winkleman stomps on past; I feel a brief stab of disappointment not to be chosen.We remove our blindfolds, blinking at each other. The room is cold but my face feels hot; I’m acutely conscious that I have literally nothing to go on.Winkleman, watching over us with her Mona-Lisa smile, asks that we address each other one by one with the magic words: “I’m 100% Faithful.”One journalist jumps on another’s intonation, finding it suspiciously at odds with his breezy demeanour earlier. The rest of us are only too happy to vote him out – and he admits he’s a Traitor. (He also happens to work for the Sun.)The response among us Faithfuls is instantaneous, as though we’ve been electrified by the table. The flood of relief is accompanied by a confidence boost. Maybe we’re great at this!Another Traitor remains. Not wanting to stay silent, I start talking. With far more conviction than I feel, I argue that I heard rustling to my left, singling out another woman, the youngest at the table. She looks innocent – perhaps too innocent … Enough players are somehow persuaded that we agree to vote her out.She actuallyis100% Faithful; I feel terrible, as if I’ve shot Bambi. But before I can find out the size of the target I’ve placed upon my back, Winkleman mercifully ends the game.Some players are so eager to be selected for the dark side – she tells us, having shed her steely gameplay persona – they try to signal their enthusiasm at the first round table. “People offer their shoulders,” Winkleman says, miming an alluring shrug. (Of her own stop-start loop around the table – which she does four or five times for filming – she jokes: “Have you seen dressage?”)The producers join us, carrying a couple of Traitor’s cloaks, long and lined with green satin. The fabric is heavy, Fay jokes as she drapes it over one of my fellow Faithfuls, “so that you feel the weight on your shoulders”. I still can’t shake the sense of blood on my hands.As we pile back into the minivan, to return to civilisation, my mind goes to the people arriving tomorrow to play the game of their lives. At least now I know the role I’m best suited to: neither Traitor, nor Faithful, but watching at home.The Celebrity Traitors airs on BBC One on 8 October at 9pmExplore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That childhood, from 10 to 14, was spent in the “model” camp at Terezín, where Jews died from malnutrition rather than extermination.It left an indelible stamp on the Czech writer’s mind and work as it taught him that “life can be snapped like a piece of string”. As did his four decades of struggle with the repressive communist regime that blighted Czech culture until the Velvet Revolution of 1989, led by his friend and fellow-dissidentVaclav Havel.Yet the best of Klíma’s 30-plus books interrogate not so much these vast tragic histories as the small wars, defeats and victories of domestic life. The resilient survivor of two tyrannies said: “Fiction should concentrate on human life and relationships, not politics.” His ironic and humane vision feels distant from the intellectual essay-novel perfected by his compatriotMilan Kundera.“It’s risky to have too many ideas in a novel,” he warned, and insisted that “most of what I have written does not rely on the existence of any particular regime.” All the same, in landmark novels such as Love and Garbage, Judge on Trial and Waiting for the Dark, Waiting for the Light, the forces of power, violence and revolt echo through the characters’ limited worlds.Klíma was born in the still-young state of Czechoslovakia to parents whose Jewish ancestry had ceased, so they believed, to count in daily life; until the Munich crisis of 1938 (when Ivan was turning seven), “I had never heard the word ‘Jew’,” he said. He was baptised a Moravian Protestant. His father, Vilém, worked as an electrical engineer, someone who “cured motors and machines, and even invented some of them”; his multilingual mother, Marta, was a secretary. After the war they changed their name from Kauders to the Czech-sounding Klíma.In 1939, after the Nazi takeover, the shadow of persecution fell over the family. Ivan had to wear the yellow star “that made me feel ashamed”. His father had secured a job in a Liverpool factory but refused to leave his visa-less relatives behind. The Klímas were incarcerated in Terezín in 1941; Vilém’s electrical skills helped them avoid transfer to a death camp. Understated as ever, Ivan recalled being “hungry, not starving”.“We survived,” he wrote, “but the Germans took away all of my friends” – to Auschwitz. When he worked as a hospital orderly after the Soviet invasion of 1968, colleagues noted his relaxed attitude to corpses. As he told Maya Jaggi, fora Guardian profile, “I was used to seeing dead bodies.” Years of hardship left marks: he would pocket apples at literary events and, used to harsh camp lights, slept with a scarf over his face.In fiction, he charted the erotic complications that, for many Czechs, took the place of 'higher goals'As communists took control in postwar Czechoslovakia, Klíma studied at Charles University in Prague. He wrote a thesis on the visionary satirist Karel Čapek, in whose work he found a “liberating antidote of democratic thinking”. At his history teacher’s invitation, Ivan had reluctantly joined the Communist party. But his father (like many other skilled workers) received a jail term on phoney charges of “sabotage” in 1953. Ivan’s party branch, like some “merciless holy order”, had tried to force him to denounce his parent.After graduation Klíma became a magazine and publishers’ editor; his co-editors on the journal Kveten included Kundera. There, “we tried to write without the ever-present ideological agitation”.From 1964 to 1967 he served as deputy editor of the writers’ union journal, Literární Noviny, as calls for cultural freedom grew louder, and then, after its suppression, co-founded a successor: Literární Listy. In 1958 he had married Helena Mala, a psychotherapist; they had two children, Michal, who would become a journalist and editor, and Hana, an artist.Klíma wrote absurdist plays as well as fiction; the Royal Shakespeare Company promised to stage one, but backed out. In 1967, he sensationally demanded an end to censorship at the writers’ union conference. As editor and author, Klíma helped the Prague Spring bloom with like-minded friends such asLudvík Vaculíkand Pavel Kohout. But when Soviet tanks rolled in to crush the movement in August 1968, Klíma was in London with a younger girlfriend, while his wife spent time on an Israeli kibbutz: the sort of tangled mess his fiction explores.He returned to Prague and the following year took up a post at the University of Michigan. But he returned in 1970, as “I was needed at home.” He later recalled that “There’s nothing worse than exile for the writer.”As contemporaries such as Kundera (in Paris) andJosef Škvorecký(in Toronto) fought Gustáv Husák’s Soviet puppet regime from afar, Klíma toughed it out at home. He paid the price: a spell of menial jobs, from garbage collector to engine-driver and surveyor’s assistant, later wittily memorialised in Love and Garbage (1986) and My Golden Trades (1992).He lost his passport and driving licence, enduring daily state surveillance and a two-decade publication ban – although he did have a few cartoon screenplays made. Still, the deadpan ironist felt glad that “compared to the war, no one was trying to kill me”.In Prague he hosted gatherings of dissident writers and organised the smuggling abroad of underground,samizdat, literature, often typed on 14 stacked sheets on thin airmail paper. About 300 works saw the light in this way. In place of conspicuous persecution, the regime made dissidents invisible. “People thought we lived in exile,” he said. “In a way, we did.”In his work, much not published at home until after the 1989 revolution, Klíma unpicked the knots of compromise and complicity that made life bearable. Because “the system never allowed you to win,” he wrote, “it saved you from defeat as well.”Compromise tempted him as well as his characters: to the surprise even of the secret police, he did not sign the Charter 77 human-rights manifesto, as he feared his name would wreck his daughter’s chances of an art-school place. In fiction, he charted the erotic complications that, for many Czechs, took the place of “higher goals”, and offered the illusory belief that “at least in one area of our lives we were free”. Klíma had other affairs himself, but he and Helena never divorced.Outsiders did relieve the isolation. To the visiting novelistPhilip Roth, Klíma served as “my principal reality instructor” in Prague. (Roth also likened the droll Czech with his Beatle haircut to a “highly intellectually evolved” Ringo Starr.) International contacts, and the foreign outlets for Klíma’s work secured by the Polish-born Swedish publisher Adam Bromberg, eased the transition to freedom in the late 1980s as the regime withered.After the Velvet Revolution, Klíma, who had re-founded Czech PEN in 1989, found himself a bestselling celebrity. There were queues to buy titles such as My Merry Mornings, with an astonishing print-run (by Czech standards) of 150,000.That mania soon passed, to his relief. Freedom, he noted, quickly became a taken-for-granted state. Although works such as his landmark novel Judge on Trial (1986) charted public landscapes of principle, cynicism and deception, much of his fiction still dealt with desire, distrust and betrayal on a domestic scale. The themes of “love, infidelity and reconciliation”, as he described them, loomed large in novels such as No Saints Or Angels (1999), with its well-drawn female narrator.Klíma surveyed his own history in a captivating memoir,My Crazy Century(2009; English translation 2013), but – unlike Havel – never tried to climb on to the stage of political action. Having outlived communism in all its three stages (“tough, liberal, tired”), he had no wish to shape its successors.He lived and wrote in a woodland area south of Prague with his children and four grandchildren nearby. He did, belatedly, pick up public honours: the Kafka prize, and the medal for “outstanding service” to the Czech Republic.In later years he published less but maintained his robust faith in fiction as the route to truth. “You may throw a hundred appeals for justice out with the garbage and no heart will tremble,” as My Golden Trades puts it, “but you cannot silence a hundred stories.”He is survived by Helena, Michal, Hana and his grandchildren.Ivan Klíma, writer, born 14 September 1931; died 4 October 2025Explore more on these topicsFiction in translationFictionCommunismobituariesShareReuse this content"

Step into your local supermarket and it’s immediately apparent: “Enter if you dare” reads an orange arch in my Sainsbury’s, and do I? There are pumpkin mugs, tealight holders, slipper socks, bibs, babygrows and adorable hat and jumper sets. Asda has fidget spinners, subtle pale greenpumpkin soap dispenserswith matchingtoothbrush beakers, and chunky knitted “Fair Isle” ones, while B&M offers “boucle stacking pumpkins”. Lucy Sweet of theLucyverse newsletter, which plumbs the depths of ill-advised seasonal retail, has spotted more: “This is particularly gourd-forsaken,” she says, showing me, in quick succession, a nutcracker with a pumpkin face and a “harvest gnome” holding one, a ceramic Highland cow bathing in a pumpkin, and a pumpkin-shaped LED lantern with crosses for eyes.Why this obsession? Because I must declare a (lack of) interest: I don’t get pumpkins. When I was little, atHalloween, we hacked at a swede for hours, hung it from a string with a candle in and that was it. Plus, my kids grew up in Belgium where Halloween was a pumpkin-free non-event. I’ve never enjoyed eating them – the only pumpkin pie I ever ate was so disgusting I’ve refused to try it again. But the evidence is overwhelming: pumpkins are taking over as an aesthetic, an autumn flavouring and full-on festivity. I need to learn to love, or at least understand, our new orange overlords.View image in fullscreenSigns point to Instagram-worthy opportunities at the Farmer Copleys festival.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianDespite my stepfather – chief swede whittler – claiming there were “no pumpkins in the north before 1986”, the pumpkin is not a recent arrival to the UK. Native to the Americas, they arrived here with New World exploration in the early 16th century. When a country that had known only “bottle gourds and cucumbers” first caught sight of them, “Our minds were blown because they were colourful and tasty”, says food historian Annie Gray, author ofThe Bookshop, The Draper, The Candlestick Maker. We preserved them and baked them in pies: a 1598 recipe, she tells me, calls for grated pumpkin boiled with “udder suet” (and other delights), sugar, saffron and cinnamon, and baked in a pastry shell. But their popularity as a food waned – for the Victorians, they were more a horticultural curiosity.Pumpkin spice – that bullying blend of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice – hastaken over the world, but you see less orange-fleshed food about, probably, Gray says, because people try to eat carving pumpkins and get put off: “They’re grown specifically to cut, so they taste horrible.” Gray recommends investigating the “wider world of squashes”, and suggests I test a recipe first seen in the 1650s for “pompion pye”: a “weird”, she admits, pumpkin omelette in pastry with unhinged seasonings – nutmeg, cinnamon and mace, but also oregano, rosemary, thyme and parsley.View image in fullscreen‘Medusa’ … a pumpkin carving by Jamie Jones.Photograph: The Pumpkin FreakMeanwhile, having put out a call for palatable pumpkin recipes, I am inundated with sensible, even tempting, suggestions from pumpkin propagandists – soups, curries and spiced flatbreads; any number of ways of tackling the gourd’s naturally sweet blandness. I’m lazy, though, so instead I scour the supermarket for pumpkin products: gnocchi are palatable, but pointless; pumpkin fritters with edamame and ginger would be nicer without the pumpkin; pumpkin-spiced oat milk is like suckling a seasonal plug-in air freshener, but, in fairness, that’s the spices, not the 2% pumpkin puree. Discouraged, I park the “pye” for now.Whether or not you care to eat pumpkin, everyone has encountered the grimacing lantern format, aCeltic tradition using turnips and even potatoesthat crossed the Atlantic to become huge, orange, business. Even I have carved a few, knives skidding off the impenetrable skin, the inner ooze, seeds and stringy bits flying everywhere. Why so slimy, pumpkins? “It’s probably the bit I dislike the most,” says Jamie Jones, self-confessedPumpkin Freakand UK carver extraordinaire. Jones started carving after watching the US showHalloween Warswhile “horribly hungover” one year, and deciding to have a go. He hosted a pumpkin carving party and “from there, it’s just spiralled out of control”. He now takes two weeks off work each year to produce extraordinary bespoke pumpkins for corporates and individuals, charging £300 to £1500. No wonder: it can take Jones and his miniature chisels up to 20 hours to create masterpieces, such asa Night of the Living Dead mastergourdor “Putkin” (Putin in pumpkin form – haunting).

Copley was an early adopter: “I believe I am the first person in the UK to doa pumpkin festival,” he says. “Where did it come from? I stole it from America, obviously.” After getting ideas from farm marketing conferences stateside, the germ of today’s festival was born in 2006. “I grew a few pumpkins, we put them in a square in the shop and let kids come and carve them.” The next year, “I grew an acre and a half of pumpkins; we had some cut-outs of witches and a burger van”. It was immediately popular, doubling in size every year until 2017 when, one weekend, “20,000 people tried to get into the farm to pick pumpkins. There was a 12-mile tailback”.Now Copley caps capacity at 8,000 a day, but the festival gets more elaborate each year. This year, there are 300,000 pumpkins of nearly 50 varieties, vintage fairground rides, live music, street food, toast your own s’mores, story-telling and fancy dress. Heather dresses up as a green witch and tells kids the story of Spookley the Square Pumpkin (a celebration of diversity): “Sometimes I think, I went to university and now I’m doing dog fancy dress …” In recent years, Copley says, “It’s more to do with Instagram and TikTok and Facebook”, but it’s also a tradition that has built organically, with families returning year on year, marking the passage of time at the “How Tall this Fall” sign. If you can bag a photo there eight years running, you get free entry for life; usually it’s £6.70 off-peak, peak is a mysterious £8.76, and under-threes go free.View image in fullscreenTom Pearcy paddling his pumpkin boat in 2018.Photograph: Charlotte Graham/Rex/ShutterstockCopleys Pumpkin festival is a month-long juggernaut, but there’s more and more competition. I count five pumpkin patches in my immediate area, a phenomenon replicated around the country. “I’ve never seen so many pop-ups as this year,” says Copley. “I think it’s because farmers are struggling a bit and they’re seeing it as quite an easy diversification.”Tom Pearcy, chairman of theNational Farm Attractions Network, agrees: “The pumpkin market is getting very busy,” he says, estimating 90% of his members are in the gourd game, with many finding it’s their busiest season. “The growth of pumpkins has really been exponential since the Instagram generation,” he says, dating its wholescale adoption in the UK to the Walmart takeover of Asda in 1999. “I don’t know whether it’s just the Instagrammability of little orange globes, but farm attractions have been very good at creating nice photo ops, nice food and all these bits and pieces.”Pearcy was another pumpkin patch pioneer (his York Maze business has now pivoted to a scarier “Hallowscream” concept); he famouslypaddled a giant pumpkin down the River Ouse in 2018to promote it, the only pumpkin event to penetrate my consciousness, until now. “It probably wasn’t the brightest idea I’ve ever had, Emma,” he says. “It was the most unstable thing, one wobble and it felt like it was going over. Then, because it was full of wet mush inside, the wet cold liquid froze my knees. I was in absolute agony. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else.”View image in fullscreenDogs love posing with pumpkins too.Photograph: IzaLysonArts/Getty Images/500pxBesides, there are better things to do with pumpkins. Back in Pontefract, Linda and Lindsay are purposefully filling their barrow. “In our porch, we do a display. We’re going to do one as Frankenstein, one as a bat, a grinch … whatever takes our fancy, lots of different colours.” I ask them for advice on making the most of my day. “Wander around,” Linda advises me, “Make sure you have a glass of prosecco while you’re doing it, and pick the pumpkins you want.” I do, and find there’s a delicious scent of toasted marshmallow, the gentle twang of country music and happy families pushing barrows in all directions, discussing which pumpkins to pick. I barely hear a single argument; everyone is grabbing a few hours of orange joy. How lovely; how un-British.View image in fullscreenA set piece at Farmer Copleys festival in Pontefract.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianI plump for Copley’s recommended “traditional eating pumpkin”, then when I get home, high on all this wholesomeness, I decide it’s time to make pompion pye. I fry pumpkin, and add eggs, sugar and the bizarre herb and spice blend to make a “froise”(or froiz – a medieval term for this omelette thing). I layer it in a shortcrust shell with apples and currants (well, raisins) then bake. When it emerges, I pour a “caudle” – a custard of egg yolk and sweet wine – down the central hole. Once it cools, I cut a slice and taste cautiously. It’s … actually not that bad. My husband, who hates pumpkin spice with the heat of a thousand suns, actually eats two slices. It’s a Fall miracle.Of course, after a month of Cinderella-style glow-up, come 1 November, pumpkins turn back into, well, pumpkins. “They’re absolutely worthless,” as Pearcy puts it. What aboutall the waste? At Copleys, signs explain that 18,000 tonnes of pumpkin are wasted each year, hoping to persuade people to eat their purchases. The farm usually ends up with about 10% unsold most years. “The Americans do what they call a pumpkin smash,” Copley tells me. “People come with baseball bats and hit ’em, drop ’em out of helicopters, they fire ’em out of cannons. It just doesn’t sit well with me.” Instead, those that don’t get picked get ploughed back into the soil. “They’re worm food.” Hearing that, I feel an instinctive, immediate pang of sympathy for the poor unpicked pumpkins. Maybe I finally get the gourd?Explore more on these topicsHalloweenPumpkinFoodFruitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Check, check, check.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Ladylike clothes have a fashion revival every few years because the attitude they represent – charming, but steely – has an evergreen appeal. Ladylike is not be underestimated, and has never looked better than in the latest fashion iteration. When it feels this modern, what’s not to love?If you thought neat sweaters, faux fur stoles, cute skirts and charming vintage jewellery were over, think again. Ladylike fashion is back in a big way. I try not to bang on about catwalk shows too much in these columns because I feel they are best not taken too literally, but theMiu Miu autumn 2025 collection, shown in Paris earlier this year, was a watershed moment for ladylike. The cloche hats and slip dresses, and bullet bras poking out proud under sheer pastel sweaters, were deliciously retro and bracingly up to date at the same time.Ladylike is often underestimated as a vibe because its tone is softly spoken … but it’s no pushoverI’m not seriously suggesting stoles and bullet bras for the school run. Catwalk fashion is always best consumed with a hefty pinch of salt. But there were lots of details in that Miu Miu show that are genuinely useful hacks for making ladylike fashion feel modern. An unexpected shoe or sock – or both – goes a long way towards bringing a look that can feel stuck in the 20th century racing into the 21st. A loafer instead of a dainty slingback or ballet flat brings a pleasing “don’t-mess” grounded heft to the silhouette, but still feels in character for clothes that are proper and preppy. Or you could wear a kitten heel, but with a ribbed sock.View image in fullscreenThe Miu Miu autumn/winter 2025 show.Photograph: Victor Boyko/Getty ImagesLadylike is often underestimated as a vibe because its tone is softly spoken and doesn’t shout over people to be heard. But while ladylike is feminine, it is not merely decorative. Ladylike is polite, but it is not a pushover. It has the quiet power that is commanded by having good manners. There is a rigour to ladylike posture: legs demurely crossed at the ankle when sitting, yes, but more importantly, back straight and chin up.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: wear any shade this autumn – just as long as it’s whiteRead moreKey to making ladylike look modern is that your outfit should have an element that is quite solid and sturdy. Resist the social conditioning that tells you to try to look delicate. Balance flimsy elements – a lace-trim skirt – with something that stands its ground like a chunky knit or a blazer. Have fun with colour. This is one of the best things about the ladylike trend. These clothes work really well in slightly bonkers pastels: lime, lilac, that sort of thing. Avoid fussing too much about matchy-matchy colour coordination or you will start to look a bit like an Easter egg, which is not where we are going with this. Instead, mix pastels with regular colours – lime with blue-jean blue, bubblegum pink with burgundy, lilac with chocolate brown.This version of ladylike doesn’t take it too seriously. Polka dots are very much the vibe: they always look smart, but they also make you smile. A polka dot silk dress with a chunky boot, perhaps. One of the nice things about wearing clothes that have a certain formality of pitch to them – tweed jackets, polka dot silks, lace‑edged skirts – is that you have scope to add a little messiness. To knock the edges off, if you know what I mean. Instead of wearing one pretty necklace, you could wear three of different lengths. I might experiment with a proper, structured handbag, and if I do, I’m not ruling out adding a bag charm or two. Ladies: shall we lunch?Model: Ellen at Body London.

But you’ll see many more that aren’t so recognizable: gum arabic, dextrin, carnauba wax, soya lecithin and E100.There are34 ingredientsin M&Ms, and, according to Mars, the company that produces the candy, at least 30 countries – fromIvory CoasttoNew Zealand– are involved in supplying them. Each has its own supply chain that transforms the raw materials into ingredients – cocoa into cocoa liquor, cane into sugar, petroleum into blue food dye.These ingredients then travel across the world to a central processing facility where they are combined and transformed into tiny blue, red, yellow and green chocolate gems.It’s becoming better understood that food systems area major driver of the climate crisis. Scientists can examine deforestation for agriculture, or the methane emissions from livestock. But the environmental impact of ultra-processed foods – like M&Ms – is less clear and is only now starting to come into focus. One reason they have been so difficult to assess is the very nature of UPFs: these industrially made foods include a huge number of ingredients and processes to put them together, making it nearly impossible to track.But it doesn’t mean it’s not important. As UPFs take over US grocery store shelves and diets– they now comprise70%of food sold in grocery stores, andmore than halfof calories consumed – experts say that understanding their environmental toll is critical to build a more climate-friendly food system.What weknowWhile scientists are only starting to examine the environmental impact of UPFs, what’s already known about them is worrisome.“The more processed foods are, the more deleterious they are to human health and the environment,” said Anthony Fardet, a senior researcher at the French National Institute for Agriculture,Foodand the Environment. The main reason, he explains, is that the ingredients are so energy intensive. When combined, the toll balloons.Take M&Ms. The first step in creating the candies is farming for cocoa, sugar, dairy and palm.It has been well-documented that agriculture for ingredients like cocoa drivesever increasingrates of deforestation across the globe. Since 1850, agricultural expansion has drivenalmost 90%of global deforestation, which has been responsible for30%of global greenhouse gas emissions. Mars corporation has beencalled outin the past for the cocoa farming practices in their supply chain, and have since createdsustainability plans, but these fail to address that large-scale agricultural practices like cocoa farming are, at their core,unsustainable.Then there’s sugar, milk solids and palm fat – also major greenhouse gas emitters.On top of that are the industrially made ingredients like food dyes – perhaps the signature of ultra-processing – which M&Ms contain 13 different types of. Blue M&Ms are colored with dyes E132 and E133; these dyes are mostly made in food dye manufacturing hotspots India and China,via a chemical reactionof aromatic hydrocarbons (which are petroleum products) with diazonium salt, catalyzed by the metals copper and chromium.View image in fullscreenM&Ms for sale in Orlando, Florida, in 2019.Photograph: Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesCreating soya lecithin, an additive made fromsoybean oilthat’s used to change the consistency of chocolate, requires steps like degumming in a hot reactor, chemically isolating phospholipids, decolorization using hydrogen peroxide and drying under vacuum pressure. Anddextrose, a sweetener, starts off as corn that gets steeped in acid before being milled, separated and dried. From there, it’s broken down into smaller molecules using enzymes and acids, and then recrystallized.Mars declined to comment for this story.While ultra-processed chocolate products are some of the worst offenders, other kinds of UPFs are taxing on the environment as well. Take for instance Doritos, which have39 ingredients. Corn is the main ingredient, and for every acre grown,1,000kgof carbon dioxide is emitted to the atmosphere. Like Mars, Pepsico, which makes Doritos, has developed its ownsustainability promises, but many of these promises are underpinned by practices that are considered greenwashing, like “regenerative agriculture”. In reality, these sustainability promises undercut the dire need to better understand how UPFs affect our global climate.As a result, some experts have started to calculate the environmental toll of UPFs.CarbonCloud, a Sweden-based software company that calculates the emissions of food products, analyzed carbon disclosures from Mars, and estimated that M&Ms generate at least13.2kgof carbon equivalents per kilogram of M&Ms produced. Mars produces more than664m kgof M&Ms in the US each year, which would mean that if CarbonCloud’s calculations are accurate, the candies emit at least 3.8m tons of carbon dioxide – making up 0.1% of annual emissions in the US. (Mars does not report emissions by product, but according to their 2024 emissions report, they emitted29m tonsof carbon dioxide across the company.)But this is only an estimate based on publicly available data; the true cost is probably much higher, experts say. There’s a “black box” when it comes to carbon accounting in the processed food industry, says Patrick Callery, a professor at the University of Vermont who researches how corporations engage with the climate crisis. “There is so much uncertainty as supply chains get complex.”What we don’t knowGetting an exact measure of the environmental toll of UPFs is nearly impossible, given that, definitionally, UPFs consist of many ingredients and a high volume of opaque processes. Ingredients aren’t just mixed together like one would do to make a stew at home. Instead, these ingredients are chemically modified, some parts stripped away, and flavors, dyes or textures added in – and it’s unclear what the cost of these processes are because so many suppliers and components are involved.Another reason is that all UPFs (again, definitionally) are the creations of food companies that have little incentive to disclose their environmental footprint and may not fully understand it to begin with.For instance, Mars itself doesn’t farm cocoa, but instead relies on hundreds of farms that don’t always have accurate carbon accounting measures in place. This means that emissions from big food corporations may be underreported. David Bryngelsson, co-founder of CarbonCloud, said that corporations “don’t have actual data, so they use emissions factors, which are guesses”.Callery says that corporations provide reports on simple things like transportation, which are easier to calculate, and often omit or convolute the agricultural emissions of their product. After all, reporting high emissions goes against the interests of large food corporations, so the complex calculations needed to determine the carbon footprint of large-scale agriculture and multi-step industrial chemical processes used to make UPF ingredients remain un-researched.“The main point of ultra-processed foods is money,” said Fardet, pointing out that they’re designed to be attractive, easy and pleasurable to eat.“Most of the people in the [food industry’s] value chain don’t care about climate change from an ideological point of view, but they do care about money,” said Bryngelsson. He explains that to shift those incentives, the value of foods and ingredients would need to incorporate their impact on our shared climate. But that would require government regulations and financial penalties based on the true environmental cost of UPFs, says Bryngelsson.Why it mattersAt just under $2, the price of M&Ms at the grocery store hardly reflects their true cost on the environment. But to address these problems with ultra-processed foods, more than just a few tweaks to the ingredient list are needed.“Reducing the salt, or sugar of just one product is just greenwashing,” said Fardet. “We need to change the whole picture.” To do that, he suggested consuming more locally sourced, whole foods, which often take much less energy and transit to produce, and therefore have a much smaller carbon footprint.Specialty goods that can’t be sourced locally, like chocolate, should make up a small fraction of our diet and come from traceable and ethical supply chains.That’s not easy for all Americans, given the rising cost of food and the prevalence of food deserts and mediocre food retailers across the US.That’s why it can’t just be up to individuals to make environmentally (and health) conscious choices, experts say. Instead, large food corporations need to be held responsible for the burden they place on society – particularly as it pertains to climate change. Sustainability practices, like the “Cocoa for Generations” plan outlined by Mars, or Pepsico’s “Pep+” initiatives are Band-Aids on broken bones. Large food corporations need to be phased out to make global food systemssustainable.But perhaps more important is to change our understanding of the hidden costs of ultra-processed foods, says Fardet, whether it’s at home, in schools or through the banning the marketing of UPFs to children. Our food systems, Fardet said, “are absolutely not normal. The whole industry should pay the hidden costs.”Explore more on these topicsUltra-processed foodsOur unequal earthFoodDiets and dietingHealthPepsicoChocolatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It opened in 2015 as a sister to thenow closed Contra, an impeccable fine-dining restaurant, and the same precision and ingenuity was applied to Wildair’s dishes, which have that perfect balance of elevated refinement and skilled execution, all combined with a casual playfulness. You can probably imagine my excitement, then, when I found out that one of my favourite dishes from one of my favourite restaurants also just happened to save waste by making an emulsion from the outer leaves of little gem lettuce cooked in butter. Pure genius.Green “mayonnaise”’ with little gem saladOnly I would say this, but finding a use for the outer leaves of a lettuce has always niggled me. They’re nature’s plastic-free wrapping that protects the lettuce inside. Composting unwanted veg scraps is zero-waste 101, and a hugely powerful practice. Turning surplus food into fertile soil, rather than a waste product that ends up in landfill (where it may release methane, a greenhouse gas about 20-30 times more harmful than Co2), is a no-brainer, and something that many of us can easily do.It’s quite radical, when you think about it: food rots and becomes the perfect soil to nourish further crops, thereby closing the loop and honouring the cycle of life. But, of course, we’re producing over 30% more food than we actually need, and using up precious and finite resources in the process. Reducing waste is worthwhile for that reason alone, not to mention the money it saves.You can cook lettuce leaves like any leafy green (seemy recipefor lettuce bag salad soup), but Wildair’s iconic recipe has a genius technique for using up the outer leaves. They’re wilted in butter, then turned into an emulsion, or “mayo”, by blending them with pistachios, which is then used to dress the rest of the lettuce for a salad. Even if you dress the salad liberally with the green mayonnaise, you’ll undoubtedly have some left over, but it keeps in the fridge for up three days and works on almost anything, from other salads to roast vegetables, grilled chicken or even drizzled over pasta or rice. I’ve adapted Wildair’s recipe a little so it works with any lettuce and nuts, and have also used a whole egg in the emulsion instead of just the yolk, to save having to find a use for the white.Serves2For the green “mayonnaise” (makes about 200g, or enough for 4-6 servings)100g butter50g outer leaves from two little gems, or other lettuce, washed and dried thoroughly20g shelled salted pistachios, or other nuts – white nuts such as pine nuts, cashews or blanched almonds will help keep the colour vivid, but anything works, really1 small whole eggFor the salad2 little gem lettuces, halved lengthwaysExtra-virgin olive oil, to tasteLemon juice, or white-wine vinegar, to taste1 small handful fresh soft herbs(eg, chives, chervil, dill or parsley), leaves picked whole, stalks finely chopped)First make the mayo. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the outer lettuce leaves, cover with a lid and cook for about a minute, stirring once or twice, until they’ve wilted. Tip into the jug of an immersion blender, add the pistachios and egg, then blend smooth; add more nuts, if need be, to give the mixture a mayonnaise-like thickness. Store in an airtight jar in the fridge for up to three days.To build the salad, drizzle each little-gem half with olive oil and lemon juice, then season generously. Dress with a tight zigzag of the green mayo, then scatter over the herbs. Arrange on two plates and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsSaladWaste notFoodFood wasteVegetablesSauces and graviesHerbs and spicesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’d kick through piles of leaves to find them, then bring them home to score and roast on the fire. I remember always burning my fingers as I tried to peel them, yet still I went back for more. To me, autumn is all about earthy flavours and a comforting sense of nostalgia. It also marks a new chapter in the kitchen, because the start of any new season is the most exciting time in a restaurant, when we get a whole new set of ingredients to work with. Today’s two first courses draw on those earthy, autumnal qualities, and work just as well for a light lunch as they do for a relaxed starter, with plenty of room for manoeuvre depending on how hungry you and your guests are.Butter bean velouté with mixed mushrooms and pickled onions (pictured top)Prep15 minPickle2 hrCook40 minServes4For the pickled onions1 small red onion, peeled300ml cider vinegar3 tbsp golden caster sugar1 tbsp salt6 black peppercornsFor the butter bean velouté700g jar large butter beans50g olive oil1 tbsp lemon juiceFinely grated zest of ½ lemonSalt and pepperFor the mushrooms50g oyster mushrooms50gshiitake mushrooms50g girollesOlive oil20g butter1 garlic clove, peeled and bashedTo serve1 tbsp pumpkin seeds1 pinchespelettepepper30g curly parsley, choppedCrispy chilli oil(optional)Finely slice the onion into rings and put them in a sieve. Put the vinegar, sugar, salt and peppercorns in a saucepan, bring to a simmer and cook for a minute, stirring so the salt and sugar dissolve. Take off the heat.Fill and boil the kettle, then pour the boiling water over the onion rings and leave to drain and cool. Once the onions are cool to the touch, pack the rings into a sterilised 500g jar, then pour over the warm pickling liquor, seal and leave to steep for at least two hours.Drain the beans, reserving all the jar liquor, and set aside a few whole beans to use as a garnish at the end. Put the rest of the beans in a blender with the olive oil, lemon juice and zest, and blitz until completely smooth; you may need to add a splash of water to achieve the smoothest consistency. Add the reserved jar liquor, season to taste and blitz again. The velouté is now ready, to be served at room temperature or gently warmed through.Wipe all the mushrooms with a damp cloth, then cut into equal-sized slices. Put a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan on a high heat, then add all the mushrooms and, after a couple of minutes, when they begin to crisp and take on a bit of colour, add the butter and garlic, and season to taste. Cook for a further couple of minutes, until the mushrooms are browned, then lift them out of the pan and spread out on a plate lined with kitchen paper, to soak up any excess water. Discard the garlic.Now to finish the dish. Toast the pumpkin seeds in a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for 12 minutes, then remove and season immediately with salt and espelette pepper. Divide the cooked mushrooms and reserved whole butter beans between four soup bowls. Pour the veloutéà tablefor a dash of wow factor, then serve topped with some pickled onions, toasted seeds and parsley. If you like, finish with a drizzle of extra olive oil or, my favourite, crispy chilli oil.Squid with padrón peppers and toasted almondsView image in fullscreenEmily Roux’s squid with padron peppers and toasted almonds.You’ll need to give the squid at least eight hours so the marinade can work its magic.Prep10 minMarinate8 hr+Cook25 minServes4For the squid and peppers500g cleaned and gutted sustainably-sourced squid12 padrón peppers1 red chilli2 tsp sesame oilZest and juice of½ lime1 tbsp finely chopped garlic1 sprig fresh thyme, leaves picked3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to finish50ml cooking sakeTo finish30g flaked almonds4 thick slices of sourdoughFinely grated zest of ½ lemon1 sprig fresh coriander, leaves picked and choppedCut the squid into triangles and put them in a bowl.

The accounts were introduced in 2011 to replace the child trust fund (CTF), which was discontinued amid government spending cuts. Unlike CTFs, juniorIsasare not started with a government voucher – all of the contributions are voluntary.Parents or guardians open an account on a child’s behalf, and anyone can contribute to it. The maximum that can be paid in each year is £9,000.The money is locked away until the child turns 18, at which point they can do what they want with it.Stocks and shares: where to start if you want to become an investorRead moreThere are two types of junior Isa: a cash version, which is like a traditional savings account; or an investment version, which can hold stocks and shares or funds. A child can have both at the same time, but only one of each type. The total annual contribution across both is capped at £9,000, meaning parents can split savings between cash and investments within that limit.If parents gift money to their children and it’s saved outside a junior Isa, any interest above £100 a year for each parent is taxed as the parent’s income, not the child’s. This could create a tax bill if it pushes the parent over their allowances. In a junior Isa, all growth is tax-free, which is why many parents choose them.View image in fullscreenJunior Isas replaced the Child Trust Fund.Photograph: Leonora Oates/AlamyTo get started, parents will need their own national insurance number, their child’s details, and information about any existing CTF or junior Isa they plan to transfer.Laura Suter, the director of personal finance at the investment company AJ Bell, says: “Whichever parent opens the account will be the registered contact, who is then responsible for choosing investments and managing the account until they turn 18. If your child already has a CTF, you’ll need to transfer it over when opening a junior Isa, as both accounts can’t be held at the same time.”Compare accountsAnna Bowes, a personal savings expert at The Private Office, says one of the simplest ways to begin is with a cash savings account. “These are easy to understand and can also help children to get excited about the importance of saving as they grow, getting them into the saving habit from an early age,” she says.Suter says you should shop around to make sure you get the best returns available. “If you’re opting for a cash junior Isa account you should hunt out the best interest rate on offer,” she says. “Many banks and building societies will rely on people not moving their money when interest rates drop, but if you want to make the most of your child’s future savings you should make a note to keep checking you’re getting the best rate. If your provider has cut rates, you should switch to a better deal.”Bowes says: “Currently the top rate is with Coventry building society and this can be opened by post, in branch or by telephone, and managed in branch or by phone.” However, she adds that although some accounts can be opened online, this may mean missing out on the best rates.Save depending on your budget“Some people set up a monthly direct debit, others just put in a lump sum for birthdays and Christmas,” Suter says.If you can save a small amount regularly into a junior Isa, it can really build upover time, she says. “For example, assuming your investments grow by 5% a year after charges, investing £50 per month from birth would leave your child with a pot worth £18,050 by age 18.”If you can afford to invest the full £9,000 junior Isa allowance each year, also growing at 5% a year after charges, from birth to age 18 it would give a pot of £265,851.“The generous £9,000 allowance, comes with the trade-off that the money is locked up until the child turns 18, says Charlene Young from AJ Bell. “Junior Isas are a great way to build a meaningful nest egg for children to be able to put towards university fees, house deposit, or to take on as an Isa of their own having learned about investing in the meantime. But it does rule out using the funds for goals and spending before 18.”Consider an investment accountDespite the long-term nature of these accounts, Suter says that many parents still default to cash. “Government data shows 42% of all money paid into junior Isas in 2022-23 went into cash junior Isas, rather than the investment version,” she says. But she emphasises the benefits of investing: “A stocks and shares junior Isa will usually have plenty of time to ride out any short-term dips in the market. History also shows that investing typically delivers better returns over the long term.”View image in fullscreenFinancial data displayed on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange. Investment Isa types often grow much more than cash Isas.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APSuter says over the past decade, £1,000 invested in a global tracker fund would now be worth £3,284, compared with £1,141 in a typical cash Isa, according to figures based on the Fidelity Index World Fund (the figures exclude any charges applied by the investment company you save through). The cash figures are based on Bank of England average rates.Young says: “Being in the markets does come with ups and down in the short term. Individual company shares can move the most in the short term, so many parents might prefer to use a multi-asset fund to insulate against the ups and downs of just one asset type, while still benefiting from the long-term gains on offer from investing. Although a cash version of a junior Isa is available, there is a significant risk that the value of the money could be eroded over the long term thanks to inflation.”A multi-asset fund can hold shares in a range of companies, plus other investments such as bonds. However, a multi-asset fund might not grow (or shrink) as much as a tracker fund specialising in one asset class, such as equities.If the funds are needed within a few years, Alex Shields of The Private Office says a cash savings account may be more appropriate. “Ultimately you need to consider the level of risk you are prepared to take with the investments as if any capital losses even in the short term are unacceptable, a stocks and shares junior Isa is unlikely to be appropriate,” he adds.Prepare for 18The funds ultimately belong to the child whose name the account is in, but they cannot access any of the money until they reach the age of 18. However, from age 16 a young person can manage their account or open their own one, giving them the chance to learn about investing and saving. You could support this by talking to them about what they have and how you have saved or invested it so far, and how you made those decisions.View image in fullscreenIn the past, at 18 your parents gave you a set of  keys to the house … now it seems they can give you a tax-free sum of £18,000 to look after.Photograph: Elisabeth Burrell/AlamyBowes says: “The funds cannot be accessed until the child becomes 18, but at that stage they will have unfettered access to it. They could also transfer it to an adult Isa to continue to receive tax-free interest or investment returns.”While some parents worry about handing over a large sum to an 18-year-old, Suter says that their research showed that fewer than one in 10 of our junior Isa holders withdrew the money and closed their account when they reached 18.Explore more on these topicsJunior IsasMoney hacksInvestmentsInvestment fundsIsasSavingsSaving moneySavings ratesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you do, you might have sleep bruxismMadeleine AggelerWed 8 Oct 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 12.02 EDTShareHow do you sleep at night? I don’t mean morally – I mean physically. Does your body soften and relax into a gentle slumber? Or do you, like roughly 8% of the adult population, spend your nightly repose gritting your teeth like an NFL coach whose team is behind in overtime?Even if you do, you might not know. Teeth grinding, also known as bruxism, occurs both during the day (awake bruxism) and at night (sleep bruxism).Sleepbruxism is generally harder to detect because, well, we’re asleep.“People are usually unaware of the condition,” says Dr Subha Giri, a dental sleep medicine expert at the Mayo Clinic. Instead, she says, night-time teeth grinders may be alerted “by caregivers or bed partners who hear grating, tapping or clicking sounds”.Below, what you need to know about sleep bruxism and how to manage it.What is sleep bruxism?Sleep bruxism is an “involuntary jaw-muscle activity such as grinding, clenching or jaw thrusting” that occurs while we sleep, says Dr Hosam Alraqiq, program director of the Dental Public Health Research Fellowship at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. If this happens regularly, it can damage teeth.The condition is more common during childhood and adolescence, when prevalence ranges from 14% to 18%, as opposed to 8% among adults, explains Giri.Experts aren’t sure what exactly causes sleep bruxism, but it tends to be more common in people with a family history of the condition, which suggests there is a genetic link, says Dr Michelle Drerup, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the Cleveland Clinic. It is also more likely to appear in individuals with medical conditions like sleep apnea, Parkinson’s disease, dementia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (Gerd), she says.Other risk factors include “stress, anxiety, alcohol use, smoking, excessive caffeine, and certain medications” like SSRIs and antipsychotics, Drerup says.How can you tell if you have sleep bruxism?Maybe you’ve been told that you click-clack like a typewriter when you sleep. But there are other ways to find out.“Dentists may detect patterns of tooth wear that indicate bruxism,” Giri says. For instance, the tooth surfaces that normally make contact during chewing might show “flattening or damage”.Symptoms like waking up with your teeth clenched, chronic jaw pain or dental sensitivity may also suggest that you’re grinding at night, says Alraqiq – but “the gold standard” for diagnosis is the sleep study, a diagnostic test in which healthcare providers monitor brain and body activity while the subject sleeps.What impact does sleep bruxism have on your health?Sleep bruxism is not always harmful, Alraqiq says. It can also be temporary. But in more serious and long-lasting cases, it can have a big impact on dental health – literally. People can clench their teeth with a “force of up to 250 pounds”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in more serious cases, where symptoms are causing problems and discomfort, “evaluation by a dentist or physician is essential”, she says. Dentists can make a custom nightguard. While this won’t stop the grinding, it will protect the teeth from damage.Sleep hygiene and behavioral adjustments are key to managing sleep bruxism, says Alraqiq. “Keeping a regular schedule, limiting caffeine, and creating a calm sleep environment can reduce triggers,” he says.In addition, Giri suggests relaxation techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy to manage the stress and anxiety which may lead to teeth grinding.In severe cases, healthcare providers may recommend botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, says Drerup. These can help “relax jaw muscles temporarily and reduce pain”.Giving your sleeping partner some nice earplugs probably wouldn’t hurt either.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe secrets of sleepSleepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While excessivesmartphoneuse is a worldwide phenomenon, authorities in Japan are taking action, amid growing concern over itsphysical and psychological toll, particularly on children and young people.Greyscale and prune your algorithm: ‘digital nutritionist’ offers advice on cutting down screen timeRead moreLast week, the town of Toyoake in centralJapanintroduced a measure limiting smartphone use among its 69,000 residents totwo hours a day, in what officials say was an attempt to tackle evidence of online addiction and sleep deprivation. The ordinance – passed by the town assembly last month – does not carry penalties for those who ignore it.Moriyama was among several people, all in their 20s, who accepted the Guardian’s challenge to keep their smartphone use to a maximum of two hours and share their experiences.There were resounding successes and abject failures.View image in fullscreenShoki Moriyama says two hours of phone use daily is ‘way too little’.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianMoriyama, who habitually checks LINE – an instant-messaging, news and entertainment “super app” popular in Japan – as well asTikTok, Instagram andX, conceded that staying off the sites, or at least dramatically curtailing his usage, had been a struggle.“I spend around eight hours a day on my phone, so two hours is way too little … and not enough time for me to stay up to date with everything,” he says. “In the end I used my smartphone for an hour and 50 minutes, which is a massive reduction on my usual screen time. I used the extra time to read a book, study a little and go to the gym, so my day wasn’t wasted.”His colleague Tomomi Hanaoka also managed to rein in her habit. “I spend about three hours on my phone on weekdays and six or seven hours at weekends, so two hours felt very short. Most people need at least three to four hours,” says Hanaoka, who usually “can’t do” without LINE, TikTok andInstagram.“I kept my usage to two hours and used the free time to read and do other things.”Akari Saito, a university student, got her caveats in early, “because my personality is such that setting limits on something makes me want to do it more”.While Saito welcomed the Toyoake initiative as a starting point for a wider discussion of smartphone use, she says the focus should be on the quality, not quantity, of screen time. “Although setting a boundary between learning and entertainment could be difficult.”Despite a valiant effort, Saito struggled to make inroads into her daily three to four hours of phone time. “I found it especially hard to put it away during my train commute to school or while I was walking. But I can see that reducing my phone use might make the day feel longer and allow me to spend it more meaningfully.”‘I don’t think my brain should have gone through that’: five young people on their experience of smartphones as teensRead moreYuri* has already tried to limit her smartphone use, usually when she has exams coming up, even going as far as to hide Instagram and set a password-activated lock for good measure.She uses her device to check social media, search for recipes, send texts and access study materials, although too much screen time gives her headaches and tired eyes.“I question why the ordinance directly recommends restricting smartphone use. If the goal is to encourage people to rethink their usage, they should be encouraged to set their own rules,” she says.“But I broadly agree with the suggested way of smartphone use – this is because I don’t need my smartphone for my hobbies and interests. But people who mainly use theirs for entertainment and stress relief will find measures like this hard to accept.”View image in fullscreenA man uses his smartphone to take a photo in Suzuka, Japan.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesToyoake’s mayor, Masafumi Koki, defended the measure, which drew dozens of complaints from residents who accused the local government of interfering in their private lives.Pointing out that he regularly uses his smartphone to keep an eye on baseball scores and consult maps – but puts it to one side during dinner – Koki says he was worried that children and younger people weresacrificing sleep and family timein favour of scrolling, texting and posting.After a wave of online criticism, some of which wrongly claimed the two-hour limit would be strictly enforced, he told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper: “If someone hears two hours, they’ll stop and think about how long they really use their smartphone for. That’s the point.”Children limiting own smartphone use to manage mental health, survey findsRead moreYoung Japanese spend an average of just over five hours a day online on weekdays, according to a survey released this year by the Children and Families Agency.Aya* spends considerably more time on her device than the national average, regularly clocking up eight hours a day.“I couldn’t limit myself to just two hours, but just being conscious of the challenge made a difference. In the end, I was able to cut my usual smartphone use by about 60%, which felt significant,” the university student says, conceding that she had consulted a travel planner and checked her emails and texts.She voiced support for the Toyoake initiative, speculating that the absence of penalties could be its biggest asset.“That’s precisely what makes it meaningful … you have to set your own rules and adjust them accordingly. It’s an important opportunity to think concretely about our daily habits, rather than just in an abstract way.”And she did not miss the hours she usually spends “aimlessly scrolling”.“I spent more time enjoying conversations and taking notice of what was happening around me. It made my day feel more meaningful.”That will be music to the ears of Koki. On the eve of his town’s controversial experiment in social engineering, the mayor insisted it would be worthwhile. “This is about sleep, family and wellbeing,” he says. “If the ordinance makes even a few people stop and talk about their habits, then it’s working.”*Name has been changed on request.Explore more on these topicsJapanSmartphonesSocial mediaHealth & wellbeingMental healthYoung peopleDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unlearn the routine of yore, where pimples were manhandled, stripped back with grainy scrubs and astringents, starved of all moisture, then nuked with alcohol or a peroxide paste that caused instant smarting and wincing.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Experts are now tackling acne with kid gloves. According to dermatologist Justine Hextall: “We are much more aware of the subtle differences in a blemish-prone skin. Not every presentation is an oily teenager with bulletproof skin that can tolerate alcohol-based washes alongside benzoyl peroxide, exfoliating acids and scrubs. For many, this skincare approach is the opposite of what is needed, and will be deleterious to skin.”While there is still an important place for actives like retinoids and salicylic and azelaic acids, the modern approach is about protecting the delicate skin barrier with gentle, kind ingredients like panthenol, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. These cushion the blow of the hard stuff, meaning people are less likely to suffer such irritation and discomfort that they quit what ultimately works. “In my experience, this approach is key,” says Hextall. A European consensus recommendationpublished in Maythis year agrees with her.“I find most acne sufferers are afraid of moisturisers,” Hextall says, “but the right ones can be very helpful. Gentle, hydrating skincare is especially important in adult acne, when skin is often dry and sensitive, and topical prescriptions are particularly difficult to tolerate.”‘Gentle, hydrating skincare is especially important in adult acne, as skin is often dry and sensitive’She and colleagues have found that barrier dysfunction caused by harsh acne skincare frequently crosses over with cases of rosacea and perioral dermatitis. A gentler approach can discourage their onset or flare-up.Like many dermatologists, Hextall recommends hydrating cleansers byCetaphil(£11.50) andCeraVe(£12.50), followed byLa Roche Posay’s Cicaplast B5 serum(£40) to replenish depleted hydration levels and calm the skin. Acne sufferers may also like Tower 28’s almost effortlessSOS spray(£28), which contains hypochlorous acid for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits. It can be tossed into a school backpack and topped up regularly.Topicals Sealed ActivePrimer(£30) is not so much a treatment as a helpful disguise, gently filling dips and scars to give uneven, acne-beaten skins a smoother appearance and a barrier between inflammation and makeup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I firmly plant my legs, stabilising a thrashing branch with my left hand as my right snips off a bunch of grapes. Local people claim the roaring mistral wind makes you crazy, which I can appreciate as each arid gust chaps my lips and desiccates my eyes.I’m atDomaine Rouge-Bleu, an organic vineyard in the Côtes du Rhône wine region in southern France. I have volunteered forles vendanges, the autumnal grape harvest where backbreaking work is doused in camaraderie.Participating in this time-honoured tradition had long been a dream of mine, a lifelong Francophile and food writer. So, in 2017, eager to understand more about winemaking beyond the bar stool, I joined a motley crew, trading sore arms and farmer tans for a hands-on course in viticulture and viniculture. I expected to gain an oenological education. I had not anticipated how hard the picking would be – nor how gratifying it felt to accomplish something so big together. Manyvendangeursgo back for more. I have returned almost every year since my first harvest, becoming friends with the owners of Domaine Rouge-Bleu.I had not anticipated how hard the picking would be – nor how gratifying it felt to accomplish something so big togetherFrance is one of thetop producers of wine worldwide, pouring 4.78bn litres of wine into the market each year. About 59,000 winemakers manage 789,000 hectares (nearly 2m acres) of vineyards. That’s a lot of grapes to pick. Since the Greeks first planted vines in France in the sixth century BC,raisins(grapes) have been harvested by hand. Machines arrived in the 1960s for speed and cost efficiency. Yet30%-40% of French wineriesstill retain the traditionalvendanges à la main(hand-picked harvests).Why would a winemaker opt for a method that costs more time and money? Renowned regions such asChampagneare required to do so to deliver the clustersto the press house intact. Grapevines can grow too close together to allow a machine to pass through. Some winemakers believe machines harm the vines and grapes. “You get better quality by hand since you only pick good grapes, without leaves, vines or oil from the machine,” says Thomas Bertrand, who co-owns Domaine Rouge-Bleu with his Australian partner Caroline Jones.View image in fullscreenDomaine Rouge-Bleu is owned by Australian Caroline Jones and her partner Thomas Bertrand.Photograph: Alexis SteinmanThe hard-working couple illustrate the realities of winemaking that are far from the glamour of Bordeaux chateaux. They bring in volunteers to cut costs. However, harvest volunteers are a legal minefield in France. The government insists winemakers pay harvesters, so some offer room and board in lieu of wages, though many refrain from doing so to avoid any issues. Many winemakers wish volunteers were recognised, for communal harvests have been part of the winemaking heritage for centuries. “Our métier is all about sharing and creating convivial moments,” says France Breton, who welcomes volunteer harvesters atDomaine Bretonin the Loire.For example,Vignerons Indépendants de Franceruns theVendangeur d’un Jour(harvester for a day) programme across France from late August to early October. “It is wonderful for wine tourism since so many want to pitch in,” says Jean-Marie Fabre, president of the association. You can also find opportunities on volunteer work sites such asWWOOF. I contacted wineries direct via introductions by my local wine bar, eventually finding Domaine Rouge-Bleu through its former owner, whose wife runs theFrench Word-A-Dayblog.Domaine Rouge-Bleu is in Sainte-Cécile-les-Vignes, a small town of 2,900 off the tourist track, despite its location in Provence. Fittingly for the town name –vignesare vines – the flat landscape is blanketed with grids of vineyards, with Mont Ventoux, the legendary Tour de France thigh-thumper, looming in the distance. At the end of a picturesque driveway lined with olive trees, a 17th-century farmhouse is home to Thomas, Caroline and their two girls. In harvest season, it swells withvendangeurs. I hit the roommate jackpot with Hannah, a perky Brit who works at a wine shop. Our 16-person team hails from France, the UK, Ireland, Australia and the US, my homeland.Conversation inevitably flows, profound at times due to the thick vines that block our faces like confessional screensEach morning, the smell of coffee wakes us before 7am. We don clothes that we don’t mind getting dirty – grape juice stains are stubborn. Despite the heat, we wear thick socks under our boots to avoid burs scraping our ankles. Thomas gives us a lay of the land on the first day. The first rule of picking is to be gentle with the grapes. Manhandling them can break their skins prematurely, causing the oxidation that negatively affects aromas and flavours.We should also watch out for oidium, a chalky mildew, because “crap grapes make for crap wine”, says Thomas. When I find a snail on a grape, he jokes: “That’s why wine isn’t vegan.” (He jokes fluently in English.) Snipping grapes eight hours a day for three weeks wreaks havoc on the hands. Cuts are so prevalent I become the unofficial nurse of the group, carrying plasters in my bumbag. We work in pairs, bookending the vines to ensure no bunch gets left behind. To break up the monotony, conversation inevitably flows, profound at times due to the thick vines that block our faces like confessional screens. Everyone has a story – healing from a breakup or breaking free from a corporate job.View image in fullscreenHarvest time at Domaine Rouge-Bleu.Photograph: Andy HaslamThis sociability is an antidote to the demanding work: the constant ache in muscles I never knew I had; the unrelenting sweltering sun and hot wind. My skin and clothes are sticky with sweat, dirt and grape juice, my fingernails permanently painted purple. Yet, knowing our collective efforts will be bottled into delicious wine is incredibly rewarding. “There’s no feeling like people coming together for a shared mission,” says Hannah.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a freelancer weighted with managing, and finding, my own work, I appreciate having specific tasks; being told what to do; the simple choreography of snip, haul, repeat. Plus, the monotony is broken up by the varied terrain.Terroir, the buzzword that rolls off sommeliers’ tongues, refers to the soil, climate and sunlight that give wine grapes their distinctive character. I get a crash course on Rouge-Bleu’s 12 hectares planted with 21 grape varietals. Stooped low like elderly ladies, the 115-year-old grenache gobelet vines are planted in an ancient riverbed of large white stones. While these heat-retaininggaletshelp the grenache reach peak ripeness, their uneven surface is torturous – like trying to balance in a ball pit. The trellised syrah are easier to pick, their extended branches welcoming us with open arms to gather their purple jewels.Gathering around the table for meals is a harvest highlight, a moment of conviviality that recharges our batteriesOnce we fill the trailer – emblazoned with an “In Grenache We Trust” sticker – we head back to the winery. This entails a different workout – manoeuvring hoses and vats, loading the press, shovelling grape bunches into the tank. “We keep their stems to reduce heat buildup during fermentation, which leads to the jammy flavours we don’t want,” says Caroline. I appreciate her red wines even more with this knowledge. My favourite task is climbing into the press to stomp out every last drop of juice.View image in fullscreenGrape expectations … about 4 tonnes of fruit are harvested by hand in a morning.Photograph: Andy HaslamThe drudgery is lessened as we toast the day’s end with craft beers from a friend’s Alpine brewery. “It takes a lot of beer to make good wine,” is a common harvest adage that Thomas repeats. Gathering around the table for meals is a harvest highlight, a much-deserved moment of conviviality that reinforces our team spirit and recharges our batteries. Each night, a different harvester cooks a recipe of their choosing, often calorie-replenishing meals such as lasagne, grilled sausages or chickpea curry. Naturally, the meals are paired with Domaine Rouge-Bleu’s bottles, from its citrusy white Dentelle to the luscious Lunatique that bursts with blackberry notes. The most oenologically curious of us have a vertical tasting for a nightcap – by sampling the same wine from different years, we can taste how age intensifies its flavours.Just as a fine wine lingers in the mouth, participating in a wine harvest is an enduring experience. A fellow harvester, Oscar, goes so far to say: “It’s about as useful a thing a person could do.” Each time I drink wine, I taste its people, its place, its story. My time among the vines has made me truly appreciate Louis Pasteur’s words: “There is more philosophy in a bottle of wine than in all the books in the world.”Further information:Domaine Rouge-Bleu;Domaine Breton;Vendangeur d’un Jour;WWOOFExplore more on these topicsFrance holidaysWine holidaysVolunteering holidaysFood and drinkEurope holidaysWinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I stubbed my toe, and my ferocious roar of pain showed me I could be myselfFrancesca HornakWed 8 Oct 2025 01.55 EDTShareIn 2008, I was in my mid-20s and single. My relationships until then had all been fun, flirty and conflict-free – which was unsurprising, given I expended so much energy on male approval.Depressingly, this seemed normal in the 00s and demanded a specific type of vigilance. As well as trying to look perfect for every date, there was also the effort of trying tobeperfect: bright and funny and engaging and fragrant, but also vaguely unavailable. Endearingly kooky was OK; but I didn’t want to come across as weird. Misery and anger were off limits. I never risked showing I cared. No wonder love had failed to launch.My relationship with Luke started differently because we knew each other already. For several years, we had worked on adjacent pages at the same newspaper; he had seen me on deadline, in my gym clothes and hungover. We were friends, but not close.Then, during a snowy spell, he began giving me lifts to work. Our conversations, side by side in traffic, felt natural and then increasingly intimate. We started organising office nights out, where we would only speak to each other, and finally progressed to a drink “on the way” to a colleague’s birthday celebrations (spoiler: we never got to the party).A moment that changed me: I’m a chef who joined the Ukrainian army – and it transformed how I live and cookRead moreBut, once we were officially a couple, I reverted to romance mode. My legs were silky, my flat was curated and my underwear matched. Because I really liked him, I was more careful than ever. I delayed responding to messages, and rarely sent the first text. A lot of the time, I didn’t even realise I was doing it. I didn’t know any other way to be in a relationship.One morning, about two months in, after Luke had spent the night at my flat, he set off to work before me. We said goodbye on the landing, still in the sweet stage of protracted parting. As his footsteps retreated down the stairs to the front door, I walked into the bathroom, undressed, turned to open the shower and stubbed my toe on a new door stop.For a split second, I couldn’t compute the pain coursing up my leg. Without thinking, I did what I’ve always done in moments of private shock and agony – I roared. Many people swear, but I’ve always preferred to unleash a kind of bellow of fury, somewhere between a Nadal serve and an outraged neanderthal.The next thing I heard was Luke’s footsteps running back up the stairs. This time I did swear, internally. Clearly, he had not left yet. He would have heard my bizarre and, to my mind, wildly unfeminine reaction. To make it worse, when he appeared in the bathroom doorway, I was naked apart from a frilly shower cap.But, from my hunched position between the shower and loo, I registered that he looked more alarmed than appalled. Once the pain abated, I was flooded with mortification. How odd my raw, guttural bellow must have sounded, especially amplified by the bathroom acoustics. How unlike the insouciant image I took such care to project. When I explained, he looked relieved – not repulsed, or ready to ridicule me, but reassured that I wasn’t mortally wounded.“I thought you’d really hurt yourself,” he said, before tactfully acknowledging that a toe stub can feel apocalyptic. We hugged again, he left again, and that was it.View image in fullscreen‘He hears my roar on a regular basis’ … Francesca with Luke in Malaysia, December 2009.Photograph: Courtesy of Francesca HornakI stood in the shower, wondering why I had not wanted Luke to hear that noise. How had I expected him to react? And what did it say about me, that I thought I was only allowed to feel pain with a delicate, palatable squeal? Luke had never given me any reason to believe that he thought women should behave a certain way; it was me who held these adolescent notions. Somewherealong the line, I had come to believe that men were an intolerant bunch with Hollywood expectations of women as ice queens, manic pixie dream girls or damsels in distress.I questioned why I was filtering myself and – if I saw us lasting – whether I really wanted to do so for ever. I can’t say I stopped immediately, but slowly I let the unedited version of myself break free. The roar served as a reminder that this relationship could be different, if I only let it. And I did – and it was. That summer of 2009 was one of the happiest of my life – we got engaged three years later, and have now been married for nearly 15 years.When I mentioned the toe stubbing incident to Luke recently, he had no memory of it. And no wonder: he has now seen me give birth three times and stub my toe many more, so he hears my roar on a regular basis.Still, that first time felt seminal. I stopped seeing relationships as a case of following The Rules. And these days I’m quick to correct my sons when they refer to something as being “for girls”.

The operator of various Melbourne cafes (279, Le Bajo Milkbar) isn’t alone in disguising his identity. “Everyone has a coffee name at our office,” he says. “Because they have Japanese names.”My local cafe has misidentified me as a Rachel and now I am trapped in a hilarious lie forever | Rebecca ShawRead moreAdopting an easy-to-spell alternative for takeouts is understandable when your name is commonly mistranslated (I’ve had “Lee Tran” creatively interpreted as “Leerog” and “Heelicha” while picking up meals). Enter the coffee name. The Iranian US cookbook author Samin Nosrat uses “Sam” for convenience and Associate Prof Sukhmani Khorana can relate.“I feel like I have no choice but to use ‘Su’ or ‘Sue’ as my coffee name,” says Khorana, who edits the Food, Culture and Society journal and works at University of New South Wales’ School of the arts and media. “Coffee names may be a curious phenomenon for those with very recognisable Anglo names but it is a taken-for-granted everyday reality for many Australians who are considered to havedifficult-to-pronounce ethnic names.”Rowena Chansiri from Sydney’s Ickle Coffee embraces such names as conversation starters. “How do you spell it? What’s the origin?” she might ask. It’s a nice way to interact with customers. “But every cafe is different,” Chansiri says. She runs a neighbourhood cafe. “We’re not in so much of a rush.”View image in fullscreenBarista Junji Tai’s approach is to say, ‘Can I get a name for the order?’ – so people can decide what they’d like to be called.Photograph: Alyx Gorman/The GuardianChansiri once worked at a busy cafe where staff were “not allowed to ask for names on the cups”, she says. Instead, they drew shapes that needed decoding. A circle with a cross would signify an order for a man with glasses. It didn’t “make sense to me”, the barista says.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhat about using numbers instead of asking for names? That feels “very sterile”, Okada says. It suits fast-food franchises but people go to cafes “because they want human interaction”. “Keeping the name part is quite important in that sense.”Sterility isn’t the only problem with numbers. People don’t remember them, says Junji Tai from Sydney’s Brighter Coffee. He believes in the name-giving approach, despite receiving typos himself: “They usually autocorrect my name to ‘Junkie’.”Starbucks, where coffee and fast food intersect, is famous for messing up names. Last month the US reporter Wolf Blitzer hada Venti skim latte orderdelivered to “Oof”.Chansiri says: “People actually look forward to what Starbucks [baristas] write.”Sometimes a customer will refuse to give a name. Tai says. “That’s fine. We’ll call out ‘strong flat white’, no problem.”View image in fullscreenTai at Sydney’s Brighter Coffee.Photograph: Made of ManyAs someone with a “difficult ethnic name”, opting out altogether is appealing. I usually use my boyfriend’s Anglo one-syllable name instead of my own. But isn’t burying my cultural heritage with a western name kind of sad?Tai also sees the opposite phenomenon: people choosing alternate identities because their Anglo name is too common.“We’ll be calling out, ‘Thanks Matt, thanks Matt, thanks Matt!’ So [someone] … will say, ‘Can I put my name down as Batman?’ I’m like, of course you can.”Australian supermarket ground coffee taste test: we tried 41 varieties, two waysRead moreTai’s approach is to say, “Can I get a name for the order?” – so people can decide what they’d like to be called.Okada says some customers recite a phone number or say “123” instead.Chansiri’s partner, who is Filipino, resorts to his middle name – “just Tom” – when ordering.But common western names still attract errors. The food writer Howard Chen has anInstagram seriesdedicated to this: he’s received orders for Harwert, Harassed and Ou!And Irish names might be spelled correctly by one staff member, Tai says, then read out by someone who “might not be able to pronounce” them.So is it better to use a fake identity for convenience? Or should I embrace what my Vietnamese migrant parents called me, even if it causes difficulties? “It’s OK if you don’t use it for a transaction,” Okada says. “For a coffee, I don’t have so much of a policy to use my name. The ease of the transaction is important for both the baristas and the customer.”Some cafes yell out the coffee order (“regular soy latte!”) but that’s not error-proof either.“Last week we had three Matts in a row that had strong flat whites,” Tai says. That’s why a nickname like Batman can be handy.“I’m still waiting for Superman and Spider-Man.

Someone is turning you down cold, taking a hard pass, telling you: “Nope.” I work as a writer, so I am no stranger to rejection. I started pitching story ideas and submitting manuscripts 50 years ago, when I graduated from college. In that time, I have had two novels rejected, as well as proposals for nonfiction books, short stories and numerous pitches for articles. Over the last 20 years, since turning my hand largely to personal essays and op-eds, I have been rejected even more. In a typical week, I get a rejection every few days – more than 100 times a year. Rejections accumulated over the course of my career run in the thousands. By now, I should have a PhD in rejection.Typewriter reveals unexpected geniusRead moreSo is this feature to be a woe-is-me rant? Far from it. Because, finally, at the age of 73, I have accepted rejection.How have I managed this? How have I equipped myself to take a setback in my stride – or even shrug it off?Some context: By this stage in my life, just about everyone and their distant cousin has given me a thumbs-down. I’ve never kept score of my win-lose ratio – doing so would be deeply dispiriting.A case in point: recently, a newspaper editor I work with nixed 20 submissions in a row before saying, “OK, I’ll take it,” to one. In 2016, no fewer than 50 book publishers vetoed my proposal for a memoir before one gave me the green light. A few years later, 25 literary agents declined a nonfiction book proposal. One editor to whom I frequently submitted work became so frustrated with my submissions that she asked me a question no editor had ever asked me before: would I please send her my potential guest essays less often? Say, once a month?In my 20s, when starting out in my career, all rejections stung. I took them personally. It was not just my work being rejected, I felt, but me as a person.No sooner would a manuscript be rejected than I would start to undergo what I’ve called the “seven stages of rejection”:First, the shock. How could this happen? How could these people be blind to my talent?Second, denial. Surely you’ve rejected the wrong person? This must be an administrative error.Third, dismissal.What do any of you know? Who appointed you to hand down rulings on my labours? You’re stupid and your publication stinks. I reject your rejection.Fourth, anger at those who rejected me, followed by anger at myself.Why do I do this to myself? Why do I let myself in for these slings and arrows from strangers rendering verdicts on mywork? Am I a masochist or martyr?Fifth, bargaining (preferably liberally seasoned with delusion). What will it taketo convince you to recogniseme as a once-in-a-generation talent?Sixth, depression. I’m no good. What’s more, I’ll never be any good.So it went through my 30s, 40s and 50s.Of course, I was in excellent company. Tales of writers whose work was initially rejected are legion. Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. James Joyce’s Dubliners. Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita. Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. Almost every writer of repute was initially spurned. If they could overcome rejection, then maybe I could, too. Michael Jordan was dropped from his high school basketball team. Most US presidents over the last 60 years had previously lost elections of some sort: Lyndon B Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Sylvester Stallone estimates that his script for Rocky and his bid to be the film’s star were turned down 1,500 times. “I take rejection as someone blowing a bugle in my ear to wake me up and get going, rather than retreat,” he has said.Then, as I reached my 60s and my 70s, I entered the seventh stage of rejection. Acceptance. Now, I better understand the many reasons why someone says no. For starters, an editor may have recently run a similar piece, or already have one in the pipeline, or just be contemplating something along the same lines for another contributor to pursue.Or, less promisingly, my pitch is of limited interest. Or the editor believes I lack the credentials or stature to fit the bill. Or is no longer in the market for the wares I am peddling. Or was too distracted and read my submission too fast to appreciate its abundant merits.Go ahead, call it an epiphany. Anything can be rejected, and for any reason, and there is pretty much nothing you can do about it. Certain rationales for rejection are forever beyond your control.Others are within it. Let’s face it, my pitches and submissions may from time to time be ill-conceived. They may lack relevance and resonance, or the point I am struggling to articulate is insufficiently dramatised. Or I’m being flagrantly unoriginal. Or maybe something about my punctuation, particularly semicolons, was offensive.The point is that, despite all my years of exertion and rejection, I have managed to get widely published. I’ve authored two books – my first when I was 51, my second, a memoir, at 65 – and more than 1,000 articles and essays. Those pieces have appeared in publications large and small, in local, national and global newspapers and magazines. My first op-ed ran in the New York Times when I was 26 – and I have now contributed to that publication, among others, for five decades.Still, no bestsellers, no book signings at Barnes & Noble, no appearances on Oprah, no Ted Talks, no book awards, no Pulitzers, no Nobel, and no Presidential Medal of Freedom draped around my neck. But I can more readily accept rejection at 73, because my, admittedly modest, successes have cushioned the jolts of my many rejections. I can afford to be philosophical about it all now.Rejection can be instructive, but only if you listen to what it’s trying to teach you. Otherwise, you will probably just keep taking rejection all wrong. So what lessons have I learned?Here’s my advice. First, go over your rejected pitch. I mean, pore over it as if you were a monk transcribing ancient Greek in a medieval scriptorium. You may see it afresh and glean how to make it better. If you decide your idea is still up to snuff, terrific. Immediately send it off to another, presumably more discerning person for a second opinion. Recycling keeps your hopes alive. If, though, as I all too often do, you find your idea wanting, then tweak it or even completely overhaul it. I sometimes realise, much to my dismay, that my opening belongs at the end, or vice versa, or some variation thereof.Rejections teach a writer to rely on his own judgment and to say in his heart of hearts, ‘To hell with you’When you get down to it, rejection can do you a favour. It forces you to face objective reality. You find out, perhaps contrary to your longstanding expectations, that an entire universe exists outside your own head and the opinions of others might matter as much as yours. The market has spoken, much as voters do in an election, and its decision deserves some respect.Rejection can also fortify your spirit. It knocks you down and defies you to get back on your feet. You learn humility because nothing better instils humility than being utterly humiliated. It can stiffen your resolve, too, because the more you are rejected, the more mightily you might strive to break through. Rejection gives you an education in the art of resilience, the capacity to bounce back from failure, an attribute essential to sustaining an entrepreneurial mindset.By no means am I recommending rejection as a desired outcome or a stepping stone to success. But in the best of scenarios, rejection may inspire us to stay true to ourselves and fly closer to the sun. Rejection can prod you to believe you not only can do better but also should do better, have to do better, and will do better. “Rejections,” said the Nobel prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow, “teach a writer to rely on his own judgment and to say in his heart of hearts, ‘To hell with you.’”Great books that publishers rejected – quizRead moreAnd so it is that I now embrace rejection. Granted, it’s easier for me to confess my vulnerability and revel in my newfound change of heart than it is for writers decades younger than I.Here’s what I told my daughter, Caroline, as she started her career as a freelance writer in her late 20s – but the advice, I think, would apply to how any and all of us choose to live our day-to-day lives. “Rejection is tough,” I wrote. “What I do – and what you may do – is pretty simple. First, write as well and as truly as you can. That’s always priority number one. Second, write about what matters to you and give it the time it needs to ferment. Third, stay productive – the more you create, the better your prospects. Always have something in development, whether you’re just daydreaming about it, taking notes about it or actually writing it. Fourth, keep at it. Fifth, as long as you have faith in yourself, it will pay off.”If I’ve learned anything at all from getting older – and I must have picked up something by now – it’s that life can be a yes or a no. So the sooner you learn to adapt to no, the sooner you’ll have a shot at yes.Bob Brody, a consultant and essayist, is a former New Yorker now living in Italy.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The 17 Pro is Apple’s biggest redesign of theiPhonein years, chucking out the old titanium sides and all-glass backs for a new aluminium unibody design, a huge full-width camera lump on the back and some bolder colours.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That alone will make the iPhone 17 Pro popular for those looking to upgrade and be seen with the newest model. But with the change comes an increase in price to £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999), crossing the £1,000 barrier for the first time for Apple’s smallest Pro phone, which now comes with double the starting storage.From the front it looks like any recent Pro iPhone with the Dynamic Island containing the selfie camera at the top of the super bright and smooth screen. It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year.View image in fullscreenHigher peak brightness and a new anti-glare coating on the screen help cut down on reflections in bright light, making it easier to use outside.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset.A glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera baron a Pixel. The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around theedges of the plateau, so a case is still prudent.View image in fullscreenThe home and lock screens of iOS 26 now have a glassy, more rounded look to text and icons.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe handset runs the sameiOS 26as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes.SpecificationsScreen:6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)Processor:Apple A19 ProRAM:12GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:iOS 26Camera:48MP main, 48MP UW and 48MP 4x zoom, 18MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)Dimensions:150 x 71.9 x 8.75mmWeight:204gFaster and cooler A19 Pro chipView image in fullscreenThe iPhone fully charges in 76 minutes via USB-C, hitting 70% in half an hour using a 40W adaptor (not included) or 96 minutes using a Qi2 25W charger such as theBelkin UltraCharge 2-in-1.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer.It works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold.The battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe camera plateau stops the iPhone 17 Pro rocking around on a desk as much as previous models.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery will lastin excess of 1,000 full-charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can bereplaced for £109. Out-of-warrantyscreen repairs cost £349. The specialists iFixit awarded thephone a seven out of 10for repairability.It contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.CameraView image in fullscreenThe simplified camera app automates more of the photo-taking and hides many features behind sliding buttons.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThere are three 48-megapixel cameras on the back and a new 18MP selfie camera with a few new tricks on the front.The main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting.New for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too.View image in fullscreenZooming beyond 15-20x to a max of 40x magnification, the photos have obvious signs of being blown up by digital zoom.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAll three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets.Finally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone.PriceThe iPhone 17 Pro costs from£1,099(€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999) with 256GB of storage.For comparison, theiPhone 16ecosts£599, iPhone 17 costs£799, iPhone Air costs£999, iPhone 17 Pro Max costs£1,199, theGoogle Pixel 10 Procosts£999, theSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultracosts£1,099and the Fairphone 6 costs£499.VerdictThe 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models.The new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous.But this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera.That leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business.So for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get. You just have to pay a pretty penny for it.Pros:looks different to other models, relatively compact, great cameras including 4x/8x telephoto, upgraded selfie camera, great screen, USB-C, good battery life, top performance, long software support, Face ID.Cons:expensive, heavier than previous models, lack of cutting-edge AI features compared with rivals, same screen and size can be found on cheaper model.Explore more on these topicsAppleiPhoneSmartphonesMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Six people, including two nine-year-old children and two teenagers, were shot, according to the Kingston Central police superintendent Beresford Williams.It was later reported that one of the teenagers died on Wednesday morning.A separate shooting occurred on Sunday north-west of the capital, when five people, including a four-year-old, were killed just outside the town of Linstead in St Catherine parish.Murders in Jamaica drop but activists alarmed at rise in fatal police shootingsRead morePolice have not said what motivated the killings.Andrew Holness, the Jamaican prime minister, who visited victims’ families in Linstead, described the attack as “criminal terrorism” that was “designed to bring on the people of the community the highest level of fear”.“And so my presence here as well is to highlight that we must also focus on the victims: the three children who are left behind by the murder of an innocent mother; the father who was just crying a while ago, [that] his son didn’t get to give him a grandson; the grandmother who was crying in her room,” he told the grieving community.Condemning the “tragic, senseless killing”, the police commissioner, Kevin Blake, appealed to the community to support the police in bringing the perpetrators to justice. “It is time that we as a people exercise intolerance of this type of senseless behavior, we do not need to give them shelter. These guys are somewhere, somewhere being sheltered by someone,” he said, adding that the Jamaica constabulary force would leave no stone unturned to ensure that the perpetrators were brought to justice.A curfew was imposed in Linstead from 6pm on Monday and will continue until 6pm on Wednesday.The island of 2.8 million people reported 522 killings as of 4 October, a 41% drop compared with 883 killings reported in the same period last year, according to police statistics.Holness warned that “though we are making progress”, the mission to create a peaceful Jamaica “is not complete”.He added: “We’re still on a good track. And we can do even better if every Jamaican were to agree that the criminals must be dealt with. They must be brought to justice. We will not protect them.”Much of the violence in Jamaica and elsewhere in theCaribbeanis blamed on guns illegally smuggled from the US.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsJamaicaAmericasCaribbeanGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Illegal miners use dredges – floating machines that chew up and spit out riverbeds – leaving the toxic mercury used to extract gold from sediment in their wake.Ultra-high resolution aerial images allowed MAAP, part of AmazonConservation, to identify dredges alongside deforestation for the first time, enabling them to identify goldminers and revealing that the environmental crisis once confined to the south of the country was creeping north.View image in fullscreenThe Amazon Rainforest in Peru.Photograph: mariusz_prusaczyk/Getty Images/iStockphoto“We used to only see it in the Madre de Dios region but now we’re seeing it everywhere”, said MAAP’s director, Matt Finer.Theprice of gold topped $4,000for the first time this week on the international markets as global anxiety increased about financial fragility. Indigenous groups have sounded the alarm that as the price of soars, armed groups were increasingly tearing down their forests and poisoning their rivers in pursuit of the precious metal.MAAP’s aerial imagesshow that once dense swathes of green jungle are being transformed into lifeless moonscapes of grey earth pocked with stagnant pools of green water.Bullion bonanza: why is gold hitting record highs?Read more“This little square is just a tiny sample,” Finer says, pointing to a small section of the vast red patchwork of deforestation mapped in the report. “Imagine this multiplied to 140,000 hectares.”The mercury residues build up in fish and pass to the people who eat them, leading to neurological and developmental problems such as birth defects and learning difficulties.A recentstudy of riverside communities in Peru’s northernmost region of Loreto found the median level of mercury was nearly four times the World Health Organization’s recommended limit.MAAP’s analysis found that 225 rivers and streams have been affected, with 989 dredges spotted in Loreto since 2017 – including 275 this year alone on the Nanay River, a tributary of the Amazon that is the lifeblood of ecosystems anddozens of Indigenous communities.“They are poisoning our rivers – it’s the water that we drink,” said Roberto Tafur Shupingahua, a representative of several riverside communities in Loreto.View image in fullscreenA miner in Peru extracts gold using mercury.Photograph: Nacho Doce/ReutersShupingahua said local communities began blocking miners from advancing up the River Tigre in Loreto 40 days ago, leading to gunfights with armed intruders. “We have no choice but to fight back but we are alone. The state is nowhere to be seen,” he said, his voice raising in anger.Mining remains concentrated in the Madre de Dios region in southern Peru but new hotspots are emerging farther north in Loreto, Amazonas, Huánuco, Pasco and Ucayali.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Heads down!” as the vehicle sped away.Officials said they were still investigating whether some of the impact marks on Noboa’s armored Chevrolet Suburban were caused by gunfire.The alleged attack came amid days of increasingly violent demonstrations sparked by a government decision to raise diesel prices.Protesters have gone on strike, blocked roads and abducted 16 soldiers – who were eventually released unharmed.Ecuador’s largest Indigenous organization reported on Sunday that a protester had been killed by armed forces during one of the rallies.More than 100 people, including protesters and security services, are believed to have been injured in the unrest.Noboa has declared a state of emergency across several provinces.Noboa’s office said on social media following the attack that “cowardly acts will not deter” the president.Albert Ramdin, head of the Organization of American States, said on the social media platform X that “such violent acts are an assault on democracy, stability, and the spirit of peaceful coexistence that must prevail in our societies.”The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador said the president’s convoy had “entered a resistance zone”, leading to “incidents that the government now uses to justify its war policy”.Lawyer Yaku Pérez told reporters that those arrested were not “at the protest. They were just confused” amid the commotion during which police fired teargas.The recently re-elected president is trying to cut diesel subsidies to save about $1bn in government spending, diverting much of the savings to security funding.Ecuador, once considered one of Latin America’s safest countries, has seena dramatic surge in violence in recent years.Strategically located between Colombia and Peru, two of the world’s largest cocaine producers, Ecuador has become a major transit hub for narcotics.Authorities have accused drug gangs of fueling the unrest, suggesting that criminal groups are exploiting the protests to destabilize the country.It is estimated that 70% of the world’s cocaine supply passes through Ecuador, much of it destined for the US.The trade has attracted international criminal organizations, including Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel, Italy’s ’Ndrangheta and Albania’s mafia.Their competition for control of trafficking routes has turned Ecuador into one of the region’s most dangerous places.Noboa has called for a referendum to allow the return of US troops to the country, repealing a 2009 ban on foreign bases.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

The ban comes into force in November 2026 for two and a half years and can be extended. The UK does not have a similar ban in place.Data analysed by the The Last Beach Cleanup, a US group campaigning to halt plastic pollution, showed that the increase in UK exports in the first half of 2025 was mainly to Indonesia (24,006 tonnes in 2025, up from 525 tonnes in 2024) andMalaysia(28,667 tonnes, up from 18,872 tonnes in 2024).Total plastic waste exports remained relatively high in the first half of 2024 and 2025, at 319,407 and 317,647 tonnes respectively. The percentage of UK plastic waste going directly to non-OECD countries was 20% of total plastic waste exports in 2025, up from 11% in 2024.The Last Beach Cleanup analysed data from the UN Comtrade database to reach its findings. Jan Dell, who works for the group, accused UK ministers of “hypocrisy” by failing to ban exports to poorer nations.“The UK is hypocritically saying, ‘we’re part of the high ambition coalition’, at the plastics talks. But behind the scenes, it is refusing to set a date to stop exporting to poorer countries,” she said. “We see it is increasing exports of its own plastic waste to places like Malaysia and Indonesia.”She added: “It is unethical and irresponsible waste imperialism.”After the collapse of the UN plastic treaty talksin August, Emma Hardy, under-secretary of state at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra),said she was “hugely disappointed” an agreement had not been reached but was proud of the UK’s work towards an ambitious treaty.Britain was part of a “high ambition” coalition of nations calling for the treaty to include binding obligations on reducing plastic production and consumption, she said.Campaigners are calling for the UK, one of the top three countriesexporting plastic waste,at about 600,000 tonnes a year, to follow the EU and ban exports to non-OECD countries. They also want to close a loophole that makes it cheaper to export plastic waste rather than recycle it in the UK.View image in fullscreenPlastic products, such as these found in Klang, Selangor in June, are often fly-tipped from factories processing imported plastic waste in Malaysia.Photograph: Basel Action NetworkThe Conservative government said in 2023 that itintended to ban plastic waste exports to non-OECD countries– but it never happened.Wong Pui Yi, a Malaysia-based consultant for Basel Action Network, a group championing global environmental health and justice, said there were “good guys and bad guys” in the waste trade.“A lot of waste traders are looking to reduce costs,” she said. “If waste falls into the hands of the bad actors, one of the easiest ways to reduce costs is to avoid environmental controls. In developing countries, it is easier to avoid environmental controls due to weaker laws and lower enforcement capacity.”In July, the UK’s exports of plastic waste to Malaysia dropped to 2.8% (1,500 tonnes), most likely due to the country’s new import restrictions. But as one country bans or tightens imports, as happened with China in 2018, the trade shifts elsewhere.The rise in UK plastic exports to Asia is likely to be an underestimate, experts say, because a lot goes to the Netherlands and other European countries where it can be shipped on. The UK also exports plastic to Turkey.‘You don’t get to aim big when you are somewhere small’: A teenager’s fight to end single use plastics on her Scottish islandRead moreJames McLeary, the managing director of Biffa Polymers, a UK recycling firm, said the UK should take responsibility for its plastic waste.“It is just common sense as a human being” he said. “I don’t want my rubbish to end up in Malaysia. I don’t want to wonder if there is a boy whose life is wasted somewhere because of me throwing something in a bin outside my house.”Earlier this month,an investigation called Boy Wastedrevealed that, for the last decade, two people were crushed, ripped, or burned to death in the recycling sector in Turkey every month.Adnan Khan, a Canadian journalist whose work on refugee labour in Turkey sparked the investigation, said that while Turkey had a licence system for recycling plastic waste, “my research shows that it is pretty easy to get a licence and the oversight is low. It’s a broken system.”All EU plastic waste exports should be banned to anywhere outside the EU, he said. “I would go further and say every country should take care of its own trash.”A Defra spokesperson said: “The export of waste is subject to strict controls set out in UK legislation.“Our collection and packaging reforms will underpin £10bn worth of investment to support UK based recycling, reducing our dependency on exports of plastic waste.”Explore more on these topicsPlasticsSeascape: the state of our oceansWastePlastic bagsOECDGlobal economyMalaysiaIndonesianewsShareReuse this content"

About 1,300 coastal homes could face significant damage from extreme weather.View image in fullscreenA house destroyed by coastal erosion and rising sea levels at Hawkes Bay, New Zealand.Photograph: Geoff  Marshall/AlamySome regions will experience a rise of 20cm to 30cm in sea levels by 2050, a tipping point for some communities, Collins said.“Sea levels that reach that height mean that a coastal storm that used to happen every 100 years could start happening every year,” she said.The world’s oceans have been absorbing about90% of the extra heatcreated from the human-caused climate crisis.New Zealand is bearing the brunt of these warming seas because of its position in the ocean, which makes it more vulnerable to atmospheric circulation and changes in ocean currents.Between 1982 and 2023, New Zealand’s sea-surface temperatures in its four ocean regions increased, on average, 0.16 to 0.26 degrees Celsius per decade, and its rate of ocean warming outstripped global averages by 34%.Coastal waters are also warming faster than the global average, it said.Meanwhile, the Subtropical Front – the boundary between cold subantarctic water and warmer subtropical water that is biologically and economically significant – has moved 120km west, the report said, noting it was the first time a shift in large-scale ocean circulation around New Zealand had been observed.The shift, which is driven by warming water, will have “huge impacts” on ecosystems, the food-web and on species such as corals, sponges, kelp and fish, Collins said.Ocean acidification and warming are also affecting the country’s fishing and aquaculture industries – which contribute $1.1bn to the economy – and can lead to toxic algae bloom in shellfish. Marine heatwaves, meanwhile, are becoming more intense, longer lasting and more frequent.New Zealand has been hit withunprecedented marine heatwavesin recent years, which have been linked tomass sea sponge bleaching, die-offs ofsouthern bull kelp, large scalefish strandingsandpenguin deaths.Monitoring and research into the marine environment was growing but there were still gaps in understanding, the report noted, adding that more comprehensive research would reduce risk to people, foster climate resilience, and promote sustainability.Of particular concern was a lack of understanding into how climate change, oceans, severe weather events and ecosystems interact, Collins said.“It is a bit like pulling a thread from a fabric and the whole thing can sort of fall apart – understanding those interactions is perhaps the biggest blind spot for us.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandClimate crisisAsia PacificOceansnewsShareReuse this content"

If police oppose the form 1, the supreme court has the final say over whether the protest will be “authorised” or “prohibited”.Sydney Opera House pro-Palestine march has ‘disaster written all over it’, senior NSW police officer tells courtRead moreGraham pointed out in court that, despite what the prohibition terminology suggested, the court had consistently understood it to merely mean people were not afforded immunity under the Summary Offences Act for obstructing traffic, for example.Graham had argued that it would undermine the form 1 system if ignoring a court order regarding a protest was an offence, because it would deter organisers from completing the form, which is not compulsory.But the court found her argument was not “persuasive” and that the text of the legislation was “decisive”.“It would be highly incongruous for the legislature to empower the court to make an order ‘prohibiting’ the holding of a public assembly, if the terms of that order did not accurately reflect the legal consequence of the order,” the justices – which included the chief justice of NSW, Andrew Bell, and justices Ian Harrison and Stephen Free –wrote in their judgement.“This court proceeds on the basis that its orders … will be respected and obeyed.”Outside court, Nick Hanna, a lawyer for the Palestine Action Group, said Thursday’s ruling would have wide-ranging impacts on the right to protest across Australia.“That hasn’t been the understanding of both the police and protesters previously,” he said.“It doesn’t matter whether your cause is ending the genocide inGazaor whether it’s protesting against racism or for a pay rise as a union member. This judgment will have very important ramifications for the right to protest in Australia.”Sue Higginson, a spokesperson for the Greens, said it was difficult to predict whether the ruling would dissuade protesters from using the form 1 system.“I’m not sure the court of appeal has genuinely considered there is a chilling effect when we see these kind of judgments that ultimately take a draconian approach to the fundamental right for people to protest,” she said on Thursday.Last November, the court issued a prohibition order against Rising Tide carrying out a blockade of the Newcastle Port to demand greater action on climate change, citing safety concerns. But the organisers went ahead with the protest anyway.Just over two months ago, the Palestine Action Group faced the NSW supreme court in its bid to march over theSydneyHarbour Bridge after the police also cited safety concerns and issues with short notice.The protesters won, with anestimated 225,000 to 300,000 peopleattending.Palestine Action Group changes route for this SundayThe Palestine Action Group and Jews Against Occupation, who had proposed marching to the Opera House, told the court shortly after Thursday’s ruling they would change Sunday’s route.A spokesperson said the protest – calling for “an end to genocide in Gaza” – would instead march from Hyde Park and along George Street to Belmore Park.They called on the NSW premier, Chris Minns, to light the Opera House sails with the Palestinian flag. Two years ago, shortly after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October with 1,200 people killed, the NSW government lit up the sails in the colours of the Israeli flag. Minns on Thursday said that would not be happening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We took it on because it’s the right thing to do. Every major human rights organisation across the world has now concluded there is a genocide taking place in Gaza and that includes major Israeli human rights organisations.” Israel has rejected that it is committing genocide.The assistant police commissioner Peter McKenna said during Wednesday’s hearing that he was concerned about the risks of crowd crush and limited police resources to manage an Opera House rally.The court also heard that the police would advise the Opera House to stop and search people, given the general level of security threat across the country. Under bylaws that govern the Opera House, it has the right to conduct security screenings, which include bag searches and X-ray screening.McKenna said after Thursday’s ruling: “I’ll say to anyone who thinks that they could go to the Opera House still and be a part of any type of demonstration or public assembly, that you will be committing an offence, and appropriate action will be taken by us.”The assistant commissioner said he did not expect the ruling to lead to fewer form 1 applications in the future.“Not at all,” he told reporters. “We still have powers that we can utilise without the form 1 process … that process actually protects people from committing certain offences. It allows us to work with them. It allows us to keep them safe.”The court of appeal had allowed two prominent Jewish groups, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) and the Jewish Board of Deputies, to provide evidence opposing the rally.Barrister Vanessa Whittaker, speaking on behalf of the ECAJ, told the court the planned protest’s proximity to the second anniversary of 7 October and its location would create “further fear of antisemitism, which includes violence, and further distress amongst the Jewish community”.Justice Free said the court of appeal bench was unanimous in its decision to prohibit the protest.He cited several safety concerns, including the lack of sufficient exit points for an expected crowd of 40,000, and the route containing “pinch points” which he said “would give rise to the risk of crowd crush as the route narrows, particularly as it approaches the Opera House forecourt”.“A further complication would be the likely response of the Opera House Trust consistent with its protocol for mass events of conducting searches of those seeking access to the forecourt. This would be likely to cause significant delays in the progress of the crowd when it reaches the forecourt, and augment the risk of crowd crush,” Freee said.“The mitigatory factors advanced by the organisers were not such as to reduce the risk to public safety to an acceptable level.“The court further held that the risk to public safety associated with this public assembly was so significant that it would be irresponsible to allow the public assembly to proceed irrespective of the political significance of the event and the importance of freedom of political expression.”The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said the court of appeal’s ruling was the “right decision”, adding “common sense” had prevailed.“We expect all applicants to abide by the court’s decision,” he told reporters. “Reasonable people in Sydney would expect the police to uphold this judgment.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailExplore more on these topicsSydneyGazaNew South WalesProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

That shift helped propel the far-right party Alternative for Germany to first place in some polls.Explore more on these topicsEuropeMigrationGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

Podemos had previously criticised the decree, arguing it did not go far enough.The government said it had already banned buying weapons from or selling them toIsraelsince the start of the war, which was sparked by the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israeli soil on 7 October 2023.But Sánchez announced last month a decree to “consolidate in law” the embargo as part of a series of measures against Israel’s offensive.“Israel’s response to the terrible attacks committed by terrorist group Hamas has ended up becoming an indiscriminate attack against the Palestinian population that the majority of experts have called genocide,” said the preamble of the law.It bans all exports of defence equipment, products or technology to Israel and imports of such goods from the country.The decree also outlaws the transit of aviation fuel with potential military use and bans the advertising of products “coming from illegal colonies inGazaand the West Bank”.The text allows the government to make exceptions for dual-use defence equipment “if the application of the ban harmed general national interests”.September’s announcement triggered furious condemnation from Israel, which had already withdrawn its ambassador to Madrid in 2024 after Spainrecognised a Palestinian state.The vote had been scheduled for Tuesday but Spanish media said it was held a day later to avoid coinciding with thetwo-year anniversaryof the Hamas attack.Israel’s embassy inSpainhad criticised the original plan, calling it “a cynical and reprehensible decision” in a letter released on Monday.Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezIsraelGazaPalestineEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There is a need for transparency and clarity for the consumer and recognition for the work of our farmers.”She argues the proposal is in line with EU rules that already ban the use of terms such as“milk” and “yoghurt”for non-dairy products.The European parliament rejected a ban on meaty names for plant-based productsin 2020, but the 2024 elections shifted the parliament to the right, bringing in more lawmakers who seek close ties with farmers.Opposition was led by Green MEPs, who decried what they saw as a populist move to rename plant-based foods. “Veggie burgers, seitan schnitzel and tofu sausage do not confuse consumers, only rightwing politicians,” Thomas Waitz, an Austrian Green MEP, said after the vote. “This tactic is a diversion and a pathetic smokescreen. No farmer will earn more money or secure their future with this ban.”Even Imart’s centre-right European People’s party (EPP) is divided on the issue. The EPP’s group leader, Manfred Weber, said before the vote that the issue was not a priority for him and lawmakers had more important things to deal with. “Consumers are not stupid when they go to the supermarkets and buy their products,” he said.The proposal is opposed by leading German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, which fear that banning familiar terms would make it “more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions”.Germany is the largest market for plant-based products and these businesses fear they would be particularly affected by any move to change the names of plant-based foods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Theoriginal French decreeintroduced a ban on 21 terms used by butchers, including “ham”, “filet” and “prime rib”.Consumer groups say the measure has little support among shoppers. A 2020 survey of 11 EU member states by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) found that most were not concerned about the use of meat-related names as long as a product was clearly labelled as vegetarian or vegan.Irina Popescu, a food policy officer at the BEUC, said the vote was disappointing and made little sense. “Almost 70% of consumers understand these names as long as products are clearly labelled vegan or vegetarian. Policymakers should focus on making packaging clear and understandable with trustworthy labels,” she said.The Austrian MEP Anna Stürgkh, a member of the centrist Renew group, said consumers were unlikely to be misled. “A beef tomato doesn’t contain any beef … Ladies’ fingers are not made of actual ladies’ fingers. Let’s trust consumers and stop this hotdog populism,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionFood & drink industryEuropeVegetarian food and drinkFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Talks would be difficult, he said, but “the prospect of a dissolution [of parliament] is fading”.Lecornu, who resigned on Monday after 27 days in office but was given 48 hours by the French president to try to rally support for a new government, presented his conclusions to Macron at the Élysée Palace earlier on Wednesday.Macron was re-elected for a five-year term in 2022, but since snap parliamentary elections last summer, a hung parliament has ousted two successive prime ministers who failed to find a majority for austerity budget plans, plunging France into one of its deepest political crises since the foundation of the Fifth Republic in 1958.Lecornu became the third to go when he tendered his government’s resignation just 14 hours after his new cabinet had been announced, saying opposition to the lineup from allies and opponents alike would make it impossible for him to do the job.The Guardian view on political chaos in France: the gift that keeps on giving to Marine Le Pen and the far right | EditorialRead moreHe said earlier on Wednesday that reducing France’s ballooning budget deficit – projected to exceed 5.5% of GDP this year, almost twice the EU’s permitted limit – was “vital, including for France’s image abroad and for our capacity to borrow”.Lecornu said he was “quite optimistic” progress could be made. “We’re only missing the final metre,” he said, calling on the parties to show a “capacity for compromise” and suggesting that a non-political technocratic government could be a way forward.The former defence minister, who met leftwing parties including the Socialist party (PS), Greens and Communists on Wednesday, told France 2 that every political group he had talked to except the far right and radical left had “told me that it would be too dangerous not to have a budget by the end of this year”.Lecornu said he was “not running after the job” of prime minister and it would be “up to the president” to decide whether his successor should come from the moderate left, which has repeatedly said any government headed by a Macron ally would be doomed to fall.He had appeared to offer a possible olive branch to the PS and moderate left on Tuesday by suggesting Macron’s unpopular pension changes, pushed through in 2023, may be “suspended”, partly meeting the left’s demands that they be scrapped.However, the leader of the PS, Olivier Faure, said after meeting Lecornu on Wednesday he had “not received any guarantees” that the reform, which raised France’s retirement age from 62 to 64, would indeed be suspended.Lecornu told France 2 that the question was “a real blocking point” and “one of the most difficult” to resolve. It would be “up to the president” to make the final decision, he said.If the PS and moderate left can be won over, a left-led cabinet backed by Macron’s centrist allies and centre-right MPs could be an option, but it would be fragile – and is not guaranteed the support of the centre-right, for whom changing the pension system is sacrosanct.The Greens leader, Marine Tondelier, whose party is allied with the PS, said after meeting Lecornu that France had “never been closer” to getting a new leftwing prime minister, adding that another appointee from Macron’s camp “wouldn’t last a minute”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the month since a swarm of Russian drones violated Polish airspace – three wereshot down– a rash of similar incidents has been reported across Germany, the Baltic and Nordic countries, often over power plants and military bases.Russia’s alleged “hybrid war” has suddenly begun to feel a bit close for comfort for many Europeans: potentially reaching into cities a long way from the frontline, comfortably untroubled – until now – by the fallout from the war raging inUkraine.Public anxiety is mounting, particularly at Nato’s borders, reportedDaniel Boffey and Miranda Bryantearlier this week – the strange red lights that people on the west coast of Norway keep seeing are a new source of collective stress. Their feature found echoes in history of what is now happening: Soviet “ghost planes” caused panic in the 1930s and UFO sightings were common in subsequent decades.Suspicion that the Kremlin is orchestrating a shadow war ofsabotage and subterfugeon Europe is not new, although Moscow denies it. Fiona Hill, the former White House Russia adviser, warned in June thatRussia was “already at war with Europe”. But the latest drone episodes suggest a gear change; that Russia is accelerating the hybrid campaign in daring new ways. Moscow may be using oil tankers from its illicit “shadow fleet”, for example, as alaunchpad for drones, including those that forced Denmark to close its airports.Challenges in defending the grey zoneView image in fullscreenAll eyes on deck … the Swedish coastguard to patrol an area that has become a hybrid warfare battleground.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianHow do European leaders reassure anxious citizens when they themselves lack any certainty about how to respond? “Our police must be able to shoot drones down immediately,” the Bavarian premier Markus Söder demanded after the Munich incident. Poland’s government has adopted similarly robust rhetoric.But shooting down airspace violators, is not always lawful – or desirable. Nato’s European leaders have a particularly difficult tightrope to walk in calibrating their response to ambiguous incursions that fall short of outright military aggression – activity in the so-called “grey zone”.The attacker’s identity is not always clear. Is it a hostile rogue state or a criminal entity? Nobody wants to be provoked into escalation against a nuclear armed superpower. Yet, doing nothing is not an option either. An overwhelming majority of EU citizens say they want their leaders to unite to protect them from security threats,polls show.The latest threats are, instead, exposing deep divisions. The resulting perception of weakness,wrote Paul Taylor, risks emboldening Vladimir Putin to prod further.Ursula von der Leyen presented plans for a “drone wall” – an integrated detection, tracking and interception system to defend Europe’s “eastern flank” – at anEU summit in Copenhagen last week. But the shrill discussion that reportedly unfolded behind closed doors suggests the drone wall is not imminent. Neither Friedrich Merz nor the (domestically embattled) French president Emmanuel Macron showed any support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni complained that southern Europe was being neglected.“The worse the situation becomes, the less able they seem to make any decisions,” says Taylor. A lack of mutual trust is now exacerbated by fears that the US cannot be relied on to help, he explained.Armed with psychologyskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The second is to confuse and scare us so we lose faith in our authorities and in liberal democracy. If our systems are too weak to keep us safe, people may conclude, what are they for?”“Provocations are attractive [to Russia] because they cause chaos and disharmony,” she says. “Ultimately the hope is to get people to flirt with autocracy. It is deeply subversive.”But by carefully anticipating the chaos around any future disruptive incident, the appeal for the perpetrator can be reduced, Braw argues. Governments in western and southern Europe are “pretty unprepared”. They should learn from Baltic and Nordic states, both in planning andcommunicating openlythat they are doing so. “We may have to close an airport, but we can still show everyone that life keeps going, no matter what tricks they try on us. We can react in a way that minimises panic.”Hostile grey zone attacks are not just about drones. “Imagine if all of our supermarket chains were taken out of action by cyber-attacks at the same time,” she says.Miika Ilomäki, chief preparedness specialist for Finland’s National Emergency Supply Agency, detailed the country’sstockpiling strategyin the Guardian recently. But Braw says some governments have a deep fear of causing people to panic by discussing threats. “The reality is we will have to face panic at some point, so it is better to talk openly about how we are going to manage. We should have learned that lesson from the pandemic.”To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeDrones (military)UkraineGermanyDenmarkRussianewslettersShareReuse this content"

The group also said it would release the 20 hostages still alive as early as this weekend, with sources saying an exchange with Palestinian prisoners would happen within 72 hours of the deals signing, which is expected to be Thursday.Gaza ceasefire talks live: Trump says Israel and Hamas have signed off on ‘first phase’ of peace planRead moreResponding to the announcement, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “With God’s help, we will bring them all home.”Netanyahu described the development as a “great day for Israel” and said he would convene the government on Thursday to approve theGazaceasefire agreement aimed at bringing home all the hostages.“I thank President Trump and his team from the bottom of my heart for their commitment to this sacred mission of freeing our hostages,” Netanyahu said.The US president hailed what he said was a “great day” for the Arab and Muslim world, Israel and all surrounding nations, as well as the US.“We thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!” he posted.Trump said earlier thata deal was almost doneand that he may travel to Egypt this weekend, possibly leaving as soon as Saturday. Netanyahu and Trump spoke by phone and congratulated each other on the agreement on Wednesday, and the Israeli prime minister invited the president to address Israel’s parliament, according to Netanyahu’s office.The UN chief, António Guterres, welcomed the Israel-Hamas agreement and called on all parties to “abide fully” by its terms.“All hostages must be released in a dignified manner. A permanent ceasefire must be secured. The fighting must stop once and for all,” the secretary general said in a statement, stressing that the immediate unimpeded entry of humanitarian supplies into the war-ravaged territory “must be ensured”.Successful completion of the deal would mark the biggest foreign policy achievement so far for Trump, who took office in January promising to quickly end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, only to be confronted with obstacles and complexities he had apparently not foreseen.Senior envoys from the US, Qatar and Turkey had joined the talks this week, apparently adding momentum to discussions launched on Monday. Trump sent his son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff.Many of the details of the agreement reached after 3 days of indirect talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh remain unclear and challenges of implementing its terms are immense.But in recent days, negotiators have closed gaps between Hamas and Israel over the details of the first phase of the 21-pointplan announced by Trumpin the White House last week.It was not immediately certain whether the parties had made any progress on thornier questions about the future of the conflict, including whether Hamas will demilitarise, as Trump has demanded, and eventual governance of the war-torn territory. But the agreement, if implemented, would bring the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt a war that had evolved into a regional conflict, drawing in countries such as Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, and reshaping the Middle East.The war began with the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023 on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, many of them civilians. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has left tens of thousands of Palestinians dead, devastated Gaza and upended global politics.In recent days, Israel has dialled down its military campaign at Trump’s behest, but it has not halted strikes altogether. Gaza medical authorities reported eight people killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, the lowest toll for weeks. Daily death tolls had been about 10 times as high over the past month as Israeli forces advance on Gaza City.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It calls for a ceasefire, the return of hostages still held by Hamas and a surge of aid into Gaza “without interference … through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent”.Dr Akihiro Seita, the Unrwa director of health and an author of the study, said more malnourished children would die unless there was an end to hostilities and “unimpeded, competent, international humanitarian nutritional, medical, economic and social services”.The study found two years of war had led to “enormous nutritional consequences” for tens of thousands of children across Gaza.Researchers used measurements of the circumference of the arms of 220,000 children aged between six months and five years old in Gaza between January 2024, and August 2025, when famine was declared in parts of Gazaby a UN-backed panel of independent experts.In January 2024, 5% of children screened showed evidence of wasting, rising to nearly 9% six months later, researchers found. After Israel imposed severe aid restrictions from the end of 2024, the prevalence of wasting had almost doubled by January 2025.When a six-week ceasefire allowed more aid to enter Gaza, wasting declined significantly before Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade in March. Though these restrictions were eased in May 2025, levels of wasting among screened children soared to nearly 16%, with almost a quarter of these suffering severe acute malnutrition, the most dangerous form of the condition.Among the estimated total population of Gaza, this is equivalent to more than 54,600 children up to six years old who need emergency nutrition and medical care, including 12,800 severely wasted children, the researchers said.Israel has accused Hamas of looting much of the aid reaching Gaza, but has not provided evidence of any significant amount of theft by the Islamist militant organisation. Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls the entry of aid into Gaza, alsoaccused Hamasof deliberately preventing civilians accessing aid by firing rockets at aid distribution sites.View image in fullscreenPalestinians, including children, wait with pots to receive hot meals distributed by charity organisations on 25 September.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBetween May and July, more than 1,400 Palestinians were killed seeking humanitarian assistance in Gaza, 859 in the vicinity of sites run by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and 514 along the routes of food convoys,according to the UN, which said that most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.Aid agencies say Israeli restrictions prevent much of the aid getting into Gaza, and conditions created by the war and Israeli strategic decisions have made it almost impossible for them to operate.Dr Masako Horino, nutrition epidemiologist at Unrwa and lead scientist for the study, said that evidence from before the war indicated that children in Palestinian refugee families in the Gaza Strip were already “food insecure” but were only marginally underweight.“Following two years of war and severe restrictions in humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality,” Horino said.Leading child health experts and paediatricians said the study was particularly “notable and important” because it was the first major medical study to reveal the extent of malnutrition among children in Gaza after two years of war.Writing in a comment piecein the Lancet, Zulfiqar Bhutta, Jessica Fanzo, and Paul Wise, who were not involved in the research, said: “It is now well established that the children of Gaza are starving and require immediate and sustained humanitarian assistance. The study by Horino and colleagues provides some of the most definitive evidence to date of this effect.”Bhutta, of the Hospital for Sick Children in Canada, Fanzo, of Columbia University and Wise, of Stanford University, also praised the researchers for using scientific evidence “to show grievous, preventable harm to children”.“These temporal data strongly suggest that restrictions on food and assistance have resulted in severe malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip, a reality that will undoubtedly impact their future health and development outcomes for generations.”Although attention has mostly focused on the short-term outcomes of starvation, there should also be “serious concern” over its long-term health effects, which included “inordinately high risks of non-communicable diseases”, they added.On Tuesday, Cogatsaidit “continues to support international organisations facilitating food delivery and production for Gaza’s civilian population”.The study found that in Rafah, the southern city in Gaza, there was a fourfold increase in wasting malnutrition after Israel launched a massive offensive into the city and levelled it. There was then a sharp decline in April 2025 after the short-lived ceasefire.In Gaza City, prevalence of wasting malnutrition rose more than fivefold from March 2025, reaching almost 30% in mid-August 2025.James Elder, a spokesperson for Unicef, said last week that there was “a lot of panic, a lot of very hungry people” in Gaza City.“It is very difficult to describe the levels of desperation there.

After reading the message, the text of which was captured by an Associated Press photographer, Trump told reporters: “I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they’re going to need me pretty quickly.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said in a statement that was “considering” travel to the Middle East after a visit to Walter Reed hospital in Washington DC on Friday morning.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio writes a note before handing it to Donald Trump on Wednesday.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APEarlier,US, Qatari and Turkish officials arrived in the Egyptian coastal resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for the third day of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas.The US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, andJared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, were joined by the Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and the head of Turkish intelligence, Ibrahim Kalin.The presence of the senior officials from the three countries brought further hope that this round of talks could result in a deal, even as significant gaps remained between the two sides.Young lives cut short on an unimaginable scale: the 18,457 children on Gaza’s list of war deadRead more“Good progress has been made today,” the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told reporters in Washington DC. “Events are moving in a good direction, but there’s still some work to be done.”Hamas has said that it is seeking international guarantees thatIsraelwill not resume bombing Gaza after the group releases all the remaining hostages, living and dead, that it captured on 7 October 2023 – its main leverage over Israel.In mid-March, Israel unilaterally ended a ceasefire when it resumed fighting inGazaand declined to move to a second stage of talks that would have led to an end to the war.In an interview with Egyptian TV on Wednesday, the leader of the Palestinian negotiating delegation and seniorHamasofficial, Khalil al-Hayya, said that the group needed firm guarantees from Trump that the war “will not return”.Though Hamas has agreed to three parts ofTrump’s 20-point planto end the war in Gaza – namely the release of all hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, surrendering power in the strip and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza – the rest of the deal still needs to be discussed.View image in fullscreenAn Egyptian woman watches footage of the US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner arriving in Sharm el-Sheikh for talks.Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesAmong the points that still need to be negotiated are the demands that Hamas disarm, how and when Israeli troops withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and the makeup of an international technocratic body that is meant to govern Gaza.Logistics of a hostage-prisoner swap still need to be ironed out. Hamas had given mediators a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants to see released from Israeli prisons, said Taher al-Nounou, a senior Hamas official.Rightwing members of the Israeli government have put pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, not to allow the release of certain prisoners, such as Marwan Barghouti, who has frequently been touted as a future Palestinian political leader, according to Israeli media.The far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said that Netanyahu should seek “complete victory” over Hamas in Gaza, in remarks he made while praying at al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem – a disputed area that contains Islam’s third-holiest site and is Judaism’s holiest place – on Wednesday. Hamas called his visit a “deliberate provocation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Netanyahu’s office said on Tuesday that Israel was “cautiously optimistic” about the discussions. Hamas has also said it will operate in good faith to ensure talks result in a permanent ceasefire.In separate statements, however, both parties have given conflicting visions on how they see the long-term prospects of the ceasefire. Netanyahu has said on two occasions that the Israeli army will remain in Gaza, in apparent contradiction to the Trump plan.In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas did not mention disarmament, while in interviews with Arabic media, some officials have rejected the idea of laying down the group’s arms entirely.The Trump administration and its Arab allies, as well as regional players such asTurkey, have thrown their weight behind the current round of peace talks in an effort to quickly push through a truce that has evaded negotiators for two years. Trump has said that he wants Israeli hostages to be released this week and has threatened Hamas with “total obliteration” if it does not agree to the deal.How likely is it that Trump’s Gaza plan will work?Read moreTrump’s plan calls for an immediate end to fighting in Gaza, the release of all 48 hostages held by Hamas – 20 of whom are believed to still be alive – the disarmament of Hamas and its relinquishing of governing power in the Gaza strip to an international transitional authority headed by Trump. In return, Israel would gradually withdraw to a buffer zone at the edges of the strip and return nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees.Humanitarian aid would also surge in a bid to alleviate the famine that consumes parts of Gaza as a result of Israel’s blockade, as well as reconstruction funds to the destroyed strip.In conjunction with the talks in Egypt, France is to host a ministerial meeting in Paris with counterparts from Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Jordan,Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE, among other countries, according to Reuters.The meeting will discuss the potential international stabilisation force in Gaza, the body meant to rule over the territory, the disarmament of Hamas, as well as humanitarian aid and reconstruction, the Associated Press reported.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises following an Israeli military strike in the northern Gaza Strip.Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/APThe Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, criticised the ministerial meeting for not including the country, describing it as being “concocted behind Israel’s back”. Saar said that he hoped the meeting would not jeopardise the release of hostages.Israel continued to strike Gaza as negotiations progressed, despite the US calling for a ceasefire on Friday. At least 10 people were killed by Israeli strikes and fire over the last 24 hours, according to the Gaza health authority.At least 67,183 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 170,000 wounded by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza over the last two years. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage on 7 October 2023.A growing number of bodies, including the UN commission of inquiry, have concluded that Israel has committed genocide in its two-year war in Gaza. Israel denies the claim, saying it has only acted in self-defence.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpIsraelGazaPalestineQatarTurkeynewsShareReuse this content"

We’re going to a country, India, where they’ve already done ID and made a massive success of it. So one of the meetings I’ll be having is about ID, in relation to that.”View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer speaks to the British high commissioner to India, Lindy Cameron, and the British deputy high commissioner for western India, Harjinder Kang, in Mumbai.Photograph: Leon Neal/ReutersThe digital ID system in India is far more extensive than that announced by the UK government and holds biometric data as well as residential and contact information. Government sources said there was no intention to copy the system, but to examine the way it was used and implemented, handling 80m transactions a day.It is considered a success, albeit with controversial implications, with estimates it has saved the Indian economy about £11bn in administration and corruption costs.Citizens are given a 12-digit identifying number, which replaces the need for multiple layers of paper documentation to prove their status when they take out bank accounts or apply for state benefits. Prior to the scheme, millions of babies would routinely not be registered at birth, leaving people struggling to access benefits or ways to prove their existence later in life.Critics of the Indian scheme said it was introduced with little protection for personal data, and has caused problems among the poorest citizens, with some said to have been denied medical care or benefits for not having the ID.Phone companies and banks have in some instances threatened to shut down accounts not linked to ID numbers, though a supreme court ruling has said it should not be mandatory for private services or education. Activists have also reported it being used to disenfranchise Muslim voters in the north of the country.Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was held because it was “useful to hear from the Indian experience; it has a very different inception and a different system, but it is used 80m times a day”.View image in fullscreenProtesters gather near Downing Street to voice their opposition to the plans for digital IDs.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAsked about some of the controversies with the Indian system, he said the UK system would have a different design – there are no plans to use biometric data so far. “One of core priorities is inclusivity and that’s what the British consultation will be about,” he said.Starmer said the scheme was essential to tackle illegal working, as the ID would be mandatory for employment, but that he hoped it would become a voluntary convenience measure for most British citizens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rightwing parties have put the spotlight on gig economy companies such as UberEats and Deliveroo, where migrant workers have been able to use false identities to work.“We have to have returns agreements with countries, as we’ve got with France, and we need to address the fact that too many people can come to this country and work illegally,” Starmer said. “And that’s why ID mandatory for working is really important.Starmer insists India trade deal will not affect UK visas as he heads to MumbaiRead more“There is a case to be made about the benefits for voluntary ID into other areas, and obviously we need to make that case. I think it’s a really important discussion for us to have. So on the one hand, it’s mandatory for work, but I actually think it would be a good passport.”The government has not identified any private provider that can take part in the scheme, with the tech companyPalantirsaying it would not do so because the plan was not in the Labour manifesto and therefore had no mandate.All opposition parties have said they would oppose the scheme, and there remain significant misgivings among some Labour MPs about the possibility of snowballing costs and data breaches.Net support for digital ID cardsfell from 35% in the early summer to -14%at the weekend after Starmer’s announcement, according to polling by More in Common.View image in fullscreenThe prime minister meets the Bollywood star Rani Mukerji during a visit to Yash Raj Films studio.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAStarmer will meet his Indian counterpart,Narendra Modi, on Thursday and make a keynote address at a fintech conference.

Speaking at a visit to a football ground, Starmer denied business leaders had been pressing for liberalisation of visa rules.“None of them have raised with me the question of visas. That wasn’t part of the FTA (free trade agreement),” he said. “What this is about is providing opportunities for them to take advantage of the FTA, and even before it’s fully enforced, the mood is very, very strong between India and the UK.”Explore more on these topicsIdentity cardsKeir StarmerIndiaNarendra ModiTrade policySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Myanmar has been engulfed in armed conflict since the military seized power in 2021 and the village has been a key battleground in the war.“I saw body parts [scattered] everywhere,” a resident told the Democratic Voice of Burma news service. Witnesses said it was hard to distinguish civilians from anti-junta fighters among those killed.The bombs were dropped from a paraglider fitted with a small engine, a low-tech and cheap weapon of a type that the Myanmar junta has increasingly deployed this year tointensify its aerial campaignagainst those opposing it.The victims were holding a sit-in protest against the military regime during a ceremony to celebrate the Thadingyut festival, the country’s biggest Buddhist holiday.A local resident who attended Monday’s ceremony told the Associated Press that people began to flee after hearing reports of an approaching paraglider but it arrived sooner than expected. The paraglider returned later the same evening to drop more explosives.Footage of the crowd’s desperate scramble to help the wounded and locate missing loved ones circulated on social media.Amnesty International said the attack underscored the need to protect Myanmar residents. “The international community may have forgotten about the conflict in Myanmar, but the Myanmar military is taking advantage of reduced scrutiny to carry out war crimes with impunity,” said Joe Freeman, Amnesty’s Myanmar researcher.Myanmar junta’s promise of elections denounced as ‘sham’ by expertsRead moreThe military has not acknowledged carrying out an attack in the area.Myanmar’s generals have been fighting a civil war that erupted after they seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.

It has also emerged that he appears to have had Islamic marriages to three women in towns across the north of England at the same time, fathering two young children to one of them.The 38-year-old, who cannot be identified, described how Shamie was “controlling and manipulating”, admonishing her for drinking energy drinks, encouraging her to go to the mosque, read the Qur’an and pray with him, and later refusing her requests for a divorce.However, she said that he had never appeared radicalised and was a “normal” practising Muslim, adding that he had barely mentioned Israel’s attack on Gaza – which counter-terror police are examining as a potential motive for his attack. One witness heard him shout: “This is what you’re going to get for killing our children” as he tried to force his way into the synagogue armed with a knife last Thursday.She said: “Was he this terrorist all along or was he crying out for help? Who knows? Maybe [he did it because of] his messed-up life, because he’s playing too many people. Apparently he was up for rape with the police. There’s so many questions.“Did he do it because he knew he was going to get found out about these other women and he was up [on police bail] for [rape]? Or was he just mentally fed up and drained because he couldn’t carry on living the lifestyle?”Police said on Wednesday that Shamie pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a call to 999 during the attack but reiterated that he was not known to counter-terror officers. However, he is known to have a criminal past and was under investigation for an alleged rape.The Guardian revealed this week that police officers attended his family home earlier this year, believed to be in relation to safeguarding concerns. He lived at the property in Prestwich, north Manchester, with his mother and one of his wives and their two children, aged one and three. After the police visit, he told neighbours that his wife had left and would not let him see their children.In an hour-long interview on Wednesday, a separate wife described how Shamie had led a double life and initially kept his Manchester family secret. She said they met on the Muslim dating app Muzmatch (now called Muzz) in December 2021 and married in an Islamic ceremony the following month.Shamie is said to have used multiple online personae, frequently using the name “Jay” and in one profile calling himself Dormammu Seven – a reference to a comic-book devil. His interests included anime and the Marvel series, working out, playing football, praying at the mosque and attending Islamic talks, she said, adding that he did not drink or take drugs.0:35Voice message from Jihad Al-Shamie to one of his wives – audioThe woman, a Muslim convert, said she last spoke to him in April this year, shortly after he passed his driving test. Speaking about their relationship, she described how he had been nice at first but then became “controlling, manipulating” and “intimidating and aggressive”, adding: “He would be slating me and my children and would say ‘Who would want you and your baggage?’”She said Shamie had raped her multiple times but that she did not report this to police until after the synagogue attack. The woman said she had now given a first witness account and handed over her mobile phone to investigators.Text messages seen by the Guardian show Shamie refusing her request for a divorce when she discovered he had children with another woman at his home in Manchester. In another he tells her: “I can do better … don’t need someone with your baggage,” and to “stop being silly and paranoid”. He wrote: “I’ve already taken u back as my wife u don’t get to just dissappear [sic] and block me [it] doesn’t work like that.”In a voice note, he said: “I’m crazy about you.

He wrote: “We must deliver the efficiency plans set out in June – reducing administrative budgets, including those of arm’s-length bodies and agencies – and deliver comprehensive digital transformation.”The Treasury reserve is a source of backup funds intended to be used by departments in “genuinely unforeseen, unaffordable and unavoidable pressures”. However, it has recently been used to fund higher public-sector pay, military operations and compensation payouts.Starting under the previous Conservative government, the Home Office has repeatedly relied on an annual top-up from the reserve to coverthe cost of the asylum system, claiming £4.3bn in 2023-24.The Home Office’s claims on the reserve in 2023-24 made up more than a quarter of thedepartment’s total spending in that financial year, a larger proportion than for any other department.The Treasury’s clampdown on this practice before the budget on 26 November forms an attempt to reduce government borrowing and keep departmental spending within the totals announced in the spending review in June.This will helpRachel Reeves, the chancellor, stick to her borrowing rules; she wrote to ministers last month warning them that their access to the reserve would be restricted.In his letter, Murray asked cabinet ministers to “respond to any pressures your department faces by making offsetting savings and by taking choices about reprioritisation”.Departments will also be forced to repay any successful claims from the reserve – the value of which was £9bn last year and is expected to be halved this year – in future.The largest claim on the reserve in 2023-24 – £18.5bn – was made by the Department for Education, which reflected a change in the valuation of thestock of student loan debtowed to the government. The Department of Health and Social Care claimed £2.8bn in the same year for NHS pay, costs of industrial action and extra NHS costs over the winter.Reserve funds have also been used to fund military support for Ukraine and compensate post office operators after the Post Office Horizon IT scandal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is the situation that we inherited, that is where the £22bn black hole comes from, and that is why I am having to make difficult decisions today to get a grip on the public finances.”Experts have criticised successive governments for using the reserve in a way that appears to go against the spirit of Treasury guidance.Reeves is still expected to announce tax rises in her budget next month to plug a spending gap estimated to stand at between £20bn and £40bn, amid anexpected productivity downgradeby the Office for Budget Responsibility and aseries of policy reversals, including scrapping plans for welfare cuts.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Tax and spendingEconomic policyBudgetDepartment for EducationLabourRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump and big pharma. Just one more way he’s menacing Britain | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe Liberal Democrats immediately criticised the move, first reported by Politico, asking how much it would cost and whether it would lead to cuts elsewhere in theNHS.The science secretary, Patrick Vallance, haspublicly acknowledgedthat the UK’s spending on new medicines needs to rise from 9% of overall NHS spend, which is below drug spending in the US and many other European countries.The main element of the plan is thought to include raising the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) cost-effectiveness threshold by 25%, which has been unchanged since 1999. Under current rules,Nice considers a medicine costing between £20,000 and £30,000for every extra year of good-quality life it provides a patient to represent good value for money for the NHS.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry on Tuesdayreiterated its callfor “urgent action” on drug pricing, saying the Nice threshold should be increased as soon as possible in line with inflation to between £40,000 and £50,000, and index-linked thereafter. Making this change would, over time, lead to a greater share of the NHS budget being allocated to medicines, and additional funding would be needed to support this.In talks over the summer, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, proposed a deal that would save the pharmaceutical industry £1bn over three years, with billions more promised over the coming decade.But the industry argued that it was forecast to make repayments totalling £13.5bn over the same period and has been demanding about £2.5bn a year extra.A government source said ministers were prepared to spend more on medicines as they increasingly became more ​innovative and preventive. They cited the example of weight loss injections – which are forecast to save the NHS billions of pounds in treating obesity and associated health problems – and trials for cancer-preventing vaccines.The patient-led campaign group Just Treatment called it “deeply troubling news for patients and the NHS”, adding: “We are at risk of importing America’s disastrous drug pricing crisis.” It called on the government to “take steps to establish a system for developing and manufacturing medicines that puts patients first”.TheNHS spent £20.6bn on medicinesand medical devices in 2023-24, up from £19.2bn the year before.Trump has put pressure on pharma companies to lower their drug prices in the US and increase them elsewhere, accusing other countries of “freeloading” on high US prices. Nearly two weeks ago, he threatened to impose100% tariffs on pharmaceutical imports from 1 Octoberto ramp up the pressure, although these did not materialise.In response to pressure from Trump, Pfizer and several other US and European companies, including the UK’s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, have started to cut their prices in the US and to sell directly to patients to cut out costly middlemen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They should also lay their plans before parliament without delay so they can be properly scrutinised. It increasingly feels like this government puts the whims of Trump before everything else – even our precious NHS.”The pharma sector’snegotiations with the UK government over drug pricing under a voluntary scheme broke downwithout an agreement in late August. Since then, MSD has abandoned plans for a £1bn research centre in London and AstraZeneca and New York-based Eli Lilly have paused projects, taking total pharmainvestments that are on hold or cancelled to nearly £2bnsince the start of this year.One industry source said: “We are relieved to see a recognisable change in sentiment and language from August.”Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryNHSTrump administrationHealthUS politicsDrugsTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

They would “allow an open all hours free-for-all in the availability of alcohol”, said Dr Katherine Severi, the chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies thinktank.But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said that “a new and improved licensing system that is fit for the 21st century will be a huge boost to the nation’s pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels”.Nick Mackenzie, the chief executive of Greene King, agreed, adding that existing licensing regulations “provide a clear example of how well-intentioned legislation can inhibit economic growth, with excessive restrictions often limiting premises’ ability to respond to changing circumstances and customer demand”.Local authorities and police and crime commissioners fear that extended late night opening will lead to more noise, nuisance and antisocial behaviour blighting the lives of residents who live near licensed premises.“These proposed reforms, developed without adequate input from policing, ambulance services, local licensing authorities, health experts or citizens are a charter for chaos,” said Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Change UK.“One of the biggest things that people across the country are desperate to see is safer streets with less antisocial behaviour. Yet these proposals – little more than an alcohol industry wish-list – would deliver the opposite.”“Allowing petrol stations, off-licences and corner shops to sell alcohol even later into the evening, or the early hours, will inevitably mean more victims of crime, including domestic violence, more antisocial behaviour and disturbance, more police time spent dealing with drink-fuelled incidents and both ambulance and A&E staff having to deal with even more people who have come to harm as a result of alcohol,” he added.View image in fullscreenThe move was criticised by health experts as a ‘charter for chaos’Photograph: Sergio Azenha/AlamyThe plans centre on major reforms of the Licensing Act 2003, under which local councils grant licences to 224,000 pubs, clubs, restaurants and supermarkets to sell alcohol within set hours. Council licensing committees of elected councillors base their decisions on four “licensing objectives”: the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, prevention of public nuisance and protecting children from harm.But the government-appointed taskforce behind the plan has suggested the creation of a new fifth objective – promoting economic growth – which councils would have to take into account when deciding on applications for new premises or longer opening hours. That has sparked claims that the government has become too close to the alcohol industry.“Adding a new objective focused on economic growth is completely ludicrous and undermines the purpose of licensing”, said Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance.“Licensing exists to protect people, not business profits. To push this through while alcohol deaths are at record highs raises serious questions about who this government is really working for.”The taskforce was co-chaired by Mackenzie and Gareth Thomas, at the time a business and trade minister. It also included representatives of UK Hospitality, the Night Time Industries Association and live music industry as well as from the National Police Chiefs Council and greater London Authority. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, has been granted powers to overrule licensing decisions by the capital’s 32 local councils if he judges that that will boost the city’s night time economy and appeal to tourists.When the proposals were first floated earlier this year the government said that it was “calling ‘last orders’ on red tape choking pubs, clubs and restaurants in [a] major boost to the British night out”.Severi warned ministers that the push to help the hospitality sector could backfire as off-licences, corner shops and supermarkets, which already sell 75% of all alcohol, would also take advantage of easier access to longer opening hours.“Using licensing to deregulate alcohol sales in the name of business growth is misguided and irresponsible”, she added.“While the government may be wary of introducing public health measures that could be seen as unpopular with Reform UK voters or criticised as ‘nanny state’ policies, polling shows strong support among Reform voters for government action to protect and promote health, particularly when it helps reduce preventable disease and ease pressure on the NHS,” she added.The plan will also restrict local councils’ long-held freedom to control licensing in their area by creating a new “national licensing policy framework” which would enhance the role of unelected licensing officers and diminish the power of elected representatives.“These reforms would hollow out the power of local licensing authorities, giving decisive influence to unelected officials and unaccountable bodies”, said James Nicholls, an expert in alcohol policy at Stirling University. They will also make it harder for residents to object to applications from operators to open new premises or extend opening hours, he added.His colleague Prof Niamh Fitzgerald said: “These proposals are completely contrary to any intention to deliver safer streets or reduce violence against women. The Home Office’s own analysis has found that alcohol is a factor in half of all intimate partner murders.”A government spokesperson said: “We are looking to rebalance the licensing system, to one which both protects local communities and gives businesses the flexibility they need to invest and adapt to changing consumer trends.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryPubsEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Her problem is whether it will make any difference.Badenoch arrived in Manchester at the weekendamid gloomy warningsthat her party – languishing at just 16% in the polls and fast losing support to Reform UK – was facing oblivion.Political analysts reported that in focus groups across the country, barely anyone was able to name a single thing she had said or done since becoming leader. “The biggest risk for the Tories is that they are drifting into irrelevance,” one said.View image in fullscreenFringe events were sparsely attended and most shadow cabinet ministers found themselves addressing a half-empty hall.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOne disgruntled Tory MP has even set up a countdown clock on social media platform X of the days left until party rules allow rivals to mount a challenge. On the first anniversary of her leadership, 2 November, her critics will be able to submit letters to trigger a contest.Rivals are waiting in the wings. Foremost among them isRobert Jenrick, who has made little secret of his intentions. “He reeks of naked ambition,” says one shadow cabinet colleague. “It’s the sunk cost fallacy: he’s poured so much into it he can’t give up now.”The shadow justice secretary, who lost to Badenoch in last year’s leadership contest, packed out fringe events and the main conference hall as he expounded his Reform-lite brand of politics to the adoring Tory faithful.Tories will scrap stamp duty on primary residences, Kemi Badenoch tells conferenceRead moreYet he appeared to have learned the lessons of the Andy Burnham show at Labour conference in Liverpool last week, taking a marginally more subtle approach as he toured fringe events and parties, praising Badenoch’s leadership and insisting he was “right behind” her.Like Burnham, Jenrick emerged from conference a diminished figure, after his complaint about “not seeing another white face” in a part of Birmingham,revealed by the Guardian, led to accusations of toxic nationalism.Badenoch’s moment of greatest peril comes after the local elections in May, when the Tories face wipeout in Wales and Scotland, as well as in councils across England. There appears to be a consensus among her critics that trying to oust her before then would make little difference.“Kemi will survive until May at least,” one former government adviser attending the conference said. “People just aren’t interested in moving against her sooner. There is a lot of apathy.”View image in fullscreenConference attendance was down one-third on 2024.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAt a fringe event on Sunday, the polling guru Sir John Curtice questioned the wisdom of the Tories’ endless focus on migration: “The question I would pose to you is, does it necessarily make sense to try to out-Reform Reform?”But within 24 hours the conference had pivoted to the economy, which polls suggest is the party’s strongest card in a weak hand. “We had to tackle issues like the ECHR [European convention on human rights] early on, to give us the space to talk about what we wanted to,” one shadow cabinet minister said.Senior Tories believe they can beat Reform on the economy, and that Nigel Farage’s pitch to the left on issues such as welfare and state aid is his achilles heel.“Reform want to get back to the days of nationalisation and state control. They are marching to the left. Be in no doubt. They are the party of more spending and more debt,” the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, told delegates.Some Tories are sceptical the strategy will be effective, as voters won’t buy that the Reform leader is anything other than a Thatcherite. They also fear the party has a long way to go to restore its reputation for fiscal prudence after the damage done by Liz Truss’s mini-budget.In the conference bars, MPs and members openly debated whether the party had done enough to express contrition for the chaos unleashed on the country in the final years of the Tories’ time in power.View image in fullscreenThe shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, has made little secret of his leadership ambitions.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBadenoch opened the conference on Sunday with a speech that acknowledged they had lost the trust and confidence of the public. “This week we will set out how we have changed, how we will be different – and, most importantly, how we will make a difference,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Badenoch is not among them.A British Ice and more stop and search: Badenoch’s Tories set out new policiesRead moreBut while Reform tried its best to make hay – releasing a drip drip of 20 councillor defectors over the course of one day – the Tory leader was determined to ignore them.In one oblique reference in her closing speech on Wednesday, she appeared to encourage her party not to engage with Farage. “As George Bernard Shaw said: ‘Never wrestle with a pig. You both get dirty and the pig likes it.’”The absence of crowd-drawing Tory big beasts such as Boris Johnson was palpable. Jacob Rees-Mogg attended Reform UK’s conference in September but skipped the Conservative one.Overall attendance at the conference was down a third on last year, when the leadership contest attracted more members, according to party sources. The Tories had to give away business tickets for free for the first time.A security guard working at the entrance to the convention centre joked with journalists on Sunday: “It’s so quiet in there, I’ve been to busier dinner parties.”View image in fullscreenCabinet members Andrew Griffith, Victoria Atkins and James Cleverly singing the national anthem before Kemi Badenoch makes her leader’s speech at the Conservative conference in Manchester.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFringe events were sparsely attended and most shadow cabinet ministers found themselves addressing a half-empty hall. There was no sense of buzz or excitement around any senior politician, other than a dutiful following for Badenoch herself.“We’ll take that,” one shadow cabinet minister said when asked at the end of the gathering about the downbeat mood. “Kemi has done what she needed to and it will have bought her some time. It could have turned out very differently.”More experienced Tory politicians urged their colleagues to maintain their newly found restraint. “The shadow of recent Conservative governments may be too big for Kemi Badenoch to escape. But this conference suggests that the best course Tory MPs can take is to let her get on with the job,” the Tory peer Paul Goodman said.A shadow cabinet minister added: “We need to keep calm and carry on because what’s the alternative? If Kemi goes it means things are even worse than they are now, and anybody who takes over will be carrying an unexploded bomb.”“You can tell people not to touch the iron but some won’t listen. You might have thought ending up with just 121 MPs had burned them enough, but maybe they need to hold the iron tight to actually learn.”But Tory MPs, who have become addicted to regicide in recent years, do not appear to be in any mood to heed the advice. Badenoch’s team is aware of a 14-strong WhatsApp group of Tory MPs who are determined to oust her.“She wasted her first year and has had virtually no cut-through with the public,” one critical MP said. “If we stick with her it’s game over and we’ll be facilitating not just the end of the Tory party, but Nigel Farage in Downing Street.”Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochConservativesConservative conferenceRobert JenricknewsShareReuse this content"

He will then return to the White House.”This is the second time since returning to the White House in January that the president has gone to Walter Reed for an exam. Last time, it included cognitive and cardiology tests. It is not clear what exactly this checkup will entail.According to a memo from the president’s physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, Trump underwent his “annual physical examination” at Walter Reed on 11 April. The health report, released by the White House, declared Trump “fully fit to execute the duties” of the presidency. It suggested the president’s “frequent victories in golf events” contributed to his “excellent” physical and mental wellbeing.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Marco Rubio interrupts Trump with handwritten note on Gaza peace dealRead moreLeavitt said Trump was “considering going to the Middle East shortly” after his consultation on Friday. The president had said earlier on Wednesday that he was contemplating a trip to Egypt this weekend as he sought to finalize a deal to end the two-year war in Gaza.Since his April exam, Trump was diagnosed withchronic venous insufficiency, a condition that can cause swelling, as the president has experienced in his legs and is common in older adults. Trump’s physician also addressed concern about bruising on the president’s hand, attributing it to irritation caused by frequent handshaking and his use of aspirin as a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.Recent images of a purplish bruise on Trump’s hand, which appeared to have been covered with a patch of makeup, fueled online speculation that the president was ill.Trump has long been cagey about his health, and concern about the president’s wellbeing stretches back to his first term. But wild rumors reached a fever pitch when the president faded from public view for several days over the summer, with critics and TikTok influencers speculating that the president was on his deathbed. “NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE!” Trump wrote at the time, in an assertion that only fueled suspicions of a coverup.Questions about the 79-year-old president’s mental acuity have flared in recent weeks following a series ofbizarre, rambling appearances anderratic onlinebehavior.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHealthUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Then Rubio passed the president a note.“I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they’re gonna need me pretty quickly,” Trump said. “So we’ll take a couple of more questions.”The event had already been going on for more than an hour when Rubio first approached. The president invited him to come in, and Rubio whispered something to Trump before handing him the note.The note’s urgent tone came as Trump’s top Middle East adviser, Steve Witkoff, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and other senior officials joined a third day of peace talks between Israel and Hamas at an Egyptian resort – a sign that negotiators aim to dive deeply into the toughest issues of a US plan to end the war in Gaza.Trump had kicked off the influencer event by telling assembled journalists that he planned to travel to the Middle East “toward the end of the week” and could even “make the rounds” in the region to Egypt and possibly Gaza as US negotiators closed in on a deal.Still, even after Rubio passed Trump the note, Trump continued to talk to the influencers and take questions from the media as the secretary of state became visibly anxious.View image in fullscreenThe note that was passed from Rubio to Trump.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APNearly 10 minutes after his initial comments about leaving, Trump said: “I have to go now to try and solve some problems in the Middle East – although I’m very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows.”“We don’t want to take any chances. So we’re going to go and do that,” Trump added.He then suggested Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem stay and take questions in his absence. However, Trump continued to take questions before the event finally broke up without Cabinet members remaining behind.“We’re gonna get peace in the Middle East,” Trump wrapped by saying. “That’s what we want to do.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMarco RubioTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, she has been unable to assume her new role because Johnson has not administered the oath of office.On Wednesday afternoon, Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, Arizona’s two Democratic senators, gathered to take questions from the press in front of the speaker’s office in the Capitol. Johnson soon arrived, and the Democrats pressed him on when Grijalva would be sworn in.“We’re going to do that as soon as we get back to work, but we need the lights turned back on, so we encourage both of you to go open the government,” the speaker replied, according to video of the exchange.Grijalvahas told the Guardianthat she believes Johnson is delaying her official start in the House because only one more signature is needed on a petition to force a vote on legislation requiring the release of files related to the late alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.When Gallego asked whether that was indeed the case, Johnson called the idea “totally absurd”.“You guys are experts in red herrings and distraction,” he told the senators, later calling the encounter a “publicity stunt”.The speaker also denied that Grijalva was being treated any differently from two Florida Republicans who won special elections earlier this year and were sworn in quickly.“They had a scheduled day for the oath of office, and the House was called out of session that day. They had all their family and friends here, so we went ahead and went through the process,” Johnson said.The argument took place as Democrats and Republicans remain at loggerheads over restarting government funding, which lapsed last Wednesday. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed, while national parks and government offices nationwide are closed or have reduced their services.Republicans are demanding that Democrats support a bill to fund the government through 21 November, but the minority party has refused and instead demanded a number of healthcare-centered concessions.The measure has already passed the House, and Johnson has kept the chamber out of session in an effort to pressure Senate Democrats into providing the eight votes it is expected to need to clear the upper chamber.The encounter between Johnson and the Democratic senators was not the only confrontation to take place in the Capitol on Wednesday.As he left a press conference, the House minority leader,Hakeem Jeffries, was challenged by the Republican representative Mike Lawler, who demanded that he sign on to legislation that would extend for a year premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans – a major condition of the Democrats.“We got a one-year extension. Why don’t we sign on right now?” asked Lawler, who had also briefly sparred with the Democratic senators outside Johnson’s office.Lawler and Jeffries got into a minutes-long argument, according to video, that ended when the minority leader told the representative, a fellow New Yorker who is seen as vulnerable to losing re-election: “You’re embarrassing yourself and your district right now, and you’re going down to defeat next year.”Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesArizonaMike JohnsonUS politicsUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

Because I know a few guys.”During Wednesday’s roundtable, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, sat beside Trump and repeated his condemnations of antifa. “This is not activism, it’s anarchy,” she said. “We can’t and we will not let masked terrorists burn our buildings, attack our law enforcement and intimidate our communities.”Trump also listed examples of attacks against federal agents which he has attributed to antifa, and suggested that the man charged with shooting Charlie Kirk was a “a far-left extremist”. Law enforcement officials have not established a link between Tyler Robinson and any specific group.“The epidemic of leftwing violence and antifa-inspired terror has been escalating for nearly a decade,” Trump said.All of the witnesses who spoke during the roundtable were conservative influencers or partisan rightwing journalists, who all claimed that antifa was a terror organization without presenting any evidence.Explore more on these topicsKristi NoemTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Taxpayers around the country will now have a much harder time getting the assistance they need, just as they get ready to file their extension returns due next week.”The IRS’s decision to furlough its employees comes a day after a White Housememosuggested that furloughed workers may not receive back pay, despite the 2019 law Trump signed during his first term, during the last government shutdown; the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Gefta) ensures government workers would be automatically paid after future shutdowns.In his letter, Traynor said that “employees must be compensated on the earliest date possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationUS federal government shutdown 2025US federal government shutdownsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of thousands of aviation workers, federal and private sector, ask all day long, ‘Is it safe?’ We do that so the American public can take safety and security for granted,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA).TSA officers and air traffic controllers are coming to work “understaffed and under-resourced by the government in any increasingly unsafe scenario,” Nelson said. “In safety we know that the first rule is to remove all distractions. But what could be more of a distraction than not getting a paycheck?”Staffing shortages, including an elevated number of workers calling in sick at airports across the US, on Monday affected major airports around New York, Los Angeles and Denver on Monday, delaying over 6,000 flights across the US.In Los Angeles, air traffic control at Burbank airport was closed and air traffic was handled by another facility. The Nashville airport was experiencing delays of around two hours because of staffing issues, the FAAsaid on its websiteon Tuesday. At Chicago’s O’Hare airport delays averaged 41 minutes, and at Dallas-Fort Worth delays were logged at 30 minutes, the FAA said.About 92% of the more than 23,600 flights departing from US airports as of Tuesday afternoon took off on time, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Despite the delays, the FAA had not issued a “staffing trigger” that would reduce the number of flights in and out of airports,NBC News said.In a statement on its website, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the largest union representing air traffic controllers, said it did “not endorse, support, or condone any federal employees participating in or endorsing a coordinated activity that negatively affects the capacity” of the National Airspace System.The union said “air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public very seriously. Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service. It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA’s credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families.”The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, warned Tuesday that the country’s air traffic control system is being harmed by the government shutdown.During a visit to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Duffy said the shutdown has increased stress on controllers, who are already working with outdated equipment, and he blamed Democrats for the situation.“They’re not just now thinking about the airspace,” Duffy said of air traffic controllers, who are not paid during a shutdown. “They’re thinking about, ‘Am I going to get a paycheck?”That comes asDonald Trumphas signaled that some furloughed federal workers may not, as is customary, receive back pay when the government reopens.“There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way,” Trump said during an event at the White House. He added that said back pay “depends on who we’re talking about”.According to the FAA’s shutdown contingency planning, a quarter of the workforce, or more than 11,000 FAA employees, were furloughed when the shutdown began last week. But 13,000 air traffic controllers continue working, with hiring and training also ongoing.“They’re not wealthy, they don’t have three or four or five months of cash sitting in their bank accounts,” Duffy said. “Like many of us, they go from one paycheck to the next, and they rely on that to pay the bills.”Nick Daniels, president of the NATCA, said the shutdown highlighted issues that air traffic controllers were already facing, including staff shortages and outdated equipment. The situation, he said, was particularly grave at smaller airports.“It’s not like we have other controllers that can suddenly come to that facility and staff them. There’s not enough people there,” Daniels told AP.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US federal government shutdownsDallasNashvilleBostonChicagoPhiladelphianewsShareReuse this content"

They’re proud of what they do, but they’re tired of being treated like their lives are expendable,” Omar said in a statement on the bill.White House says furloughed federal workers not entitled to back pay amid shutdownRead more“This administration has made it clear it’s not interested in standing up for workers – but I am,” she added. “As a working parent, I know the importance of having reliable childcare. This bill is a small but necessary way to show that their work and their families matter.”About 100 childcare centers previously operated in GSA-managed federal spaces, providing childcare for thousands of children daily, but the so-called “department of government efficiency”eliminatedthe GSA office that managed these facilities earlier this year.Co-sponsors of the bill include the congressional Democratic representatives Pramila Jayapal, Summer Lee, Gregory Meeks, Jerry Nadler, and Rashida Tlaib.Areportfrom the Economic Policy Institute in Marchnotedthat childcare is more expensive than rent in 17 states and Washington DC”, with the average cost of childcare for an infant in Washington DC at $2,363 per month, the highest average cost in the US.It comes as Donald Trump’s administration attempts to pin blame on Democrats for the shutdown,repeating false claimsabout funding healthcare for undocumented people. “Democrats should simply stop putting illegal aliens before the American people and reopen the government,” said Abigail Jackson, spokesperson for the White House in an email.ButDemocratsinsist this is unfair. “The House hasn’t held a vote now for eighteen days,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democrat leader, wrote on social media on Tuesday. Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, “is CAUSING—and NOT INTERESTED IN ENDING—the shutdown”, Schumer claimed.Omar’s bill is the latest proposed by Democrats to support federal workers affected by the government shutdown.

And there are worrying signs the test may come,” she told an audience at the Milken Institute in Washington.Georgieva suggested the full economic impact of US tariffs “is yet to unfold”, after many firms front loaded exports earlier this year to dodge the levies. “Buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay,” she warned.In thelast updateof its World Economic Outlook in July, the IMF forecast global GDP growth of 3% for this year – a modest slowdown from 3.3% in 2024. It will update its projections at next week’s meetings.While financial markets have broadly remained calm in the face of policy turmoil, she said this was “masking but not arresting some softening trends”, and warned: “History tells us this sentiment can turn abruptly.”Share prices in the US have surged to fresh highs in recent weeks, driven by rocketing valuations for the “magnificent seven” tech firms, including chip maker Nvidia and Elon Musk’s electric vehicle-maker Tesla.Optimism about future productivity gains from generative AI have continued to underpinconfidence on Wall Street, despite signs of a slowdown elsewhere, including in the US jobs market.Drawing a parallel with the dotcom bubble at the turn of the millennium,Georgieva said; “Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago.“If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth, expose vulnerabilities, and make life especially tough for developing countries.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is time for action,” she said. “Remove border frictions in the labour market, goods and services trade, energy and finance. Build a single European financial system. Build an energy union. Complete your project.”She also highlighted growing public frustration at the economic status quo in some countries, warning: “Many people in many places – especially the young – are taking their disappointment to the streets: from Lima to Rabat, from Paris to Nairobi, and from Kathmandu to Jakarta, all are demanding better opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsInternational tradeGlobal economyTrump tariffsTariffsKristalina GeorgievanewsShareReuse this content"

If you look at it just from a strategic asset allocation perspective, you would probably have something like 15% of your portfolio in gold … because it is one asset that does very well when the typical parts of the portfolio go down.”The price of gold futures, which can be seen as a measure of sentiment, rose above $4,000 per ounce on Tuesday. Futures are now trading higher than the spot price, suggesting appetite for gold shows little sign of fading.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Central banks, including China’s central bank, have also been buying gold, fuelling expectations that the gold rally will continue.Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at the banking group ING, said: “Gold has staged a historic rally, doubling in less than two years.“Looking ahead, central banks are still buying … Trump’s trade war is still pressing on, geopolitical risks remain elevated and ETF holdings continue to expand while expectations of more Fed rate cuts intensify. All of this suggests that gold has still further room to run.”Investors have traditionally turned to gold and other safe haven assets during previous US government shutdowns, but some analysts predict the rally could slow if the shutdown ends more quickly than anticipated.However, expectations of US interest rate cuts, along with tariffs, and continued concern over other geopolitical uncertainty may continue to make gold attractive to investors.Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesUS federal government shutdown 2025EconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That includes the Environmental Protection Agency, the interior and energy departments and others.The analysis comes as Trump wagesbroad attackson climate and energy policiesand on renewable energy. The president’s so-called one big beautiful act, for instance, opened swaths of federal land to drilling and mining and enshrined the rapid phaseout of incentives for renewable energy. The administration has also launched an unprecedentedassault on climate science, for instance with anenergy department reporton climate change that experts derided as full of misinformation. The report was created to justify the planned overturning of a key legal finding that forms the basis of virtually all US climate regulations.“With the firehose of terrible, bad things that have happened on the environment front … it’s important to remind the public that these aren’t just actions from the amorphous, ginormous thing that is the Trump administration writ large,” said Toni Aguilar Rosenthal, report author and senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project. “It is often specific actors coming from specific moneyed interests that are carrying out this disastrous deregulatory agenda.”The authors identified 111 employees whom they deemed “fossil fuel insiders and renewable energy opponents”. That includes 43 people who were directly employed by coal, oil or gas companies. Among them are well-known senior officials such as energy secretary Chris Wright, the former CEO of the fracking company Liberty Energy.The list also includes lesser-known administration members. The energy department’s efficiency and renewable energy office – which recentlytold workersto avoid using terms such as “climate change” and “emissions” – for instance, is led by a former fracking executive. And in the White House, one senior policy adviser has heldhigh-ranking positions at big oil firms including Shell.Another 12 Trump officials, the authors found, have ties to fossil fuel-funded rightwing thinktanks. Among them: former employees and fellows of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative group that hasfought renewable energyand made what it calls “the moral case for fossil fuels”, as well as the anti-environmentalist group Americans for Prosperity, which isbacked by the fossil fuel mogulsthe Koch brothers.A total of 29 other Trump officials are former corporate executives from polluting sectors whose business interests are tied up with fossil fuels, such as chemicals, automaking and mining, the report says. Other officials have ties to utility companies that sell fossil fuels or elected officials who have pushed pro-coal, -oil and -gas policies.Reached for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “It’s totally pathetic and transparent that The Guardian is regurgitating a press release from a self-described anti-Trump group and calling them a ‘consumer advocacy nonprofit’ in order to attack White House staff.”Trump hascastigated criticsof his administration andwarned of a crackdownagainst progressive non-profit organizations.Reached for comment, energy department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said: “Unlike the Biden administration, which routinely prioritized the interests of the radical climate lobby at the expense of the American people, President Trump’s administration has consistently put the American people first – advocating for lower energy prices and more reliable and secure energy.”He added that most US energy comes from fossil fuel. “Of course, President Trump is going to recruit professionals who actually understand how the energy industry works,” he said. “Perhaps the Biden administration would have been more successful in lowering energy prices if they hadn’t filled their administration’s energy-related positions with climate alarmists.”An interior department spokesperson, Aubrie Spadie, said: “While it’s clear that this progressive group pushing an entire climate cult program, among other radical policies, would like to see American taxpayer dollars wasted on the Green New Scam, Americans can rest assured that the Trump administration will continue enforcing an energy strategy that solely benefits our country’s success – one that lowers costs, chooses innovation over regulation, and reduces reliance on our foreign adversaries.”The Guardian has contacted the American Petroleum Institute, the top US fossil fuel lobby firm, for comment.The researchers found that 32 employees at the Department of the Interior alone have ties to polluting energy, making it the most compromised federal agency. That includes interior secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota who has long accepted oil funding and been aconduitbetween fossil fuel industry donors and the US president’s campaign. Burgumhimself owns landthat he leases to oil company Continental Resources, the report notes. That firm is run by major Trump donor and ally Harold Hamm, whose business interests Burgum has oftensupported.Fossil fuel donors poured$96minto Trump’s 2025 presidential campaign and affiliated action committees, and contributed $11.8m to Trump’s second inauguration. Since entering office, his administration has not only enshrined pro-fossil fuel policies and rules, but also craftedtax breaksandtariff carveoutsbenefitting the industry.In addition to oil-tied nominees and appointees, the authors identified several Trump administration higher-ups who were appointed or nominated to powerful positions with little or no subject matter expertise.“These people may not be tied to fossil fuels so directly, but their inexperience is dangerous,” said Alan Zibel, a co-author and the research director at Public Citizen, speaking broadly about the administration’s links to fossil fuels interests. “It’s reasonable to think they will be pushovers, or easy marks, for the oil industry’s agenda.”Trump administration spending $625m to revive dying coal industryRead moreTrump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of general counsel, Sean Donahue, for instance, has scant legal experience, having worked in the first Trump administration EPA for three years, then briefly for aregional law firmin Buffalo, New York, and then for a solar energy company.“He has never tried a case to verdict, never taken a deposition, never signed a pleading and never argued a motion,” said thesenator Sheldon Whitehouse in May.Asked forcommentabout Donahue by the publication Inside Climate News in April, Molly Vaseliou, an EPA spokesperson, defended his nomination. ​​“President Trump made a fantastic choice in selecting Sean to lead [the] EPA’s office of general counsel,” she said. “His years of public service to the American people at the federal and state government level is a boon to the agency.”In another example, one White Houseaide working on energy policy, Jarrod Agen, came to the role after working for Mike Pence, the former vice-president, and defense company Lockheed Martin. Agen does not appear to have direct energy industry or policy experience, the report says.In her statement, Kelly of the White House said: “Secretary Wright, Secretary Burgum, and Jarrod Agen are all exceptionally qualified to deliver on the American people’s mandate to ‘drill, baby, drill’ and unleash our nation’s energy potential – which is what President Trump was overwhelmingly elected to implement, even if the Guardian doesn’t like it.”Trump oversaw a massive slew of anti-environmental actions during his first term. During his second term, equipped with rightwing plans like the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, he has overseen a far broader and harsher crackdown on climate rules and renewable energy.The current Trump administration has also been completely unabashed about doing the bidding of the oil sector, said Zibel.“There’s no shame,” he said. “They are proud and willing to go out there and tout the fact that they are doing favors for the oil and gas industry, mining industry, the coal industry.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocracy and justiceOil and gas companiesFossil fuelsClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes as Donald Trump’scontinues to attack the US central bankand threaten its independence.Continued hype and optimism about the potential for AI technology has led to arise in valuations in recent months,with companies such as OpenAI now worth $500bn (£372bn), compared with$157bn last October. Another firm, Anthropic, has almost trebled its valuation, going from $60bn in March to $170bn last month.However, the Bank of England’s financial policy committee (FPC) warned on Wednesday: “The risk of a sharp market correction has increased.“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence. This … leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.”It said investors had not fully accounted for these potential risks, warning that “a sudden correction could occur” should any of them crystallise, resulting in finance drying up for households and businesses. The FPC added: “As an open economy with a global financial centre, the risk of spillovers to the UK financial system from such global shocks is material.”Faith in the AI boom has recently been rattled by research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which showed that 95% of organisations are getting zero return from their investments in generative AI.That has fed into concerns that stock market valuations could tumble if investors ended up being disappointed by the progress or adoption of AI technology. The FPC said this “could drive a re-evaluation of currently high expected future earnings”.It added: “Material bottlenecks to AI progress – from power, data or commodity supply chains – as well as conceptual breakthroughs which change the anticipated AI infrastructure requirements for the development and utilisation of powerful AI models could also harm valuations, including for companies whose revenue expectations are derived from high levels of anticipated AI infrastructure investment.”The committee also said the Trump administration’s continued threats against the USFederal Reservewere putting financial stability at risk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ban comes into force in November 2026 for two and a half years and can be extended. The UK does not have a similar ban in place.Data analysed by the The Last Beach Cleanup, a US group campaigning to halt plastic pollution, showed that the increase in UK exports in the first half of 2025 was mainly to Indonesia (24,006 tonnes in 2025, up from 525 tonnes in 2024) andMalaysia(28,667 tonnes, up from 18,872 tonnes in 2024).Total plastic waste exports remained relatively high in the first half of 2024 and 2025, at 319,407 and 317,647 tonnes respectively. The percentage of UK plastic waste going directly to non-OECD countries was 20% of total plastic waste exports in 2025, up from 11% in 2024.The Last Beach Cleanup analysed data from the UN Comtrade database to reach its findings. Jan Dell, who works for the group, accused UK ministers of “hypocrisy” by failing to ban exports to poorer nations.“The UK is hypocritically saying, ‘we’re part of the high ambition coalition’, at the plastics talks. But behind the scenes, it is refusing to set a date to stop exporting to poorer countries,” she said. “We see it is increasing exports of its own plastic waste to places like Malaysia and Indonesia.”She added: “It is unethical and irresponsible waste imperialism.”After the collapse of the UN plastic treaty talksin August, Emma Hardy, under-secretary of state at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra),said she was “hugely disappointed” an agreement had not been reached but was proud of the UK’s work towards an ambitious treaty.Britain was part of a “high ambition” coalition of nations calling for the treaty to include binding obligations on reducing plastic production and consumption, she said.Campaigners are calling for the UK, one of the top three countriesexporting plastic waste,at about 600,000 tonnes a year, to follow the EU and ban exports to non-OECD countries. They also want to close a loophole that makes it cheaper to export plastic waste rather than recycle it in the UK.View image in fullscreenPlastic products, such as these found in Klang, Selangor in June, are often fly-tipped from factories processing imported plastic waste in Malaysia.Photograph: Basel Action NetworkThe Conservative government said in 2023 that itintended to ban plastic waste exports to non-OECD countries– but it never happened.Wong Pui Yi, a Malaysia-based consultant for Basel Action Network, a group championing global environmental health and justice, said there were “good guys and bad guys” in the waste trade.“A lot of waste traders are looking to reduce costs,” she said. “If waste falls into the hands of the bad actors, one of the easiest ways to reduce costs is to avoid environmental controls. In developing countries, it is easier to avoid environmental controls due to weaker laws and lower enforcement capacity.”In July, the UK’s exports of plastic waste to Malaysia dropped to 2.8% (1,500 tonnes), most likely due to the country’s new import restrictions. But as one country bans or tightens imports, as happened with China in 2018, the trade shifts elsewhere.The rise in UK plastic exports to Asia is likely to be an underestimate, experts say, because a lot goes to the Netherlands and other European countries where it can be shipped on. The UK also exports plastic to Turkey.‘You don’t get to aim big when you are somewhere small’: A teenager’s fight to end single use plastics on her Scottish islandRead moreJames McLeary, the managing director of Biffa Polymers, a UK recycling firm, said the UK should take responsibility for its plastic waste.“It is just common sense as a human being” he said. “I don’t want my rubbish to end up in Malaysia. I don’t want to wonder if there is a boy whose life is wasted somewhere because of me throwing something in a bin outside my house.”Earlier this month,an investigation called Boy Wastedrevealed that, for the last decade, two people were crushed, ripped, or burned to death in the recycling sector in Turkey every month.Adnan Khan, a Canadian journalist whose work on refugee labour in Turkey sparked the investigation, said that while Turkey had a licence system for recycling plastic waste, “my research shows that it is pretty easy to get a licence and the oversight is low. It’s a broken system.”All EU plastic waste exports should be banned to anywhere outside the EU, he said. “I would go further and say every country should take care of its own trash.”A Defra spokesperson said: “The export of waste is subject to strict controls set out in UK legislation.“Our collection and packaging reforms will underpin £10bn worth of investment to support UK based recycling, reducing our dependency on exports of plastic waste.”Explore more on these topicsPlasticsSeascape: the state of our oceansWastePlastic bagsOECDGlobal economyMalaysiaIndonesianewsShareReuse this content"

Even around midnight, the humidity was still so oppressive he spent the final 20 minutes of histhird-round match against Tallon Griekspoorcramping, panting and in considerable pain. Eventually, he could not even walk properly. Midway through the final set, the 24‑year‑old hobbled slowly to his chair using his racket as a crutch and terminated the match.Emma Raducanu retires from first-round match at stiflingly hot Wuhan OpenRead moreThose scenes were representative of the Shanghai Masters so far as, throughout the past week, so many players have wilted in brutal conditions. Terence Atmane and Hamad Medjedovic both retired after struggling with the heat. Francisco Comesaña appeared close to collapsing and he had to be helped mid-match by his opponent Lorenzo Musetti. Despite the benefit of competing at night,Novak Djokovic repeatedly vomitedin two consecutive matches and there were times in his fourth round win over Jaume Munar where he too looked as if he had reached his limit.Five hundred miles away in Wuhan, the weather has also been challenging for the top female players. Emma Raducanu and Jelena Ostapenko both retired in hot, humid conditions. Alongside a social media video that showed her wringing out sweat from her socks, Bianca Andreescu wrote: “Wuhan weather really said: ‘Go play tennis in a sauna.’”As startling as these scenes have been, this is hardly uncharted territory. Every year players are pushed to their limits in a sport that chases the sun. However, tennis has failed to ensure players’ safety by tackling the danger of competing in such extreme conditions.The most immediate and glaring problem was illustrated by Holger Rune during his medical time out at the weekend. Speaking with Gerry Armstrong, one of the men’s Association ofTennisProfessionals supervisors in Shanghai, Rune asked: “Why doesn’t the ATP have a heat rule? You want a player to die on the court?”View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic towels away sweat during his match against Jaume Munar at the Shanghai Masters.Photograph: Andy Wong/APWhile the grand slam tournaments and the Women’s Tennis Association have extreme‑heat policies, the ATP still does not. The ATP entrusts the supervisors, in coordination with its medical staff, to manage the players in stifling conditions. As such, Armstrong’s response to Rune was even more damning. “I don’t know, it’s a good question,” he said.In a statement, an ATP representative said: “Under ATP rules, decisions regarding the suspension of play due to weather conditions – including extreme heat – lie with the on-site ATP supervisor, in coordination with on‑site medical teams and local authorities. In parallel, the ATP medical services team implements several measures in cases of extreme heat, to help protect player health during competition.“This remains under active review and additional measures including the implementation of an official heat policy are currently being evaluated in consultation with players, tournaments, and medical experts. Player safety remains a top priority for the ATP.”In a well-governed sport, a standardised extreme‑heat policy across all tournaments would have already existed for a long time. Tennis, however, is split uncomfortably between the four grand slam tournaments, the ATP, WTA and International Tennis Federation – organisations that are often too focused on protecting their own interests.View image in fullscreenHolger Rune feels the heat at the Shanghai Masters.Photograph: Andy Wong/APIn August, players similarly struggled in hot and humid conditions for two weeks at the Cincinnati Open before the tournament concluded withSinner retiring against Carlos Alcaraz in the finaldue to illness. Global heating will lead only to further difficulties, so governing bodies should already be investigating how to adapt the calendar to avoid these unbearable conditions.This is a challenging subject considering physical preparation and stamina is a key part of excelling at the top of the sport. Elite players pride themselves on being able to handle the elements and still find a way through. Everyone, however, has a limit.“I think there should be some kind of rule,” Rune said on Tuesday. “We can handle a certain amount of heat because we are fit, we’re strong, we’re mentally strong as well, but there’s always a limit. I think it’s also important to take care of your health. We need to survive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Back in Cincinnati, as the heat wreaked havoc on the tournament, Iga Swiatek said she would like to see more flexibility with the time limit between points on warmer days: “This kind of heat is like something that we just need to survive, and it’s not like we can’t,” she said. “Maybe giving us five more seconds to use the towel or to have more time to breathe, because it is a bit harder, would be nice.”This latest issue of managing extreme heat comes at the end of another gruelling, long season, and player welfare has been a significant talking point.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka came through the extreme heat to beat Rebecca Sramkova at the Wuhan Open.Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesThe number of retirements, withdrawals and injuries this year has been shocking. With seven retirements or walkovers at the Shanghai Masters over the past week, there have now been 41 retirements and walkovers at the ATP Masters 1000 events this year, including nine in Madrid and eight in Cincinnati.On Monday last week at the China Open in Beijing, a combined WTA 1000 and ATP 500 event, five of the 12 matches ended in retirements. This does not even account for the injuries, physical pain and mental strain that many players on both tours are continuing to push through. It is increasingly difficult to argue that the tours have done enough to prioritise player welfare.The length of the tennis season has been a significant talking point for decades with minimal change, but recent initiatives from the ATP and WTA tours have only seemed to accentuate these issues.Over the past two years, the WTA has enacted stricter scheduling controls for its top players and there is a growing consensus that the ATP-driven push to extend so many of the ATP and WTA 1000 events into protracted two-week affairs have come at the cost of the players themselves. With even more “on” days at tournaments and more time away from home, their growing physical and mental difficulties are clear.In the final weeks of another campaign, as the injuries pile up and few competitors seem content, it feels like the tour is reaching breaking point. It is still unclear, however, if the governing bodies are ready to recognise those issues and take meaningful steps towards fixing them.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But despite Gabriel and Sanders being the only two quarterbacks on the Browns’ active roster after Flacco’s exit, Cleveland coach Kevin Stefanski on Wednesday said he would “let the week play out [and] make a decision later” on whether Sanders will be the team’s No 2 quarterback behind Gabriel, who made his firstNFLstart last week. Bailey Zappe, who has been a member of the Browns practice squad, could be activated and serve as Gabriel’s backup.The draft roughed up Shedeur Sanders. The NFL will demand even moreRead more“All roster type of things, I always have to be mindful of our players and our players’ development,” Stefanski said. “And I want to make sure that I’m always doing what’s best for our players and, of course, our team. But with young players, I’m always thinking about – last week, making the change to Dillon, you have to think long and hard about that, because these are young players that you are so invested in their development. So, I’ll let the decision play out [and] make a decision later.”Sanders had been the No 3 quarterback on the Browns roster before Flacco’s departure. Sanders, the son of hall of famer Deion Sanders, generated huge amounts of attention when hedropped to the fifth round of this year’s draftafter many thought he would go in the first two. He completed 17 of 29 passes for 152 yards and two touchdowns in two preseason games but the Browns have shown no indication they intend to start him.“I wouldn’t say there’s one thing you need to see [from Sanders to start him],” Stefanski said. “In my role, I have to do what’s best for our players, our team, and I’m very, very invested in our player development, our young players’ development, our quarterback development. So, any decision I make, I want to just make sure that I’m doing what’s right for our players.”Sanders has come under criticism for talking about his role with the Browns in recent weeks. “If you see the [quality of] quarterback play in the league right now, I know I’m capable of doing better than that,” Sanders told ESPN Cleveland last month.When askedabout the Browns’ quarterback situation last week, Sanders repeatedly answered bygrinning then silently moving his mouthin response. A member of the Browns staff then cut the interview short.Meanwhile, the Bengals say Flacco will start this weekend against the Green Bay Packers. The team started the season 2-0 but have fallen to 2-3 after their star player, Joe Burrow, suffered a toe injury that will put him outfor at least three months.Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 40-year-old has been in charge for 11 months but is yet to win back-to-back league games and the team sit 10th.Which footballers defied a manager’s tactics – and what were the results? | The KnowledgeRead moreUnited have picked up 37 points from his 34 league games, finished 15th last season, andwere knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsbyin August. Amorim has faced questions over his 3-4-3 formation, which is yet to pay dividends despite a summer net spend of about £170m.Ratcliffe is regarded as a key supporter of Amorim but the head coach has admitted that if results do not improvehe will face the sack.“He has not had the best of seasons,” Ratcliffe toldThe Business podcast. “Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be. The press, sometimes I don’t understand. They want overnight success. They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow. You can’t run a club like Manchester United on kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”Ratcliffe has controlled football operations since purchasing an initial 25% of the club in December 2023 from the Glazer family, who maintain majority ownership. Asked what the response would be if the Glazers suggested Amorim needed to be dismissed, Ratcliffe said: “It’s not going to happen.”View image in fullscreenSir Jim Ratcliffe (left) feels the Glazers, his fellow owners, are ‘really nice people’ and ‘really passionate about the club’.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Glazers have been the subject of numerous protests over the years and are rarely seen at Old Trafford, leaving Ratcliffe and Ineos to run day‑to-day operations. “We’re local and they’re the other side of the pond,” Ratcliffe said. “That’s a long way away to try to manage a football club as big and as complex as Manchester United. We’re here with feet on the ground. They get a bad rap … but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.”Wide-ranging cost-cutting measures have been implemented by Ratcliffe, resulting in about 450 jobs being lost at United, Sir Alex Ferguson’s £2m‑a‑year ambassadorial role being ended and free lunches for staff being removed, leading to criticism of Ratcliffe.“The costs were just too high,” Ratcliffe said. “There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated.

All wore shirts reading “Pay Us What You Owe Us,” with the Women’s National Basketball Players’ Association (WNBPA) logo prominently displayed below. Thevisualimmediately went viral, drawing attention to the union’songoingnegotiations with the league for a new collective bargaining agreement.Had the messaging started and ended with those shirts, it would have been notable, but limited in scope. Instead, a continuing campaign became just one example of the ways the two most prominent women’s players’ unions in the US have worked together to advance their causes.“When you’re fighting for something historic, something that has never been done before, it cannot happen in a vacuum,” said Erin D Drake, the WNBPA’s senior advisor and legal counsel who wascreditedfor the shirt campaign, which sought to get as many other people and organizations involved as possible.To that end, the shirts were made available to buy online by the end of the All-Star Game, and soon the WNBPA’s soccer counterparts were customers.“Most of our staff had already gone on the website and purchased the shirts themselves,” said Tori Huster, the deputy executive director of the National Women’s Soccer League Players’ Association (NWSLPA), adding that a stream of player requests followed. The two unions got to talking, and soon afterward the NWSLPA asked its members to indicate if they wanted to be sent a shirt reading “Pay Them What You Owe Them.”“It was a quick yes,” Haley Hopkins, president of the NWSLPA, said of her teammates at the Kansas City Current. There was no top-down directive about when to wear the shirts, so the players decided to make their statement before the team’s home match against the Washington Spirit on 13 September.The NWSLPA was quick toamplifyimagesof those players, even as the Current and NWSL broadcast partners did not (the Current did not respond to the Guardian when asked why the players were not featured. Their post was a joint post with ION NWSL’s Instagram account, and Scripps, which owns ION, also did not provide a reason when asked).“It’s not just female athletes in the W that are experiencing this,” Hopkins said. “It’s a message to send for virtually every female athlete across the United States in whatever league it may be that we deserve pay.”Besides,notspeaking out about the issue would have been a break from how the unions’ relationship hasgrown.“We’re always in constant support of each other. Wearing the t-shirts was just an expression of that relationship,” Hopkins said.View image in fullscreenCurrent players arrived for their game on 13 September wearing versions of the WNBPA’s shirt.Photograph: Jay Biggerstaff/NWSL/Getty ImagesIn many ways, the WNBPA, which was founded in 1998, set an example for the NWSLPA, which came along in 2017. WNBA players have a storiedhistory of activism, speaking out against racist systems, police violence, discrimination against transgender people, and other issues. “Their collective action, their advocacy, for sure has been a shining example of what we aspire to be,” Huster said.When the NWSLPA was in its infancy, its leaders “were like, Googling what labor unions were,” said Huster. Meghann Burke, the organization’s executive director, was its only full-time staff member at the beginning. During that time, her relationship with her WNBPA counterpart Terri Carmichael Jackson was the main conduit between the unions. Now more folks from both teams are in touch, with Huster and Drake especially connected.“There’s probably not a month that goes by without Erin and I communicating about something,” Huster said.The early asymmetry has shifted into solidarity. “Over time, as our union has grown in strength,” Burke said, “that’s become a relationship of reciprocity and mutuality.”It’s a relationship that has shown itself in joint public actions. In 2022, when the NWSLPA led ajoint investigationwith the NWSL into abuse in the league, Jackson sat on the oversight committee with Burke and others. “Terri was really important to us in course-correcting the league and creating a new standard for player safety in the NWSL,” said Burke. In December 2024, when players from the Chicago Sky and Chicago Stars, as well as Burke,testifiedin an Illinois hearing about House Bill 5841, there was communication between the unions in organizing that appearance. Behind the scenes, the unions have worked together to organize educational programs for players across both leagues.Solidarity is an ethos as well as a strategy for the unions. Unions believe workers are stronger together in the face of corporate interests – why shouldn’t that logic extend to solidarity between unions themselves?“It’s a tactic to be divided. It’s a tactic to feel in isolation when you are trying to assert your value and your worth,” Drake said, adding that both the WNBPA and NWSLPA reject that tactic.Portland NWSL, WNBA teams to share newly-built practice facilityRead moreSolidarity, of course, doesn’t mean that the unions operate in total synchrony. But they have more than enough in common to make collaboration useful.“Our orientation to the issues that affect workers is certainly grounded in our experience as women,” said Burke. Shared priorities like ensuring protections for mothers, overcoming underinvestment, and securing healthy work environments and fair compensation drive both unions.Another commonality is the unions’ relative youth compared to their equivalents in the NBA (1954), NFL (1956), MLB (1966), and NHL (1967).“Anytime you have an emerging league, a newer league, it’s more challenging, and by definition, the union is going to have typically less strength and a more difficult time,” said Nellie Drew, a professor in sports law at the University at Buffalo School of Law. “[That] is why it’s especially important now for these two unions to collaborate and to assist each other.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She added: “It was clear through conversations that NWSLPA members were having similar observations.” Thus, the WNBPA invited the NWSLPA to be a part of the statement. The NWSLPA, which has a sizable international membership and a deep understanding that soccer is global, jumped on board.The unions’ connection to national politics also arises due to their membership in the AFL-CIO Sports Council – a group of players’ unions within the largest federation of labor unions in the United States. That organization recently brought a big issue to the unions’ attention: The Student Compensation and Opportunity for Revenue Equity (Score) Act.Burke told the Guardian that all the unions in the council had concerns that the federal bill would “prevent workers from organizing and create anti-trust exemptions for the NCAA.”But the WNBPA and NWSLPA were also concerned about the Score Act’s implications for Title IX – the 1972 law that prohibited sex-based discrimination in federally-funded educational programs. Title IX was not mentioned in the bill, which aims to codify Name, Likeness, and Image (NIL) policies, opening the possibility that sex-based discrimination could occur at federally-funded schools with sponsorship money in the balance.In July, the Democratic Women’s Caucus sent aletterto members of congress associated with the bill, and a couple months later, Burke and Drake spoke about the issue in a congressional briefing hosted by the caucus. “For this briefing, the NWSLPA came to us, and asked us to participate, and that was a no-brainer because at the end of the day, regardless of what the text of the proposed SCORE Act says, Title IX is not contemplated within the bill,” Drake told the Guardian, “and that is a death blow to to all of us, frankly, because we wouldn’t be here if it were not for Title IX.”View image in fullscreenFan support for increased pay for players has been a trend in both the WNBA and NWSL.Photograph: Angelina Katsanis/APThe shirts may have gotten headlines, but both unions know that the attention ultimately serves the greater purpose of winning better conditions in their CBAs.“We can see the NWSLPA standing with the WNBPA during this contract fight because they know what it means to fight for respect on the job, for fair pay, and for a share in the massive profit their labor generates,” said Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO.Indeed, leaders from both unions said that the unions’ CBAs are always in conversation. “I’m sure the WNBPA is looking at our most recent CBA and some of the provisions that we secured … and trying to improve on that,” Burke said, a sentiment echoed by Drake. “And similarly, whatever wins they are able to secure in their next CBA, we’ll be looking to that when we’re in negotiations next.”Drew emphasized that while the negotiations the unions have with their leagues will naturally have some differences, the conversations likely look somewhat similar. “They’re not apples and oranges; they’re like maybe different types of apples, if you will,” she said.One of the reasons the WNBPA’s CBA negotiations are especially critical this year is the increasing attention and revenue coming to theWNBA, part of a larger trend in women’s sports. The greater funding and attention, however, hasn’t dampened the unions’ desire to work together – if anything, it’s only strengthened it. Huster said it’s imperative that as “the investment in women’s sports continues to rise, and this momentum that everyone keeps talking about – that we don’t forget what is at the center of that. And I think both of our organizations would agree that that’s the players.”Huster also mentioned that it was especially notable that Kansas City Current players wore the shirts, as the team’s owners, Angie and Chris Long, haveshown interestin bringing a WNBA team to the city. “It’s really important that that ownership group knows that we’re well in it in our relationship with the WNBPA, and that it’s definitely important to us that professional athletes are at the forefront of any conversation that’s being had,” Huster said.For Hopkins, the rising attention also doesn’t change things too much.“We’ve always been here, and now everyone’s kind of just catching on, and we’re not just gonna be grateful for that quote unquote momentum, but continuing to build off of us to work towards what we know we deserve and have always deserved,” Hopkins said. “It’s just now there’s eyes on us – about damn time.”Explore more on these topicsNWSLWNBAWomen's footballUS sportsUS unionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Players, coaches and staff had their lives turned upside down. Career paths were inevitably changed. What kind of an impact would a fit Trent Alexander-Arnold have had at Euro 2020 if it had been played that year? As it turned out he injured himself just before the postponed tournament in 2021 and had to withdraw from the England squad.Next Generation 2020: 60 of the best young talents in world footballRead moreMillions of footballers will have had their trajectories altered,including our Next Generation picks from that year. Theseriesstarted in 2014 and each year we select a first-year scholar from every Premier League club, as well as 60 of the best talents from around the world, and follow them for five years.In 2020, our players will have been about 17 years old, many of them hoping to break into their first teams. Some will have been better off because of the pandemic break, some worse.If the quality is there, though, they are likely to make it in the end. In 2020 we had four German players on our list of 60 of the best players in the world born in 2003. Two were Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz. They were at Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen and set for stardom.Musiala was born in Germany but moved to England at the age of seven. He played for several clubs in London before landing at Chelsea. He also represented Germany and England at youth-age groups before moving back to mainland Europe and pledging his allegiance to the country of his birth.As with Wirtz, there was never any doubt that he would make it to the top. He may have had a more settled path to the top – joining Cologne at the age of seven before moving to nearby Bayer Leverkusen 10 years later (although that was a controversial switch) – but he suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2022, which robbed him of almost a year of competitive football. In the end he came back better than ever and won the German double with Leverkusen before moving toLiverpool for an initial £100m this June.The other two Germans on the list, Luca Netz and Torben Rhein, have also done well with the former having racked up more than 100 Bundesliga appearances while the latter is plying his trade in the Dutch second division with Emmen.Eighteen months ago we may have placed Jhon Durán in the category of players who would have made it no matter what, but since having had his breakthrough at Aston Villa his career has taken an unexpected turn. Sold to Al-Nassr in January this year he is on loan at Fenerbahce but was recently castigated by José Mourinho and told to work harder in training.Bar chart showing the 20 picks who have played for their senior international teamsThe Colombian is sixth on our list of Next Gen 2020 players with most international senior appearances but has not appeared for the national team since the half-time whistle blew against Peru in early June, after which there were reports of a dressing-room bust-up.Just below Durán is Wilfried Gnonto, another player who has had an interesting journey but is now back playing regular Premier League football. He was born in Italy and joined Inter at the age of nine but then took the decision to move abroad as a 16-year-old by signing for Zürich.After two successful seasons in Switzerland he joined Leeds, where he has been on a rollercoaster ride. He had a fine debut season in the Premier League, playing 24 times but not able to prevent Leeds from being relegated. Then followed two campaigns of Championship football among persistent rumours of him leaving, which continued this summer despite the club’s promotion. He has now made more than 120 appearances for Leeds and his decision to move abroad at an early age has paid off.As for the20 Premier League players we picked in 2020, they too have had different journeys, with several moving countries to get the best out of their career. They may not have enjoyed quite the same success as some of our previous graduates – such as Alexander-Arnold and Bukayo Saka – but have still amassed more than 100 top-flight appearances between them.Bar chart showing players with top-flight games playedAntwoine Hackford, who was with Sheffield United in 2020, and Michael Ndiweni, then at Newcastle, are the only players to have featured in the Premier League but several players have gone on to forge careers around Europe. Not on the above list but still worth a mention is Charlie Patino, who was with Arsenal five years ago but is now playing for Deportivo La Coruña in the Spanish second division. He joined them in 2024 and this season he has featured in all league games as Deportivo are undefeated and top of the league. La Liga for him next season?List showing where our 2020 Premier League batch are playing nowA look at where the 20 players are now reveals a big spread of leagues, from the Premier League 2 (Reece Welch at Everton, Luke Mbete-Tabu at Manchester City and Leicester’s Kian Pennant) to the ninth tier of English football.It goes to show that nothing is guaranteed in football, even though with Musiala and Wirtz their talent was so substantial it would have taken a remarkable series of events for them not to reach the top.Explore more on these topicsFootballNext generationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The PGA of America chief executive, Derek Sprague, said he would apologise to McIlroy and the rest of the European team for the behaviour of the home fans.US fan ugliness at the Ryder Cup was merely a reflection of Trump’s all-caps America | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreMorikawa, who lost two and halved one of his three matches at the tournament, agreed USA fans had gone too far but denied any personal responsibility.“I think we’ve taken what I said a little out of context. I think Ryder Cups are meant to have a lot of energy, right, and I think me saying the word ‘chaos’, I didn’t mean for them to be rude, right?” he said. “So like that’s not on me, I believe, for me to take credit for people being rude. I think what I meant was like I wanted energy, right?“You wanted people to be proud of the country, the countries they’re rooting for. I don’t think me saying one word, everyone listened – I don’t think I have the power to do that amongst people. I think fans can do and say what they want sometimes. It probably crossed a line out there so I would say there’s a line that needs to be drawn.“But what’s so different and unique about golf is that we hear nearly everything what people say because people have access to be so close to us. I think you have to learn how to find that division of what’s appropriate and what’s not.”Morikawa was speaking before the PGA Tour’s Baycurrent Classic – which he won in 2023 – being hosted in Yokohama, Japan. The tournament is already being affected by warnings about the incoming Typhoon Halong, with Thursday’s tee times brought forward by two hours.“You just have to adjust a lot tomorrow and be ready really to hit any club off the tee because it’s going to play very different than what we’ve seen the first couple days,” added Morikawa.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The German stressed thatEngland, who have been losing finalists in two successive European Championships, should not get carried away given they have not won the men’s World Cup since 1966.‘We’re not here as tourists’: Bellamy insists Wales will go on attack against EnglandRead more“If you’ve never won Wimbledon you are maybe one of the favourites but you are not the favourite,” Tuchel said. “It is just how it is. There is Brazil, there is Argentina, Spain, France and they just did it recently. It doesn’t mean we have no chance. First we will qualify and then we will know exactly why we go there. We want to go all the way but the role has to be clear.“I don’t see why we should burden ourselves that we are the big favourites. When did we last win it? Let’s go step by step. We build a team that is ready to go step by step and no one wants hopefully to play against us.”It was put to Tuchel that pundits and bookmakers tend to raise hopes by making England favourites, to which he said: “How am I responsible? We will arrive with a clear target to try to win but I think there is a way to do it and a way people are not upset if it doesn’t happen.”Tuchel said attitudes towards him have shifted sinceEngland’s 5-0 win against Serbialast month. “I felt the reaction when I go to restaurants or sit in a cab,” he said. “Just speaking to people I felt a different reaction to this last match and I believe it is because of the way we played.“Before it was a different view but no one was upset with me. It was: ‘Bring it home and you will make it happen and by the way my team is whatever and nominate this player and you cannot play without this player.’ After the last camp it was: ‘Ah, that was amazing to watch.’”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel said he would be without Harry Kane in Thursday night’s game with Wales but that the captain should be fit to face Latvia.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesTuchel saw Steven Gerrard’s description this week of the Golden Generation as“egotistical losers”. Gerrard’s team fell below expectations and faced criticism after disappointing at the 2006 World Cup.“When I hear people talking about their titles in international football or their missed chances I hear always the same song: ‘We have been a team,’ or: ‘We haven’t been a team,’” Tuchel said. “I think the rivalry between clubs was huge in this moment and they obviously couldn’t find a way to buy into a bigger purpose, a bigger goal. A big, big opportunity wasted.”Tuchel was studying for his coaching licence in Germany in 2006. Was he aware of the media frenzy around England at their base in Baden-Baden? “I was maybe more focused on the football but we realised there was a bit of circus going on,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He loved the energy during the camp last month and saw no reason to bring Bellingham and Foden back into the squad. “We are not collecting the most talented players, we are trying to build a team,” he said.“Teams win trophies, no one else. We will try to bring the best players and the best squad with the best players but it can sometimes happen in the end that you don’t just collect the most talented players and hope it works out.“We build a team that cares for each other and supports each other, that accepts the hierarchy within the team, and this will bring us a long way.”Tuchel is not looking to make sweeping changes to his starting XI when England hostWalesin a friendly on Thursday night. Harry Kane is out with a foot injury but should return for the World Cup qualifier against Latvia on Tuesday. Declan Rice is competing with Jordan Henderson and John Stones to captain the side against Wales.

You saw at the press conference how much it means to her to be ‘playing in the Champo’ with the big dogs. She’s a great character. She had a real calmness to take that penalty, it just shows her mental acumen to control herself. She’s a rock for us and it’s fitting she got the first goal.”After Arna Eiríksdóttir’s handball, Le Tissier calmly sent Tove Enblom the wrong way and then ran to slide on her knees in front of the home supporters in celebration.It was a rare moment that got the crowd off their feet in an otherwise fairly flat first half, with the turnout perhaps not quite befitting the occasion of the club’s debut at this stage of the Champions League, albeit this is far from the glamour match in the league phase.Perhaps many home fans have decided to prioritise the visit in November by Paris Saint-Germain to Old Trafford or OL Lyonnes – the eight-time European championswho won at Arsenal on Tuesday– over the side sitting second in the Norwegian top division.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Jess Park (centre) battles with Ylinn Tennebø (left) and Olaug Tvedten.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAUnited were expected to win and they almost opened the scoring early on when Elisabeth Terland’s glancing header dropped narrowly wide of the base of the post. Melvine Malard also went close twice before Le Tissier’s goal.The captain’s resolute display could be timely before Sarina Wiegman names her England squad on Tuesday; Le Tissier, who has barely put a foot wrong this season, looks certain to feature prominently, as does Jess Park, who once again impressed.Park should have scored in the first minute of the second half, after a flowing team move involving Ella Toone and Terland, but Park’s one‑on-one effort was blocked by Enblom. What followed was a lengthy spell of United possession inside the Vålerenga half but with little to show for it, as the visitors tightened up their defensive lines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They want it. They want it badly. However, their title credentials took a knock in the Netherlands, a 1-1 draw against Twente far from the ideal start to a tournament they long to dominate.Despite Chelsea’s dominance in possession it was the home team that took the lead through their captain, Danique van Ginkel, before Sandy Baltimore converted from the spot for the equaliser.Le Tissier realises WCL dream to earn Manchester United win against VålerengaRead more“It’s not a good result at all,” said Sonia Bompastor, speaking to Disney+. “We wanted to start the campaign with three points and a victory. Tonight, out of ­possession I am quite happy with the ­performance, even if we conceded a goal. In possession, when you play this game you need to show more desire especially when you are in the box.”Every piece of silverware is valuable but, for the team that has repeatedly won it all domestically, the desire for the final piece of the puzzle is strong. It eluded them during Emma Hayes’s tenure, defeat to Barcelona in the 2021 final the closest they came. Three back-to-back semi-final defeats to Barcelona, includinglosing 8-2 on aggregate to the Catalan giants last season, have stung each and every time.View image in fullscreenTwente’s players surround Danique van Ginkel after her opening goal.Photograph: DeFodi Images/Getty ImagesBompastor flexed the muscles of her squad for the trip to Enschede, with only four of the team that started their1-1 draw with Manchester Unitedon Friday night on the pitch, but it proved costly as they started their Champions League campaign in a new era of the competition – the group stage replaced by a league phase akin to the men’s tournament.These two teams met in last season’s group stage, Chelsea inflicting a9-2 aggregate defeaton the Dutch side. Van Ginkel suggested things would be different one year on. “I hope we’ve matured a bit and can address what we did wrong,” she said.At De Grolsch Veste that maturity showed. Twente did not try to match Chelsea’s press or compete one-on-one; they were an efficient unit, frustrating the visitors, who threw wave after wave of attacks at the home team, the Belgium goalkeeper Diede Lemey doing her bit to thwart the Women’s Super League leaders.Afterwards, Van Ginkel said: “We made big, big steps. We fought as a team, the plan was good. We defended a lot but I am really proud.”It was the home side who took the lead, having twice failed to make the most of opportunities to do so beforehand. Chelsea would rue their own profligacy when Jill Roord’s cutback found Van Ginkel and the captain shifted on to her right foot and lashed past Livia Peng – the goalkeeper handed a start ahead of the Yashin Trophy winner Hannah Hampton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Wales manager vowed to attack Thomas Tuchel’s side in search of a first win against England since 1984, in the first meeting between the sides since a3-0 defeat in Qatarat the 2022 World Cup.Bellamy suggested a boxing promoterwould not pit Wales against Englandowing to the gulf between the squads but said he wants his team to play on the front foot. “We’re here to come and play, and to play our brand of football the way we play, at an incredible place like Wembley, which it is,” Bellamy said.Clarke nonplussed by Katy Perry but hopes for fireworks from Scotland in qualifiersRead more“So to us it is exciting. We’re not here as tourists, to enjoy the occasion, we’re here to be the best version of ourselves and that allows you to be excited and also to have fun as well.”Bellamy acknowledged that a positive result could empower his players before a crunch World Cup qualifier against Belgium in Cardiff on Monday. “Of course it would help but Monday will take care of itself. We have players who have been in this position, full house at Cardiff, dare I say it, now-or-never moments.“I only just got the job off the back of us missing out on a penalty shootout [Wales did not qualify for Euro 2024 afterlosing a playoff against Poland]. We live for those moments.”Asked whether he could be tempted to park the bus, Bellamy dismissed the suggestion thatEnglandhave struggled against opponents who operate with a low block, saying: “I honestly believe if you play this England team and defend deep, you’ll die a slow death. And I’m not into that. Please put me against a wall and end it now. Don’t put me in that position.”Bellamy also played down the rivalry between the nations and reiterated he believed there was no such thing as a friendly. “I had a good teacher … Mark Hughes told me that. Now, due to where we are, England on the border withWales, people would sense that as a rivalry. We’re not your rivals. You understand that, yes? Because you have to be two top teams going at each other on a consistent basis to be a rival. We’re not. But, to us, like against Canada, we don’t do friendlies. We’re here to win.”He reserved special praise for Harry Kane, who will miss the game. “One of my best friends coaches him right now, so I know a lot about him,” the Wales manager said, alluding to the England captain’s manager at Bayern Munich, Vincent Kompany.“I think he’s the most complete player I’ve ever seen at this present moment and I think Vinny’s had a big say in that as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why didn’t I spend more time with him? I took it for granted and that annoys me. Some of the questions I did get to ask him were like gold dust. The most important part of him was how he made me feel before I played.“He made me feel like I was the best player going and that is how I always want my players to feel. To feel that confidence that you’re the best player in the world in this position … that feeling, never underestimate it. He’s always been there and he always will be.

Or is it a teenage one? Katy Perry shared a city centre hotel with Steve Clarke and his squad this week as the singer’s Lifetimes tour stopped off in Glasgow. Clarke did not quite go as far as saying “Katy who?” but he was nonplussed by his squad rubbing shoulders with a bestselling artist.“Was she?” said Clarke when asked about Perry’s whereabouts. “I didn’t know she was there. I’ve heard the name and I’m sure if you played me a couple of her songs I’d say: ‘I recognise that one.’ But I couldn’t name you one of her songs. That’s no disrespect to Katy but I’m from a different generation.” Pressed on whether he would even recognise Perry, Clarke – by now laughing – added: “Eh, no. And she wouldn’t recognise me.” This very much feels like two worlds that should never collide.Clarke was understandably more serious on the challenge likely to arrive from Greece on Thursday as Scotland kick off a crucial double-header. Belarus also visit Hampden Park on Sunday, as Scotland look to build on the positive World Cup-qualifying opening provided by four points out of an available six.The backdrop is a curious one.Rangers’ sacking of Russell Martin, with Steven Gerrard to hold talks over a return to Ibrox, and off-field rumblings at Celtic mean the national team’s matches have rather crept up on even seasoned observers. Even Hearts’ high-flying domestic start and woes at Aberdeen have felt more prevalent in Scottish football discourse. “I do glance through the headlines sometimes and it’s been strange in the buildup to such a big game that the national team has not been the main headline,” said Clarke. “But listen, that’s the nature of football in Scotland.“The players understand that every game in a qualification process is important, to get as many points as you can. We managed to pick up four points in the two away games last month and we hope to pick up as many as we can this month and that will put us in a good place going into November. The players understand what they have to do.”View image in fullscreenJohn McGinn (right) in Scotland training with Billy Gilmour (left) and Scott McTominay. The side hope to atone for March’s 3-0 defeat by Greece on Thursday.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAThe Greece clash will mean Clarke matches the late Craig Brown’s record of 71 games in charge of his country. Somewhat typically, the 62-year-old has no desire to focus on personal landmarks. “I haven’t really thought about it, to be honest,” said Clarke. “Having had a half-decent career as a player and a half-decent career up to now as a manager and a head coach … I don’t think I’m finished yet. Let me finish and then look back and I will tell you exactly how I feel about it.“I have enjoyed it. When you take the job you don’t think you’re going to be in for six and a bit years with so many games under your belt. I have been lucky enough to work with a really good, consistent squad of players who have done ever so well for me. All my coaches have helped me and to get to this stage is been really nice.

The rights for Europe’s five major markets – England, France, Italy, Germany and Spain – will go to tender at once, leaving open the opportunity for one broadcaster to but them for all five countries rather than their being sold piecemeal.It will be the first major challenge for UC3, the joint venture created between Uefa and European Football Clubs. The latter was known as the European Club Association until a glitzy relaunch at its general assembly in Rome this week. Relevent Sports, the American events promoter, was appointed this year as UC3’s global marketing and sales partner.On Wednesday the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, addressed delegates in Rome and, without referring explicitly to the rights tenders, acknowledged the need to innovate in broadcast deals.“Together we are building something unique with ambition, to deliver the most engaging football, the most innovative and the most accessible, to expand our core revenue streams,” Ceferin said.Quick GuideRabiot told to 'respect the money' he earns after complainingShowFootballers should respect the money they make and their employers, Serie A's chief executive, Luigi De Siervo, said on Wednesday in response to the Milan midfielder Adrien Rabiot's concerns over his club's planned league match against Como in Perth, Australia, in February.Rabiot called the decision crazy when he spoke to the French newspaper Le Figaro on Tuesday. \"I was surprised when I learned that AC Milan will be playing a Serie A match against Como ... in Australia,\" Rabiot said. \"It's completely crazy. But these are financial agreements to give visibility to the league, things that are beyond us.There's a lot of talk about schedules and player health, but this all seems truly absurd. It's crazy to travel so many miles for a match between two Italian teams in Australia. We have to adapt, as always.\"De Siervo was asked about Rabiot's remarks that these decisions are taken without the input of players. \"He's right, but Rabiot forgets, like all footballers who earn millions of euros, that they are paid to carry out an activity, to play football,\" De Siervo told reporters.\"He should have respect for the money he earns, complying with the wishes of his employer, Milan, who accepted and pushed for this match to be played abroad.\"ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“To inspire new fans to follow our competitions, to drive engagement with new audiences, especially in an ever‑changing media and streaming rights landscape, and to make the most of digital platforms and bring the game closer together forever.

They phoned up, they said they wanted us to do it, so I said: ‘Yeah, fine. Make us an offer.’“I genuinely don’t do it for the money, although it’s nice, but I think I’m worth [more] than just over a quarter of the [salary of] other head coaches.“The money was one thing so I’m not quite sure they wanted me anyway, but then you also want to feel valued. I said: ‘This isn’t going to work for me,’ and they weren’t going to move on it.”Rashid, one of the team’s marquee players, told Flintoff: “You’ll be missed. I wasn’t expecting that.”Flintoff, who is also head coach of England Lions, may interest other Hundred teams as the influence of new investors is felt.

In a dramatic move theleading unions collectively made clear this weekthat players involved in the R360 competition would be ineligible for their national sides and have warned them to treat offers with “extreme caution”.Privately there is a widespread view that those pushing the R360 concept, fronted by the England World Cup winner Mike Tindall, now face a struggle to get the project off the ground if the world’s top male and female players are required to forfeit their international futures to join the rebel league.England among eight rugby nations vowing to ban players in rebel R360 leagueRead moreThe decision of the unions to issue a coordinated statement on Tuesday followed the announcement last week that the International Rugby Players Association – the global players’ union – was not backing the competition or any contracts offered to its members. R360 has also still to be officially sanctioned by World Rugby, the sport’s governing body.While World Rugby cannot comment for legal reasons relating to R360’s pending official application that will not be heard until at least next June, the mood of leading rugby officials and union representatives is hardening. It is also understood that some pre-contract player agreements with R360 may have had deadlines attached that have either expired or are reaching that point.Fin Smith, theNorthamptonand England fly-half who signed a new club contract last week, said he sympathised with players nearing the end of their careers who may have been tempted by the money on offer, but he said it was never an option for him.“[My agent] knew my priority was to stay in England and give myself a chance to play for my country and hopefully go to a World Cup,” he said. “Most players, when they finish with their contracts, there are options but I was pretty clear from the start I wanted to stay in England and I’m really happy with my decision to stay with Northampton.”Of the announcement on Tuesday, he said: “I don’t think it will change how things are looked at too much. There will be people in a position and at a stage in their career that it will probably make a lot of sense for, who have achieved a lot in the international game, have done it, are going to play less matches and making a pretty hefty sum of money is an attractive proposition.“I completely understand why for some people, at some stages of their career, it makes a lot of sense.”World Rugby has intimated previously that any new competition would need to complement the existing calendar and preserve the sanctity of international rugby, the financial engine of the sport globally that generates funds for grassroots development.The statement on Tuesday also highlighted the self-serving nature of the R360 model that ultimately would benefit only a few at the expense of many others. “[It] rather appears designed to generate profits and return them to a very small elite, potentially hollowing out the investment that national unions and existing leagues make in community rugby, player development, and participation pathways,” said the unions’ statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The RFU said: “We have invested millions into PWR [Premiership Women’s Rugby], central contracts, bonuses, and performance support to develop the women’s and girls’ game here and played a pivotal role in negotiating the structure of the new WXV global series. We cannot therefore support this proposition.”The RFU and other unions accept that “some players may choose to take opportunities in R360” and insist they will “bear no ill will with them” if they do. As things stand, though, the 2027 World Cup is just over the horizon and any world-class players who might be swayed by the attractive terms of an R360 contract would have to balance that against missing out on the ultimate tournament.A better scenario for the wider game, perhaps, would be for the financial backers of R360 to switch horses and support the sport’s existing competitions and teams instead. Sources suggest that World Rugby’s door remains open to any such investors, particularly with the 2031 men’s World Cup taking place in the US and the profile of the women’s game increasing rapidly.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionRugby Football UnionEngland rugby union teamNorthamptonSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Australia were absolutely cooked here, seven wickets down, except for one thing: Beth Mooney.Pakistan were right on top. Nashra Sandhu, Sadia Iqbal, and Rameem Shamin, the three spinners, bowled so well, and the fielding was magnificent, led by wicketkeeper Sidra Nawaz. Her magnificent stumping off Ellyse Perry was the moment when Pakistan really seemed like they were in this contest, backing up the wickets of the openers. Then it was all Pakistan for a while, some fine catches inside the circle.But Mooney wasn’t one of those seven wickets, and she has saved the day so often. She got together with Kim Garth first, who barely scored but batted long, and then with Alana King who did the same until the last four overs, then exploded as Mooney flagged with exhaustion having neared a century. King made sure she was there late enough in the innings that her big hitting had its right time to come out, and so it did, ransacking 36 off the last two overs of seam, with Pakistan’s spin quotient exhausted.That left 222 looking far too many for a deflated Pakistan, and so it proved, with some pretty tame dismissals to standard seam bowling in the opening overs. Australia get away with one, and Pakistan stay bottom of the table.Share"

They scored eight unanswered runs and pulled to 2-1 in the best-of-five series, with Game 4 on Wednesday night in the Bronx.“We need another one tomorrow,” manager Aaron Boone said. “We’ll enjoy this for about 10 minutes and get ready for tomorrow.”Judge went 3 for 4 with an intentional walk and scored three times, also making critical plays with his glove and legs as fans chanted “MVP! MVP!” After struggling at the plate in previous postseasons, he is 7 for 11 in this series (.636) with five RBIs and three walks.“Tonight was special, but there’s still more work to be done,” the Yankees’ captain said. “Hopefully we have some more cool moments like this the rest of the postseason.”With the season on the line, New York starter Carlos Rodón gave up six runs and six hits in 2.1 innings – but five Yankees relievers bailed him out as they kept the Jays scoreless the rest of the way. Tim Hill got four outs for the win, and David Bednar worked 1.2 perfect innings for his second playoff save as New York improved to 3-0 in elimination games this postseason.It was the Yankees’ largest comeback ever in an elimination game, and tied for their second-biggest in any postseason game. Toronto hadn’t lost all season when leading by at least four runs.“Kind of just didn’t play our game, really,” manager John Schneider said. “Their bullpen did a really good job, and we just gave them extra outs.”Vladimir Guerrero Jr hit an early two-run homer and Ernie Clement had four hits for the AL East champion Blue Jays, who squandered a golden opportunity to put away the Yankees as Toronto tries to reach their first American League Championship Series since 2016.Consecutive doubles by Trent Grisham and Judge to start the third began New York’s comeback from a 6-1 deficit. Later in the inning, Judge stayed in a rundown between third base and home plate long enough to allow Cody Bellinger to reach third. That became important when Bellinger scored on Giancarlo Stanton’s sacrifice fly against Toronto starter Shane Bieber, who lasted 2.2 innings.Stanton also had an RBI single in the first after Blue Jays second baseman Isiah Kiner-Falefa committed a fielding error against his former team.With the Yankees trailing 6-3 in the fourth, third basemanAddison Barger dropped Austin Wells’ wind-blown popupfor another costly error with one out. Grisham walked, and right-hander Louis Varland was brought in to face Judge, who turned on an 0-2 fastball clocked at 100 mph off the inside corner and somehow kept it fair, launching a three-run drive that clanged high off the left-field foul pole.“He made a really good pitch look really bad,” Varland said.Judge tossed his bat aside and gestured to teammates on the bench as the sellout crowd of 47,399 burst into a frenzy.“It’s an amazing swing,” Boone said. “That’s shades of Edgar Martínez right there, taking that high-and-tight one and keeping it fair down the line. Manny Ramirez used to do that really well, too. But just a great swing on a pretty nasty pitch, obviously.”Judge then made a diving catch with a runner at second in the fifth, drawing more “MVP” chants.Chisholm gave the Yankees their first lead of the series with a solo homer off Varland in the bottom half. Amed Rosario doubled and scored on Wells’ two-out single to make it 8-6, and Ben Rice added a sacrifice fly in the sixth that scored Judge after he was intentionally walked with one out and nobody on base.Call it the ultimate sign of respect. Or perhaps, fear.Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesToronto Blue JaysMLBUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes as Donald Trump’scontinues to attack the US central bankand threaten its independence.Continued hype and optimism about the potential for AI technology has led to arise in valuations in recent months,with companies such as OpenAI now worth $500bn (£372bn), compared with$157bn last October. Another firm, Anthropic, has almost trebled its valuation, going from $60bn in March to $170bn last month.However, the Bank of England’s financial policy committee (FPC) warned on Wednesday: “The risk of a sharp market correction has increased.“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence. This … leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.”It said investors had not fully accounted for these potential risks, warning that “a sudden correction could occur” should any of them crystallise, resulting in finance drying up for households and businesses. The FPC added: “As an open economy with a global financial centre, the risk of spillovers to the UK financial system from such global shocks is material.”Faith in the AI boom has recently been rattled by research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which showed that 95% of organisations are getting zero return from their investments in generative AI.That has fed into concerns that stock market valuations could tumble if investors ended up being disappointed by the progress or adoption of AI technology. The FPC said this “could drive a re-evaluation of currently high expected future earnings”.It added: “Material bottlenecks to AI progress – from power, data or commodity supply chains – as well as conceptual breakthroughs which change the anticipated AI infrastructure requirements for the development and utilisation of powerful AI models could also harm valuations, including for companies whose revenue expectations are derived from high levels of anticipated AI infrastructure investment.”The committee also said the Trump administration’s continued threats against the USFederal Reservewere putting financial stability at risk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While excessivesmartphoneuse is a worldwide phenomenon, authorities in Japan are taking action, amid growing concern over itsphysical and psychological toll, particularly on children and young people.Greyscale and prune your algorithm: ‘digital nutritionist’ offers advice on cutting down screen timeRead moreLast week, the town of Toyoake in centralJapanintroduced a measure limiting smartphone use among its 69,000 residents totwo hours a day, in what officials say was an attempt to tackle evidence of online addiction and sleep deprivation. The ordinance – passed by the town assembly last month – does not carry penalties for those who ignore it.Moriyama was among several people, all in their 20s, who accepted the Guardian’s challenge to keep their smartphone use to a maximum of two hours and share their experiences.There were resounding successes and abject failures.View image in fullscreenShoki Moriyama says two hours of phone use daily is ‘way too little’.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianMoriyama, who habitually checks LINE – an instant-messaging, news and entertainment “super app” popular in Japan – as well asTikTok, Instagram andX, conceded that staying off the sites, or at least dramatically curtailing his usage, had been a struggle.“I spend around eight hours a day on my phone, so two hours is way too little … and not enough time for me to stay up to date with everything,” he says. “In the end I used my smartphone for an hour and 50 minutes, which is a massive reduction on my usual screen time. I used the extra time to read a book, study a little and go to the gym, so my day wasn’t wasted.”His colleague Tomomi Hanaoka also managed to rein in her habit. “I spend about three hours on my phone on weekdays and six or seven hours at weekends, so two hours felt very short. Most people need at least three to four hours,” says Hanaoka, who usually “can’t do” without LINE, TikTok andInstagram.“I kept my usage to two hours and used the free time to read and do other things.”Akari Saito, a university student, got her caveats in early, “because my personality is such that setting limits on something makes me want to do it more”.While Saito welcomed the Toyoake initiative as a starting point for a wider discussion of smartphone use, she says the focus should be on the quality, not quantity, of screen time. “Although setting a boundary between learning and entertainment could be difficult.”Despite a valiant effort, Saito struggled to make inroads into her daily three to four hours of phone time. “I found it especially hard to put it away during my train commute to school or while I was walking. But I can see that reducing my phone use might make the day feel longer and allow me to spend it more meaningfully.”‘I don’t think my brain should have gone through that’: five young people on their experience of smartphones as teensRead moreYuri* has already tried to limit her smartphone use, usually when she has exams coming up, even going as far as to hide Instagram and set a password-activated lock for good measure.She uses her device to check social media, search for recipes, send texts and access study materials, although too much screen time gives her headaches and tired eyes.“I question why the ordinance directly recommends restricting smartphone use. If the goal is to encourage people to rethink their usage, they should be encouraged to set their own rules,” she says.“But I broadly agree with the suggested way of smartphone use – this is because I don’t need my smartphone for my hobbies and interests. But people who mainly use theirs for entertainment and stress relief will find measures like this hard to accept.”View image in fullscreenA man uses his smartphone to take a photo in Suzuka, Japan.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesToyoake’s mayor, Masafumi Koki, defended the measure, which drew dozens of complaints from residents who accused the local government of interfering in their private lives.Pointing out that he regularly uses his smartphone to keep an eye on baseball scores and consult maps – but puts it to one side during dinner – Koki says he was worried that children and younger people weresacrificing sleep and family timein favour of scrolling, texting and posting.After a wave of online criticism, some of which wrongly claimed the two-hour limit would be strictly enforced, he told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper: “If someone hears two hours, they’ll stop and think about how long they really use their smartphone for. That’s the point.”Children limiting own smartphone use to manage mental health, survey findsRead moreYoung Japanese spend an average of just over five hours a day online on weekdays, according to a survey released this year by the Children and Families Agency.Aya* spends considerably more time on her device than the national average, regularly clocking up eight hours a day.“I couldn’t limit myself to just two hours, but just being conscious of the challenge made a difference. In the end, I was able to cut my usual smartphone use by about 60%, which felt significant,” the university student says, conceding that she had consulted a travel planner and checked her emails and texts.She voiced support for the Toyoake initiative, speculating that the absence of penalties could be its biggest asset.“That’s precisely what makes it meaningful … you have to set your own rules and adjust them accordingly. It’s an important opportunity to think concretely about our daily habits, rather than just in an abstract way.”And she did not miss the hours she usually spends “aimlessly scrolling”.“I spent more time enjoying conversations and taking notice of what was happening around me. It made my day feel more meaningful.”That will be music to the ears of Koki. On the eve of his town’s controversial experiment in social engineering, the mayor insisted it would be worthwhile. “This is about sleep, family and wellbeing,” he says. “If the ordinance makes even a few people stop and talk about their habits, then it’s working.”*Name has been changed on request.Explore more on these topicsJapanSmartphonesSocial mediaHealth & wellbeingMental healthYoung peopleDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The 17 Pro is Apple’s biggest redesign of theiPhonein years, chucking out the old titanium sides and all-glass backs for a new aluminium unibody design, a huge full-width camera lump on the back and some bolder colours.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That alone will make the iPhone 17 Pro popular for those looking to upgrade and be seen with the newest model. But with the change comes an increase in price to £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999), crossing the £1,000 barrier for the first time for Apple’s smallest Pro phone, which now comes with double the starting storage.From the front it looks like any recent Pro iPhone with the Dynamic Island containing the selfie camera at the top of the super bright and smooth screen. It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year.View image in fullscreenHigher peak brightness and a new anti-glare coating on the screen help cut down on reflections in bright light, making it easier to use outside.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset.A glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera baron a Pixel. The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around theedges of the plateau, so a case is still prudent.View image in fullscreenThe home and lock screens of iOS 26 now have a glassy, more rounded look to text and icons.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe handset runs the sameiOS 26as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes.SpecificationsScreen:6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)Processor:Apple A19 ProRAM:12GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:iOS 26Camera:48MP main, 48MP UW and 48MP 4x zoom, 18MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)Dimensions:150 x 71.9 x 8.75mmWeight:204gFaster and cooler A19 Pro chipView image in fullscreenThe iPhone fully charges in 76 minutes via USB-C, hitting 70% in half an hour using a 40W adaptor (not included) or 96 minutes using a Qi2 25W charger such as theBelkin UltraCharge 2-in-1.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer.It works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold.The battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe camera plateau stops the iPhone 17 Pro rocking around on a desk as much as previous models.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery will lastin excess of 1,000 full-charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can bereplaced for £109. Out-of-warrantyscreen repairs cost £349. The specialists iFixit awarded thephone a seven out of 10for repairability.It contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.CameraView image in fullscreenThe simplified camera app automates more of the photo-taking and hides many features behind sliding buttons.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThere are three 48-megapixel cameras on the back and a new 18MP selfie camera with a few new tricks on the front.The main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting.New for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too.View image in fullscreenZooming beyond 15-20x to a max of 40x magnification, the photos have obvious signs of being blown up by digital zoom.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAll three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets.Finally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone.PriceThe iPhone 17 Pro costs from£1,099(€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999) with 256GB of storage.For comparison, theiPhone 16ecosts£599, iPhone 17 costs£799, iPhone Air costs£999, iPhone 17 Pro Max costs£1,199, theGoogle Pixel 10 Procosts£999, theSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultracosts£1,099and the Fairphone 6 costs£499.VerdictThe 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models.The new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous.But this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera.That leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business.So for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get. You just have to pay a pretty penny for it.Pros:looks different to other models, relatively compact, great cameras including 4x/8x telephoto, upgraded selfie camera, great screen, USB-C, good battery life, top performance, long software support, Face ID.Cons:expensive, heavier than previous models, lack of cutting-edge AI features compared with rivals, same screen and size can be found on cheaper model.Explore more on these topicsAppleiPhoneSmartphonesMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Going out alone, or sober? Rawdogging.So by extension, a rawdogging marathon must be running a marathon unprepared.People sometimes use the term that way, but that practice should be discouraged, and it’s not what we’re talking about here.Well then – does a rawdogging marathon mean doing anything for a long time?No. It means doing nothing for a long time.I’m very confused.Specifically, it means sitting still and staring into space for an extended period.

A “productivity influencer” called Rowan recentlyfilmed himself rawdoggingfor an hour every day in a bid to improve his attention span.What did he do with the footage?He posted it onTikTok.So that other people could watch him do nothing on their phones?Don’t worry – he cut the hour down to a 30-second timelapse to make it less boring.Just so you know, the irony of that is not lost on me. What was the result?He found it helped his focus and his productivity, and many of his followers were inspired by his efforts.It sounds as if the TikTok generation has somehow invented meditation.That’s one criticism levelled at rawdogging, but young people are battling monumental levels of distraction these days: while older generations had to learn to tolerate boredom, they must learn to cultivate it.Who wants to be bored, though?Manyneuroscientists suggestthat boredom is not only good for you, it’s a critical stimulus required for creative thinking.Do say:“An hour spent without your phone is never wasted.”Don’t say:“Dude, just finished a rawdogging marathon – no headphones, no water, no shoes. Out of hospital on Tuesday.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peoplePass notesTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead of buying albums and films, most of us pay for a few subscriptions depending on what we want to watch, and maybe supplement that with the odd vinyl or special-edition Blu-ray. This has been pretty terrible for musicians, who earn approximately $0.004 per play on Spotify, while Spotify itselfmade $1bn in profitlast year (admittedly after many years of operating losses). On the TV front, it’s increasingly annoying for customers: in my household we have to carefully bounce around between five different TV subscriptions depending on what series we’re into, to keep costs down.This model hasn’t really caught on in video games. Apple has its Arcade service that offers premium mobile games for £6.99 a month, but free-to-play games are the norm on phones and tablets and make gigantic profits through ads and in-game purchases. (Fun fact: around 85% ofallrevenue in the entire games industry comes from free-to-play games, mostly in territories such as China.) Netflix packages games as part of its subscription,but not very many people play them. PlayStation and Nintendo both have subscription services, but they only include older games, rather than brand new ones. And then there’s Game Pass, the Xbox subscription service, which has offered a library of 200+ gamesincludingall of Xbox’s brand new exclusives for an eyebrow-raisingly generous price. Until now.Microsoft recently announced that a Game Pass Ultimate subscription was going up from £14.99 to £22.99 a month. (This is the version that includes all the latest releases – cheaper options remain available). And while subscribers in some countries (mostly in Europe) received an email last night delaying the price hike, subscribers in the UK and US will still pay more. The hike has seemed inevitable for some time; nobody could quite figure out the economics of Game Pass given that blockbuster games cost hundreds of millions to make, and Microsoft has also been paying other developers to host their games on its service.Bloomberg estimatesthat putting Call of Duty on Game Pass last year cost Microsoft the equivalent of $300m in sales.Does this suggest that Game Pass is not proving as successful as Microsoft would like? I asked Christopher Dring ofThe Game Business newsletterfor his very informed opinion. “Game Pass is profitable,” he says. “But it’s clearly had an impact on the premium sales of games. It’s most notable with games like Halo Infinite and Starfield not charting as highly as you’d expect … Xbox bought Activision Blizzard for $70bn. That comes with scrutiny from the heads of Microsoft, including chief financial officer Amy Hood. It’s not just about profitability, it’s about growth – Microsoft expects a strong return from its Xbox division for that kind of investment. Not to over simplify things, but that’s why Xbox has been cutting costs, projects and even studios, and why it’s raising prices across the board.”Xbox will be relying on Game Pass for growth, because its actual console sales have been in freefall for years. Microsoft stopped reporting how many Xboxes it was shifting, preferring instead to talk about revenue and engagement, but it is estimated that the Xbox Series S/X has sold a few million less than 2013’s Xbox One, putting it in distant third place behind Nintendo and PlayStation. Xbox’s own executiveshave saidthat console sales aren’t a priority: that’s why Microsoft has started putting all its games on PC and PlayStation, too, and why it’s been investing so heavily in buying up studios to make content for Game Pass.View image in fullscreenA promotional image of Call of Duty Warzone.Photograph: ActivisionBut here’s the bigger picture: do we evenwanta subscription-based future for video games? And what does it mean for developers? One possible future follows the pattern of the TV industry: prices creep up, streaming services proliferate and gamers have no choice but to pay a fortune every year to play the latest titles. Meanwhile, developers will find it increasingly difficult to make the money needed to support big titles as direct sales dry up, forcing a consolidation of talent – which ultimately makes it harder and harder for original art to emerge. Millions of gamers are still happy to pay £70 for games on release day: Mario Kart World and Assassin’s Creed Shadows were two of the bestselling games in Europe in the first half of this year. Why would the big players seek to undermine that?“For [smaller] developers, it comes down to whether you’re in it or not,” reckons Dring. “Right now, Game Pass is a strong discoverability tool in an era where that is a real industry issue. It’s also a way for players to access games at an affordable cost (well, it used to be), which in the current economy is important. But there are concerns for what the future might hold.”Different business models can coexist, of course. In video games, free-to-play now coexists with premium games: they largely serve different audiences, and the data suggests that they do not cannibalise each other. Some people prefer to buy high-end consoles and high-end titles, and that market has remained pretty stable for the past decade; many more people engage casually with free-to-play games, a market that has been growing hugely, and has massively increased the overall gaming audience along with it. It’s possible that subscription services like Game Pass – if managed well – could offer an in-between option that doesn’t completely ruin the entire industry’s business model. But given the precedent elsewhere in the arts, and the rapacious hunger for profit and growth of big corporations likeMicrosoft, maybe that is overly optimistic.Despite the price rise,XboxGame Pass still represents good value for the most time-rich customers. “Xbox is asking its biggest players, those who engage the most, to pay more. That’s who Game Pass Ultimate is for,” Dring points out. “I suspect a large number of these players will accept it, if they can afford it, because, according to statistics, they get good value out of it. The average Game Pass Ultimate player plays $550 worth of games a year.”Editor’s note: due to an editing error, last week’s edition referred to the new Nintendo of America president Devon Pritchard as “he” when she is in fact the first woman to hold the position. Apologies to Devon, and thanks to the people who wrote in to point this out.What to playView image in fullscreenBaby Steps.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThere were so many good games in September that I’m still catching up with them (and I’m still very much stuck in Silksong’s web). EnterBaby Steps, a surreal slapstick comedy game that I’ve been looking forward toforever. It opens promisingly, as pathetic man-child Nate is zapped from his parents’ basement to a bewildering wilderness hike for which he is woefully unprepared; using the triggers to lift his pallid feet and the control stick to lean his weight, you stumble out of a cave and up to a camp at the foot of a mountain.What follows, though, is one of the most painful gaming experiences you’ll ever have, as you slip and flounder and slide down sections of terrain that you already spent twenty minutes trying to climb. I misplaced one of Nate’s feet on a wooden beam across a gap and tumbled so far down that it took me several minutes to even make it back to the campsite I’d started at an hour before. And yet! I still stayed up until 2am playing this because it’s extremely weird and funny and obstinate, and because I finally feel like I’m getting somewhere with controlling Nate’s useless body. It’s a real “suffer for your art” situation but if you’re into novel suffering, give it a try.Available on:PS5, PCEstimated playtime:10 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenEA headquarters.Photograph: Terry Schmitt/UPI/ShutterstockIf you want to know more about the ethical dubiousness ofSaudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund– which will soon co-own EA, as we talkedabout last week–Eurogamerasked Human Rights Watch for some insight: “This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We’ve found it’s been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country … We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country’s human rights abuses.”My household’s summer obsession was the Netflix animated filmKpop Demon Hunters(iykyk), a movie so explosively popular that it is nowtaking over Fortnitewith new modes and character cosmetics. This has sparked an interesting debate between me and my partner: he does not want our still-quite-young kids engaging with Fortnite at all; I am willing to overlook it because of how delighted they will be by it. Either way,Iwill be playing it.Pour one out forRock Band, the once popular plastic-instrument game that soundtracked my uni days.

It is a crucial moment. The UN’s scientists have yet to publish calculations based on the latest round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – as countries’ emissions pledges are known. But Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has called leaders together because it is already clear that the current emissions pledges are nowhere near enough. The Paris 1.5C threshold wascrossedlast year. Without stronger action, that temporary breach will become irreversible – with devastating consequences for people and planet.Lula’s diplomaticoutreachto Donald Trump, who calls the climate crisis a “con job”, suggests he is trying to bring key players into the fold ahead of Belém. Having heavyweights in the room can make all the difference. Ten years ago in Paris, world leaders’ presence proved crucial to securing an ambitious deal. That’s why it is important that Sir Keir Starmer attends. He may not be the most powerful world leader, but his presence is a moral and diplomatic imperative. If King Charles is able to, he ought to go too. Soft power can help to rebuild the spirit of cooperation to keep the hopes in the Paris agreement alive.The UK is one of the world’s biggest polluters historically, due to its earlyindustrialisationand itsempire. But the climate policies of the last two decades have been ambitious compared with other wealthy countries, and the UK’s NDC is one of the few that climateanalystsregard as helping to keep the 1.5C goal in view. All of which makes it even more important that Sir Keir should be in Brazil, in person, standing up for evidence-based policy in multilateral climate talks.Cop30 comes at a fraught moment for climate politics in Britain. The Tories’ promise torepealthe Climate Change Act was populist posturing, aimed at pandering to an anti-science, Trumpian right. Labour must not flinch. It has beenreportedthat Sir Keir’s aides are advising against going to Belém, fearing backlash from Reform UK. Retreat would be cowardly and wrong. Sir Keir should instead reaffirm his commitment to national targets and the Cop process – confident that shifting to renewable energy is both right andpopular.Sir Keir is, of course, not the only leader who should be making travel plans. The leaders ofAustraliaand Canada both made climate policies part of their pitches to voters in recent elections. They too should be heading for Belém, as should the leaders of the EU, China, India and Japan. As the former UN secretary generalBan Ki-moon noted, attendance is not ceremonial but a test of leadership. He warned that the world was watching – and said that history would remember who showed up.Mr Trump’s election win was adangerous setbackto the global green energy transition. But 33 years after the Brazilian Earth Summit that set the process going, he is also a reason for other governments to step up. Perhaps Lula could evenconvinceMr Trump to change his mind? If there was ever a time to show that the climate is a diplomatic priority, this is it. Sir Keir must not leave the question of his attendance hanging any longer. He must decide – and go.Explore more on these topicsCop30OpinionBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaDonald TrumpKeir StarmerClimate crisisKing Charles IIIeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Only a particular type of visionary leader was fit for the task.More than a decade later, Blair has now joined forces with the pre-eminent reality-creator, Donald Trump, to draft a hallucinatory20-point planfor Gaza. It aims to turn the devastated Strip into what seems to resemble a colonial protectorate: cleansed of armed conflict, buzzing with development projects and a “special economic zone” through which foreign capital can flow, and overseen by an international “board of peace” with Trump himself as chair.The authors of the programme have not explained how they intend to impose it on a resistant population, or how they will persuade Hamas to disarm and concede defeat. So there is a high likelihood that the Blair-Trump fantasy will remain just that. Whatever its fortunes, though, it is a clear reflection of our historical moment, representing the most recent mutation of an imperial worldview that has already left a trail of destruction across the Middle East.For Blair, “the economy and foreign policy” have long been entwined. His military adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan tried to spread the virtues of the market to supposedly backward nations. The privatisation of resources creatednew investment opportunities, while a wide range of profiteers, from weapons dealers to security contractors,made a killingoff the wars themselves.Uponleaving office in 2007, Blairimmediately took up a postas Middle East envoy for theso-called Quartet: the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia. His work in Palestine displayed the same unerring faith in free enterprise. He proposed a series of “industrial parks” to attract foreign investment, advocated eccentric agribusiness and tourism schemes, and promoted other ventures that raised questions about possible conflicts of interest: while being paid £2m per year as a JP Morgan adviser, for example, he was accused of using his Quartet role toadvance the interestsof JP Morgan clients. (Blair denied the claims, insisting he did not know about the links between the bank he worked for and the companies it served.)The Kushner-Blair Gaza plan is a moral atrocity – and a policy catastrophe | Josh PaulRead moreAs envoy, Blair often bypassed or rejected political solutions –fighting vigorouslyagainst Palestinian attempts to win statehood at the UN – and instead treated economics as the route to progress. His diplomatic activities seemed to be based on the notion that peace would naturally follow prosperity. If securing the latter was the task of the intrepid statesman, then strong ties to the business sector could perhaps be framed as an asset.Yet Blair’s tenure in the Middle East brought no diminution of the conflict. In 2012, a senior Palestinian officialgave a succinct assessmentof his record: “Useless, useless, useless.” Still, undeterred by failure and fond of dramatic political comebacks, the former prime minister now appears to be seeking to apply the same logic to Gaza. Since the early months of the war, he has reportedly been crafting his plan for the “day after”.Staff from his thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI),participated in a projectthat appeared to endorse ethnic cleansing in the territory and outlined what could be built atop its mass graves: a “Trump riviera”, an “Elon Musk smart manufacturing zone”, “regional datacentres”. Although Blair’s organisation claimed it had no meaningful involvement in the plan, and rejected the idea of displacing Palestinians, there are a number of continuities with his own blueprint, details of which were soon leaked to the press.Drawn up with the help of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the 21-page document suggests reconstructing Gaza through “public-private partnerships”, forged by a “commercially driven authority, led by business professionals and tasked with generating investable projects with realfinancial returns”. Hamas would be demobilised and a small unelected executive would be installed. Thiswould include Blair himselfin aprominent role, plus “leading international figures with executive and financial expertise” and “at least one qualified Palestinian representative (potentially from the business or security sector)”. An international stabilisation force would meanwhile put down “threats to public order”.View image in fullscreenTony Blair and Jared Kushner attend a US-led workshop in Manama, Bahrain on 26 June 2019.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBlair met Kushner and Trumpin the White House on 27 Augustand his proposals got awarm welcomefrom the president. They have since been refined and repackaged as the Trump “peace plan”. As with previous versions of the initiative, the emphasis is on creating a Gaza that is “conducive to attracting investment”, and in which Israel will continue to reign supreme. Blair is primed to take charge of governing the Strip until some unspecified future point when day-to-day administration may be returned to a “reformed” Palestinian Authority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which states would be irresponsible enough tosend troopsto serve this novel dictatorship? How can it hope to sustain itself with no mandate nor legitimacy? Even more striking, however, is the extent to which the plan signals the overlap between Blair’s ethos and Trump’s.It is not unreasonable to suggest that Blair might see a business opportunity beneath the rubble of Gaza. To figure out who may benefit, we can look at his network of paymasters. Since 2021, Larry Ellison, founder of the tech company Oracle, hasdonated or pledged£257m to the TBI. The thinktank has, in turn, transformed into whatone commentator has calledan “Oracle dealership”: promoting the company’s software around the globe, including in impoverished countries where it has been criticised for potentially “trapping” and “indebting” users. Ellison is also a prominent supporter of Israel who hasgiven millionsto the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces and, according toHaaretz, once offered Benjamin Netanyahu a seat on the Oracle board. Were Blair to rule over Gaza – perhaps establishing “regional datacentres” in line with the TBI-linked plan – it is possible that Ellison could wield major influence.The TBI has also received huge sums from the authoritarian regimes ofSaudi Arabia,Bahrainand the United Arab Emirates, while Blair has been given a lucrativeadvisory contractby the UAE state-owned investment firm Mubadala. All three states havereadily endorsed the plan for Gaza. Once the besieged enclave is opened for investment, they may well be first in line. Blair’s work for these petro-monarchies tallies with his involvement in the fossil fuel industry, having taken cash from aBP-led consortium, the oil companyPetroSaudiand the South KoreanUI Energy Corporation, which has interests in the Middle East. Given that Israel has recently grantednew licencesto explore for oil and gas off the Mediterranean coast, such connections could prove significant later down the line.In one sense, then, this “peace plan” could simply be read as an extension of Blair’s belief in market-led development. Yet this chapter in the annals of colonialism also has a uniquely Trumpian twist. Visions of a new world order that underpinned earlier regime-change projects are gone. Here politics is reduced to dealmaking, grand strategy to crude self-interest. The fusion of public power and private profit is complete. Blair may be creating new realities, but few would want to inhabit them.Oliver Eagleton is an associate editor at the New Left Review and author of The Starmer Project: A Journey to the RightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

TheCBSnews department had some of the best journalists in the nation, and the corporation itself exuded a sense of public mission.But on Monday, whenBari Weisswasnamededitor-in-chief of CBS News, it was the latest turn in the network’sconfounding departure from its roots.Given her lack of experience in news, “placing Weiss at or near the helm of a television news division makes no more sense than it would have, a generation ago, to have given such a role to William F Buckley of the National Review or Victor Navasky of The Nation,” wrote Richard Tofel, an astute media observer, formerly of the Wall Street Journal and ProPublica, mentioning conservative and liberal opinionators of their era.Bari Weiss’s ascension to top of CBS News highlights the political winds driving US media rightwardRead moreWeiss – a staunch Zionist and a fierce opponent of supposed wokeness and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives – famously left the New York Times opinion section, claiming she had beenbullied by her colleagues for her beliefs.

She “has ascended the mountain of journalism on a slingshot”, Jessica Testa of the New York Times put it this week.To her many critics, her appointment was just one more step on theshameful paththat CBS has trod sinceDonald Trumpwas elected to a second term.The network caved to the US president when its parent company,Paramount,settleda lawsuit it could have won, sending millions of dollars for a future presidential library. Trump claimed that he was harmed during last year’s presidential campaign by theediting(actually, quite routine) of a 60 Minutes interview of his then rival Kamala Harris. Not only did the company settle the case, but now it has decided not to edit taped interviews with political figures on its Sunday morning Face the Nation – a dubious idea at best, and another piece of capitulation to Trump.The longtime executive producer of 60 Minutesquita few months ago, saying he feared the loss of his prized editorial independence; and the network’s evening newscast ratings continue to lag their competitors. Recently, the company named an ombudsman for CBS News – someone with no news experience – tomonitor claims of bias, but with no arrangement to communicate regularly to the public, as normal news ombudsmen or public editors have.Others were much harsher than Tofel in their criticism, noting that Paramount paid an astonishing $150m for Weiss’s site, Free Press. Paramount is led these days by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, one of the world’s richest people, and Weiss is very much his pick to led CBS News; the corporate press release said she will, among other things, “reshape editorial priorities”. She will report directly to Ellison, rather than to the CBS News president, a more traditional arrangement.“Like Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, the deal can be understood as part of a broader elite project to smudge the lenses through which many people see the world,” wrote the Defector’s Patrick Redford. “By installing Weiss, the richest people in the world have taken another step toward ushering in the toothless, acquiescent future of mainstream media they’ve always wanted.”Certainly, that is something that Trump and his allies have worked relentlessly for.Redford called it “yet another victory of marketing over its natural enemy, journalism”.The real bias monitor at CBS is Donald Trump | Seth SternRead moreAs she took the helm, Weiss sent around a friendly-sounding note to the news staff that had one particularly notable line. Among her “core journalistic values”, she wrote, is “journalism that holds both American political parties to equal scrutiny”.Sounds good, but the two parties are far from equal these days.“CBS should brace for a heavy dose of bothsiderism,” wrote Oliver Darcy in his Status newsletter, observing that the Free Press has, as its central thesis, “that Trump and his supporters are largely right about the cultural rot of the woke-elite” and liberal overreach (wokeness) is a bigger problem than Trump’s existential threats to American democracy.As independent media gains influence, it may not matter very much any more who leads a major TV network. Certainly, it matters far less now than in the years when CBS ruled the airwaves.But it is telling that Weiss – such apolarizing provocateurherself – has been chosen to reinvent the most mainstream of legacy networks at this fraught and dangerous time in the US.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCBSOpinionUS television industryTelevision industryDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Just ask NYC mayoral candidate Zohran MamdaniWed 8 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 07.19 EDTShareZohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who islikely to beNew York City’s next mayor, became a household name this year – but that doesn’t mean Andrew Cuomo knows how to pronounce it. The disgraced former New York governor, who is running as an independent candidate against Mamdani in the mayoral election next month, has repeatedly mispronounced “Mamdani”, even causing Zohran to spell it out for him during a debate in June. And Cuomo isn’t alone: Kathy Hochul, the current governor of New York, has alsobutcheredMamdani’s name, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has called the politician “Zimdami”.I’ve mispronounced plenty of people’s names; struggling with an unfamiliar word is perfectly understandable. During arecent chatwith Zeteo founder Mehdi Hasan, Mamdani said as much himself, noting he isn’t bothered if someone initially gets his name wrong. “What’s inexcusable, however, is the repeated intentional mispronunciation,” Mamdani stressed. More importantly, he said, his experience is far from unique: “This is the experience of so many … There are so many of us who are seen as if we are forever others.”Kamala Harris, who gave Mamdani ahalf-hearted endorsementlast month, would certainly know what he means. Conservatives have long taken great pleasure in othering the former vice-president. “Kamala? Kamala? Kamala-mala-mala? I don’t know. Whatever,” David Perdue, who was then a Republican senator, saidduring a campaign rallyin 2020. Perdue is now Trump’sambassadorto China, a job he’s clearly earned through diplomacy and respect for other cultures.Of course, Trump himself repeatedly mispronounced “Kamala” while running against her. Although, to be fair, he does have trouble getting his mouth to work properly and has botched basic words like “origins” (oranges in Trumpspeak) and “suspected”. Still, hard to give Trump the benefit of the doubt when, at acampaign rallylast July, he said: “I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce [Kamala], I couldn’t care less.”As someone with a “difficult” name, I’ve met plenty of Trumps in my lifetime. People have no trouble pronouncing names like Tchaikovsky but act as if “Arwa Mahdawi” is beyond them. You know what’s funny, though? None of my four-year-old daughter’s friends have any trouble with it: they call me “Arwa” with zero issue. Pretty sure they could all pronounce Mamdani as well. It’s a sad state of affairs when preschoolers are more respectful than politicians.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Art, especially comedy, can be part of thatWed 8 Oct 2025 11.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 11.40 EDTShareAfter 15 years of turning down offers to perform standup comedy in Saudi Arabia due to the country’s human rights record, this time I tookthe gig. Why?There’s a push for change in Saudi, and signs are discernible. Yet many from the outside would rather comedians in the west stayed away. At a time when freedom of speech is under attack, the backlash against comedians who participated in the Riyadh comedy festival reflects our ongoing struggle to find consensus on this and many issues affecting humanity.I am no stranger to cancel culture. I was cancelled after 9/11 simply for being Middle Eastern, as Arab terrorists were behind the attacks on the twin towers. This is despite the fact that I am not Arab, nor am I, contrary to popular opinion, a terrorist.US comedians defend decision to play in Saudi Arabia: ‘They’re paying me enough to look the other way’Read moreIn certain circles there have been calls to boycott my UK tour Namaste, a show in which I try to explore the nuances of the complex geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. After explaining that the restrictions on performing in Saudi were exactly the same as in Dubai – basically no jokes about the royal family, no disrespecting Islam and no humiliation of the government – a concerned friend texted me, “I think you’re at risk of invalidating your right to make jokes about anything important.” My show in Riyadh had a lot of material about the Saudis themselves. The perception that we, as comedians, were all being paid to be silent was as laughable as the idea that Dave Chappelle, a hugely successful comicwith an estimated worth of $70m(£52m), was doing his show in Riyadh for the money.This perception, it should be said, might have its roots in comments made by an American comedian/podcaster who, prior to the festival, mentioned a figure that he was apparently receiving.He says this led to him being uninvited. Whether it was his material about the regime or just mentioning money in public, we do not know. The comedy guide Chortleerroneously reportedthat the pay was “between $375,000 (£278,000) and $1.6m (£1.2m) for those doing solo shows”. One thing east and west can agree on is don’t talk about your fee publicly, because it is likely to cause consternation among the other performers – most of whom received a significantly smaller amount than the American podcaster was purportedly set to receive.It’s worth remembering that governments are not their people. Especially in Iran, where the chasm between the people and the regime is perhaps wider than ever before. If I’d had an inkling that changes similar to those emerging inSaudi Arabiaright now were happening inside Iran, and a comedy festival was taking place in Tehran (and pigs were flying), I can assure you I would be on the first pig over. As it is, expecting behavioural change from the Islamic regime in Iran would be like being attacked by zombies and politely asking them if they would consider a vegan diet.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: visitsaudi.comSo, for those who are interested, some reflections:Allowing international performances in Saudi, especially comedy, subtly broadens what’s thinkable and sayable in a society. Every laugh at a taboo subject shifts norms, albeit slightly. Bear in mind “slightly” is a seismic movement in the Middle East. Dubai is a very different place now to what it was when I first performed there in 2008.When artists perform in the Middle East they don’t just face “the regime”. They face real people, many of whom are reform-minded, quietly disillusioned youth who want to embrace new ideas without betraying their own culture and beliefs.As an international performer I like to connect with local artistes. As a Middle Eastern comedian I am of the view that a blanket boycott tends to dismiss and patronise ordinary Saudis, often those eager for exposure to diverse culture.There’s a saying in the Middle East: “It’s not about what you hear, it’s about being here.” And the truth is, if you’re sitting behind a keyboard on the other side of the border lecturing on a social media site owned by a billionaire, then your capacity to contribute to positive change might be somewhat compromised.One significant sign of progress in the Middle East is how women are treated. In Saudi, women were not even allowed to drive until 2018. Seven years later I am on stage in Riyadh doing jokes about it. A routine at the expense of the men who get frustrated with women who actually abide by the traffic laws went down well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Performing is not selling out. Rather it is about sharing laughter and a chance for cultural exchange as a force for social transformation. And we underestimate the transformative power of comedy at our peril. So I went.And the gigs were great. Packed houses, young crowds, popcorn, standing ovations, even heckling. About 80% of the audiences were locals, many of whom had never seen a live comedy gig. I saw theNorthern Irish comedian Jimeoinspeak about getting older and suffering varicose veins, on his nether regions. After the show, a discussion broke out between Saudis discussing remedies they could suggest, such as pomegranate juice. If that’s not a step towards east/west relations then I don’t know what is.I’ve waited years for something like this to happen – millions of us with links to the region see it as a miracle of change. And privileged individuals either privately or online instructing me on what I should or shouldn’t do regarding gigs in the Middle East is symptomatic of the worrying ignorance that continues to exist. Not all parts of the region are the same – and should not all be given the same blanket treatment.One American comedian not invited to the festival wrote of the comedians who went to Riyadh, “your hypocrisy will never be not noted.” Another American who turned down the offer was reported to have said, “I said no because I won’t do a show in a country responsible for 9/11.” Two funny guys I like very much. But maybe go there first before judging the region, its people and the motives of those who choose to travel there?Saudi Arabia – I’ll be back there soon.

First, the ATO released the corporate tax transparency report showingthat 28% of companies with annual turnover above $100m paid no taxon their income here. Then came a report by Jonathan Barrett onthe impact of the ATO’s new initiativeof clawing back old tax debts.The political reality is if we want a better, more equal society, the government needs to raise more tax to pay for better public services and benefits. But more tax only works if the system is also fair.As I have said many, many times before,Australia is a very low taxing nation– and this is not without consequences.It’s not a fluke that Australia is the ninth-richest country in the OECD, but has the fifth-worst rate of poverty among women aged 66 or older (and seventh-worst among men) – we have the worst rate of aged pension for women and the second-worst rates of male aged pension. And not surprisingly Australia raised the 10th-least amount of tax:If the graph does not display click hereIf Australia raised as much tax as Canada – a nation that also has a big mining sector and a population spread over a large landmass – we would have an extra $133bn a year to spend on government services.That might help lift some people out of poverty.There’s no secret here – you want to keep retirees out of poverty – have a strong age pension. Those waiting for the free-enterprise fairy to magically lift people out of poverty with itsinvisible handwill find a nonexistent hand is more accurate:If the graph does not display click hereSo it is good to know the ATO is going after those individuals with years-old debts. That’ll fix it, especially when some of Australia’s biggest companies are not paying any tax at all.Much like the annual income tax reports highlightinghow many millionaires pay no tax, the annual corporate tax transparency release always generates rightful anger at how many large companies also avoid a company tax bill.This year we are to celebrate that for the first time in a decade, fewer than 30% of companies with turnover of more than $100m went without paying corporate tax:If the graph does not display click hereAnd yes, that is good – but cripes, talk about a low bar.You might think those companies must have had a bad year, or perhaps last year was a dud and so they were carrying forward losses. And sure, that might be the case. But consider oil and gas giantSantosLtd: 2023-24 marked the 10th year in a row it paid zero company tax. That is despite over that time taking in $46.7bn in revenue:If the graph does not display click hereAt this point all the business advocates will yell that you don’t tax income but profits. And sure, but after a decade are we really saying Santos isn’t making a profit? Especially when you consider Santos’s own2024 full year reportpresentation notes it made $1.2bn profit after tax.I guess that “after tax” part is a bit easier when you don’t pay any.Other gas companies also treat the tax system as its plaything.The Japanese company Ichthys LNG is a frequent non-taxpayer. Since 2018-19 they have taken in $43bn in revenue, but not one dollar of taxable income and similarly have not paid one dollar of tax. And neither of course have they paid any Petroleum Resources RentTax.AsPatrick Commins reported, while some of the non-paying of corporate tax by some companies is due to carrying over losses and offsets, there is also a lot of shuffling of money around the world.Optus among companies earning billions in Australia but paying no income taxRead moreThis gets to the crux of the issue. While we poor taxpayers pay our money where we work here in Australia – and thus are an easy target for the ATO – companies are able to use foreign parent companies and other entities to make it seem as if they made no profit here at all.Netflix Australia, for example, earned $1.2bn in revenue but had no taxable income at all.It is tough to estimate the loss of tax revenue from these non-tax paying companies, but we know on average that in 2023-24 the companies that paid tax did so equivalent to 3.6% of their total income.Given the companies that paid no tax had a total combined income of $651.7bn, if we assume the same percentages, we are talking $23.7bn extra tax.This is why the government worked with the OECD to introduce a global 15% tax minimum. It also last year introduced laws requiring publiccountry-by-country reportingon tax, income and profits. This prevents hiding money in tax havens such as Monaco, Jersey, Panama and the Bahamas.But here’s the rub – Donald Trump, with the compliance of the G7, killedthe global tax minimum. And US companies arenow furiously lobbying Trump and his commerce secretaryto treat our public country-by-country reporting as a trade barrier.While it is fine to argue that the international financial system makes this hard, it is also why suggestinga company tax cut is needed to spur investmentsounds pretty hollow. And should individuals come to feel that they are the ones being unfairly punished for not paying tax while large companies get away legally paying nothing, trust in both the tax and political system can quickly falter.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsTaxOpinionAustralian economyBusinessSantoscommentShareReuse this content"

Spiralling concert prices are a cultural disasterJohn HarrisTickets for big tours have vastly outstripped inflation, while smaller artists and venues struggle. The magic is in danger of being snuffed out entirelyWed 8 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 12.02 EDTShareThe 21st century may be a time of human estrangement, but the pleasures of watching our favourite band or singer play live surely unite millions of us. There is something about the whole ritual that crystallises what popular music fundamentally is: a profoundly democratic artform that will always soundtrack the lives of just about everybody.But perhaps all that is on its way out. When it comes to big names, gig-going is becoming absurdly expensive. The ticket market is now both byzantine and hierarchical, often carving up audiences into no end of tiers. Thanks to the exploitative absurdity of “dynamic pricing” and resale websites, it also charges people much more than even the original face-value ticket prices. To track what’s going on in terms of average price rises can therefore be very difficult. But in the face of an ongoing cost of living crisis, the eye-watering upward trend is crystal-clear, and driven by those artists in the commercial super league of music. That may suit them and the industry players who take a cut, but it is starting to look like very bad news for everything music is supposed to represent.The Manchester-based digital marketing agency Dark Horse recentlypublished a reportcentred on a large handful of big-selling acts, and the differences between the prices they charge now and charged in 2005. Back then, if you wanted to see an artist in either a stadium or indoor arena, your budget usually had to be somewhere between £30 and £50. But such gigs now routinely come in at way over £100, with plenty of acts charging fans who happen to be wealthy a whole lot more. If you want a vivid example of what has changed, try this:according to Dark Horse, in 2005 the face value of a ticket for “general standing” at an Oasis gig was the equivalent of three hours’ work at the median hourly wage. These days, you’d have to graft for pretty much a whole day: seven hours and 56 minutes, to be precise.Go back a decade earlier, and the picture becomes even starker. In July,analysis by the Yorkshire Postshowed that between 1996 and 2025, the average UK concert ticket price increased 521%. Back then, the relevant cost was £16.99. Today, that figure has zoomed up to £105.60. If ticket prices had gone up line with inflation, the average cost would now be £34.18. “This means fans are currently paying nearly three times more than what would be expected based on inflation alone,” the Post said. “The most significant jump in prices has occurred recently, with an 80.5% increase since 2021.”There are heroes here too. Hats should be raised to the former Housemartins and Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton, whorecently capped pricesfor his gigs at big indoor venues at £35. Last week, those gnarled veterans the Cure announced summer dateswith core prices starting at £77.50: their leader, Robert Smith, says dynamic pricing is a “scam” that is “just driven by greed”.View image in fullscreenRobert Smith, of The Cure performing in Hamburg in 2022.Photograph: Daniel Bockwoldt/APFor the most part, however, the sense of prohibitive expense is overwhelming. In 2022, a standing ticket for Billie Eilish’s run of shows at the O2 arena in Londoncost an average of £76. This summer, the price was about £245. Consider also the insane prices charged for the “VIP” tickets that are now a particularly depressing aspect of the live ritual. The most expensive “package” for Oasis’s Wembley concertscame in at £506.25per person. When Beyoncé played the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, places in the “Buckin’ Honey Pit” and “Sweet Honey Pit”, went for £858.10. Any two-bit economist will tell you what those elite prices tend to entail for the rest of us: in proving that there are people who will cough up that much (and more), they add to the general upward pull.There are some rising costs that musicians and venues cannot avoid: energy bills, the increasingly stupid prices charged by hotels, how muchBrexit has added to touring expenses. Perhaps understandably, the huge decline in sales of music as a physical product has focused the mainstream industry’s attention on wringing as much money as possible from live performance. But a concert market dominated by a single corporate giant – Ticketmaster, nowhas a 60% UK market share– is another part of the story.Connected with all this is a change in many people’s understanding of what a gig actually is. I am quite old. The best concert I have ever seen was probably the Smiths at Salford University in the summer of 1986 – when they were in their pomp, and aticket cost £4(£12 in today’s prices, according to the Bank of England website). Back then, the pinnacle of musical achievement for most musicians was symbolised by such legendary theatres as London’s Hammersmith Odeon (now the Eventim Apollo), Manchester Apollo and Newcastle City Hall. The embodiment of the modern gig economy, by contrast, is the kind of sterile indoor arena that entails maximum efficiency – playing to as many people as you can in as few nights as possible – or, for music’s aristocracy, those huge stadiums.These venues are a byword for astronomical prices, and contribute to audiences’ modern expectations of big screens and pyrotechnics – which drive up costs and prices even further – and with no allowance for rough edges or artistic funny business. If you are paying big money to get in, that is hardly unreasonable. Yet it is also bad news for music’s creative health, and how people are likely to judge the kind of grassroots gigs that happen in more modestly sized places. Part of music’s current transformation is the fact that so many of the UK’s small venues – where ticket pricesremain low, and are largely static – arestill closing down, at speed. But if they are competing with gigantic spectacles staged in arenas and sports venues, is it any wonder that they find themselves struggling? Worse still, the insane money people have to pay for big gigs surely limits their spend on smaller ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just to make this clear: plenty of music of substance is still being made (a tip: if you can, go and see one of the forthcoming tour dates being played by the Leeds-based merchants of magical realism English Teacher, for whichtickets are pricedat about 30 quid). But how does this music break through and achieve the dream of mass communication when the gap between the grassroots and music’s upper echelons now seems so impossibly huge, and success involves more of a surrender of ethics and creative bravery than ever?Perhaps the essential problem is laughably simple. The songs we stream into our earphones are effectively free; as a consequence, live music has reached the point where sheer expense is threatening to destroy what we love and treasure about it. I know: it’s only rock’n’roll, and all that.

This has only made us more determinedWed 8 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 09.51 EDTShareThis is the last article I will write before one of two things happens: my boat reaches Gaza, or Israel seizes it. We hope to arrive on 9 October, havingbeen at sea since 27 September. Last week,Israel abducted the crewon the first Global Sumud flotilla the night before it had been due to land and deliver its aid. That is probably the same point that Israel will try to seize our Thousand Madleens and Freedom Flotilla Coalition boats, too.Our second flotilla has kept sailing amid all the news ofwhat has happened to the first one. We were just off Cyprus, getting ready for a night watch overshadowed by a loud unidentified drone, when we heard Israel had illegally commandeered the two main Sumud boats in international waters. The following morning, I washed a pile of plastic bowls in the sink while checking my phone: one by one, Israel seized the rest of the flotilla.We are sailing to Gaza. Here’s why | David AdlerRead moreOn my boat, this news has only made us more determined. We have work to do: a ship to navigate through temperamental weather with seven people living in close quarters, and aid to deliver. Keeping up with the first flotilla has helped us establish what we might expect, but it has not dented our resolve to continue.At this point of sailing, I’ve settled into a routine. I sleep from 11pm to 2am, get up for my night shift until 5am and then manage another two hours of sleep afterwards, bringing the total to five. More is impossible between the turbulent waves and the constant interruptions of communal living. My bed is a slim mattress above the couch in the common area; I get dressed inside my sleeping bag each morning while someone makes coffee at the kitchenette a metre away. There are aspects of living with six other people on a 40ft boat that take, to put it mildly, getting used to. You can’t stay put anywhere for long without getting in someone else’s way.But we do all get along well. The common goal helps, as does our sailors’ expertise: they know what they’re doing, which creates an infectious calm.The medicine and baby formula packed in the stern cabin and cockpit of our boat will save lives ifIsraeldoesn’t abduct us. “I assume you see this mission as symbolic, since they’ll certainly stop you,” an interviewer said to me last week. Perhaps that’s how it seems from far away. But when you’ve sailed for more than a week with aid all around you, knowing exactly where it’s stored, it’s impossible not to keep hoping you will reach those who need it.Yet aid is not the ultimate point of the flotilla, nor the ultimate point of the Palestinian cause. Israel likes to ask why we don’t “just” let them distribute our supplies. Besides there being good reason to distrust that this would actually happen when Israel has been deliberately starving Palestinians for two years, doing so would tacitly concede that Israel has the right to control Palestinian waters.Further details of the Sumud flotilla emerged over the weekend:that the abducteeshad been trafficked to Ktzi’ot prison in the Negev desert. That they were being processed as illegal immigrants, despite having been forcibly transferred to Israel from international waters. That Israel was denying them water, medicine and food, with degrading and sometimes violent treatment at the hands of its officers. On Monday, it was reported that 341 activists had beendeported, with 138 still in detention.This is horrific – but nowhere near as bad as the abuses faced by Palestinians in the same prison.Thaer Abu Asab, 38, was allegedlybeaten to deathin 2023 after refusing to bow his head to guards;19 officers were investigatedand none charged. Human rights groupB’Tselem has documentedwidespread torture and sexual violence in the detention centre. The international outrage we’ve seen over the treatment of flotilla participants is necessary and justified. But where was it for Palestinians in all those decades of barbaric Israeli conduct?I look across the endless blue sea each morning, and at the sinking amber moon before the next dawn’s rise, and know that my boat’s liberty to navigate such vastness reinforces the importance of not treating this mission as charity. Palestinians do not yet have freedom, and our own freedoms will be compromised until they do. That’s why we’re sailing. It’s that simple.Naoise Dolan is an Irish writer and the author ofExciting TimesandThe Happy CoupleExplore more on these topicsGaza flotillaOpinionGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinecommentShareReuse this content"

Zephaniah died in 2023 but he would have had much to say about shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick’srecent commentsabout the diverse inner-city Birmingham ward.Jenrick complained that he “didn’t see another white face” on his visit there, saying the area was “as close as I’ve come to a slum in this country”. After highlighting the lack of white people, Jenrick claimed it was not about “the colour of your skin or your faith”, but that he wanted people to “be living alongside each other”.Waking up to Jenrick’s distorted comments as a British-Asian daughter of immigrant parents, I immediately felt like fodder in this latest salvo of our culture war, swept into “otherness” without a pause for thought about what those words would mean for millions of black, Asian and minority ethnic British people like me.My relationship with Handsworth is complicated. I was born and lived there until my late teens and my mother and close family members still live in the area. My parents both worked in the same cotton factory owned by a Gujarati family near our home, and I would sometimes sneak in for a visit; loving the whirr of the machines and watching my dad operating the big iron presses as my mum sat sewing uniforms with all the other machinists.Robert Jenrick has been on a bizarre political journey. It’s made him incredibly dangerous | Owen JonesRead moreWatching everyone at work would instil in me the strong work ethic that I still possess to this day. There were games of cricket in our cul-de-sac with neighbours of Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani heritage as well as those who were white. Many weekends and afternoons were spent on Soho Road, at the time a thriving artery, where kitchens simmered with samosas and Indian sweetmeats, and brides would buy their intricately embroidered wedding lehengas in the numerous fabric shops, while other residents headed to temples, mosques and churches located on the streets nearby. It was definitely, as Zephaniah wrote in his poem named after that road, a place for everyone.Handsworth is now and was then a melting pot of different ethnicities, including white British. Of the 12,000 people who live in Handsworth, 91.3% identify as BAME andaccording to Birmingham city council, the ethnicity of Handsworth is 25% Pakistani, 23% Indian, 10% Bangladeshi, 16% Black African or Black Caribbean, 10% mixed or other ethnic group and 9% white. In overall terms, the health of residents in Handsworth is worse than the average for England, and it is among the more deprived wards in the city, with employment rates much lower than Birmingham’s average. I have previously written about the complex relationship between some of the most deprived areas of Birmingham, integration and immigration, including during ourVoices and votes seriesand theBrexit referendum.Handsworth, as one of those areas with high deprivation, is not a place without its issues. In recent years, there have beengrowing reportsof prostitution, antisocial behaviour and alcohol and drug abuse. Many different communities do live side by side, but even during my childhood there were some factions that did not mix, though nothing on a level that would justify Jenrick’s allegation of a community living separate, “parallel” lives.Then there are the bins. Bin workers in Birmingham have beenstriking since Januaryand walked out indefinitely in March in a dispute over job and pay cuts. Piles of black bags in the streets and overflowing wheelie bins have led to an influx of rats in some parts of the city. Yet Jenrick described this as a “litter” problem, comparing the area to a “slum”, and seeming to imply that the issue was somehow linked to a lack of integration.Just a few weeks ago, I spoke to frustrated family members of thepostcode bin lottery. Those who live in the slightly more salubrious area of Handsworth Wood were having their bins collected, but those just across the border in Handsworth were left with rubbish piling up outside their homes, including my mother – who is one of the most house-proud people you’re ever likely to meet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But really, this wasn’t about Handsworth at all: it was a cynical attempt to out-Reform Reform, to stoke division and use the colour of people’s skin to make his point. The danger does not lie in places like Handsworth, but in Jenrick’s words.Jenrick said that in Handsworth he saw a country that he didn’t want to live in. In August, my mother had major heart surgery, and while I sat next to her hospital bed, visitor upon visitor walked through the doors; some family, but others friends from her local community. At that crucial time, her community had gathered around her, and as a child, I remember this happening time and time again.

That isn’t a forecast of extinction for Kemi Badenoch’s party, just an observation of decline. Their agenda-setting days are behind them. Their loyal voters are old and they are not recruiting new ones.There is vigour on the right of the political spectrum, but the most energised people prefer burning things to conserving them. In parliament, Badenoch is still leader of the official opposition but in swaths of the country, the role of chief antagonist to the government has been usurped by Nigel Farage. Every speech at the Tory conference in Manchester has been a strangulated plea for relevance.Is it terminal? Another way to ask the same question: if the Conservative party didn’t exist, would there be any need to invent it? To answer yes is to locate a gap in the political market that Reform UK could never fill. The possible vacancy is defined by that depleted, demoralised band ofone nation Torieswho stand well to the right of Labour on economic issues but feel no cultural affinity with Farage’s immigrant-baiting, culture-warrior radicalism.Conservative moderates are more numerous in the Lords than the Commons, but they’re hardly assertive in either chamber.They see an opportunity for a sensible, centre-right party to advance on to terrain that will fall vacant if, as they expect, Keir Starmer is dragged leftwards by a rebellious Labour party that doesn’t trust its leader’s progressive instincts. The Liberal Democrats, not wanting to be outflanked on social conscientiousness, will drift with that tide.In theory, that would open space for revival of an old-fashioned, pro-enterprise, fiscally disciplined, mild-mannered Tory party, offering sound economic management and rejecting Reform’s swivel-eyed school of crank conspiracies and race-obsessed grievance mining.Proponents of a centre-facing Tory strategy say there is proof of demand for such a programme in private discussions with British business leaders and inpublicly declared donationsto the Tories, which are greater than the sums flowing into Farage’s or Starmer’s coffers. But corporate sponsorship of a mainstream Conservative revival is not evidence of voter appetite for one.It is notoriously hard for a party evicted from power after a long incumbency to even get a hearing from people who are thoroughly sick of the sight of them.Badenoch defends Jenrick’s ‘no white faces’ comments about BirminghamRead moreBadenoch understood that much about her predicament when taking over the leadership last November. She told her party there would beno “quick fix”. She promised more “thoughtful Conservatism”, which would distinguish itself in rigour and credibility from the habit of “kneejerk” policy announcements that are designed to grab attention but cannot work in government.What followed was a detour into semi-coherent ideological abstraction. There werespeeches that meldedpolitical theory to niche social media fixations; rhetorical meanderings in labyrinthine arguments about the threat to western civilisation posed by woke bureaucracies and militantly censorious liberals. As an analysis of what ails Britain, it was convoluted, idiosyncratic and no match for Farage’s campaign-ready diagnosis that it all comes down to immigration.The party’s poll ratingshave dropped lowerthan they were at the last election. Talk of defections to Reform is constant. Only despondent paralysis restrains the Tories’ twitchy regicidal impulse.In a desperate effort to generate some sense of momentum at this year’s conference, Badenoch has abandoned her former reluctance to make premature policy. Tory pledges in the past few days includecutting £47bnfrom Whitehall budgets; reducing the number of civil servants by about a quarter; withdrawing benefits from foreigners even if they are legally entitled to reside in the UK;repealingthe Climate Change Act andwithdrawing Britainfrom the European convention on human rights and other treaties that might impede deportation of undesirables. Those removals would be expedited by a new body, modelled on Donald Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice).Pride forbids Badenoch admitting that this frantic display of policy pyrotechnics represents an abandonment of her old strategy. She clings to the idea that seriousness and practicality are the traits that will distinguish Conservatives from Reform. “We’ve started doing politics in a new way,” she boasted,in a curtain-raising speechin Manchester. “No more making the announcement first and working out the policy detail second.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The advertised budget cuts assume a fictitious mountain of surplus bureaucracy that can be incinerated with no impact on public services. The abandonment of climate commitments channels a dogmatic horror of green energy as a leftwing plot against bill-paying consumers instead of a pathway to cheaper power, an escape route from reliance on oil-exporting despots and a future growth industry. Unilateral repudiation of international treaties makes no allowance for the reaction of other countries that would, under Badenoch’s plans, be expected to receive the tens of thousands of people Britain would send to them.At a glance, Badenoch’s programme is pure Faragism. The difference, measurable only with close attention to the Tory leader’s speeches and interviews, is her sanctimonious confidence that bad policy turns good once she has declared it to be the product of her ponderous method. She seems sincerely to believe that she has spent the past year preparing her party as a force for government based on a set of Conservative principles that are recognisably unlike the vandalistic populism of her more successful radical rightwing rivals.She extols the value of historic institutions and the rule of law. “I reject the politics that everything must go, everything must be torn down, that everything is broken,” she says – hinting at disapproval of Reform’s more histrionic denunciations of modern Britain. Then she endorses Ice, Trump’s paramilitary kidnap squad, as the template for a putative Tory immigration regime.Badenoch has spent a year immersed in pseudo-intellectual laundering of radical nationalist positions, all the while imagining she was heading to some other, more sophisticated destination. She really thought she was rehabilitating the Tories, but she has reduced them to a low-wattage thinktank attached to a warehouse storing future parliamentary candidates for Farage.For the remnant of moderate centre-rightConservativeshoping for some pathway back to credibility, Badenoch’s leadership has been the worst of all worlds. Her claim to be thoughtful was an affectation, squandering time when real thought might have been applied to the hard questions she has avoided. She discredited the idiom of serious Conservatism by appropriating it for the shallowest agenda. She understood the need for a boundary between traditional Toryism and populist demagoguery but lacked the clarity of thought, strategic acumen and political courage to enforce one. She has accelerated the dissolution of her party’s identity by asserting it in terms that no casual voter will understand. In the post-Conservative climate of British politics, they won’t even notice.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservative conferenceOpinionKemi BadenochConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

The squabbles have to stopWed 8 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 08.55 EDTShareThe closer Russia’s hybrid war comes to European capitals, the less EU leaders seem able to agree on how to respond. That, at least, was the worrying impression left by a dissonant EU summit in Copenhagen.Summonedlast week to build consensus on the top priorities for European rearmament, the meeting was an embarrassing display of theturf wars, political squabblesand hidden agendas that are plaguing attempts to build a coherent European defence. Leaders quarrelled not only about who should be in charge of Europe’s military buildup but also about how to fund Ukraine’s continued resistance against Russian aggression, and how to advance Kyiv’s bid for EU membership.They voiced alarm at repeated breaches of their airspace by drones buzzing European airports and military bases, and Russian fighter jets violating their borders but appeared unsure how to react. Shoot them down? Escort them out? Keep calm and carry on? Or hit back by leveraging frozen Russian assets to provide a giant loan to Ukraine, taking more aggressive steps to choke off Moscow’s oil and gas exports, andgiving Kyiv long-range missilesto strike deeper inside Russia? No consensus emerged in Copenhagen, but decisions need to be taken soon.The Russian president,Vladimir Putin, must be laughing at the cacophony in the Danish capital and may well draw the conclusion that Europe is weak and divided in response to his mounting provocations. That would be dangerous for all sides.Leaders of the biggest EU powers used the informal summit to slap down the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen’s,proposalto build a multilayereddrone wallfor eastern Europe after the spate of Russian airspace violations and incidents involving Moscow’s shadow fleet of sanctions-busting rust-bucket oil tankers.In a paper circulated to leaders, von der Leyen proposed fourEuropean flagship defence projects: a European drone wall, an eastern flank watch surveillance network, an air defence shield and a defence space shield. She also said the EU executive would monitor member states’ progress in meeting targets to boost readiness by 2030 through a new reporting and assessment process.The French president, Emmanuel Macron,dissed the drone wall concept, saying something “more sophisticated and more complex” was needed. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, slammed overregulation by Brussels and savaged the anti-drone plan behind closed doors. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, complained that Brussels was focused exclusively on protecting eastern countries, and ignoring the southern flank. She also hinted at another objection: this should be Nato’s job, not the EU’s.The row was about power, not drones. National leaders suspected a commission power grab behind the defence initiatives and wanted to put von der Leyen back in her box.It’s fine for Brussels to offer member states €150bn in loans for collaborative defence procurement projects and to ease rules to allow more deficit spending for defence. But big EU governments want to keep control in their own hands, with groups of countries developing different capabilities to meet theirNatoforce requirements.These turf wars have been around ever since the EU began to play a role in defence 25 years ago. They have resurfaced more acutely because defence is increasingly the new frontier of European integration.No one can blame Brussels for pressing member states to spend their rising defence budgets more efficiently together rather than duplicating capabilities and failing to build a stronger European defence technology industrial base. That will require harmonising military requirements and buying less from the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Besides, the UK remains an indispensable player in European defence despite having left the EU.The “coalition of the willing”, working under Franco-British leadership on security guarantees forUkraine, could serve as the nucleus of Europe’s rearmament drive. But industrial rivalries among its core members risk undermining the common defence effort.France and Germany arefeudingover afuture combat air system projectthey launched in 2017 and which Spain joined. The constellation of a sixth-generation fighter, advanced drones and a “combat cloud” was supposed to be a European alternative to dependence on the US F-35 and its successors. Dogfights between prime contractors Dassault Aviation and Airbus over design leadership and workshare have brought the project to the brink of collapse. Meanwhile, a rivalglobal combat air programmepiloted by the UK, Italy and Japan is moving ahead.Underlying all these disputes is a lack of mutual trust among Europeans, exacerbated by uncertainty over the US commitment to European security under the Trump administration. When countries are not sure how far they can trust each other, their instinct is to fall back on national arms industries and militaries.That is weakening Europe at a time when it needs to project strength and determination towards Russia.

His voice is high and rasping. Listening to him, you could be forgiven for thinking that the late Truman Capote was still with us. As for what happened “a very long time ago”, Bachardy is referring to the parties he threw with his partner, the British novelistChristopher Isherwood. Their home in Adelaide Drive, Santa Monica, was a salon thronged by movie stars and writers as well as Bachardy’s fellow artists.“Yes, we had a good time back then, but you can’t expect me to remember exactly who was here!” he says. It’s a fair point. Isherwood has been dead for almost 40 years and Bachardy, who is 91, suffers from some of the conditions that typically afflict people of his age. But the famous names they entertained in the 60s and 70s read like a wishlist for the guest bookers on the Johnny Carson show: Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich, Laurence Olivier, Rock Hudson, Igor Stravinsky, Elton John, Tennessee Williams and Capote, too.David wasn’t in any hurry – you don’t get a beautiful picture in half an hourThose heady recollections have been prompted by the forthcoming auction of David Hockney’s celebrated “double portrait” of Isherwood and Bachardy. It’s a monumental work, measuring more than six feet by nine feet, and it could fetch up to £45m. Bachardy has no difficulty in remembering that, he says. “How could one forget it? It’s a beautiful picture.”Hockney depicted the couple in their living room, sitting in matching chairs. Isherwood, whose writing inspired Cabaret and the acclaimed film A Single Man, is seen on the right of frame, looking over at Bachardy. The foreground is filled by a large, low table set with stacks of books and a fruit bowl. The pieces of fruit are almost luminous in the west coast sunshine that infuses the room despite the closed shutters behind the two men. My call to the Los Angeles-born Bachardy finds him anticipating another scintillating day. “It’s a sunny morning here, the ocean is calm,” he confirms. He is speaking from the house on Adelaide Drive. Next year, Bachardy will have lived there for 70 years.View image in fullscreen‘No one held a candle to him’ … Bachardy with Isherwood, left, in the 70s.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyPainted in 1968, Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy is like a storyboard for an interiors magazine or a sober, even bourgeois, portrait of a marriage, one that could almost have come from the studio of a Gainsborough or Joshua Reynolds. You might never know that “homosexual acts” were criminalised in the California of the 60s and that out gay men and women were beyond the pale of mainstream America. Needless to say, Isherwood and Bachardy weren’t married. They spent their first night together on Valentine’s Day 1953 when the artist was 18 and the writer 48. They lived with each other, not always frictionlessly, until Isherwood died in 1986.Hockney’s study of a gay couple living a settled middle-class life – their improving books, their healthy snacks – is a landmark in queer art, according to critics. “It’s perfectly understandable that’s what it’s become,” agrees the surviving sitter. It’s also a significant work in Hockney’s own oeuvre, the first of only seven “double portraits” by the artist, which also include the much-loved Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, now in Tate Britain in London.Despite its title, Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy is really about three people: the third, unseen presence is the artist himself, who was a neighbour of Bachardy’s at the time and remains a friend. What does Bachardy remember about the making of the work? “David was relaxed, confident. He’s very talented, his results were always impressive. He wasn’t in any hurry. You don’t get a beautiful picture in half an hour.”I expected the best and I got it. I had no reservations about the painting at allHockney took photographs of his subjects and drew them in pencil before making the finished work in acrylic paint. At first, he intended that the pair would appear the other way round in the picture, but then he noticed that the writer often glanced over to his lover while they sat for him and so he swapped them over.Were they good models? “I sat still!” Bachardy said. “David and I are both painters. We know exactly how to do it and we’ve done it for years.” What about Isherwood? “He had lots of experience of sitting for artists and he was lucky to have such talented artists painting him.” Was Bachardy happy when he saw the finished product? “I expected the best and I got it. I had no reservations about it at all.”But some people are surprised or even shocked to see what an artist has made of them, even one as accomplished as Hockney. “The amateurs have amateur reactions,” says Bachardy with a note of asperity. “People who are doing this for a living are very experienced.” He is a considerable artist in his own right, with many gallery shows in the US to his credit. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum ofArtin New York and the National Portrait Gallery in London. For a time, he was court artist to Hollywood royalty. He painted Bette Davis at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Contemplating Bachardy’s likeness of her, the formidable star muttered: “Yes, that’s the old bag.”As well as sitting for Hockney, Bachardy returned the favour. He says: “I don’t think somebody in his position could be happy sitting for another painter but we sat for each other several times. I think this was really the start for him of doing portraits outside members of his family. We had friends who wanted to sit for us. We used to say to each other, ‘Hey, this is a pretty good business to get into!’” Their friendship survived Hockney moving back to Europe and they still speak on the phone from time to time, says Bachardy.View image in fullscreen‘I am still painting because that’s what I do’ … Don Bachardy in 2010.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverThe double portrait was a highlight of Hockney’s acclaimed exhibition in Paris this summer, David Hockney 25. It’s of its time and yet oddly contemporary: we could be looking at the green room of a literary festival somewhere warm, or the waiting room of an exclusive and open-minded adoption agency. It’s been in private hands for the past four decades and Bachardy is surprised to learn that it’s up for sale. Its eye-popping asking price elicits another rasping laugh. “Oh really? Well let’s see. I’ll believe it when I see it!”Do you think it’s a lot of money for a painting of you and Christopher, I ask. “It’s a lot of money for anything!” he says, with that voice like an emery board from Tiffany’s.David Hockney 25 review – so moving I had tears in my eyesRead moreBachardy painted Isherwood many times over. Was that difficult? “It’s always difficult to do something that’s worth doing, whether it was Christopher or a hundred other people. If you live with a painter, it’s hard to go on being painted by him, but he was a good sport.”Isherwood died at Adelaide Drive. He was 81. Some of Bachardy’s most penetrating and affecting images of him were made as he was dying and immediately postmortem. Though the artist has not wanted for company in the past 40 years or so, Isherwood was a great loss, he says. “He was irreplaceable, one of a kind. I never met anyone who could hold a candle to him. I probably miss him more than ever because it’s been such a long time since he went another way.”Why has Bachardy chosen to stay in the house after so many years? Doesn’t he get itchy feet? “Oh, I think my feet are as itchy as any other person’s! But this is a precious, wonderful house. I love it and would hate to leave it. Isn’t that what most people feel about their home?”Bachardy tells me that he continues to paint. “Yes, I am painting because that’s what I do. The same things I’ve always done: paintings of people, portraits. It can be difficult but not enough to stymie me,” he says. You’ve been lucky with your eyesight, I suggest. “I think I’ve been lucky in quite a few departments,” he shoots back.I wonder what’s become of the furniture which is such a feature of Hockney’s painting. Bachardy thinks that he still has the chairs. His friend, a younger man called Tim, takes the phone. He says: “The chairs are rattan. They were deteriorating so they’re in storage.”Somebody would probably pay a lot of money for them, I suggest. “That’s why they’re in storage,” Tim replies. He says the chairs may be restored to the property at a future date. Could the house become a museum? “It belongs to a trust. It might become a residence,” thinks Tim, perhaps a base for writers and painters as it was in its 60s pomp.At the beginning of the year, the house was threatened by the wildfires that raced through the neighbouring district of Pacific Palisades. “We were only moderately endangered,” says Bachardy. “The fire wasn’t really close.” Did he evacuate? “No, I stayed. I thought, ‘If the house burns down, I prefer to stay in it.’”Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy will be auctioned by Christie’s in New York next month. It can be viewed at Christie’s, London, 17-22 OctoberThis article was amended on 8 October 2025.

What should Taylor Swift do next?Swift’s 12th LP is set to dominate the charts – despite fans lampooning the lyrics and lamenting its quality. Guardian music writers discuss what it means for her careerShaad D'Souza,Elle Hunt,Alexis PetridisandLaura SnapesWed 8 Oct 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 20.19 EDTShareLaura SnapesTaylor Swift’s 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl (TLOAS), has been a smash statistical success. She’s broken records that she previously set, and in the US has now beaten Adele for the most sales in a single week. The cinematic release party this weekend grossed $34m in the US and an additional $13m worldwide. But it’s second only to her 20-year-old debut – written in her teens – as the worst reviewed album of her catalogue, with a 70% approval average on Metacritic. What are the successes and failures of this record?Alexis PetridisThe success part is obvious. It’s set to become the biggest-selling album of the year by a preposterously long chalk. In terms of shortcomings, I think the biggest one is prosaic – a lack of really memorable melodies. I think you’d be hearing a lot less about the cringy lyrics if it was packed with tunes that were up to the standard of Blank Space, Don’t Blame Me or Bad Blood.Shaad D’SouzaI’m less inclined to see the commercial victory of this album as any kind ofprofoundsuccess. Swift has been bigger than everyone else for years now, and I don’t think any achievement of hers will ever seem as big as the Eras tour, which was the kind of monocultural event a lot of people thought couldn’t exist any more.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl review – dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzledRead moreIf there’s overall success here, beyond a couple of individual songs, it’s in brand maintenance. A new album gives Swift a reason to charm late-night audiences and radio hosts, which she hasn’t done in a while, and I think after the moody-teen aesthetic of The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD), it’s fun to see her return to the kind of peppy, high-wattage aesthetic she explored on Lover, even if with a far inferior album. I think the main failure is the overall feeling of regression, which ties in to the same failure that’s dogged her for a good while now: she seemingly has no internal sense of quality control any more. There are some truly unforgivable lines on this album.Elle HuntThe lack of quality control struck me too. The way she talked about this project on Travis Kelce’s podcast New Heights, it seemed conceived in direct response to the criticisms of TTPD: a tight 12 tracks versus a variable 31, “infectious” pop bangers in place of wordy angst. Bringing on Max Martin, the producer behind most of this century’s solid-gold pop hits, including her own, seemed to underscore this ambition. There are some catchy melodies and the production is slick, crowd-pleasing, expensive-sounding.The big issue, as you say, Shaad, is the lyrics, which are often so clanging that they invalidate any pleasure you’re taking in the music. Eldest Daughter is the prime example, with the sparse piano focusing your attention on these horrible, meme-y turns of phrase: “We all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire” is just nonsense. “Did you girlboss too close to the sun?” from Cancelled! dates it immediately. Olivia Rodrigo, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter have all released smarter, funnier, more high-concept pop in the past two years. Does Swift know that, too? Or does she really believe she’s working at her best?View image in fullscreenSwift and Jimmy Fallon go deep on The Life of a Showgirl.Photograph: NBC/Todd Owyoung/Getty ImagesLSIn her intro videos to each song, in the dismal cinematic release party, she seemed very pleased with the record. But I think the playful, poppy sound is a play to re-establish herself as a major hitmaker – ie someone who has more than one major single per record, like Olivia, Sabrina and Chappell have had, after TTPD and Folklore only spawned one hit apiece. I also think that the mammoth Eras tour, as well as the shifting company she keeps – from artsy lovers and collaborators and pals like Boygenius, to the fairly normie sports world she’s now part of – may have recalibrated her desire to speak to as many people as possible. No more “esoteric” records, as she called everything from Folklore to TTPD. Whether that’s because those are periods of her life she’d rather leave behind or because she internalised criticism of how unwieldy her writing had got, who knows? And the biggest fans of this album that I know of, other than apparentlythe staff of Rolling Stone, are all under the age of 10. Having Shake It Off-style hits that play at kids’ birthday parties is good business, too.I also find it regressive. Although I don’t think 2019’s Lover is most people’s favourite Swift album, its spread-betting styles offer a really interesting document of a pop star fresh out of the contract she signed as a teenager, on the edge of 30, working out what an adult pop career might look like. Folklore and Evermore felt like her vacating that space; Midnights was largely a convincingly adult recalibration of it. But this feels like time-travelling back to the 2010s, pretending none of that ever happened.SDA lot of people were thrilled about Swift returning to Martin and Shellback, but neither producer has been on a hot streak over the past decade, or longer. Martin’s last true smash was the Weeknd’s Blinding Lights in 2020. Swift’s music has never exactly been in conversation with the rest of the pop world. She has always seemed more invested in pop’s business trends than its musical trends, and her choice of collaborators here is revealing: she’s at a point where she’d rather look back into her own archive than the world around her, for instruction. One look at the charts might have told Swift that her style of “centrist pop” isn’t really necessary any more – as streaming subsumes radio, it’s less necessary to appeal to all bases. That Showgirl has such an easy, all-encompassing sound makes this album feel weirdly old-fashioned – she could have taken bigger swings here, still within the realm of “pure pop”, and still dominated. Instead, we get Bruno Mars-y lite-funk and wan Abba pastiche.One question now is where she goes next, creatively. I’d love to see her work with a younger producer such as Leroy Clampitt, who’s made excellent sinister, synthy pop with Madison Beer and Sabrina Carpenter; or Carter Lang, who’s made pop that’s earthy, but still hooky, with SZA and Lola Young. My pipe dream is that she strips it all back and works with someone like Cass McCombs (check his Sky Ferreira collaboration, Sad Dream, for a proof of concept) on a back-to-basics album.APMore than anything, she probably needs to take a break. Her star is so big that the usual rules of streaming-era pop don’t apply. She doesn’t need to put out a constant stream of music, and she could easily take a few years off. That would make the level of expectation around her next album higher, and it’s probably worth it for her to recalibrate what she does, to come up with something different, to not feel impelled to keep pumping material out when she doesn’t have to. Folklore and Evermore were creatively different from the albums before them, and they came out of the enforced break of lockdown.View image in fullscreenA fan looks at copies of the album at the Target release party in Times Square, New York.Photograph: John Taggart/EPAEHMore than just a break from the public eye, it feels like Swift needs to live a little, venture out from the Taylor Cinematic Universe and have some new thoughts and experiences that aren’t already enshrined in her lore. Except for Ruin the Friendship, all these songs deal with either: a) her new relationship bliss; or b) her grievances with how she’s perceived. It’s not a surprise, given her schedule over the past few years, but it’s not particularly interesting or novel. Often here Swift feels like she’s rehashing musical and lyrical ideas that she’s already executed, often better. That’s why the album feels so non-essential: her creative well has not been replenished, forcing her to draw from the same stagnant, self-referential water. Imagine if she’d taken the time to actually reread Hamlet and made a concept album, The Life of Ophelia (rather than just reference it in the first track, The Fate of Ophelia). Or properly committed to the showgirl concept with a Broadway sound and story. Instead, it just feels as if she’s hedging her bets with the broadest possible, frequently banal pop, simply to hang on to the spotlight.LSI’d love to see her jettison the Easter eggs, “numerology” – at this point, essentially: “Hey kids, math is fun!” – and bits like putting her saddest song at track five. Naturally they generate terabytes of headlines as fans put the pieces together, but it’s such a constraining framework and the acrobatic self-referencing makes her output feel more and more claustrophobic. Sadly, I think there’s a gnat’s chance in hell of any of this happening. Next year is the 20th anniversary of her debut album, and her next record will be her 13th – her lucky number. There’s no way she won’t mark that, with either another new album or the version of her debut that she re-recorded for Taylor’s Versions but didn’t ultimately need to release once she got her masters back. It will be framed as a gift to fans, albeit one they have to pay to receive in various vinyl variants. You’d hazard a guess at her getting married next year, once her fiance’s final football season has finished – also, incidentally, his 13th – an event that almost no one is going to be able to act normally about.View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift performing on the Eras tour.Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/API’m interested in the phrase “too big to fail”, which I’ve heard a lot since Friday. None of the criticisms of the album have stymied its vast commercial success, for sure. But I am curious about how many of her fans are engaged, ardent Swifties, a number of whom have registered their disappointment with the album – plus the cost of paying for the numerous physical versions, and the evident use of AI in promo clips – and how many are casual consumers, otherwise unengaged in pop, who just know her as the default pop star of our age and don’t engage with the lore. In the US, she has an exclusive product deal with the supermarket Target, and her albums strike me as the kind of thing a kind parent would drop in the trolley for their kid. How many disappointing records would it take for them to stop automatically outstripping their predecessors? As with the shift from TTPD to TLOAS, will she adjust her next release in line with the many criticisms it’s received? Or is its proudly basic worldview (rich husband-lovin’ girlie who defends the family) a sign that she’s over her period of craving critical respectability? Are the hints of a backlash serious enough to flourish? Or is life now just an endless Eras encore?Taylor Swift’s Charli xcx hit job misses the point – and underscores her tedious obsession with conflict | Laura SnapesRead moreAP:I don’t think the backlash is serious enough to have any real impact, and I think the casual consumers you mention are the people any artist has to reach if you’re going to be huge. One thing Idothink is interesting about TLOAS is how much the “proudly basic worldview” may chime with her long-term fans’ own lived experiences. Say she does take time off, gets married, has kids, all that stuff she’s talking about on Wi$h Li$t – can she then write an interesting album about that? That’s a massive challenge. I’m trying to think of a mainstream pop album that successfully addresses those topics and I can’t come up with one. But it’s got to be more intriguing than stuff about internecine pop squabbles and internet backlash. She’s spent her career basing a chunk of her songwriting on the model of You’re So Vain. To extend the Carly Simon comparison, it would be interesting to hear her start basing it on Coming Around Again.EHI might be disappointed by this album/cash grab but my interest and investment in Swift will inevitably survive at least one more cycle. Ultimately, though, on her return I’d love to see her writing with self-reflection, imagination and rigour instead of this internet-addled defensive crouch or increasingly tedious, triumphant underdog shtick. Without being blind to the irony of noting this here, my other hope for her next album would be for a more proportional, measured response from the media. Nothing on TLOAS justifies or rewards the volume of coverage, depth of analysis, or cross-platform fanfare. It’s a pop album, and a mid one at that – not a ‘London Bridge is down’-levelglobal news event. I hope that, in future, Swift will be covered on merit, not just because she is too big to ignore.SDI choose to take a long view of this, perhaps foolishly: there were entire decades when artists like Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell didn’t make good records! With any hope, this is just an artistic down period, and she’ll wake up in a few years with some hunger to make an album with the integrity and specificity of Speak Now or Lover.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl is out nowThis article was updated on 8 October 2025.

Part of the competition involved visiting places where violence had happened. “If we don’t reclaim them,” she said, “it’s like we don’t exist”’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 8 Oct 2025 10.08 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 12.48 EDTShareIhave always been interested in gender and identity stories. InSouth Africa, we have a strong liberal constitution on paper for queer rights, but the reality on the streets – the hate crimes, the animosity in the workplace and in social settings – is very different. I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. That led me to the drag pageant scene.I would go to photograph pageants every weekend, and every Monday I would get messages from the people I’d photographed asking me to send the pictures – so I had a lot of instant feedback on the work I was making. I was using harsh lighting to play with the idea of masculine and feminine, to emphasise the contrast between the strong jawlines and the feminine personae. But there’s no one more honest than a drag queen, and very early on, someone told me they really didn’t like the picture I’d taken of them.It was hard to hear, but letting go of my ego I asked this person why. They said it was because they didn’t look beautiful. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. I changed my approach. And if I hadn’t had that knock to my ego, the work wouldn’t have become what it needed to be.We met at a petrol station. We moved quickly and didn't lingerOver the next year and a half, making the work became a conversation with the drag queens. I put it out there that I wanted to do a collaborative project. Belinda, who is in this image, came to me and told me she was applying for the Miss Drag South Africa pageant; part of the competition involves doing a project. The idea was to work with other drag artists and visit places where acts of violence had happened, and to reclaim these places. I told Belinda to think about who should tell this story – I wanted her to consider carefully if I was the right person. Two weeks later, she came back and said she wanted to work with me.I was concerned for the drag queens’ safety, not only while going to these sites of violence and making the images but also after, as some of them lived in the townships where the portraits would be made. I sat with it for a while. But one thing Belinda said stuck with me. She said: “If we don’t go, if we don’t reclaim these spaces and make these pictures, then it’s like we don’t exist.”The entire series was shot in four hours. We met at a petrol station on the day, so the drag queens could get ready – everyone had specific ideas about what they wanted to wear. We moved quickly and didn’t linger. I was definitely nervous – it made me realise how these people feel every day, you can never fully relax.I photographed Belinda at theshisanyama– a community space where women cook and sell meat – in Khayelitsha, a township located on the Cape Flats, near Cape Town. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was the end of the day and the light was really good – everything came together, with the lady in the background staring. If you look carefully, you can see my shadow – I love that I’m a part of it, that always makes me smile. Belinda has such a regal, enigmatic presence. There’s something about her – I hope it comes across in the image.Afterwards we organised a show at a community hall in Khayelitsha. It was a small gathering but people were really engaged, and came to ask questions, and the artists shared about themselves. It’s amazing to have global exposure for the issues we care about, but none of that is as valuable as showing the work in the space it was created.Lee-Ann Olwage’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lee-Ann OlwageBorn:Durban, 1986Trained:“I’m a self-trained photographer but studied film directing at AFDA film school in Cape Town.”Influences:“My peers, life, the stories I work on, and other forms of storytelling: painting, music, weaving, textile art.”High point:“Winning theWorld Press Photo award in 2020.

A handsome American millionaire, Bender moved to Costa Rica with his wife, Ann, two years after they married, and set about building a 2,000-hectare nature reserve, centred on a mountaintop mansion that had neither walls nor windows. But despite moving to this vision of paradise, the couple’s mental health fell into sharp decline and in January 2010, Bender died of a gunshot wound to the head.Thanks to an unscientific forensic investigation by the Costa Rican authorities, the perpetrator remains unknown. Suicide is one option – John had written emails about wanting to die in the weeks previously – but the fact that he was shot in the back of the head, in bed, while wearing earplugs, suggests that Ann may have shot him. In the intervening years, the Costa Rican justice system (which has no double jeopardy law) has tried Ann Bender for murder on three separate occasions; of these, she was convicted once and acquitted twice.It is, by all accounts, a fascinating case – and it has been rigorously detailed in the new podcast series Hell in Heaven. In an effort to discover the events that led to Bender’s death, journalist Becky Milligan travelled to Costa Rica and conducted interviews with almost everyone involved.“It was quite full on,” Milligan says of the trip, over video call with her producer Poppy Damon. “Serendipity steps in when you’re on the ground. With some of the interviews, we didn’t know them before we got there, then it just flowered. In situations like that, you have to have your wits about you.”“We understood the story a lot more once we’d gone there,” adds Damon. “When we went into the jungle, the audio of all the different creatures and birds was so rich. It was like nothing I’d ever heard. My ears couldn’t really process the amount of sound. And going to the property just takes your breath away, because it’s this massive building with no walls, and it looks like a car park, but it’s also sort of beautiful.”The Benders’ mansion – Boracayan to them, The Benderdome to less impressed locals – did indeed represent a bold move. Having made a fortune on Wall Street, Bender set about building his paradise home to his exact specifications. But, as a neighbour points out in the podcast, a lot of people underestimate the noise and darkness and isolation of jungle life, and as such “a lot of people go kind of crazy”.View image in fullscreen‘It looks like a car park, but it’s also sort of beautiful’ … the Benders’ Boracayan mansion today.Photograph: Poppy DamonAnd so it came to pass. Ann’s psychiatrist at the time came to believe that the pair were psychotic, and diagnosed Ann withfolie à deux, a disorder where two people reinforce each other’s mental illness until it reaches extreme proportions. In addition, Ann was battlingLyme disease, and John – despite having no medical training – chose to shun conventional medicine in favour of injecting her with water from a local stream.The Benders’ decision to live this way does seem somewhat eccentric. Similarly, John’s decision to try to cure Ann with injections of untreated water sounds a little like abuse. And then there’s the fact that the initial crime scene pictures were such poor quality because they were lit by more than 500 Tiffany lamps that Ann had compulsively collected.It’s these outré details, combined with the lack of resolution, that tends to get people hooked. And they do get hooked. Carol Vaughn, an American journalist (and author of Crazy Jungle Love, a book about the case) who works in Costa Rica, has seen her fair share of grisly murders – in 2021, she covered the mass murder of an American coffee farmer and his staff, which was by all accounts unthinkably horrifying – but it was the death of Bender that plunged her into obsession.“Obsession is the right word,” she clarifies. “It was all things Bender, 24 hours a day. Didn’t comb my hair, didn’t brush my teeth. Dog barely got walked. I thought I was writing a love story. I thought, this is Shakespearean. This is biblical, the love these two people had for each other. And so I was writing it from that point of view. Meanwhile, the whole world was viewing it as a crime story and nothing more. At the time of his death, they were both deeply depressed. That chemistry, I think, made one of their deaths inevitable.”Set out like this, the death of John Bender sounds as if it might make the basis for yet another grubbily exploitative true crime podcast. However, the beauty of Hell in Heaven lies in the humanistic way Milligan and Damon approach the subject matter.“Visiting Costa Rica meant that we could meet people face to face, and be really fair and interested in the characters, rather than have the voyeurism which sometimes happens with these things,” Milligan says. “One of the most moving things was speaking to John’s parents, Paul and Margie. It just brings it home that this is a family tragedy, and any of us could go through this.”The podcast also takes a lot of care in following the aftermath of the death, not least Ann Bender’s subsequent woes. She weighed just 38kg when police arrived at the crime scene and, to quote a friend of hers, looked like “someone who had just walked out of a concentration camp.” Jewels of hers worth $16m (nearly £12m) vanished in the aftermath of John’s death. And she was tried over and over again by Costa Rican prosecutors. “First, she was acquitted,” says Vaughn. “Then, she was found guilty on all counts. The third time, she was acquitted again due to lack of evidence, but then immediately the prosecutor put in for a fourth trial.”View image in fullscreen‘This is biblical, the love these two people had for each other’ … Ann and John Bender.Photograph: Exactly Right MediaThis is where Vaughn’s story collides with Ann’s. “I was the representative for the American embassy, and I snuck her a new emergency passport the day she was acquitted,” she says. “I was sitting right behind her. I slid it under the chair. She put it right next to her heart, and was gone two days later. I mean, she was out of here and she’ll never be back. She’s lost her money, her property, her jewels, everything. She’s wiped out.”And yet the central mystery at the heart of the case – was it suicide or murder? – remains frustratingly out of reach. “The reason it hooks people in is because, if you pull a thread, more seem to come out,” says Damon. “There were things we just kept chasing, like a mercenary who we planned to meet, and he stood us up.”“John is forever fascinating,” adds Milligan. “So is Ann. They tried so hard to create something beautiful, and do something good. What stays with you is how it all went wrong.”To varying degrees, Vaughn, Milligan and Damon have been plunged into the core of a mystery that looks as if it will never be solved. With all the insight they have, do they have any suspicions of what the truth might be?“That’s what’s tormented me because I can’t honestly say what happened that night, and I’ve read everything that can be read about it,” says Vaughn. “When I visited Ann in jail, I found a woman so not playing with a full deck of cards that I didn’t even ask her, because I don’t think she knows. I honestly don’t think even she knew what happened that night.”“I almost always return to the key things that jump out,” says Damon. “Both of them were mentally really unwell, so it was a pressure cooker. I think it’s strange that he had a gun. It’s also very strange that he had his earplugs in. The details are strange and bizarre.”“There are so many details where you can say, ‘Oh, this means that, and that means this,’ but no, it doesn’t,” says Milligan. “You go backwards and forwards, yo-yoing all over the place. Maybe we will never know. Let’s just tell the story and talk about the love, the tragedy and the paradise they tried to create. That is their legacy.”Hell in Heaven is available on 9 October, wherever you get your podcastsExplore more on these topicsPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of The Celebrity Traitors, we head to Ardross Castle for the inside scoop on what it’s really like to sit at the round tableElle HuntWed 8 Oct 2025 05.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 10.21 EDTShareAll I can hear, above my thunderous heartbeat, is thestomp … stomp … stompof Claudia Winkleman’s boots as she approaches the round table to determine my fate. It sounds as if she is treading unevenly, maybe even skipping slightly, to throw us off – but maybe that’s just my nerves, fraying by the second.I became a fan ofThe Traitorswith the first UK season in 2022. I’ve since watched as many of the 30 international adaptations of the (originally Dutch) format as I’ve been able to track down. Though I know better than to apply myself, I’ve naturally debated whether I’d want to play as a Faithful, tasked with flushing the Traitors out; or a Traitor, with more control but vulnerable to backstabbing. Now, I’m going to find out.Ahead of the BBC’s first celebrity season, a small group of journalists have been invited to the Scottish Highlands, to go behind the scenes and – the real sweetener – play a game overseen by Winkleman herself.Ardross Castle is a 19th-century, privately-owned mansion, a 30-minute drive from Inverness. For most of the year it’s a wedding venue, but since 2022 it’s been booked up for three to four months for Traitors business.Even the tree-lined drive leading up to the castle is instantly familiar from the players’ conspiratorial convoys to and from the challenges off-site. Our minivan falls into jittery silence, at odds with the serene parkland.We pull up beside a line of foreboding black 4X4s with TRAITORS numberplates. Any semblance of journalistic neutrality is flung off like a Traitor’s cloak as we pile out of the van, emitting squeals of delight.To the left are the formal gardens, featuring the fire pit where the last players standing cast their final votes, and the bush into which UK season three fan favourite Alexander famously careened.To the right is the terrace, looking out over verdant rolling hills, where players convene to forge alliances. I can even hear the caw of the resident peacocks. “They always go to the catering tent,” executive producer Mike Cotton tells me.The castle is a hive of activity as the production team – having just wrapped The Celebrity Traitors – prepare for a fresh batch of civilian players. At this very moment, they are meeting each other for the first time, being filmed on the train for the first episode of season four.Tomorrow they will descend upon the castle, and a select few will be shoulder-tapped to be Traitors by Winkleman at the first round table. Today, however, it’s our turn.We’re led into the breakfast room to find the table laden with the same spread laid on for those players who survive each night: pastries, deli meats, dried fruit, some cupcakes. Watching at home, I’ve always thought it looked somewhat wooden, but I take a plate, hoping to settle my nerves, and sit down with my fellow players.We size each other up. Our professional headshots are framed and mounted on the wall just like the contestants’ on the show, reminding us of the treachery to come.View image in fullscreenClaudia Winkleman and Elle Hunt with the giant, gleaming pile of gold AKA the prize pot.Photograph: Ruth Roxanne Board / BBC“It’s all friendly now,” says one man darkly, between bites of ham.We continue on our castle tour to the library, where players gather their allies for cosy chats, and the billiards room, wallpapered in tartan, where Winkleman conducts her interviews, which is a secret room – concealed behind a bookcase in the bar.I’m more surprised to find the bar stocked with real booze, including mini bottles of wine and a brandy decanter. Cotton won’t be drawn on the rules for contestants, saying only that there are limits and they’ve “never had an incident” with drunkenness.Paintings throughout, of skulls and cloaked figures, aren’t just spooky set dressing: they conceal mirrors that would otherwise reflect cameras. More cameras are integrated within the set, such as in the roundtable room: the castle’s Great Hall, made smaller with extra panelled walls, enables crews to move around undetected.The table’s centrepiece conceals a camera and rotates like a lazy Susan, capturing players’ fleeting reactions. The goal is to create as immersive an experience as possible, to encourage the players to live the game. The groundwork is laid with casting, says Sarah Fay, another executive producer: “We want people who purely want to play the game.”They are sorted into Faithfuls or Traitors based on what they say in their interviews with Winkleman and players’ individual preferences – if only to avoid an apathetic villain. “You’ve got to want to be a Traitor,” says Cotton.View image in fullscreen‘We still can’t believe we got Stephen Fry to come to the castle’ … the star in The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryOnce roles are assigned, producers let the action unfurl. Only the challenges and certain set-pieces, such as the“death match”card game from last season, and season two’s funeral, are prepared in advance, says Cotton. “We’re really hands-off … Once we’ve set it up, we just let them go.”Players sleep off-site and are kept apart when not on set, but are otherwise free to roam the castle. Cotton shakes his head exasperatedly, recalling their frequently futile attempts to find a private corner to scheme: “I often think: ‘Just go outside!’”There was no special treatment for The Celebrity Traitors –despite the big nameson the cast, among them Stephen Fry, Charlotte Church, Tom Daley, Jonathan Ross and Alan Carr.Some were approached to take part, but there is such buzz around the series, “there were some people who did come to us,” says Cotton. (He won’t name names – but Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York,reportedlydeclined an offer.) “We still can’t believe we got Stephen Fry to come to the castle,” adds Fay.The only difference from the civilian series, they say, is that the celebrities had their public personas and in some cases preexisting relationships to play with, creating more opportunities for subterfuge. “I don’t know what beasts lie within me,” muses Fryin the show’s first trailer.“It’s designed to be psychologically intense,” says Cotton. The entire production is set up to minimise interactions with the contestants, lest they risk giving a Traitor away. Their only regular connection on-set is with the welfare team, with whom they meet twice daily.“The cast are looking for clues all the time … who we interview; how long we interview them for,” says Cotton. The worst-case scenario, Fay adds, would be for a production slip-up to be brought up at the round table as evidence. “We shouldn’t ever be a player in the game.”They are summoned to the nightly round table remotely, by a song – The Hanging Tree, the theme from The Hunger Games films – playing through the castle.The Big Brother-style “diary room”, where players record their bits to camera, is also unmanned. Just outside, he points out a grille in the ground: the dungeon, where players were held during a season-two challenge – I can glimpse the dingy cell beneath my feet.The producers didn’t even know it existed during season one, Cotton tells us. He is more vague about the location of the “Traitors’ tower”, no doubt wanting to keep some secrets back – rumour has it, it’s closer to ground level (and potentially not even at the castle).Cotton has also heard the speculation online that the roundtable room is deliberately kept cold, so tempers run hot. “It’s just a big castle – it’s really hard to heat!” he says.All this reflects the frenzy surrounding the show. About300,000 people appliedto take part in series three, v just 20,000 for the first.Last season, the Faithfuls were fixated on the Traitors likely being predominantly women after criticism of the “boys’ club” of season two. (They were right.) Cotton denies that it was a deliberate course-correction – but you can see why the players would come to that conclusion, having so little else to go on.Now it’s my turn, as “ah-yoo, ah-yoo” sounds through the castle: The Hunger Games song, summoning us to the round table. One of our group instantly has to go for a nervous pee.On our way into the Great Hall, we pass the gleaming pile of gold coins – the prize pot – take our seats and don our blindfolds.View image in fullscreen‘I feel a stab of disappointment not to be chosen’ … Elle at the iconic round table.Photograph: Ruth Roxanne Board / BBCI have rarely ever felt so nervous nor, as Winkleman’s footsteps draw closer, so ambivalent. My assumption has always been that I’d make a great Traitor – and that I’d immediately be targeted, even as a Faithful, for my resting bitch face. Do I want to feel her tap my shoulder?But Winkleman stomps on past; I feel a brief stab of disappointment not to be chosen.We remove our blindfolds, blinking at each other. The room is cold but my face feels hot; I’m acutely conscious that I have literally nothing to go on.Winkleman, watching over us with her Mona-Lisa smile, asks that we address each other one by one with the magic words: “I’m 100% Faithful.”One journalist jumps on another’s intonation, finding it suspiciously at odds with his breezy demeanour earlier. The rest of us are only too happy to vote him out – and he admits he’s a Traitor. (He also happens to work for the Sun.)The response among us Faithfuls is instantaneous, as though we’ve been electrified by the table. The flood of relief is accompanied by a confidence boost. Maybe we’re great at this!Another Traitor remains. Not wanting to stay silent, I start talking. With far more conviction than I feel, I argue that I heard rustling to my left, singling out another woman, the youngest at the table. She looks innocent – perhaps too innocent … Enough players are somehow persuaded that we agree to vote her out.She actuallyis100% Faithful; I feel terrible, as if I’ve shot Bambi. But before I can find out the size of the target I’ve placed upon my back, Winkleman mercifully ends the game.Some players are so eager to be selected for the dark side – she tells us, having shed her steely gameplay persona – they try to signal their enthusiasm at the first round table. “People offer their shoulders,” Winkleman says, miming an alluring shrug. (Of her own stop-start loop around the table – which she does four or five times for filming – she jokes: “Have you seen dressage?”)The producers join us, carrying a couple of Traitor’s cloaks, long and lined with green satin. The fabric is heavy, Fay jokes as she drapes it over one of my fellow Faithfuls, “so that you feel the weight on your shoulders”. I still can’t shake the sense of blood on my hands.As we pile back into the minivan, to return to civilisation, my mind goes to the people arriving tomorrow to play the game of their lives. At least now I know the role I’m best suited to: neither Traitor, nor Faithful, but watching at home.The Celebrity Traitors airs on BBC One on 8 October at 9pmExplore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Simon Evans and Debris Stevenson do not try to emulate the radical genius of that show in their adaptation. The genius here is in honouring the old rather than radical reinvention.Their modern-language script distils the spirit of Rostand’s drama, set in the French golden age, albeit in the midst of war. The heart and poetry is all here, and the sincerity too, which sometimes spills into schmaltz (for example, a silently smiling child Cyrano roams through the production to tug at our heart-strings). But it is all underpinned with emotional authenticity and neat, quipping wit.View image in fullscreenHonest intelligence … Levi Brown as Christian  in Cyrano de Bergerac.Photograph: Marc BrennerIts biggest highlight is Adrian Lester’s Cyrano, who gives this production its sublimely wounded soul. He plays the Gallic nobleman, soldier and poet with a perfect balance of braggadocio, gruffness and closely-guarded vulnerability; you believe all his torments, forgive every deceit. Lester wears a large prosthetic proboscis as he channels his tortured love for Roxane (Susannah Fielding) through handsome young soldier Christian (Levi Brown) and it gives him an old-school, slightly comic aspect.There is plenty of musketeer-style sword-play and entertaining humour, all the bolder and fresher in modern language, while Grace Smart’s set mixes 17th-century elements with a timeless expressionism. The script, aside from adding an unnecessary framing device featuring the baker, Ragueneau (Christian Patterson), tempers the grandiose Alexandrine verse of the original without removing its soaring flights of lyricism (Stevenson is a poet as well as playwright).It gives subtle new spins on each of these iconic characters, too. Cyrano is still a libertine, outsider and idealist but he is squarely an antihero now rather than the paragon of heroic masculinity. His fear of admitting his love to Roxane is generated by self-loathing, all the more pronounced here, and he bears a kind of moral grubbiness as he passes his words off as Christian’s in the love letters he obsessively writes.There is an evident class difference between him and Christian, who is yokel-like, with a Black Country accent and a love of the soil. He might be awkward with words but there is an integrity and honest intelligence about him that makes Cyrano’s violations clear: the latter is using words to woo Roxane for Christian but also taking ownership of the romance (“I have my own feelings sir,” Christian protests). Roxane, for her part, is a widow, desperate for a second chance at romance, and much more clearly in love with the poetry of love than the thing itself. “I love you,” Christian pleads, but it is not enough for her. She wants high-flown verse, rhyme, simile. Although every character’s flaws lie exposed here, they are still imbued with a humanity that makes them all likable.The staging is nifty, too. Under the direction of Evans, the over-theatricality of the play-within-the-play in the opening scene, at the Paris theatre where Cyrano makes an enemy of Comte de Guiche (Scott Handy), bleeds into the rest of the production. So Cyrano later stamps his foot to mark a sudden change in lighting and his band of musicians bring knowing winks.The playfulness sits in stark contrast to a France that is battle-worn by 20 years of war. The gunfire and thunderous bombs make the romance all the more life-affirming – an assertion of love over hate.Yet Rostand’s interrogation of love remains alongside. Is love located in the physicality of Christian himself or through its abstract expression in Cyrano’s letters? Possibly both, for Roxane. Language is not to be trusted even while being the truest reflection of passion. It is all Cyrano has until the very end, when it is words that fail this tragic wordsmith.At the Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAdrian LesterRoyal Shakespeare CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jilly visited our shop several times for signings and she was our favourite author visitor. She always spoke to all the staff, brought a gift for staff with her and always wrote us a note of thanks afterwards. Lovely with customers and just an absolute delight.Judith Denwood, retired bookseller, Hastings‘A week later, a gorgeous wooden postcard arrived’View image in fullscreenJilly Cooper’s postcard to Kitty.Photograph: Guardian CommunityI read Riders in the summer of lockdown after graduating in English from university and having moved to Putney. It reignited my love of reading for pleasure, and entirely changed my experience of living in London. Jilly Cooper’s writing is so vivid, the characters filled the lockdown drought of gossip, and her writing always brought me so much joy. I emailed her publisher’s office to say how much her writing meant to me, and how it had transformed my view of life and London to always find the fun, and they emailed back to ask for my home address as she wanted to write back (and didn’t like to use the computer).A week later, a gorgeous wooden postcard with woodland animals on the front arrived from Jilly. It meant so much to me that she’d taken the time to write back, and that a reader’s experience had meant so much to her. I’ve since read nearly all of her works, feeling lost without a Rutshire Chronicle on the go, and discovered her perceptiveness and clarity of expression in her columns in Turn Right at the Spotted Dog. Her depiction of her jury service experience is a particular favourite. Her writing always has the reader’s best intentions at heart, and reading one of her books brings a sparkle that extends beyond fiction into the reader’s real world.Kitty, Wiltshire‘She showed me one of her prized possessions’Jilly Cooper’s husband Leo was my godfather so I would meet her off and on over the years. The last visit was a long weekend in Gloucestershire in 2007 when the four of us chatted around the kitchen table until the early hours. She showed me one of her prized possessions – a signed shirt from England and Liverpool footballer Emile Heskey!Sebastian, Edinburgh‘No better quick fix for boredom, loneliness, anxiety or heartbreak’At a very low point in my then young life (1985/86), unhappy in love, broke, bereft and desperately job hunting, I bought a paperback copy of Riders on a whim, knowing very little about Jilly. I was enchanted, and spent the next few afternoons lying on the flea-ridden sofa in my shared flat reading; and when I got to the last page, I went right back to the beginning and read it all over again. Jilly Cooper’s ability to create a wholly believable fictional world, and draw readers in, has never been surpassed, and probably never will be. There’s no better quick fix for boredom, loneliness, anxiety or heartbreak than a few hours of escapism with one of Jilly Cooper’s satisfyingly weighty novels.

For a boarding school girl they provided a romantic escape and an expectation of the joy and excitement of love affairs that I hoped lay ahead. I met Jilly at a book signing in Oxford, in 1976. She was late and arrived flustered and on opening her handbag the chaos within was on display for all to see. I loved her for being like me, happily disorganised and untidy without a shred of embarrassment. She was confident enough to speak in that wonderful upper class voice with no wish to appear anything other than herself.Morag Coles, 72, retired secretary,Broadstone, Dorset‘My mother’s hero’Just yesterday I was going through a file of my late mother’s correspondence and found a series of letters between her and Jilly Cooper. My mother died in 2000, and the letters date from a few months before that when she struck up a brief pen-pal relationship with Jilly. I believe it started when she wrote to Jilly suggesting that the world of competitive gun dog trails might be a suitable subject for a book, as it contained the apparent Cooper prerequisites: animals, affairs, back-stabbing, and landed gentry. The correspondence came at a time when my mother had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer and I remember how much it cheered her up that one of her heroes took the time to reply to her.Tim, Hertfordshire‘She liked dog people’Aside from her well recognised literary talent she was also a great dog lover. I used to live in Bisley, where Dame Jilly lived for many years. If you ever met her out on a walk with her beloved dogs, you were guaranteed a cheery hello accompanied by her warm smile. As she was so famous you didn’t want to stop and chat too much. That changed, though, when I got my own dog.

The DHS also made a provocative post on X, laying another Bryan song, Revival, over footage of Ice officers arresting migrants, with the caption “we’re having an All Night Revival”.Using rhetoric that is characteristic of its public messaging during Donald Trump’s second term in office, the department is responding to a snippet of unreleased new song Bryan posted on social media earlier this week, featuring the lyrics: “I heard the cops came, cocky motherfuckers ain’t they? / And Ice is gonna come bust down your door / Try to build a house no one builds no more / Well I got a telephone / Kids are all scared and all alone”.Bryan has elaborated on the song, presumably titled The Fading of the Red White and Blue after he used those words as a caption alongside the song snippet.“This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything,” he wrote on Instagram. “When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back … Left wing or right wing we’re all one bird and American. To be clear I’m on neither of these radical sides.”The song also more generally laments discord in American society, as Bryan sings: “The middle fingers rising and it won’t stop showing / Got some bad news / The fading of the red white and blue.”Dolly Parton ‘going to be just fine’, singer’s sister says as she calls for prayers amid health problemsRead moreBryan, 29, was born to parents in the US Navy, and himself served in the Navy for eight years as a younger man, writing and uploading his earliest songs while enlisted. “I am so proud to have served in a country where we can all speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we’ve faced in the last few months!” he wrote in another message this week.Bryan self-released his debut album DeAnn in 2019, and broke through with American Heartbreak in 2022 which reached the US top five. His self-titled follow up reached No 1 in 2023, and his latest album The Great American Bar Scene reached No 2 and is certified platinum. He also topped the US singles chart in 2023 with his Kacey Musgraves duet I Remember Everything.Earlier this month he broke the record for the highest attendance at a ticketed concert in US history, with 112,408 concertgoers, beating another country star, George Strait, who who drew 110,905 to a 2024 concert. Bryan’s huge gig also broke the record for merchandise sales, shifting $5m worth of goods.Explore more on these topicsCountryIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

I truly believe in the power of prayer, and I have been lead to ask all of the world that loves her to be prayer warriors and pray with me.“She’s strong, she’s loved, and with all the prayers being lifted for her, I know in my heart she’s going to be just fine. Godspeed, my sissy Dolly. We all love you!”Dolly Parton postpones Las Vegas residency, citing ‘health challenges’Read moreFreida’s comments caused widespread concern for Parton. She later wrote a second message, saying: “I didn’t mean to scare anyone or make it sound so serious when asking for prayers for Dolly. She’s been a little under the weather, and I simply asked for prayers because I believe so strongly in the power of prayer … Thank you all for lifting her up.”Parton’s manager, Olly Rowland, said Parton had been treated for kidney stones, and added: “It looks like her sister posted, and it got quite a bit blown out of proportion.”Parton was due to begin Dolly: Live in Las Vegas, the singer’s first extended run of concerts in the city in 32 years, at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace on 4 December but it has been rescheduled for September 2026.The singer announced that she has “been dealing with some health challenges, and my doctors tell me that I must have a few procedures”.She did not give details but added light-heartedly: “As I joked with them, it must be time for my 100,000-mile checkup, although it’s not the usual trip to see my plastic surgeon!”She continued: “In all seriousness, given this, I am not going to be able to rehearse and put together the show that I want you to see, and the show that you deserve to see. You pay good money to see me perform, and I want to be at my best for you … I just need a little time to get show ready, as they say.“And don’t worry about me quittin’ the business because God hasn’t said anything about stopping yet. But, I believe He is telling me to slow down right now so I can be ready for more big adventures with all of you. I love you and thank you for understanding.”Asked about thepossibility of retirement in an interview last year, Parton told the Guardian: “Oh, my Lord, I can’t retire. I always say I’ve dreamed myself into a corner. I’ve got to keep all those dreams alive. Every dream spins off into some something else … I couldn’t retire if I wanted to. And I don’t want to.”Parton’s husband of nearly 60 years, Carl Dean,died aged 82 in March.Explore more on these topicsDolly PartonCountrynewsShareReuse this content"

Season two of the series turned away from that drab gloom and focused, with at least some sensitivity, onthe sensational trials of the Menendez Brothersin sunny California.Monster: The Ed Gein Story review – Ryan Murphy’s depravity-loving murder show is unforgivableRead moreSeason three,the Ed Gein Story, returns to midwest murk and, especially in its early episodes, makes far less of an effort to do anything other than grimly titillate. The show’s thesis makes some sense: Ed Gein, who murdered at least two people and stole the bodies of many more from their graves, was an object of intense fascination in the middle of the 20th century, his crimes serving as inspiration for Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Silence of the Lambs and, in creator Ian Brennan’s argument, other budding serial killers. Thus Monster can depict Gein’s squalid deeds in gruesome detail while also saying something big about American culture, an analysis that might justify the show’s prurient interest in Gein’s graverobbing, necrophilia and other aberrant behavior.That trick worked better in the Dahmer season, which rubbed our noses in some of the worst crimes imaginable but did so with at least the appearance of higher purpose. The Ed Gein Story spends most of its early episodes giving us pure freak show: weirdo loner Ed (Charlie Hunnam, another hunk to be gawked at) explores his fascination with women’s bodies as his hectoring mother (Laurie Metcalf) brutally shames his sexual impulses and, really, any attempt to live a life outside their moldering farm house in the middle of nowhere. It’s bleak, ugly, and wholly expected: we saw some version of this on the lugubrious Psycho prequel series Bates Motel. And we’ve seen religious-nut, harridan moms before in movies like Carrie. Monster, though, acts as if it has discovered a new trope, as if mothers have never before been blamed for their son’s ornate sexual hangups.What are those hangups, exactly? Monster’s diagnosis is complicated. Toward the end of the season, we hear the term gynophilia, which on the show is described as an erotic sexualisation of the female body so profound that a man like Gein seeks to dress himself up in a woman’s skin in order to fully possess her. That’s somewhat persuasive, as is the more fact-based assertion that Gein was schizophrenic, and thus in some way not responsible for his heinous crimes. (Gein died in a mental institution, not a prison.)And yet, the show saves its more generous, humane assessment of Gein until the end of the season; what’s come before is awfully reckless in its leering examination of gender expression. There is some editorializing happening under the show’s surface that feels awfully pointed at trans people. Which may be deliberate – in the final episodes, trans icon Christine Jorgensen (Alanna Darby) gets a chance to push back against any idea that Gein is among her cohort. Monster might be presenting this dangerous conflation only to dispel it. But it takes a long time to get to that place of nuanced understanding. There are hours and hours of the series in which gender queerness is carelessly compared with harmful deviance.This has, sadly, become a Ryan Murphy specialty. Murphy only produced the Ed Gein Story, but his authorial stamp is nonetheless all over it. It’s there in the garishly outsized performances dragged out of Metcalf and Lesley Manville (as one of Gein’s hapless victims). It’s there in every insistence that the envelope ought to be pushed that much further. And it’s perhaps most hideously present in the way the show treats Anthony Perkins (Joey Pollari), the semi-closeted star of Psycho. Murphy – in the Monster series and in other shows like the noxiousHollywood– has long strained to draw a straight, short line between queer identity and a kind of depraved self-loathing that manifests in terrible ways. One gets the sense, after years of watching Murphy-stamped product, that he is trying to drag queerness (gay men in particular) into a psychosexual torment that not all of us share. It’s troubling, and sad, and deeply frustrating.View image in fullscreenJoey Pollari and Tom Hollander in Monster: The Ed Gein Story.Photograph: NetflixPerkins did, in the rough course of his life, consult a therapist who was eventually branded a dangerous practitioner of something like “conversion therapy”. But that was much later in his life, not when he was filming Psycho, as Monster suggests. And it’s grossly unfair to suggest that Perkins, bedeviled as he might have been, felt some sort of dark allegiance or kinship with a man who raped dead bodies and wore women’s skin like a suit simply because Perkins struggled with his sexual orientation. This is what results when a show tries to launder its baser impulses – its deep interest in gore and psychological anguish – in ersatz sociology.The Perkins stuff is only one of myriad examples of Monster’s flagrant contortions of the historical record. Plenty on the show is flat-out made-up, lies that are then waved away with the assertion that much of what happens on the series is only happening in Gein’s mind. That’s interesting to a point – some of the show’s fantasy is alluringly dreadful, even poignant – but the technique fails when it becomes mere excuse to show us ever more terrible events. Why must we see serial killer Ted Bundy, who had no material connection to Gein, kidnap and torture two women in the final episode of the season? The show tries to culturally tether Gein to Bundy, but it does not sell its tenuous argument. It’s not unlike the wholly unnecessary scene at the end of the Dahmer series in which we are, for some miserable reason, dropped in on John Wayne Gacy as he abducts a boy he will later murder. Both instances are gratuitous pilings-on, and yet are presented as wise considerations of the serial killer continuum, the interconnectedness of all acts of horror.That is, after all, the Monster series’ ultimate assertion: that we live in a sick, sad world and thus should be shown the sick, sad things that happen in it. Maybe there is some value in that. Though, one wishes that Murphy and Brennan and all else involved in this dubious project would be honest about what interests them. If they want to revel in the blood and muck of American life, so be it. Plenty of people will happily hop into the gunk with them. But it’s rather galling to cloak that indecent fascination in pseudo-academic analysis. It’s possible that the Ed Gein Story clumsily grasps for higher meaning simply because it has to fill eight hours of programming. And yet it’s hard not to see a more sinister, self-exonerating motivation behind it. Whatever the reason, the end product is crass where it tries to be elegant, exploitative where it plays at compassion. At least Gein was honest about wanting to mess around with corpses. Monster thinks, or pretends, it’s doing something much more sophisticated than that.Explore more on these topicsDramaRyan MurphyNetflixTelevisionUS televisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Should we take him seriously?Farrah JarralWed 8 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 06.51 EDTShareAt 83,Werner Herzogis a living legend who can and does do precisely what he wants.Like the strange, enchanting films for which he is best known, Herzog’s seventh book defies the usual conventions of structure, narrative arc and the delineation of fact from fiction, even as it addresses the very subject of truth.This slim volume sets out Herzog’s views on truth in a world where technologically enhanced falsehoods proliferate. These appear to be an elaboration of Herzog’sMinnesota Declaration, the 12 statements he made in 1999 at the Walker Art Centre in Minneapolis. Much like the declaration, The Future of Truth contains strong, gnomic opinions which include despising cinéma vérité because it obscures more than it illuminates, as well as a plethora of surprising sentences such as “rather die than wear a toupee”.Two principles are central to Herzog’s idea of truth. First is the notion that seeking truth is a greater goal than finding it. As he puts it, “the quest itself, bringing us nearer to the unrevealed truth, allows us to participate in something inherently unattainable, which is truth”. The second is that bare facts can provide little more than a boring “accountant’s truth” that is less useful than what he calls “ecstatic truth” in helping people understand what’s really going on in life.If anyone else had written The Future of Truth, I suspect they would come under critical fire for taking the piss out of the readerIt’s like listening to a fireside monologue from an entertaining uncle. The weirdest and most compelling tale, among some stiff competition, is the story of the Palermo pig. Once upon a time, according to Herzog,a pig got stuck down a straight-sided sewage pipe in Palermo, Sicily. It remained wedged in there for years,surviving on scraps of food thrown down to it.Eventually the pig took on the shape of its container. It became a kind of translucent block, “ghostly pale … wobbly as a great hunk of Jello”, taking in nourishment from above, ejecting waste below.Herzog uses this story as an allegory, linking the Palermo pig to the perils of long-distance space exploration. Should humankind embark on a voyage to our nearest habitable planet, it would take centuries. During this time Herzog envisages the intrepid travellers would be forced to inbreed, becoming “mutants” with no comprehension of the purpose of their mission. Eventually the astronauts would morph into pale, maggot-like beings rather like the Palermo pig, capable of little more than eating and shitting.This morbidly fascinating and unintentionally hilarious handbrake turn from Sicilian sewers to space mutants offers a lesson in Herzog’s concept of ecstatic truth. Because, as I discovered to my dismay after spending quite some time trying to track down any record of this intriguing and biologically implausible cuboid swine, the Palermo pig appears to be apocryphal. I had been pursuing the miserly “accountant’struth”, a reality grounded in mere facts. What did it matter whether an incarcerated Sicilian farm animalactuallyturned into a quivering square jelly? The real point of Herzog’s story suddenly hit home: penning animals into small spaces for long periods is unwise and creates monsters.If anyone else had written The Future of Truth, I suspect they would come under critical fire for odd choices in structure, rambling, contradictory statements, and, to put it bluntly, taking the piss out of the reader. After all, Herzog devotes five whole pages to the histrionic plot of an opera just to demonstrate that when art forms contain concentrated, intense emotion, we “invest this preposterous kernel with the full array of our own feeling, so that it seems mysteriously genuine”. However, because this book is a collection of uniquely Herzogian mindfarts, it resists a panning. Michael Hofmann’s sparkling and inventive translation from the original German – a crypto-zoologist is described as “a ham sandwich short of a picnic” – somehow makes Herzog more Herzog in tone.While much of the The Future of Truth will be familiar from his previous books, films and interviews, one relatively new element is his meditation on deepfakes. Herzog refers more than once to anAI-generated perpetual conversationbetween fake audio versions of himself and Slavoj Žižek online. Since his own methods of getting at ecstatic truth have included inventing quotes by famous figures and casting actors in his documentaries, there is a risk of hypocrisy. The distinction, he argues, is that an intelligent mind would be reasonably able to discern lies in older forms of media, while AI is so new and so powerful that our ability to identify them is seriously impaired. “We have grown up with radio and photography.

It’s certainly not social, though quizzes are not a solitary pastime per se, hence the popularity of Trivial Pursuit; I like to brag about having once won the French version – against French people! – but am less keen to be reminded of that time I humiliated myself at my sister’s local pub quiz by expecting to ace the round on 1980s cinema, only for most of the questions to be aboutThe Goonies, which I have never seen.Naturally, when I was asked if I would like to help set questions for a Guardian film quiz, I jumped at it. This should be a doddle, I thought, a useful way of utilising a memory that can dredge up petty details from obscure 1980s slasher movies while increasingly forgetting where I left my specs five minutes ago. For a blissful period I conjured variations on “Name a vampire movie starring Lucy Liu”, or “Name a film in which Oliver Reed played a priest”. Alas, none of that malarkey quite worked in a system that didn’t recognise descriptors such as “film noir”, “superhero” or “adapted from a work of 19th-century French literature”.I filled notebooks with lists (my favourite thing!), and devised a filing-card strategy that was probably much too sophisticated for its main purpose, which was to preventAdam Driverfrom popping up again and again and again. From the outset I was determined to include as much diversity as possible, and also wanted to dip back into the past, but combining these two aims was sometimes tricky. Apart from, say,Sidney Poitierand Toshiro Mifune, how many prominent non-white film actors can you name from the 1950s?View image in fullscreenMartin Luther King Jr stands next to Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier and which other figure in this 1960 photograph?Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesMy earliest sample questions were impossibly hard. I know this because only a few weeks later I had trouble answering them myself. Name a film in which Emily Blunt appeared with Brendan Gleeson, anybody? A western starring Marilyn Monroe? Making the quizzes easier, but not too easy, turned out to be easier said than done. But I’m finally getting there, I hope.I try to convince myself that playing quizzes and word games helps stave off dementia, though I suspect it’s more a form of procrastination, postponing the moment where one must finally start work, tidy the flat or go to sleep. But so long as your brain is engaged in trying to solve a puzzle, you can forget the horrible headlines, your bank balance, global warming and so on, if only for a few precious moments. So please have a go. Polite feedback welcome.

George Lucas really missed a trickStuart HeritageWed 8 Oct 2025 06.43 EDTLast modified on Wed 8 Oct 2025 12.05 EDTShareTheStar Warsprequels were not particularly enjoyable to sit through. All the matinee adventure serial action of the first three films were gone, replaced by long scenes about impenetrable galactic taxation systems, as performed by characters that seemed to have been designed purely for their potential to sell toys.So bad were the prequels in fact, that realistically there is only one thing that could have possibly improved them. Of course, I am talking about the sight of Ray Winstone tearing around the set in a silly costume, drunk off his face. Only now do we understand how close this came to be.Talking to Far Outrecently, Winstone revealed that he auditioned for the part of Ruwee Naberrie, the father of Padmé Amidala, inStar Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. And he would have got it, too, except for the fact that he turned up a little worse for wear. Or, as Winstone puts it, he was “pissed” and things “didn’t go well”.In Winstone’s telling of the story, he rocked up to the audition having been up all night drinking, and immediately realised that he was “wrong for the part”. To make matters worse, Winstone claims thatGeorge Lucasyawned throughout the duration of the audition, prompting Winstone to declare “Why don’t we both have a 15-minute sleep and then I’ll fuck off?”In the end the role went to the storied Australian actor Graeme Blundell, whose scenes ended up being deleted anyway. But would this have been the case had Lucas been brave enough to do the right thing and redrawn Naberrie as a hoarse, red-eyed, slurring cockney? Obviously not.View image in fullscreenMissing something … Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.Photograph: Lucasfilm/AllstarYou have to remember that we’re talking about the Winstone of the early 00s here. Today he is best known for sleepwalking through television commercials for gambling sites and delivering legendarily inept Russian accents in forgettable Marvel films. But the Winstone of a quarter of a century ago was a fearsome presence indeed. This was the Winstone who had made Sexy Beast in 2000, and Nil By Mouth three years before that.Imagine what that Winstone could have done with Star Wars. Far from being a side character so forgettable that people didn’t even notice when he briefly turned up in Episode III, Naberrie could have ended up being the undisputed king of the galaxy. He could have sauntered around outer space without a top on, sunburned and blistered from overexposure to the yellow sun of Naboo. He would have almost certainly called Anakin Skywalker the C-word.And, clearly, given Disney’s current obsession with giving every imaginable Star Wars character their own spin-off series, Winstone’s Naberrie would have enjoyed a life that stretched far beyond the prequels. Chances are, had the audition gone his way, then we’d currently be in the middle of an entire Mandalorian-style franchise about a 70-year-old Naberrie roaming the wilds of the galaxy, stinking of whisky and chips, head-butting a ton of stormtroopers. His series would be called Ruwee Naberrie: Have It You Fanny, and it would be the best television show ever made.But it wasn’t to be. At least the tale does have a somewhat happy ending, though. Despite missing the chance to turn a minor Star Wars character into an aggressively dribbling drunkard, Winstone did eventually get the chance to work with Lucas, in the role of George McHale in the film where Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion by hiding in a fridge.View image in fullscreenRay Winstone and Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.Photograph: David James/Paramount Pictures/ReutersWinstone says that his casting in that film might be down to the fact that Lucas “didn’t remember” his drunk Star Wars audition. But perhaps he did. Perhaps this was his attempt to correct a historic wrong. And if that’s the case, then it still isn’t too late to act on it.Because, if Lucas is known for anything at all, it’s for tinkering with his films long after they’ve been released. Who’s to say that, right now, he isn’t sat in an editing bay in Nicasio, painstakingly grafting CGI footage of a drunk Winstone into the background of every single shot of the Star Wars films? Winstone stumbling around on the Death Star. Winstone vomiting down himself as he does a loop the loop in an X-Wing. Winstone trying to hump the back of R2-D2’s head. This is the version of Star Wars that the world deserves, and it cannot come quickly enough.Explore more on these topicsRay WinstoneStar Wars: Attack of the ClonesGeorge LucasFilm industryStar WarsScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Film-maker Myrid Carten, who holds the camera much of the time as well as directing, exposes here the open wound that is her relationship with her mother Nuala, who has both bipolar disorder and alcoholism. Nuala often goes missing on binges, and as the film opens we hear Myrid telling someone on the phone how she just spotted her mother on a Belfast street in a total state, but recognisable because of the glamorous high-heeled shoes she was wearing.You’d struggle to realise this is the same woman we see in news footage from years earlier: soignée, composed and described as a social worker who has written a guidance paper for police on how to handle victims of domestic abuse. The Nuala of the present, when sober, is still articulate, empathic and insightful at times – it’s just that she can’t stop herself from hitting the red wine hard, an addiction that similarly affects one of her brothers. Families, eh?Nuala gave Myrid a camcorder when she was a teenager and, a natural archivist as well as instinctive film-maker, she seems to have kept everything. That includes footage of kids in her class, about nine or 10 years old at the time, acting out little dramas of drunken adults rowing with their spouses. Later we see footage of teenage Myrid and another girl (her sister?) acting out a psychodrama cribbed from the antics of Nuala and other family members. It all escalates until we get an extraordinary spell where Nuala effectively plays herself for the camera, lying like a corpse in a road at night, resplendent and ridiculous in her rabbit-fur jacket. Later, Myrid lip-syncs to recordings of Nuala talking, a device reminiscent ofClio Barnard’s The Arborwhich, like this, offers a searing examination on generational abuse and guilt.If A Want in Her has a flaw it could do with a bit more in the way of narrative progression, a teleological shape that drives the story forward. That said, at least it offers some sense of closure, sealed with a powerful montage set to a propulsive folk performance.A Want in Her is in UK and Irish cinemas from 10 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBipolar disorderAlcoholismNorthern IrelandIrelandAlcoholreviewsShareReuse this content"

(This includes Leeds supporters, many of whom in this film’s opening sequence appear to be completely unaware of its ever having taken place – let alone know the result.) The game, of course, was notoriously won by Bayern, after a disallowed goal and a couple of what you might think were nailed-on penalty claims.Director-producer Harvey Marcus previously gave usWaterloo Sunset, an amiable study of social housing in central London, and this – while similarly low-budget – is very much a change of pace. It is a furious supporter’s-eye view of the action, with many of the diehard Leeds fans still burning with rage about it all. The words “cheated”, “robbed” and “corrupt” are thrown about, though nobody (wisely) makes these claims against Bayern, preferring to focus their ire against referee Michel Kitabdjian (who died in 2020).The fans’ anecdotes are augmented by a couple of heavyweight player interviews: Paul Reaney, still combative and fairly scary as he reaches his ninth decade, and the somewhat more emollient Allan Clarke, still apparently devastated at not being given a pen after Franz Beckenbauer took him out. Sadly, a good number of their teammates are no longer with us; nor, of course, is Don Revie, who built the side in the mid-1960s before abruptly departing for the England manager’s job before the 1974-75 season started. And while the game itself may no longer be lodged in the wider public’s brain, The Damned United, bothbookandfilm, have made sure that the early-70s-vintage Leeds side, and their scrap with Revie’s immediate successor Brian Clough, has passed into sporting legend – though without acknowledging their footballing excellence as much as, shall we say, their enthusiasm for getting stuck in.Marcus’s film uses actual TV footage of the game very sparingly, for fair-use budgetary reasons no doubt, and padding out the visuals with lots of endearingly wobbly cine footage presumably shot by supporters in the stands. And while there’s little objective analysis of what else might have been a factor in the outcome – the Bayern team, after all, contained the spine of the West German side that had won the World Cup the year before – this film is a valuable piece of football archaeology, exposing a culture of fans’ closeness to the players that has long since vanished.Paris 75 is atBrewery Arts Centre, KendalandReel, Wakefieldon 10 October, then tours.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLeeds UnitedBayern MunichreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not so for Common/Wealth’s Demand the Impossible. Described as part-performance, part-punk gig and part-sensory experience, this is a striking work.Structured around Taylor Edmond’s text of short episodic monologues, it resists an easy poeticism, instead focusing on the objectively descriptive. This is of the everyday, where injustice occurs around the peeling of apples, the making of sandwiches and the eating of crisps. Threading together the narratives of a Black Lives Matter activist, a blacklisted construction worker and an environmental campaigner, its characters have all been directly affected by police violence and undercover operations, the latter explicitly – as a victim of the spycops scandal. They’re played by Bianca Ali, Soul Roberts and Hussina Raja respectively, and there’s a smart frisson in how these well-known stories are articulated through everyday details before becoming symbolic of other lives ruined by state violence.‘We wanted to tell the wider story’: play highlights impact of ‘spycops’ scandalRead moreUnder Rhiannon White’s direction, the production is perfectly calibrated. Set almost entirely to music performed live by Ollie Emanuel, Ruari Floyd and Jassen Summogum, it has an accumulative and sometimes almost oppressive power. One imagines this is the point. Performers are surveilled and, in a space designed by Nathaniel Mason, Studio of Mark Gubb and Andy Purves, both they and the audience are illuminated by projected live images, as if only through narrating oppression might it be rendered visible.These individual transgressions accumulate into a catalogue of injustices, individual texts into a polyphony of voices. Throughout, it simmers with an indignant rage at the obscene scale of such abuses and particularly at their insidiousness. Beyond the targeting and ruining of individual lives, it draws attention to the manner in which family and home, and even love itself, is weaponised by the state.The real world continues to rumble on outside. But at a time when legitimate protest (and repeated protest) is increasingly criminalised, the mere affirmation of activism feels significant, dramatised or not. This is potent and urgent theatre.At Corn Exchange, Newport, until 13 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Despite this, Perry is still a much-loved star in many camps, with her own brand of kooky iconography adopted by her fans tonight –like J-Lo at the 2019 Met Gala, I also run into a woman dressed up as a burger in the venue toilets. The tour is not the disaster that some have reported, but it does suffer from Perry not allowing herself to have as much fun as her audience are having.The show starts with a video setting up a convoluted storyline: a video game about Perry trying to save the world by rescuing stolen butterflies from AI overlords. This good v evil story would be more effective if Perry’s visuals didn’t share such an AI-style aesthetic. After a stilted start with 143 single Artificial, Perry settles into the show with 2013 single Dark Horse. Its high drama is an early highlight, with Perry shouting “I’m a Scorpio bitch!” over its deep womp-womp beats.It’s clear that Perry is most at ease when she lets the hits speak for themselves, but too often we’re distracted by the frankly excessive visuals and staging. During the maligned singleWoman’s World– which is much more fun and silly in a live setting – she’s surrounded by hunks draping themselves over scaffolding, but plays second fiddle to a blow-up statue that takes the attention away from her entrance. She’s almost constantly doing far too much: hanging off props, spinning upside down, and wearing a glove that shoots fireworks.View image in fullscreenDystopian narrative … Perry battles her foes.Photograph: Martin Grimes/Getty ImagesShe loosens up for a run of California Gurls, Teenage Dream and Hot N Cold, proving she doesn’t need a theme park’s worth of apparatus and fireworks when she has an intimidating imperial phase to fall back on. This infectious attitude infuses 143 tracks Crush and Nirvana, but the momentum is cut short for another costume change, another convoluted video, some more extraneous dystopian narrative. During Part of Me and Rise she battles dancers with shields, and her projected image has an overlaid target – the defiant multimillionaire against her feeble critics – yet when she breaks away to sing alone, she displays more energy and charisma than she has had all night. She’s at her most natural playing The One That Got Away in a cute Josie and the Pussycats-esque setup with her keyboardist and guitarist, chatting in a chaotic but charming way to fans and getting a few up on stage.This quiet(er) moment aside, watching the show is akin to being an overstimulated, sugar-loaded child. It’s not surprising that a large percentage of the audience are young children, brought along by millennial parents who grew up with Perry’s music. Her candy-coloured nudge-wink aesthetic does adapt well to children’s entertainment – if only she had the confidence in the strength of her best material to allow it to speak for itself, then Lifetimes could be better enjoyed by people of all ages and attention spans.Katy Perryplays AO Arena, Manchester, on 8 October; Utilita Arena, Sheffield, on 10 October; Utilita Arena, Birmingham, on 11 October; and the O2, London, on 13 and 14 OctoberExplore more on these topicsKaty PerryPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Veljo Tormis, Ester Mägi and Erkki-Sven Tüür are just the tip of the iceberg, whileArvo Pärt, 90 this yearand the subject of this celebratory concert, regularly tops lists of the world’s most popular composers. Who better, then, to present his work than two of the country’s finest ensembles: the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir.Tõnu Kaljuste, who founded both, led authoritative performances, opening with an unusually impassioned account of the austerely meditative Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten. String players leant into hypnotic musical lines urged on by the conductor’s’s fluttering left hand. Fratres received similarly insistent treatment,Harry Traksmann’s solo violin performing death-defying variations over orchestral iterations of the work’s modal melody.Mägi’s defiantly tonal Vesper tapped into a similar vein of hopeful simplicity.Two substantial works demonstrated the choir’s preeminence in this music. Written in 2009,Adam’s Lamentexplores the father of humanity’s anguish following the expulsion from paradise. The music seems to hang its head one moment before bursting out in wodges of adjacent harmonies the next. Basses and tenors were especially powerful in a confident and disciplined reading.View image in fullscreen‘Holding the audience spellbound’: soprano Maria Listra with conductor Tõnu Kaljust perform at the Barbican.Photograph: Mark AllanThe masterly Te Deum was composed in 1984 for three choirs, strings, prepared piano and wind harp (here represented by an electronic wash). Some of its reverberatory resonance was lost in the dry acoustic, the piano sounded tame, and the choirs could have been better separated for spatial effects. Nevertheless, committed singing ensured the sinuous medieval lines and pungent harmonies worked their magic.The London premiere of L’abbé Agathon, a haunting tale of a hermit put to the test by a leper who turns out to be an angel, was a chance to hear a different side of a composer rarely credited as a musical dramatist. Trudging strings conjured a desert trek and pizzicatos a bustling market, with biting dissonances accompanying the needy outcast. Maria Listra held the audience spellbound throughout, her ethereal soprano spiralling higher and higher as the divine messenger disappeared into the heavens.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicArvo PärtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Focusing on individual artists and on various artists’ groups, it attempts a history of movements and of alliances in a country that has been both factionalised and divided by language and belief, religious and ethnic divisions, by the traumas of colonisation and of civil war. The sweep of Nigerian history, even over the past century or so, is too big and too complicated to be charted through the lens of the country’s art. What can modernism possibly mean here, especially from our position at the end of the first quarter of the 21st century?European-style academic portraiture, including paintings by Aina Onabolu (one of the few women here) and by Akinola Lasekan, who also depicted Yoruba acrobatic dancers and mythic scenes, jostle with a pair of 1910-14 carved wooden door panels, depicting a British officer, carried in some sort of sedan chair, with shackled prisoners carrying his possessions, to be received by the Ogoga – or king – of Ikere. The officer looks, inadvertently, like a little homunculus on a bier. Nearby photographs, by Jonathan Adagogo Green, one of Africa’s first professional photographers, show the king of Benin, deposed in thebrutal invasion of Benin City in 1897, shackled on board a British yacht, on his way into exile. The photographer is complicit in this scene, and in others where he was hired to photograph similarly deposed local rulers, dressed in all their finery.View image in fullscreen‘Africa’s first art star’ … The Dancer (Agbogho Mmuo - Maiden Spirit Mask) 1962 by Ben Enwonwu.Photograph: Ben Enwonwu Foundation, courtesy Ben Uri Gallery & MuseumAll this is so much scene-setting. We jump to Ben Enwonwu (1917-94), who was described by the late curator and critic Okwui Enwezor as “arguably Africa’s first art star”. His tall, carved figures, commissioned by the Daily Mirror in 1960, the year of Nigerian independence, are a group of men and women reading newspapers, which seem to mysteriously transmogrify into wings. The readers are variously astonished and transfixed.Enwonwu’s career as sculptor, painter and art educator wasremarkably varied. He painted the celebration of Eid and flamboyantly costumed ritual dancers; he sculpted a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and made sinuous watercolours of silhouetted, naked dancing women, titling them Black Culture and Negritude (these, I think, have been a reference for British Nigerian artist Chris Ofili). Versions of Enwonwu’s sculpture Anyanwu, depicting an Igbo mythological figure, stand outside the Nigerian National Museum and at the UN building in New York. The small version here is in the Royal Collection. Enwonwu’s skill was, I think, mostly graphic, whatever his medium.It is also easy to get mired in the sociology of groups of artists included here, though it is probably an unavoidable rubric. In 1960 a group of rebellious art students, rejecting the limited Eurocentric curriculum they’d been taught, first formed the ZariaArtSociety – to whom a room is devoted – and moved to south-western Nigeria to co-found the Mbari Club of artists and writers alongside German publisher Ulli Beier.Aesthetics and contingency both played their part. Many of the works in this close-hung room are very much of their period. There’s a flavour of the late 1950s, many of the artists favouring a kind of semi-abstracted, often tortured figuration not so removed from the kinds of things their counterparts in the UK were doing at the time, though some had more urgency and purpose.Uche Okeke painted a monstrous bloated amphibian, and a genuinely nasty depiction of a Christian convert sacrilegiously unmasking an Igbo ceremonial dancer. Okeke’s raw and violent paintings of this time are matched by Demas Nwoko’s Nigeria in 1959 which shows three white colonial officers sitting together in great unease. Behind them loom five Nigerian soldiers, servants of the state, their faces shadowed and menacing in the gloom, Nigerian acolytes who imagined they had immense powers, whereas they had no aim and future. Until, of course, they found others to serve. The painting is like a premonition.View image in fullscreenUntitled (Mkpuk Eba) 1974 by JD ’Okhai Ojeikere.Photograph: Mkpuk Eba/TateLarge-scale photos of 1960s European modernist architecture are pasted to the wall in a section devoted to post-independence Lagos. Nearby hang a few Highlife album covers, while a playlist by DJ Peter Adjaye, is piped, too quietly, into the gallery. More could have been made of this. Meant as an evocation of cosmopolitan energy, the room itself is anything but jumping, in the same way that Tate Modern’s celebration of post-independence Lagos in its opening 2001 exhibition Century City failed to capture the city’s vitality, while also soundtracking the show with Highlife music and featuring the same photographs – by JD ’Okhai Ojeikere – of women sporting astonishingly sculptural hairstyles.We take a quick respite in the sacred groves of Osun, near Osogbo, where Austrian-born artist, Yoruba priestess and senior member of the Ogboni cult Susanne Wenger (1915-2009) worked with local craftspeople and artists for more than 40 years to restore and extend the traditional reserve of deities, and set up what is called the New Sacred Art Movement. At Tate Modern, a group of diminutive sculpted figures sit on a low, green platform against the backdrop of a black and white photograph of part of the shrine at Osun, now a Unesco World Heritage site. The overall effect is deeply underwhelming.More interesting is the work of the Oshogbo School, based in Osogbo , a melting pot of cultures and beliefs, and now a centre for the Yoruba religion. Yoruba mythology and culture were at the heart of artist and musician Twins Seven Seven’s work. This guy had a remarkable life and is owed a biography; his complex, dense paintings, peopled by spirits and ghosts and fearsome creatures are electrifying. In one etching, heaving with pattern and swarming cityscapes of the imagination, he clutches at the city entwined in his fingers. It is called In the Palm of an Architect.View image in fullscreenOur Journey 1993 by Obiora Udechukwu.Photograph: Obiora Udechukwu/ Hood Museum of ArtA reading of Come Thunder, by poet Christopher Okigbo, who died fighting as a volunteer for Biafra during a battle with Nigerian forces in 1967, fills the penultimate room of the show. “The smell of blood already floats in the lavender mist of the afternoon,” Okigbo wrote. “The death sentence lies in ambush along the corridors of power…” It is hard to listen to the verses, repeated on loop, as one goes from painting to painting, object to object.Terrors and tremors are threaded through Nigerian Modernism, along with conflicting aspirations and the mess of history. Obiora Udechukwu’s monumental and strange 1993 work Our Journey, with its little figures, gatherings and events inscribed, faintly, on an unfurling spiral of yellow paint that crosses an otherwise almost abstract swooning fields of colour, punctuated by disruptions, sheerings and symbols, is full of questions and intrigue. The drawn, the painted and the symbolic are in constant flux.View image in fullscreenStateless People: an artist with beret, 1981, by Uzo Egonu.Photograph: The estate of Uzo Egonu. Private Collection.Now in his 70s, Udechukwu is worth a room of his own here, but the final gallery is devoted to the paintings of Uzo Egonu (1931-96), who moved to the UK as a teenager. He returned to Nigeria only once, for two days, in the 1970s. Buses traverse Piccadilly Circus, as though seen in a fish-eye lens. People sit alone, reading. There’s some sort of clamour in a crowded room and people tussling with a ladder. Egonu’s paintings have an anxious sinister calm. His figures, imprisoned by geometry and oddly static, exist in a painted modernity that seems to defy any particular place or moment. The modern is inescapable. It is an oddly abrupt ending to an unfinished story.Nigerian Modernism is at Tate Modern, London, until 10 May.Explore more on these topicsArtTate ModernNigeriaPaintingSculptureTextile artAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

I firmly plant my legs, stabilising a thrashing branch with my left hand as my right snips off a bunch of grapes. Local people claim the roaring mistral wind makes you crazy, which I can appreciate as each arid gust chaps my lips and desiccates my eyes.I’m atDomaine Rouge-Bleu, an organic vineyard in the Côtes du Rhône wine region in southern France. I have volunteered forles vendanges, the autumnal grape harvest where backbreaking work is doused in camaraderie.Participating in this time-honoured tradition had long been a dream of mine, a lifelong Francophile and food writer. So, in 2017, eager to understand more about winemaking beyond the bar stool, I joined a motley crew, trading sore arms and farmer tans for a hands-on course in viticulture and viniculture. I expected to gain an oenological education. I had not anticipated how hard the picking would be – nor how gratifying it felt to accomplish something so big together. Manyvendangeursgo back for more. I have returned almost every year since my first harvest, becoming friends with the owners of Domaine Rouge-Bleu.I had not anticipated how hard the picking would be – nor how gratifying it felt to accomplish something so big togetherFrance is one of thetop producers of wine worldwide, pouring 4.78bn litres of wine into the market each year. About 59,000 winemakers manage 789,000 hectares (nearly 2m acres) of vineyards. That’s a lot of grapes to pick. Since the Greeks first planted vines in France in the sixth century BC,raisins(grapes) have been harvested by hand. Machines arrived in the 1960s for speed and cost efficiency. Yet30%-40% of French wineriesstill retain the traditionalvendanges à la main(hand-picked harvests).Why would a winemaker opt for a method that costs more time and money? Renowned regions such asChampagneare required to do so to deliver the clustersto the press house intact. Grapevines can grow too close together to allow a machine to pass through. Some winemakers believe machines harm the vines and grapes. “You get better quality by hand since you only pick good grapes, without leaves, vines or oil from the machine,” says Thomas Bertrand, who co-owns Domaine Rouge-Bleu with his Australian partner Caroline Jones.View image in fullscreenDomaine Rouge-Bleu is owned by Australian Caroline Jones and her partner Thomas Bertrand.Photograph: Alexis SteinmanThe hard-working couple illustrate the realities of winemaking that are far from the glamour of Bordeaux chateaux. They bring in volunteers to cut costs. However, harvest volunteers are a legal minefield in France. The government insists winemakers pay harvesters, so some offer room and board in lieu of wages, though many refrain from doing so to avoid any issues. Many winemakers wish volunteers were recognised, for communal harvests have been part of the winemaking heritage for centuries. “Our métier is all about sharing and creating convivial moments,” says France Breton, who welcomes volunteer harvesters atDomaine Bretonin the Loire.For example,Vignerons Indépendants de Franceruns theVendangeur d’un Jour(harvester for a day) programme across France from late August to early October. “It is wonderful for wine tourism since so many want to pitch in,” says Jean-Marie Fabre, president of the association. You can also find opportunities on volunteer work sites such asWWOOF. I contacted wineries direct via introductions by my local wine bar, eventually finding Domaine Rouge-Bleu through its former owner, whose wife runs theFrench Word-A-Dayblog.Domaine Rouge-Bleu is in Sainte-Cécile-les-Vignes, a small town of 2,900 off the tourist track, despite its location in Provence. Fittingly for the town name –vignesare vines – the flat landscape is blanketed with grids of vineyards, with Mont Ventoux, the legendary Tour de France thigh-thumper, looming in the distance. At the end of a picturesque driveway lined with olive trees, a 17th-century farmhouse is home to Thomas, Caroline and their two girls. In harvest season, it swells withvendangeurs. I hit the roommate jackpot with Hannah, a perky Brit who works at a wine shop. Our 16-person team hails from France, the UK, Ireland, Australia and the US, my homeland.Conversation inevitably flows, profound at times due to the thick vines that block our faces like confessional screensEach morning, the smell of coffee wakes us before 7am. We don clothes that we don’t mind getting dirty – grape juice stains are stubborn. Despite the heat, we wear thick socks under our boots to avoid burs scraping our ankles. Thomas gives us a lay of the land on the first day. The first rule of picking is to be gentle with the grapes. Manhandling them can break their skins prematurely, causing the oxidation that negatively affects aromas and flavours.We should also watch out for oidium, a chalky mildew, because “crap grapes make for crap wine”, says Thomas. When I find a snail on a grape, he jokes: “That’s why wine isn’t vegan.” (He jokes fluently in English.) Snipping grapes eight hours a day for three weeks wreaks havoc on the hands. Cuts are so prevalent I become the unofficial nurse of the group, carrying plasters in my bumbag. We work in pairs, bookending the vines to ensure no bunch gets left behind. To break up the monotony, conversation inevitably flows, profound at times due to the thick vines that block our faces like confessional screens. Everyone has a story – healing from a breakup or breaking free from a corporate job.View image in fullscreenHarvest time at Domaine Rouge-Bleu.Photograph: Andy HaslamThis sociability is an antidote to the demanding work: the constant ache in muscles I never knew I had; the unrelenting sweltering sun and hot wind. My skin and clothes are sticky with sweat, dirt and grape juice, my fingernails permanently painted purple. Yet, knowing our collective efforts will be bottled into delicious wine is incredibly rewarding. “There’s no feeling like people coming together for a shared mission,” says Hannah.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a freelancer weighted with managing, and finding, my own work, I appreciate having specific tasks; being told what to do; the simple choreography of snip, haul, repeat. Plus, the monotony is broken up by the varied terrain.Terroir, the buzzword that rolls off sommeliers’ tongues, refers to the soil, climate and sunlight that give wine grapes their distinctive character. I get a crash course on Rouge-Bleu’s 12 hectares planted with 21 grape varietals. Stooped low like elderly ladies, the 115-year-old grenache gobelet vines are planted in an ancient riverbed of large white stones. While these heat-retaininggaletshelp the grenache reach peak ripeness, their uneven surface is torturous – like trying to balance in a ball pit. The trellised syrah are easier to pick, their extended branches welcoming us with open arms to gather their purple jewels.Gathering around the table for meals is a harvest highlight, a moment of conviviality that recharges our batteriesOnce we fill the trailer – emblazoned with an “In Grenache We Trust” sticker – we head back to the winery. This entails a different workout – manoeuvring hoses and vats, loading the press, shovelling grape bunches into the tank. “We keep their stems to reduce heat buildup during fermentation, which leads to the jammy flavours we don’t want,” says Caroline. I appreciate her red wines even more with this knowledge. My favourite task is climbing into the press to stomp out every last drop of juice.View image in fullscreenGrape expectations … about 4 tonnes of fruit are harvested by hand in a morning.Photograph: Andy HaslamThe drudgery is lessened as we toast the day’s end with craft beers from a friend’s Alpine brewery. “It takes a lot of beer to make good wine,” is a common harvest adage that Thomas repeats. Gathering around the table for meals is a harvest highlight, a much-deserved moment of conviviality that reinforces our team spirit and recharges our batteries. Each night, a different harvester cooks a recipe of their choosing, often calorie-replenishing meals such as lasagne, grilled sausages or chickpea curry. Naturally, the meals are paired with Domaine Rouge-Bleu’s bottles, from its citrusy white Dentelle to the luscious Lunatique that bursts with blackberry notes. The most oenologically curious of us have a vertical tasting for a nightcap – by sampling the same wine from different years, we can taste how age intensifies its flavours.Just as a fine wine lingers in the mouth, participating in a wine harvest is an enduring experience. A fellow harvester, Oscar, goes so far to say: “It’s about as useful a thing a person could do.” Each time I drink wine, I taste its people, its place, its story. My time among the vines has made me truly appreciate Louis Pasteur’s words: “There is more philosophy in a bottle of wine than in all the books in the world.”Further information:Domaine Rouge-Bleu;Domaine Breton;Vendangeur d’un Jour;WWOOFExplore more on these topicsFrance holidaysWine holidaysVolunteering holidaysFood and drinkEurope holidaysWinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It opened in 2015 as a sister to thenow closed Contra, an impeccable fine-dining restaurant, and the same precision and ingenuity was applied to Wildair’s dishes, which have that perfect balance of elevated refinement and skilled execution, all combined with a casual playfulness. You can probably imagine my excitement, then, when I found out that one of my favourite dishes from one of my favourite restaurants also just happened to save waste by making an emulsion from the outer leaves of little gem lettuce cooked in butter. Pure genius.Green “mayonnaise”’ with little gem saladOnly I would say this, but finding a use for the outer leaves of a lettuce has always niggled me. They’re nature’s plastic-free wrapping that protects the lettuce inside. Composting unwanted veg scraps is zero-waste 101, and a hugely powerful practice. Turning surplus food into fertile soil, rather than a waste product that ends up in landfill (where it may release methane, a greenhouse gas about 20-30 times more harmful than Co2), is a no-brainer, and something that many of us can easily do.It’s quite radical, when you think about it: food rots and becomes the perfect soil to nourish further crops, thereby closing the loop and honouring the cycle of life. But, of course, we’re producing over 30% more food than we actually need, and using up precious and finite resources in the process. Reducing waste is worthwhile for that reason alone, not to mention the money it saves.You can cook lettuce leaves like any leafy green (seemy recipefor lettuce bag salad soup), but Wildair’s iconic recipe has a genius technique for using up the outer leaves. They’re wilted in butter, then turned into an emulsion, or “mayo”, by blending them with pistachios, which is then used to dress the rest of the lettuce for a salad. Even if you dress the salad liberally with the green mayonnaise, you’ll undoubtedly have some left over, but it keeps in the fridge for up three days and works on almost anything, from other salads to roast vegetables, grilled chicken or even drizzled over pasta or rice. I’ve adapted Wildair’s recipe a little so it works with any lettuce and nuts, and have also used a whole egg in the emulsion instead of just the yolk, to save having to find a use for the white.Serves2For the green “mayonnaise” (makes about 200g, or enough for 4-6 servings)100g butter50g outer leaves from two little gems, or other lettuce, washed and dried thoroughly20g shelled salted pistachios, or other nuts – white nuts such as pine nuts, cashews or blanched almonds will help keep the colour vivid, but anything works, really1 small whole eggFor the salad2 little gem lettuces, halved lengthwaysExtra-virgin olive oil, to tasteLemon juice, or white-wine vinegar, to taste1 small handful fresh soft herbs(eg, chives, chervil, dill or parsley), leaves picked whole, stalks finely chopped)First make the mayo. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the outer lettuce leaves, cover with a lid and cook for about a minute, stirring once or twice, until they’ve wilted. Tip into the jug of an immersion blender, add the pistachios and egg, then blend smooth; add more nuts, if need be, to give the mixture a mayonnaise-like thickness. Store in an airtight jar in the fridge for up to three days.To build the salad, drizzle each little-gem half with olive oil and lemon juice, then season generously. Dress with a tight zigzag of the green mayo, then scatter over the herbs. Arrange on two plates and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsSaladWaste notFoodFood wasteVegetablesSauces and graviesHerbs and spicesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’d kick through piles of leaves to find them, then bring them home to score and roast on the fire. I remember always burning my fingers as I tried to peel them, yet still I went back for more. To me, autumn is all about earthy flavours and a comforting sense of nostalgia. It also marks a new chapter in the kitchen, because the start of any new season is the most exciting time in a restaurant, when we get a whole new set of ingredients to work with. Today’s two first courses draw on those earthy, autumnal qualities, and work just as well for a light lunch as they do for a relaxed starter, with plenty of room for manoeuvre depending on how hungry you and your guests are.Butter bean velouté with mixed mushrooms and pickled onions (pictured top)Prep15 minPickle2 hrCook40 minServes4For the pickled onions1 small red onion, peeled300ml cider vinegar3 tbsp golden caster sugar1 tbsp salt6 black peppercornsFor the butter bean velouté700g jar large butter beans50g olive oil1 tbsp lemon juiceFinely grated zest of ½ lemonSalt and pepperFor the mushrooms50g oyster mushrooms50gshiitake mushrooms50g girollesOlive oil20g butter1 garlic clove, peeled and bashedTo serve1 tbsp pumpkin seeds1 pinchespelettepepper30g curly parsley, choppedCrispy chilli oil(optional)Finely slice the onion into rings and put them in a sieve. Put the vinegar, sugar, salt and peppercorns in a saucepan, bring to a simmer and cook for a minute, stirring so the salt and sugar dissolve. Take off the heat.Fill and boil the kettle, then pour the boiling water over the onion rings and leave to drain and cool. Once the onions are cool to the touch, pack the rings into a sterilised 500g jar, then pour over the warm pickling liquor, seal and leave to steep for at least two hours.Drain the beans, reserving all the jar liquor, and set aside a few whole beans to use as a garnish at the end. Put the rest of the beans in a blender with the olive oil, lemon juice and zest, and blitz until completely smooth; you may need to add a splash of water to achieve the smoothest consistency. Add the reserved jar liquor, season to taste and blitz again. The velouté is now ready, to be served at room temperature or gently warmed through.Wipe all the mushrooms with a damp cloth, then cut into equal-sized slices. Put a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan on a high heat, then add all the mushrooms and, after a couple of minutes, when they begin to crisp and take on a bit of colour, add the butter and garlic, and season to taste. Cook for a further couple of minutes, until the mushrooms are browned, then lift them out of the pan and spread out on a plate lined with kitchen paper, to soak up any excess water. Discard the garlic.Now to finish the dish. Toast the pumpkin seeds in a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for 12 minutes, then remove and season immediately with salt and espelette pepper. Divide the cooked mushrooms and reserved whole butter beans between four soup bowls. Pour the veloutéà tablefor a dash of wow factor, then serve topped with some pickled onions, toasted seeds and parsley. If you like, finish with a drizzle of extra olive oil or, my favourite, crispy chilli oil.Squid with padrón peppers and toasted almondsView image in fullscreenEmily Roux’s squid with padron peppers and toasted almonds.You’ll need to give the squid at least eight hours so the marinade can work its magic.Prep10 minMarinate8 hr+Cook25 minServes4For the squid and peppers500g cleaned and gutted sustainably-sourced squid12 padrón peppers1 red chilli2 tsp sesame oilZest and juice of½ lime1 tbsp finely chopped garlic1 sprig fresh thyme, leaves picked3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to finish50ml cooking sakeTo finish30g flaked almonds4 thick slices of sourdoughFinely grated zest of ½ lemon1 sprig fresh coriander, leaves picked and choppedCut the squid into triangles and put them in a bowl.
