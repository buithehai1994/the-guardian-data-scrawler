But the arrival of a new class of appetite-suppressing drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy has transformed obesity treatment into the most scientifically exciting and commercially lucrative area of healthcare.These drugs lead to dramatic weight loss, are shifting perceptions and, according to a series of results announced at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Málaga this week, promise health benefits that extend far beyond weight management.“It’s been an extraordinary week,” said Prof Susan Jebb, a public health nutrition scientist at the University of Oxford, who has been researching obesity treatments since the 1980s and who presented the findings at the ECO meeting.“Obesity has been [in the background] for so long and it’s been such a slog,” she added. “These drugs have energised the field and it has happened so fast.”Gamechanger for more than just obesityFirst developed to help lower blood sugar levels as a diabetes treatment, it was quickly apparent that Novo Nordisk’s drug semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy jabs)has a dramatic effect on weight. The drug works by mimicking a hormone, GLP-1, which is released in the gut when we eat and acts on receptors around the body, including the brain.Eli Lilly’s rival product, Mounjaro, contains the active ingredient tirzepatide. This emulates GLP-1 as well as a second hormone producing even more impressive results, according to the firsthead-to-head trialreported this week in which participants lost an average of 20% of their body weight after 72 weeks of treatment.The benefits of being at a healthy weight are substantial, withone study published in Januarysuggesting weight-loss jabs could reduce the risk of 42 diseases including heart disease, cancer, clotting disorders, Alzheimer’s, chronic kidney disease, addiction and a range of psychiatric conditions. There is early evidence that these benefits go beyond what might be expected due to the drugs’ metabolic effects.View image in fullscreenTrials have shown weight-loss jabs can reduce the risk of the onset of 42 conditions, among them cancer and cardiovascular disease.Photograph: Barry Diomede/Alamy“We absolutely know that almost every aspect of health is better if you’re a healthy weight,” said Jebb. “What we haven’t really nailed is whether those effects are independent of weight. There may be weight independent effects. My reading is that the jury is still out.”Others are already convinced. Results from a phase 3 trial of semaglutide in patients with fatty liver disease (medically known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis or MASH) found the drug could halt and even reverse the condition, which affects one in five UK adults. Most participants in the trial were obese or had diabetes, but the data revealed benefits to the liver even in those who experienced little or no weight loss.“We were able to demonstrate that there’s a weight loss contribution but that there’s a contribution that’s weight independent,” said Prof Philip Newsome, of King’s College London, who presented the findings in Málaga this week. “That’s quite interesting and exciting.”Another trialfound weight-loss jabs could almost halve the risk of obesity-related cancers, with the effects larger than would be expected from weight loss alone. And twostudiessuggested that the drugs may have mental health benefits.“Clearly if your weight improves there will be a benefit to emotional wellbeing, your self-worth, self-confidence and energy levels,” said Dr Toby Pillinger, a psychiatrist and lecturer at King’s, who authored one of the studies. But given that the drugs also appear to act on the brain’s reward system, more direct neurological effects are also plausible.“They’ve been likened to the Swiss army knife of medicines,” Pillinger said. “We are only starting to understand their effects around the body. None more so than in the changes in how our brain is functioning.”Within a few years, the drugs have transformed the landscape of metabolic medicine. Pillinger sees a similar revolution on the horizon for psychiatry, suggesting that addiction, binge-eating disorders and schizophrenia are obvious targets for future trials.What happens when you come off the drugs?The problem with diets, notoriously, is that once a person stops dieting they often regain weight. For GLP-targeting drugs, the data is patchy because pharmaceutical companies typically stop tracking people once they stop taking the medicine.Jebb and colleagues are among the first to trace this trajectory . They found rapid weight loss was followed by a rapid rebound. When people stopped taking semaglutide they regained all the weight lost within 10 months – far quicker than for behavioural interventions. “We’ve got to face up to what happens when people stop taking these drugs,” said Jebb.View image in fullscreenThe drug works by mimicking a hormone, GLP-1, which is released in the gut when we eat and acts on receptors around the body, including the brain.Photograph: Image Source/AlamyAnother obesity expert, Prof Alexander Miras, at Ulster University, said: “No one has actually given us specific numbers as to how many people this happens in, but we are estimating it to be around 95%.”Dr Martin Whyte, a consultant in diabetes at King’s College Hospital NHS trust, said it was a phenomenon he cautioned patients about. “I haven’t seen a single person who got down to a weight on GLP-1 drug, stopped it, and their weight stayed exactly the same coming off the drug,” he said.The findings do not undermine the efficacy of the drugs, experts say, but they need to be carefully considered by those paying for them and by patients considering their treatment options.“We need to face up to the costs of lifelong treatment – and these drugs are expensive,” said Jebb. “When we come to private prescriptions – and right now in the UK most people are doing this privately – people need to understand there are high risks of regaining the weight very fast when you stop. We’ve got to give people the facts.”It is an experience familiar to Anita*, 41, who is a consultant from Cambridge. She started on Mounjaro in April 2024 and continued taking the medication until December, falling from 87kg (13.7st) to 70kg.“Food has always been front and centre for me,” she said. “But when I was taking Mounjaro, my appetite was absolutely different. It was almost to the point where I couldn’t believe how much it had changed. I thought: ‘Oh, this is what normal people must feel like when they’re just not wanting to eat all the time.’”Just before Christmas 2024, Anita came off the jabs as the £225 monthly cost was proving too expensive. Three weeks into January her cravings and appetite returned. She put 7kg back on within two months.“My appetite came back as unstoppable as before,” she said. “I could not help eating junk. I craved chocolate and cheese, which was exactly what I felt before I started the jabs. It was like I had never been on them.”Anita decided to go back on Mounjaro and started on the jabs six weeks ago. This time she shopped around and now pays £150 a month.“I feel like if I can afford it I’ll probably keep on it as maintenance. If you have a drug that will help you achieve what you need, has low side effects, and it works well and is safe, why not use it?” she said.View image in fullscreenMounjaro also emulates GLP-1 as well as a second hormone producing even more impressive results.Photograph: George Frey/ReutersExperts say rather than being an acute treatment, as would be used for something like an infection, these weight-loss medications should be viewed as a treatment for a chronic condition – similar to the way statins are used.“If you have somebody on a statin for their cholesterol, and you stop statin, almost inevitably the cholesterol rises,” said Whyte. “If you have somebody on the blood pressure tablet, you stop the tablet, almost inevitably the blood pressure rises. So it’s not dissimilar from that.”Yet questions remain, including why a fraction of patients do not regain weight when they stop the medications.“No one knows who these people are, and they don’t know what makes them different,” said Miras, though he added that there were two main theories. The first was that such patients might have gained weight due to particular life events such as a pregnancy or a stressful period – meaning that when the event resolved, so too did the weight gain.Another possibility, said Miras, was that a genetically predetermined “set point” for body weight had a broader range for some people than others, meaning their body did not resist efforts to deviate from this weight as strongly as for other people.Whyte said research was now looking at how to minimise weight-regain, noting that as well as maintaining muscle mass and making lifestyle changes, research suggested tapering down doses might help.As patients are tracked for longer and in real-world settings, it is also clear that these drugs are not the solution for everyone. Some find the side-effects unpleasant, miss enjoyment of food or simply don’t want to continually take medication and, while they have been found to be effective in early trials in children, some question whether this is the right approach so early in life.With the medications known to reduce muscle mass, Whyte said an important question was whether this went beyond what would be expected from weight loss alone.Yet with GLP-1 drugs having been used for diabetes for almost 20 years, Whyte said the data suggested overall the medications were safe.“There was an initial concern [about], maybe it could lead to higher risk of pancreatitis or even pancreatic cancer or thyroid [cancer]. That has not been borne out in any of the follow-up data,” he said.‘Treatment revolution that will only get better’Critics of weight-loss drugs tend to view them as medicalising a problem that would be better solved by policies to tackle the underlying causes of the obesity crisis. But, according to Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, there is no sign of high-calorie foods becoming less ubiquitous. And where successive policies have failed to make a sufficient impact, he argues the drugs themselves may provide a fresh incentive for a change in the food market.“When Eli Lilly first reported their results, the share prices of some fast-food places dipped,” said Sattar. “Ultimately it might reverse-engineer things towards a better food environment.”Weight-loss drugs now dominate the conversation around obesity. But their success may also drive medical interest in alternative pathways for treatment.“What the success of these drugs absolutely demonstrates is that obesity is a biological phenomenon,” said Jebb. “Some people have a genetic susceptibility that makes it a struggle to manage their appetites, which is made incredibly hard in a world where food is everywhere.”“Part of what I hope these drugs do is reframe medical attitudes around obesity. It’s easier to engage doctors in talking about drug treatments but I hope it will draw them into talking about other options as well.”Miras was also enthusiastic. “When you don’t understand the disease, it is almost automatic in medicine that we start blaming the patient because we feel uncomfortable,” he said. “Now we have understood the disease, not completely but much better. And now, as a result, there is a revolution in the treatment of obesity and that will only get better.”*Name has been changed."

Perhaps a second half that didn’t live up to the extraordinary drama of the first meant that this wasn’t quite a classic final, but it wasone packed with incidentand storyline, from Jean-Philippe Mateta’s glorious return after hishorror injury at Millwall, to a missed penalty, a heroic goalkeeper inspired by the memory of his late father and a debutant substitute.And at its heart, well asCrystal Palaceplayed, was Pep Guardiola making a series of decisions so striking they could not but raise the familiar spectre of overthinking.Crystal Palace stun Manchester City to win FA Cup amid drama and Henderson controversyRead more“If we meet again you can’t play in this system because we will solve it,” Oliver Glasner told Guardiola after ManchesterCity beat Palace 5-2last month. If that was intended as a mind game, it worked brilliantly; Guardiola’s Cup final team featured just three players – Nico O’Reilly, Rúben Dias and Josko Gvardiol – operating in the same positions as they had played in that game. Palace, by contrast, showed only one difference from that game, Marc Guéhi restored on the left side of defence having been suspended for the fixture at the Etihad Stadium.The most striking of the City changes was the deployment of Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva at the back of midfield. Thoughts immediately went back to 2021 and Guardiola’s decision not to pick a holding player againstChelsea in the Champions League final. It’s perhaps oversimplistic to say that the effectiveness of Palace on the break was a consequence – their pace and directness has troubled City sufficiently in the recent past, whatever the makeup of the midfield, that Palace had scored twice against them in five of their previous six meetings. But equally, it didn’t help. The pairing perhaps ensured City had more of the ball, but it also meant they were more susceptible to Palace’s counter when they came. It was just such a break that led to Palace’s winner.But that wasn’t the only oddity. Why Savinho, who hasn’t scored a domestic goal this year? Why Jérémy Doku, whose only goals this year have come against Ipswich and Salford? When City ran out of ideas in the second half, as they did, could anybody claim to be surprised? The defensive chaos of the tail end of last year may have gone but the cost has been that Guardiola’s side these days often look predictable and toothless. City could perhaps point to misfortune – Dean Henderson could easily have been sent off in the first half and went on to make a string of important saves, including from Omar Marmoush’s penalty – but equally they played in a way that allowed misfortune to derail them. Would it really have been so outlandish to play something closer to the side that had beaten Palace by three goals last month?Eagles are flying high: FA Cup final 2025 – in picturesRead moreView image in fullscreenPep Guardiola’s team featured just three players in the same positions in the 5-2 league win against Crystal Palace.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Allstar Picture Library Ltd/SportsphotoThen there was the introduction of Claudio Echeverri from the bench with 14 minutes remaining. Throwing on a 19-year-old who hadn’t even been an unused substitute before for his debut in a Cup final is one of those moves so bold that it can only ever be regarded as genius or folly. Given he wasted two decent opportunities with shots too close to Henderson, it will inevitably be regarded as the latter.Beyond gut feel, or perhaps hubris, what could the logic possibly have been? And what did that decision say about Jack Grealish’s status? The 29-year-old will surely be on his way out of the club in the summer.To cap it all, at the final whistle Guardiola engaged in a furious row with Henderson. It’s possible Henderson provoked the altercation, which would at least make Guardiola’s reaction understandable, but it nevertheless suggested a manager feeling the pressure. It might not have been the scalp-scratching of thedraw against Feyenoord, but neither did it suggest a manager comfortable in his role. Nor did his spiky post-match press conference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola is very unusual in being both revolutionary and also capable of perpetual evolution. To have been as consistently successful as he has been over 16 years is extremely rare, but all managers begin to decline at some point. The process, if it is happening, could be gradual; summer passing into autumn does not mean the sun never shines, merely that the days of relentless glory may be drawing to a close.Guardiola, clearly, isn’t the only issue at City this season. He’s almost certainly not even the main issue, given Rodri’s absence and some curious recruitment. But it will fall on Guardiola to try to restore City to previous greatness – and there has to be uncertainty as to whether he has the energy to build another great team.Explore more on these topicsPep GuardiolaManchester CityCrystal PalaceFA CupFootball tacticsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Where might we be happiest if we had the choice of going anywhere? It’s an almost impossible question, as we do not all thrive on the same things, but there are some that are universally agreed to be conducive to cheeriness.When we tried to work out the happiest places for Guardian readers, easy access to countryside and parks, sea, lakes and rivers were high on the list of ingredients, as studies have shown that getting out and about in nature can help improve your mood.Being fit and well, and able to see a doctor when you are not, are also helpful, so we looked at the average driving time to GPs, hospitals, pharmacist and dentists. These sets of data, together with information about air quality were contributed to by the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool.The things that make life easier are also likely to lead to a happier life. For this reason we included broadband speeds, marking areas down where, according to Ofcom, they were below 30MB. We thought about transport, and what could take some of the strain out of travelling. Our measure of this was how far you could get on public transport within half an hour, reflecting the local infrastructure and ease of getting around without a car. And we included crime figures.But this is a list for Guardian readers, so we wanted to reflect the importance of culture and community. We gave extra weight to these factors, as measured by proximity to cinemas, theatres and museums, pubs and libraries, using data from sources including the Food Standards Agency, and various industry reports and listings websites.For reasons concerning lack of easily comparable data, we kept our analysis to England,Scotlandand Wales. We mean no disrespect to some of the most glorious areas of Northern Ireland.Our lengthy initial list was the basis for discussion, research and on the ground reporting. Out of that came our pick of places that generally scored highest as happy places to live.There may well be people who disagree with our choices. And I’m afraid we cannot guarantee a joyous life to everyone who lives in any of the places we have featured. But one of them could be your happy place.Hilary OsborneJump toThe top three1. Berwick-upon-TweedView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stock87/Getty ImagesAdmittedly it was eight centuries ago, but the Guardian’s happiest place to live was once hailed as the Alexandria of the north because of its fabulous commerce and wealth. Today, Berwick-upon-Tweed remains an often overlooked jewel. Yet people who know it, adore it – it is a great place to live with community spirit in bundles.Architectural expert Nikolaus Pevsner, no less, described Berwick as “one of the most exciting towns in England” and Michael Palin once said: “It feels like somewhere where stories happen and where stories are told.”There’s certainly a lot of history here. The town switched between England and Scotland at least 13 times until, in 1482, it became England’s most northerly outpost.The biggest draw for many is the heritage and the architecture that tells its story, with the Elizabethan town walls considered some of the best preserved in Europe. They were built to keep out marauding Scots, resolute that Berwick was not English, and were the most expensive undertaking of England’s golden age. Walking them takes about 45 minutes but is well worth it. Close your eyes and you can feel the history, open them and the views are sensational.Berwick was LS Lowry’s favourite holiday destination and a place where he made more than 30 sketches, drawings and paintings including one of Bridge Street which, wonderfully, looks more or less as it did when he painted the scene in 1938.Today there is a Lowry Trail (about three hours), taking in cobbled streets, romantic riverbanks and the big, sandy, fun Spittal beach. When there was an attempt to recreate the painting last year, there was no shortage of volunteers – a reflection of the importance of community in Berwick.Community is also in evidence each May, when crowds gather for the Riding of the Bounds, a celebration of the traditional horse ride that was made to check the security of the town’s boundaries.Berwick’s markets on Wednesday and Saturday are popular and busy. Day-to-day shopping is great with plenty of interesting independent shops, whether the Vintage Department Store at No 1 Woolmarket, vinyl at The Mule on Rouge, or books you didn’t know you wanted at Slightly Foxed.For a place as small as Berwick – the population is around 13,000 – there is an impressive cultural offering including the town’s annual eclectic film and media arts festival.A £4.5m lottery grant was recently announced for a project that will transform Berwick’s historic barracks, designed by Hawksmoor, into a new arts hub. Part of that includes providing a new home for a fabulous collection donated to the town by the shipping magnate Sir William Burrell. While he’s more famous for what he gave to Glasgow, Burrell left 300 pieces to Berwick including an important Degas pastel called Danseurs Russes.The town is unquestionably in Northumberland but there’s a definite Scottishness to it, not least the football team, Berwick Rangers, which plays in the Scottish leagues (currently the lowly Lowland League).The outdoors is great here. Within town are Coronation Park, with its sculpture trail, and Castle Vale Park, which has spectacular views of Robert Stephenson’s 28-span Royal Border Bridge, opened by Queen Victoria in 1850. There are coastal paths to explore, sandy beaches to walk and play on, and the natural beauty of Northumberland all around you.And if you want a day in the city, Edinburgh and Newcastle are each around an hour and 15 minutes away on the train. No wonder people have fought over it.Where to goThere’s no shortage of great places to eat including the popular Riverside Cafe, the quirky Atelier, and well-regarded Amran’s Indian Kitchen & Grill. Grape lovers should head to Coxon & Coxon Wine Rooms and beer fans to the multi award-winning Curfew micropub.What to doThe Maltings is the place for film, theatre and visual arts and there is a wealth of community groups and clubs for all tastes – whether tennis, tai chi, art, bowling, history, or braving the freezing North Sea.Where to breatheThere are sandy beaches, riverside walks and two beautiful parks. Berwick is also at the top end of the Northumberland coastal path which takes in sweeping, empty beaches and Bamburgh, Dunstanburgh and Warkworth castles.Where to buyThe average house price in Berwick, according to Rightmove, is £220,000 and even living in the historic centre is not out of the question. Estate agents say Castle Terrace is one of the “most desirable streets” and it’s easy to see why. A six-bedroom semi is on for £760,000.Mark Brown2. EveshamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart Black/AlamyWhat could be a happier existence than living in the asparagus capital of the UK? In Evesham you can eat the vegetable to your heart’s content, especially during the British Asparagus festival which the town hosts every year from late April.The reason it is so revered here is because Evesham sits on the banks of the River Avon, surrounded by land that was a paradise for the market gardeners who shaped the area’s economy in the 19th and 20th centuries. Asparagus became the Vale’s of Evesham’s most famous food, and it now has protected food status here.During summer you may spot Gus the Asparagus Man, the town’s unofficial mascot, who attends events and delivers asparagus wearing a bright green costume.But even if you’re not a diehard fan of the vegetable, there’s lots going for Evesham. The Worcestershire town has plenty of rural charm, with dozens of pick-your-own fruit and veg fields in summer, and beautiful scenery on its doorstep.It is close to the scenic (but more expensive) Cotswolds, only 1hr 5 minutes from Birmingham, 25 minutes from Worcester and on a direct train line to London. The M5, taking you up to the north of England, or down to the south-west, is also only 20 minutes away.Evesham provides a more tranquil existence than the bigger cities many people in the town commute into. You’ll find lots of Georgian and Tudor architecture, pretty parks and family-friendly events – there are medieval re-enactments and an annual food and music festival.There are plenty of good school choices too – Prince Henry’s High School, founded over 600 years ago, is an academy rated outstanding by Ofsted. Evesham is also one of the few local authorities operating a three-tier school system (meaning pupils attend first, middle, then high school).Evesham Park in the town centre has plenty of activities for children, including water fountains, a skate park and events such as a hot air balloon festival.For history and literature buffs, Stratford-upon-Avon and its many Shakespearean attractions are just a bus ride away, and there’s plenty of history to explore in the town itself.The meandering Avon, which runs through the town, is a particular draw. The barges which once carried cargo along the river have been replaced with pleasure boats. For the sporty, a regatta takes place in May, while in July the river festival offers entertainment and food.A walk along the riverside in summer, with its swans and pretty greenery, is a real treat. But be warned it does have a habit of flooding, so make sure to check this is not an issue for the area you want to move to.Where to goThe Royal Oak and the Thatched Tavern are two popular country pubs selling dishes made from local produce.What to doThe Regal Cinema, in its 1932 art deco-style building, is also home to a coffee shop and evening wine bar.Where to breatheA ride on the Hampton Ferry, a pedestrian cable ferry running across the river to the village of Hampton, is a popular activity.Where to buyTypical house prices in Evesham range from £275,000 to £350,000. Many choose to live in the town but surrounding villages such as Badsey, Offenham and Wickhamford are also popular.Jessica Murray3. CaernarfonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Thomas Lukassek/AlamyIt is difficult, perhaps even impossible, to conjure an image of Caernarfon without the grey stone castle that towers over the town. One of the most historically important buildings of the middle ages, it is where King Charles was invested as the Prince ofWaleson 1 July 1969 while the world watched on.While it may be the focal point of Caernarfon, it is far from all that this town, on the north coast of Wales, has to offer. Both the dramatic mountain landscapes of Snowdonia, and the beautiful sandy beaches of the Llŷn Peninsula, are within an hour’s drive. “You can get a sense of living in the mountains, but you’re only 15 minutes away from the town,” one local estate agent says.For culture, Galeri Caernarfon houses a cinema, gallery space, and theatre that plays host to music, drama and dance. While the cafe has some of the best coffee in town, the real highlight is its terrace, overlooking the harbour, with views across the Menai Strait to Anglesey. The 16th-century Black Boy Inn offers dishes including Welsh pie – but watch out for the resident ghosts, while Sheep and Leeks serves a fine dining menu, with local seasonal produce at its heart.Cross the bridge on the far side of the harbour, and you’ll find an expanse of green grass stretching out towards the water, with a skate park, basketball court, and children’s playground. There’s a holiday park, and a golf course up here, but also plenty of space to take a stroll.While the old town is all painted houses and sloping streets, the more modern part of Caernarfon looks a little tired, with a few empty storefronts, and more charity shops than boutiques.Although Caernarfon itself has no beach, it is only around seven miles to Dinas Dinlle, a long stretch of sand, more damp and brown than soft and white, with pebbles at the farthest section from the water’s edge, but gloriously peaceful.The highlight among the beach’s smattering of amenities is Braf cafe, offering generous plates of locally sourced fare; Welsh halloumi, Waunfawr mushrooms, and homemade bread. Sunning himself close to the cafe, one man explains why people like living in the area. “It’s beautiful,” he says, “and sometimes we even get the weather.”Where to goOsteria is a Tuscan restaurant with a simple menu of great value pasta and bruschetta.What to doCaernarfon food festival draws crowds in the spring. Beacon Climbing Centre is the largest of its kind in north Wales.Where to breatheThe Lôn Eifion Cycleway runs along a 12.5-mile route to Bryncir through tranquil woodland with views of Snowdonia.Where to buyUpper Llandwrog is a desirable spot, with prices between £340,000 and £395,000. Closer to town – and the sea – houses on Bangor Road are around £775,000 for a four-bedroom property, or £330,000 for a two-bed bungalow.Hannah Al-OthmanAnd the best of the rest … (in no particular order)NorthDurhamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: TraceyAPhotos/Getty ImagesThe author Bill Bryson was on a train to Newcastle when, impetuously, he got off at Durham and fell in love with the place deeply and instantly.“Why, it’s wonderful,” he wrote in Notes from a Small Island. “A perfect little city – and I kept thinking: ‘Why did no one tell me about this?’”Bryson was so enraptured he added: “If you have never been to Durham, go at once. Take my car.”He was articulating what people who live there already know: why go to York or Edinburgh when you can go to magical Durham. There’s something about its pocket size, genuine friendliness, wealth of places to eat and drink, and world-class heritage.That of course includes the cathedral, arguably the nation’s finest. The Guardian’s art critic, Jonathan Jones, described it as “one of the most beautiful places in the world” and once you’ve been there, you understand what he means. It’s a place you enter for the first time and your jaw quietly drops.It was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries to house the remains of the Venerable Bede and St Cuthbert, the “saint of the north”, a man who sang psalms at night in the North Sea and emerged to bless otters who dried his feet. It was one of the first places in the UK to be designated a Unesco world heritage site and remarkably, is free to enter, although most visitors will feel obliged to stump up the £5 donation that is asked for. Dogs are also welcome.The cathedral was used in Avengers: Endgame, along with Durham castle, but it is as a backdrop to the Harry Potter films for which it is best known on the big screen. It has become something of a pilgrimage destination for Potterheads who will instantly recognise that the Chapter House was Professor McGonagall’s classroom in the first two films, the place where young students transfigured animals into goblets. The cloister walkways were also used for scenes of Harry, Ron and Hermione walking between lessons.People who live in Durham are rightly proud of the cathedral, for many it boosts a sense of community. But if you want to witness an explosion of belonging then look no further than the annual Durham miners’ gala, known locally as the Big Meeting. Held on the second Saturday in July, it is seen as “the world’s greatest celebration of community, international solidarity, and working-class life” typically attracting more than 200,000 people. County Durham’s pits might be long gone but the blaze of banners, brass bands and speeches is still going strong.Durham is also home to one of Europe’s greatest light festivals: Lumiere, a biennial free event which transforms the city into a living outdoor art gallery and attracts huge crowds.In 2023, visitors were treated to incredible geometric projections on to the cathedral, the work of Spanish artist Javier Riera and Illuminated Bottle Rack (2018), an artwork featuring scores of antique chandeliers, was installed inside the building by Ai Weiwei.Durham’s annual book festival in October is popular, with a lineup last year that included Pat Barker, Helen Fielding, Alan Hollinghurst, Jackie Kay, Jodi Picoult and Horrible Histories’ Terry Deary. In the summer there’s the always fun Durham Brass festival.Part of the fabric of Durham is the university and the more than 20,000 students who study there. Surely one reason for there being so many great places to eat and drink.The city’s medieval streets and confined geography, surrounded on three sides by the River Wear, mean it’s not somewhere for big shops. But there is a great market and the giant MetroCentre in Gateshead is only a 30-minute drive away.Where to goThe daily queue for brunch at the Flat White Kitchen is an indicator of how good it is. For pubs, try the Half Moon Inn or the Victoria Inn. For fancy tasting menus try both Coarse and Faru.What to doDon’t miss the light festival or the miners’ gala. The Gala theatre and cinema is the place for musicals and National Theatre screenings.Where to breatheFinchale Priory was once used as a holiday retreat by Benedictine monks and is lovely. Any riverside walk is a joy – look out for the occasional great cormorant.Where to buyAn abundance of gorgeous properties, old and new, in parts of the city such as Gilesgate and Neville’s Cross. New-build detacheds go for under £400,000.MBChesterfieldView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alexey_Fedoren/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe iconic image of Chesterfield is the crooked spire of the Church of St Mary and All Saints, which twists 45 degrees to a tip which is 9ft 6in (2.9m) off-centre. No one is sure of the reasons for its contorted appearance, but in modern times gravity and the weight of lead roof tiles have taken over from the devil as the most likely suspects.It is the Derbyshire town’s most-famous landmark – making an appearance on the league two football team’s badge – but there is more besides. Chesterfield sits on the edge of thePeak District and is home to one of the oldest open-air markets in England, as well as historic medieval alleyways, churches, museums and grand old buildings. Its blend of urban and rural access (being just a short journey from both the Peak District national park, and Sheffield and Derby) make it a popular place to live.There’s an annual walking festival in May, and plenty of rambling groups to join. But if hiking isn’t your thing, there is an abundance of other outdoor activities – you can try abseiling, canoeing, caving or scrambling.There are also green spaces such as Linacre Reservoirs, originally built to supply water to the town and now a haven for wildlife. And in town, Queen’s Park offers fresh air, play areas and, during school holidays, miniature train rides.When you’ve finished exercising, there’s a strong independent food and drink scene to enjoy. Bottle and Thyme, a family-run restaurant with a focus on ethical and sustainable ingredients, is a big hit locally.George Stephenson,the renowned “Father of Railways” who helped build the first steam train, spent the last 10 years of his life in Chesterfield and is buried inside the town’s Holy Trinity Church.Where to goLombardis, a bustling Neapolitan eatery in the town centre. The Market Pub serves fresh seafood and more than 100 gins.What to doThe Grade II-listed Winding Wheel theatre hosts plays, musicals and comedies. Sports fans can play golf and cricket, or head to Chesterfield FC matches.Where to breatheThe Chesterfield canal, with its towpath known as The Cuckoo Way, winds past some of the earliest staircase locks ever built.Where to buyAreas west of the town centre towards the Peak District are the most sought after. In the suburbs you’ll find picturesque villages and stone cottages. The average house price was £202,000 in February.JMYorkView image in fullscreenPhotograph: StephenBridger/Getty Images/iStockphotoThis North Yorkshire city can sometimes be overlooked in favour of its bigger and edgier northern neighbours, but with its cobbled streets, eccentric independent shops and snuggly pubs it contains all the charm of Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Sheffield put together.It was the ancient Romans who first created a town – Eboracum – from a small settlement here and since then York has gone through many iterations, including as the Viking city of Jorvik, with evidence of 2,000 years of history strewn across the highly walkable centre. The medieval period is particularly well-preserved in everything from the city walls – the longest medieval town walls in England – the higgledy-piggledy timber-framed shops of the Shambles, the remains of York Castle known as Clifford’s Tower sitting atop a steep mound, and of course the spectacularly impressive York Minster cathedral.There’s a modesty and unreserved warmth to York that sets it apart from other places – gentle, big-bearded men greet customers from behind the bars of many of the city’s exceptional boozers. There are at least a dozen pubs that if they were in London would be considered among the best in the capital. House of Trembling Madness, The Fat Badger, Pivni, Eagle & Child, The Hop, Guy Fawkes Inn, Minster Inn, The Punch Bowl and The Market Cat are all centrally located and each a great place to spend a couple of hours over a few locally brewed beers. York’s picturesque river, the aptly named Ouse, that runs through its centre is perfect for a calm walk or as the backdrop for a pint on a sunny evening.Good food is a given in York’s pubs – as is live music in a lot of cases. Though it is not the cultural centre of the north – that accolade would go to half a dozen northern cities before York – it has a healthy supply of medium-sized touring musicians and comedians. Even the Viking-themed Valhalla bar manages to stay on the right side of gimmicky. It is a great example of York’s sense of fun, and underlines how there is very little here of the desperation to cling to tradition that defines the character of more pompous historical cities.The throngs of tourists going in and out of the Harry Potter shops are perhaps a downside to living here, although they tend to congregate around the Minster and the Shambles, places easily avoided by locals. The Christmas market, which brings in crowds from across the north, can be contentious but it is hard to find a more festive-feeling location when the season comes around.York Racecourse is one of the major venues in the racing world – the third biggest in Britain in terms of prize money offered – and hosts everything from classic car events to festivals several times a year.The popularity of York as somewhere to live is in part due to it being a rare northern city with good rail links to London, thanks to its Victorian role as a major transport hub (it once laid claim to having the largest train station in the world). King’s Cross is around two hours away on a reasonably reliable LNER or Grand Central service.Two large universities are probably what stop York becoming a place that time forgot, with the students – many of whom choose to stay here when they graduate – keeping the city young and relatively diverse for somewhere surrounded by rural villages.All this makes York a shining example of a great modern historical city – cool and stylish (yes, perhaps a little bougie), all amid awe-inspiring millennia-old architecture.Where to goSpoilt for choice is a phrase that could have been written about the York food and drink scene, with the Michelin guide listing 16 restaurants in and around the city, including one with a Michelin star.What to doAs well as everything in York itself, Leeds, home of Opera North, the Northern Ballet and a 13,000-seat arena, is only around 30 minutes away by train.Where to breatheThe North York Moors, a wild expanse of moorland bridging the city and the row of cute North Yorkshire coastal towns and villages, including Whitby, Robin Hood’s Bay and Sandsend.Where to buyBishopthorpe Road (Bishy Road), Clifton and Fulford are among the most desirable areas, while around £250,000 would get you a two-bedroom terrace house in Holgate, within a pleasant 30-minute walk of the train station. Flooding is a city-wide issue, though defences have and continue to be built to mitigate against it.Robyn VinterPadihamView image in fullscreenIt’s not raining … Pendle Hill overlooks Padiham.Photograph: LukeP77/Getty Images/iStockphotoThere’s an old saying in Padiham: if you can see Pendle Hill it’s about to rain and if you can’t, then it’s raining. Dry humour and wet weather are part of the charm of this little corner of Lancashire.Tucked into rolling fields outside Burnley, Padiham (pronounced “Paddy-am”) might be one of the north of England’s best kept secrets. For decades a general gloom seemed to hang over the town, but with a £1.4m fund from the National Lottery Heritage Fund it has cleaned up its 100-year-old architecture and redesigned the high street.Known locally as “the hill”, Burnley Road is home to all manner of independent shops and cafes. At the bottom end of the town is Rawes Grazing, a food emporium stuffed with delicious local produce and refillable goods. Once you’ve gorged on artisan cheese you could head for a tipple in The Taproom, a single-room micropub that opened 18 months ago.Young professionals and buy-to-let investors have cottoned on to the town’s resurgence and are snapping up the relatively cheap housing. A charming three-bed terrace house is on sale for £65,000 – about the price of a parking space in London.“Previously it was older people and families but more recently people from Manchester are realising the value within Padiham and how much they can get for their money,” says Holly Frost, an estate agent at Fardella & Bell. “There’s a lot of green space and people are realising how valuable that is.”Where to goMooch Cafe87, where the staff greet you like an old friend. For an evening meal try The Cellar, housed in a 16th-century former coach house.What to doVisit Gawthorpe Hall, a Jacobean country house set in 40 acres of woodland.

One night in the 18th century when high taxes on alcohol led to a boom in smuggling, some locals had quickly stashed hogsheads of brandy in the Crammer pond to hide them from approaching excisemen. They were retrieving them with hay rakes when the suspicious officials returned demanding an explanation for what they were up to. Pointing to the reflection of the moon on the pond they claimed they were trying to rake in the “giant cheese” they’d found. Dismissing them as drunk or foolish, the excisemen went on their way and the locals got away with their booty.The people of Devizes are fond of the legend. There is a plate telling the tale by the renowned Wiltshire ceramicist Mary White in the Wiltshire Museum while one of the local netball leagues is named the Moonrakers League.There’s a cosiness to modern day Devizes. There is a modest Sainsbury’s and an M&S Simply Food but this is a place of independent shops. The Walter Rose & Son butcher’s has been selling meat since 1847. The hardware store down the road, Roses, was established in 1947. Devizes Books Ltd, sited in a lovely Georgian building, has been operating for almost half a century. A weekly Thursday market has taken place for three centuries and indoor traders set up each day in the historic Shambles, off the market square.There is no railway station – the town council is campaigning for one – but the mainline between London and Bath and Bristol is accessible at Chippenham, 12 miles away. The lack of a train station adds to the sense of self-containment. This is no commuter town.Politics is fun here. The majority party on the town council is the Devizes Guardians, which is not bound by any particular ideology nor allegiance to a national political party.Devizes may not have the alternative vibe of Frome, across the border in Somerset, but there is plenty for those who hanker after the mystical, with the Stonehenge and Avebury world heritage sites a short drive away.There’s a good arts and culture scene. The annual Devizes arts festival presents musical events, poets and authors, literary talks and comedians and each autumn, a food and drink festival includes “delicious meals in very unusual places”.Where to goThe 16th-century Bear Hotel is all wooden floors and roaring fires when the temperature drops. Table 31 has great breakfasts, lunches, cakes and coffee.What to doA guided tour of the Wadworth brewery, which is 150 this year. The Wharf theatre produces in-house musicals, plays, pantomimes, youth shows and live music.Where to breatheThe Ridgeway path and Roundway Hill, which has views to the Cotswolds and Salisbury Plain. Hillworth Park started life as a private landscaped garden and came into public ownership in 1945.Where to buyIn the heart of Devizes a four-bedroomed, listed house will cost about £575,000. A decent sized semi just outside town will be around the same or a little less. More modern homes around the centre cost about £400,000.Steven MorrisLewesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: www.mjt.photography/AlamyFrom the top of the tallest tower of Lewes Castle, you can see the chalky downs that ring the red-roofed market town. Lewes is entirely inside the South Downs national park. The same tectonic shifts that built the Alps lifted the prehistoric seabed to become wildlife-rich chalk grassland, one of Earth’s rarest landscapes.Lewes has a strong sense of history. Bull House, near the castle, was home to radical writer Thomas Paine before he went to America, where his work helped inspire the war of independence. Thomas Paine Legacy has reopened the house and sees Paine’s work as an example of active citizenship, helping preserve contemporary freedom and democracy.“We have it in our power to begin the world over again,” wrote Paine in 1776. This utopian vision lives on in Lewes in projects like The Phoenix, a sustainable community-focused development on a once-derelict postindustrial site. The Lewes Pound, a local currency aimed at keeping resources in the town, is being discontinued, but its spirit survives. Staff in the Runaway cafe give free tea to the station gardeners, who do the cafe’s flowers in return.The Friday Food Market, in an 18th-century tower, sells raw honey, probiotic vinegar, organic veg, vegan chocolate and gluten-free cakes, topped with blackberries, figs and avocado ganache. There’s a whole room full of sourdough. Lewes sometimes feels like an eccentric, Bohemian aunt – lovable, easy to mock, but indomitable.The range of good food in Lewes these days is mouth-watering. There’s bánh mìat Pestle and Mortar noodle bar, classic Sunday roasts in the Lewes Arms, or pasta at brick-walled Squisito in the Needlemakers, a maze of indie shops in a former syringe factory. Artisanal coffee roaster Tigermoth lurks nearby on an industrial estate round the back of Aldi.Lewes also has an eclectic flea market, a Sunday morning car boot sale and regular seasonal crops of fairs and art shows. The flowery Grange Gardens is an irresistible combination of old stone arches, sunny lawns and dappled pathways, with The Hatch cafe serving real-fruit lollies and tea in china mugs. Across town, Pells Pool, one of the UK’s oldest freshwater lidos, is spring-fed and 46 metres long with a wooded lawn and waterside sauna. The new Charleston gallery, near the station, has great cakes.Glyndebourne opera house, venue for a summer festival since the 1930s, is three miles east – a calendar fixture for people who love posh picnics, dressing up, and/or world class classical music.It may be one reason for the joke that it’s easier to buy a bow tie here than socks. It’s true that the clothes shops tend towards vintage, outdoor or boutique so if you need cushion-soled alpaca or strawberry-patterned bamboo, you’re sorted. Otherwise, you might need to head to Argos or hop on the train to Brighton, 15 minutes down the line. Quick trains to London are one reason for the influx of people moving here from the capital.Local complaints include DFLs (“Down from Londons”) inflating the house prices, lack of nightlife and a dearth of parking spots. Lewesians have even been known to blow up parking meters, a protest that fits the town’s gunpowder-themed traditions. The Lewes Bonfire on 5November, commemorating both Guy Fawkes and local Protestant martyrs, involves dozens of Sussex societies. It features torchlit parades, burning effigies and flaming tar barrels rolling through the streets.Where to goCafe Vegu, an inventive Korean, and Taith, with good coffee and an elegant menu. Just off Cliffe High Street, Cafe du Jardin offers quiche and croque monsieur in an antique shop courtyard.What to doSouthdown Sports Club caters to all ages with tennis and squash courts, a hockey club and small gym. The Depot Cinema is in a refurbed former brewery by the station. Lewes Con Club is a not-for-profit community venue, hosting comedy and music.Where to breatheSpectacular paths head out of Lewes in almost every direction, whether you stroll along the grassy banks of the River Ouse or scramble up the steep sides of Malling Down, past cowslips and wild marjoram.Where to buyOld houses in the town centre and cobbled Cliffe are expensive, but there are cheaper areas on the fringes so prices vary wildly. Some of the 685 sustainable houses in The Phoenix should be available from 2027.Phoebe TaplinNewport, Isle of WightView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Greg Balfour Evans/AlamyEven the estate agents are discouraging: “Why would you choose the one area on the island where you can’t walk to a beach?” But houses in Newport can be cheaper as it’s inland and the Isle of Wight’s county town is an obvious transport hub with roads and bus routes radiating from it. The buses are unusually good and the nearest beaches are less than five miles away.Since its revival in summer 2002, the Isle of Wight festival has taken place in Newport’s waterside Seaclose Park. This year’s headliners are Sting, Stereophonics, and Justin Timberlake. For a different vibe on the far side of the River Medina, the reedbeds of Dodnor Creek nature reserve host water rails and willow warblers.Newport is full of contrasts like this. Georgian and Victorian houses, with gabled roofs and chequered brickwork, are sandwiched between 20th-century supermarkets. It is unmistakably urban, but it’s a short stroll to fields of sheep or an orchid-filled chalk pit. It’s home to the island’s smallest pub and largest cinema.Charles I was imprisoned in the castle and Nash designed the Guildhall, but the town wears its history lightly. The 16th-century Castle Inn hosts regular karaoke nights and live music. For the morning after, there’s a choice of bakeries, including Scarrots Lane, which helps fund community projects. Grace’s Bakery has just opened a big wood-floored cafe on the High Street. Round the corner, there are pots of fresh herbs on the tables outside Wadhams, a new cafe downstairs from a sustainable fashion school.A century ago, at the southern end of town, workmen discovered a Roman villa with a bath suite and hypocaust. Today’s new houses are more likely to have air-source heating and solar panels. The Isle of Wight is one of the UK’s sunniest places, with an average of more than five hours of sunshine a day.Snacks and Ladders, Newport’s dog-friendly board game cafe, has pizzas, burgers and hundreds of games to choose from. Nearby, close to Church Litten playground, the Lord Louis library offers holiday crafts and toddlers’ rhymes. Robin Hill adventure park, just out of town, reopened in April. Medina theatre serves up tribute bands and comedy while the Apollo, in an old Methodist chapel, has drama, musicals and live screenings.The guy in the record store says he swapped a “tiny flat in Bermondsey” for a three-bedroom house with sea views in Cowes: “No-brainer, really.” Return tickets to London for foot passengers start at around £50, including train, ferry and connecting bus for the hovercraft. Currently the only scheduled passenger hovercraft service in the world, the Ryde-Southsea service thrums regularly over sand and water, scattering seagulls.After a freezing dip with the new Isle of Wight Bluetits group of wild swimmers on a typically sunny Friday evening in Sandown, one swimmer gestures at the miles of sea, sand and chalk cliffs and asks: “What’s not to like?”Where to goThe cafe at One Holyrood boasts a suntrap courtyard garden full of tulips and wisteria.What to doThe community-led Department cultural centre has a bar and innovative theatre.Where to breatheTo the north, Parkhurst Forest, with its old oaks and tall pines, has a hide for spotting red squirrels.Where to buyCarisbrooke has some of the prettiest houses as well as pubs and shops. Neighbouring Shide has large Edwardian houses and a cycle path running into town. Flats start from about £115,000 while three-bed semis cost from £200,000 and detached houses from £350,000. For £1.5m, you could snag a big stone farmhouse.PTExeterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: eye35.pix/AlamyDepending on the wind direction, when you’re strolling along Exeter’s High Street you might catch a sea breeze from Lyme Bay or the heathery scents of Dartmoor.The cathedral city is lovely in its own right, but it is also the geographical position that many of its residents enjoy – Exmoor to the north, Dartmoor to the south-west, the Exe estuary and the Jurassic Coast to the south-east.The city has good road and rail connections. Bristol is an hour and 40 minutes away by road or an hour by train. You can be in Cornwall in just 40 minutes. And there’s a small airport.Not that getting out of Exeter is necessary. There’s plenty to do. The shopping is varied. Most of the high street stores are here but there are also terrific independent shops. On Fore Street you’ll find specialists ranging from a luxury belt maker to a vintage record player restorer.There is a thriving independent coffee and food scene. With Brixham Harbour, home to one of the UK’s biggest fishing fleets, only 30 miles away, it’s no surprise that fish tends to star on the menus of many of the best places to eat.Unsurprisingly for a city with a hugely popular university, the arts are strong in Exeter. The lead singer of Coldplay, Chris Martin, was born here and, though Muse are from nearby Teignmouth, the band’s earliest performances were at the Exeter Cavern, which is still going strong. Exeter Phoenix is home to art galleries, a solar-powered cinema, performances, gigs, comedy, talks and workshops.There are two interesting sports teams to get behind here. The football club, Exeter City – known as the Grecians (nobody is certain why) – play in EFL League One. The club is no Liverpool or Arsenal but it’s a warm, homely outfit and, very unusually for the UK, is owned by its fans. The rugby team, Exeter Chiefs, plays at Sandy Park on the edge of the city and have had great success in recent years.The Labour party has held the Exeter parliamentary constituency since Ben Bradshaw was elected in 1997. During the wilderness years for the party, Exeter remained a foothold in the Tory-dominated south-west.Winters tend to be mild here and the spring brings spectacular blossom but there can be surprisingly hefty drops of snow given it is so close to the coast.The weather is a good topic to bring up – the Met Office relocated here in 2003 and is one of the city’s biggest employers.Where to goSacred Grounds, in McCoy’s Arcade on Fore Street is an award-winning vegan brunch cafe. The Turk’s Head on the High Street is one of the region’s oldest pubs, apparently once frequented by Charles Dickens, and now has a microbrewery.What to doWalk, cycle, kayak or paddleboard along the River Exe.

The Exe estuary is of international importance to wading birds while the National Trust’s Killerton is one of Devon’s great estates.Where to buySt Leonard’s has a village feel. A three-bedroomed semi may cost more than £500,000. At Topsham on the estuary a two-bedroomed cottage is about £400,000. A detached in Pennsylvania near the university is around £550,000.SMPenzanceView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Manfred Gottschalk/Getty ImagesJust 10 miles from Land’s End, Penzance is a mini urban bubble among the wild outer reaches of Cornwall.With its two-and-a-half-mile seafront promenade and large harbour, it has the key features of a quintessential English seaside town. Plus cobbled streets and rows of Regency and Georgian terraces awash with independent shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants. There are also some prized cultural centres including Penlee House Gallery and Museum.Access to the incredible landscape surrounding the town is obviously its biggest draw with dozens of beaches – Gwynver, Lamorna Cove and Long Rock to name a few – all within walking and cycling distance or a short drive away.Penzance boasts the UK’s largest seawater pool, the art deco-influenced Jubilee. Filled on a high tide, the temperature sits a couple of degrees warmer than the surrounding seawater.Although a tourist hub, the town is not solely geared up for out-of-towners, it still has all key services for its 20,000 permanent residents – major supermarkets, a hospital, library, a college.And despite being at the end of the line, Penzance is fairly well connected, with non-stop services to Plymouth, Bristol and London. The bus station connects to surrounding towns and villages. Truro and Falmouth are a 55- and 60-minute drive respectively.House prices in Penzance have an overall average of £324,569 over the last year, according to Rightmove, which is likely inflated by second home and holiday let purchases. Local government data suggests that average household income is just below the national average.Where to goPick your favourite maritime-themed pub; splash out on dinner at The Shore; buy coffee at The Quirky Bird.What to doIf you’re not on the beach or the water, there’s the Acorn theatre, Savoy Cinema or Penlee House Museum & Gallery.

Dominating the city centre is the 11th-century cathedral with world-class choristers and art by Marc Chagall, John Piper and Elizabeth Frink mingling with Anglo Saxon reliefs and medieval vaulting.Bishop’s Palace Gardens, which you can stroll around for free, is 14 acres of herbaceous borders and specimen trees tucked between the city walls and the cathedral close. The walls themselves, built by the Romans and now pedestrianised, make for a lofty circuit of the city. Within them, there’s a cafe, most probably, for every day of the month.The city, rising out of flat green meadows, captivated the artists Constable and Turner. The poet John Keats began writing The Eve of St Agnes, inspired by the medieval architecture, while visiting friends in Chichester and is commemorated by a statue opposite his lodgings in Eastgate Square. Philip Larkin was moved by the clasped hands of a medieval earl and his wife in the cathedral to conclude in his poem An Arundel Tomb, that “What will survive of us is love”.From the newly opened cathedral spire you can see right across Sussex to the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth, while the remains of a Norman motte and bailey castle rear up from the green acres of Priory Park in the centre of town. Back on the ground you can follow the canal out of the city to Hunston Bridge where the view across the water meadows remains unchanged since Turner painted it in 1828.However you like to spend your spare time, you will find something to do in Chichester. There’s a weekly street market in the city centre selling local produce and crafts, which is a happy place to potter. Chichester Festival theatre launches new works into the West End and beyond and has a stream of plays, comedy and family entertainment. And you have the great outdoors on your doorstep.Cyclists can escape the city via a network of paths, and can quickly start to explore the area around Chichester Harbour – a large, wild space boasting fantastic nature spotting, and other more vigorous leisure activities. Continue on your bike around the inlets of the harbour, or instead of riding round it, take to the water. The local yacht club – about five miles out of the centre – has a fleet of boats, so you do not need your own to become a member, and runs social events on land and off.Where to goLuckes, an independent deli/cafe. Fine dining at Purchases; Santorini, a Greek restaurant with a weekday three-course lunch for £14.95. The Hole in the Wall has live music and craft beer and The Park Tavern offers a snug stop on the way to the theatre.What to doSee 20th-century British art in the Pallant House Gallery. There’s racing (horses and cars) at nearby Goodwood.Where to breatheThe beaches just nine miles away at West Wittering.Where to buyA two-bed cottage in Pallant in the centre costs around £800,000. A similar sum would buy a postwar family home in Somerstown, or a three-bed Victorian terrace in Whyke. The Manhood Peninsula to the south ranges from around £300,000 for a two-bed inland to up to £4m in West Wittering. Tighter budgets might find a foothold in the estates within the south-eastern ring road where an ex-council semi starts from around £250,000.Anna TimsCirencesterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kay Ransom/AlamyOne of many towns that claim the title “Capital of the Cotswolds”, Cirencester has been attracting new residents for literally thousands of years. In Roman times, it was known as Corinium and was the second-largest town in Roman Britain after London.Historians have suggested the original settlement was founded due to its strategic location on the Roman roads system, but today it’s far more likely to be the heady mix of market town charm and glorious English countryside that draws settlers to Cirencester.The town is a picturesque pleasure to explore, shop and live in. Narrow, winding streets of Cotswold stone buildings are lined with cafes, restaurants, boutiques and independent stores.Aside from being wrapped on all sides by the rolling hills of the Cotswolds with its beautiful walks and postcard villages, the town has plenty of green space including the whopping 3,000-acre Cirencester Park. The park, which is protected by Grade I-listed status and home to the world’s tallest yew hedge, is privately owned – locals can get an annual pass for their whole household for £10.The town is fairly isolated, which can be a pro or con depending on your taste. The nearest train station, Kemble, is a 10- to 15-minute drive away, and from there it’s a quick 1hr 15 minute ride to London Paddington. By car, it’s about 20 minutes to the M4.Property in Cirencester is not the cheapest, with house prices hitting an overall average of £393,469 over the last year, according to Rightmove. Household incomes in the town are in line with the national average.Where to goThe Hop Kettle for beer, Sam & Jak for dinner, Jacks for brunch and coffee. Octavia’s Bookshop on Black Jack Street.What to doBarn theatre (also doubles as a cinema), Sundial theatre, Cirencester Lido, Corinium Museum.Where to breatheCirencester Park, Abbey Grounds and the entire Cotswolds on your doorstep.Where to buyIf you’re after the quintessential Cotswold stone terrace or townhouse – the obvious place to start your hunt is the centre but it is also where the prices are highest. The town is surrounded by more affordable new-build estates, including The Steadings, where a three-bedroom home is on for £535,000.JGAylesburyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: KHellon/Getty ImagesFrom the train window near Aylesbury, you can see chalk hills, wooded valleys, big fields with traces of medieval farming and flowering hawthorn hedges. You can also see pylons, solar farms, and the building of HS2. Chiltern Railways trains are relatively reliable and sometimes get to London in an hour or so, but Buckinghamshire’s county town is far more than a potential commuter base. It has a strong sense of community, a mixed population, and great countryside.The Chiltern hills are tantalisingly close and the timber-framed town of Wendover, with varied walks and Rumsey’s chocolate shop, is 10 minutes away by train. The Ridgeway national trail, running through ancient downs and bluebell-carpeted beech woods, starts a few miles east at Ivinghoe Beacon.Aylesbury’s uneven reputation has kept houses slightly more affordable here than some other parts of the south-east. Last year, the constituency swung to Labour for the first time in its history. Affected in various ways by the HS2 route, there are also problems with traffic. The town has colour-coded cycle routes showing the best roads for bikes, like the Aqua Way to Watermead, where the lake attracts ducks and dragonflies.There’s less of the boutique-and-vintage vibe that more touristy market towns can develop. Aylesbury has the lived-in feel of some London neighbourhoods, but seems friendlier. There are Polish and Korean shops and an African cash and carry, Salt and Spices superstore. It opened a few months ago and has bunches of fresh fenugreek and coriander along with okra, quinces, papaya, lentils, rice and gram flour.St Mary’s Church stands at the cobbled heart of the old town. “It’s like a little village round here,” says graphic designer Mel Walker, greeting passersby. “OK, it’s not the sleepy little market town it was,” she admits, “but it’s got so many positives going for it.”St Mary’s hosts concerts and a community group called Space. Aylesbury has parkruns through the fields and badminton at the Methodist chapel. Yarn bombers decorate the square, while the Tour de Vale charity bike ride starts and ends in the town.Aylesbury’s Discover Bucks Museum houses displays including the Lenborough Hoard, and the Roald Dahl galleries are part of the museum’s child-friendly offering.“I love this place of possibility,” reads one of the inscriptions that decorate the Exchange, a colonnaded shopping area with a cinema and bunch of restaurants. The latest offering is Aurelia, which opened in late 2024 and has quickly become busy, offering a cornucopia of Italian dishes, from arancini rice balls to zenzeroni king prawns.Where to goThe King’s Head is a medieval coaching inn with a cobbled courtyard. Owned by the National Trust and leased to Chiltern Brewery, it serves real ales and beautifully cooked pub classics.What to doThe Waterside theatre puts on West End musicals and TV comedians. The town’s 122-year-old Literary Club is based on Temple Street, which is also home to Bucks Archaeological Society, holding regular talks in winter and outings in summer.Where to breatheA lovely walk along the Grand Union canal, past swans and moorhens, starts near the Waterside theatre.Where to buyCharacterful cottages sometimes come up in the town centre while the suburbs have more affordable modern houses. Flats can cost anything from about £80,000 up to £380,000. Terrace houses average around £350,000 and three bed semis go up to £600,000. Detached houses with four bedrooms, start around £450,000.PTMidlandsShrewsburyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBeautiful timber-framed Tudor buildings cluster the centre of this market town, encircled by a loop of the river Severn. Shrewsbury sits on the doorstep of Wales as well as the rolling Shropshire hills, and you can get to Birmingham or Manchester by train in just over an hour.Shrewsbury has been named as one of the country’s top places to live in multiple polls, while its high street has been ranked as one of the best in Britain, with lots of thriving independent shops. It has some of the top schools in the West Midlands, low crime rates, plenty of food and drink choices and beautiful period architecture.The town is perhaps best known for its indoor market, which was recently voted Britain’s favourite for the third year running. With over 600 listed buildings, it has dozens of historic pubs, including The Nags Head which dates back to the 16th century and featured in the 1984 movie adaptation of A Christmas Carol.Look up and you’ll notice lots of quirky details. Number 16 High Street (now a Costa Coffee) is a crooked Tudor building which in the 1990s was adorned with a carving of Margaret Thatcher and Michael Heseltine. The 16th-century Old Market Hall has been beautifully restored and is now home to a cinema and cafe bar.Charles Darwin, Shrewsbury’s most famous son, was born here in 1809. The landscape helped inspire his love of the natural world – in the town centre you will find the Bellstone, a granite boulder which was his first introduction to geology.Where to goFor fine dining try The Walrus – featured in this year’s Michelin guide. The Riverside Inn on the outskirts of town has beautiful water views, while Casa Naranjo, a family-run tapas bar, is popular with the locals.What to doAt Theatre Severn, you’ll find a constant stream of productions to see in the 650-seat auditorium.Where to breatheNorth of the town is Hawkstone Park, 100 acres of Grade I-listed landscape.Where to buyThe average asking price for a semi-detached is £293,244. Suburbs south of the river such as Belle Vue, Abbey Foregate and Meole Brace are considered some of the nicest areas to live.JMWorcesterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Gee 4/AlamyThis West Midlands city has beautiful cobbled streets as well as dozens of shops and restaurants, and plenty to see and do. The beautiful Worcester Cathedral dominates the city centre – King John is among the historical figures buried there.Compared with many other cities, it is affordable and has a low crime rate. This is in addition to a rich history, plenty of green spaces, and good transport links across the Midlands and south. Other strings to its bow include being home to Lea & Perrins, creator of traditional Worcestershire sauce, and Berrow’s Worcester Journal, thought to be the world’s oldest newspaper still published every week.If you want the convenience of city life, but without the urban sprawl, Worcester is a great choice. You’ll find all the main shopping brands, but the streets aren’t as crowded as in bigger cities. Its smaller size is its charm, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere in the centre. The University of Worcester, with a student population of around 10,000, adds a vibrant energy.At the Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum you’ll find exhibitions from world-renowned artists and celebrations of local history – a current display features a huge selection of Lea & Perrins bottles through the years. There’s also the Worcester Paint festival, which brings street and graffiti artists to the city every year to create a series of murals.It is particularly popular for families, with lots of good schools in the area and affordable house prices. There are a number of new housing developments, as well as plenty of early-20th century properties. It’s also within commutable distance from Birmingham.Where to goRestaurants such as Benedictos and the Olive Branch attract rave reviews. Visit Piston Distillery where you can become your own gin distiller.What to doEverything you might find in a larger city including axe-throwing, crazy golf, indoor go-karting, bowling and board game cafes. Theatres and cinemas, museums and art galleries and a weekly market.Where to breatheThe Malvern Hills and the Cotswolds. There’s also Worcester Woods country park, or Gheluvelt Park in the city centre.Where to buyThe average asking price was £253,000 in February. In the city centre, Diglis, Barbourne and St John’s are popular, and surrounding villages are also sought after.JMScotlandPerthView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Navin Mistry/AlamyPerthshire is often called “big tree country”, but to those who know it well, it’s also waterfalls, canyons and lochs country. This part of Scotland plays its cards close to its chest compared to more famous parts of the country, but is dotted with the hippest villages (yes, they do exist) and food destinations, while also being jam-packed with opportunities to hurl yourself off a bridge on a bungee rope or down the UK’s wildest rapids on an inflatable raft.Perth’s appealing position at the gateway to the Highlands has long been recognised as a prime real estate spot, with historians tracing settlements as far back as the prehistoric period. A rich bounty of archaeological finds from the region’s past are displayed at the light and airy Perth Museum, which reopened after refurbishment last year, complete with swish cafe.This city of only around 47,000 people punches above its weight as a cultural hub, with a small but mighty art gallery, a theatre, a concert hall and an art deco cinema, not forgetting its annual arts festival. June sees Potfest, the UK’s biggest ceramics festival, hit the city, while August heralds Perthshire Pride.There’s no escaping the fact that the city centre is struggling to recover post Covid, but its self-reliant spirit abides through its network of independent establishments, which include gems such as Concorde Music, Scotland’s oldest family-run record shop, and The Bean Shop for top-tier tea and coffee supplies.Perth is bookended top to bottom by two riverside parks – North Inch and South Inch. As a residential district, the area of Central and South Inch encompasses not only the grand houses on the edge of the park, but city centre flats and the smartest parts of middle-class enclave Craigie.Amenities are concentrated in the city and once you’re away home across the park, you’ll find little to entertain you other than the well-rated chippy. There’s a big Tesco on the city’s southernmost reaches, otherwise you’ll need to avail yourself of the Aldi, Lidl or Morrisons in the centre. For high-end provisions, a gourmet spread can be acquired from Provender Brown Delicatessen and topped up with Italian goodies from Casella & Polegato, cheeseboard provisions from The Cheese Byre or local produce from the monthly farmers’ market.The central train station means you can reach Edinburgh in one hour 24 minutes and Glasgow in just over an hour. But with northbound trains heading to Aviemore and Inverness and some of the best scenery in the UK at your fingertips, you might be hard pressed to justify any journey south.Where to goHave cake for breakfast at Hinterland, where you can also pick up one of the city’s best flat whites. Go French at Cafe Tabou for lunch, before reverting to local classics at North Port for dinner (and a pint at The Twa Tams after if you’re in the mood for music).What to doGet out on the water, maybe fishing for salmon, wakeboarding or golfing on Moncreiffe River Island. Alternatively stay indoors at the leisure pool, which has slides galore.Where to breatheCross the River Tay to explore pretty Rodney Gardens with city views. Follow Perth’s sculpture trail as it winds around the riverside heather garden, which at the right time of the year blooms in a riot of colour.Where to buyAverage prices in the popular suburb of Craigie are £280,000 with two-bed flats in period buildings around £120,000. A three-bedroom apartment overlooking South Inch will set you back over £240,000.Katie CollinsHaddingtonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Richard Newton/AlamyDrive 30 minutes from Haddington in one direction and you can be in Edinburgh city centre, catching a fringe show or jetting off from the airport. Drive 30 minutes the other way and you can be riding horses along the beach in the shadow of Tantallon Castle or eating lobster and chips while gazing out at Bass Rock.But to describe Haddington solely in terms of its proximity to nearby attractions would be a disservice to this small, friendly town that has a good deal going for it in terms of amenities and community spirit.Away from the coast and just off the A1 with no train station of its own, Haddington flies under the radar compared with other pockets of East Lothian. In-the-know locals have no problem catching the express bus when they fancy a jaunt into the city but there’s plenty to keep them occupied nearby too, whether they’re meandering the Tyne river path or hunkering down in one of the many cosy pubs.Since being classified a burgh by King David I in the 12th century, Haddington has grown into a thriving market town, with a jumble of historic buildings and properties from different periods. Today’s town centre occupies the same slim isosceles triangle of Market Street, High Street and Hardgate that’s made up the historic core for centuries.Independent shops dominate the centre. These include clothing boutiques, a bookshop and wellness emporium, Oils in Bloom, which has the feel of an authentic Victorian apothecary. At the Foraging Goat, you can pick up homemade cullen skink pie and honey ice-cream. For the weekly shop, there’s a Tesco in the town centre and an Aldi in the retail park, plus a monthly farmers’ market.Given Haddington’s network of riverside and cross-country pathways it’s no surprise that residents seem to be an active bunch. Cycling, squash, petanque, cricket, football – name a sport and you’ll probably find a club here dedicated to it.Those less athletically inclined may find friends over at The Cheese Lady, the local fromagerie-cum-bottle shop, where you can join the “Fine Cheese Lovers Circle”. The Poldrate Arts and Crafts Centre and Made in East Lothian offer a mix of classes and gallery space for the artistically minded. Town beautification is also serious business, with community group Blooming Haddington winning gold in the Beautiful Scotland awards.If this all sounds a little sedate, order pizzas from Mazzoli in town then head to the Haddy Tap, attached to Winton Brewery. If you’re lucky, there will be live music to accompany your hyper-local pint.Where to goThe Loft is the go-to spot for coffee and brunch. The Waterside Bistro offers local beer and elevated pub grub to enjoy by the river.What to doThere’s a leisure centre with a pool, a golf course and a skate park. Catch a film at the John Gray Centre. A 10-minute drive will take you to Foxlake Adventures where you can wakeboard.Where to breatheHaddington’s idyllic position means it isn’t short of green space, but for true tranquility don’t miss the Oriental Garden, the 17th-century St Mary’s Pleasance Garden and, just out of town, the Amisfield Walled Garden.Where to buyPeriod properties run the gamut from quaint to handsome, with a four-bedroom semi on Station Road priced at nearly £650,000. New builds on the western edge of town are cheaper. For something bigger you might need to push out even further and snap up one of the many local farmhouses.KCWalesAberystwythView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Colin Burdett/AlamyAberystwyth feels a long way from any main city. Yes, Cardiff may only be 99 miles away but it can be three hours or more by road, over four by rail.But the setting is spectacular. Aber, as it is often known, sits on Cardigan Bay, and Ireland is the next place you would make landfall if you were to set off westwards. The sunsets are spectacular and on balmy evenings attract a crowd to the sweeping promenade. You can surf along this coast and play golf at some lovely links courses.Inland sits miles of rugged, sheep-dotted countryside, the peaks and valleys of the Cambrian Mountains where the rivers Severn and Wye rise.No surprise that film and television makers like this landscape. The “Welsh noir” TV police procedural Y Gwyll (its English-language version was Hinterland) used the coast and mountains as suitably moody backdrops.It’s not all about the landscapes and tourism, though. Aberystwyth is home to a university and major hospital, making it a diverse and vibrant place.The university campus, perched on Penglais Hill above the town, teaches students from more than 100 countries, lending the town more of a global feel than might be expected. Also on the hill is the National Library of Wales, one of the great libraries of the world. Opened in 1907, it is at the centre of research into the culture and heritage of Wales and the other Celtic nations, and home to rare books, manuscripts, archives, film and video, newspapers, maps and works of art.The Arts Centre is a hub for culture, creativity and entertainment, from gigs and theatre shows to exhibitions and screenings of independent films, via dance and pottery classes.Aber and the countryside around it is one of the strongholds of Cymraeg – the Welsh language. The language is spoken in the streets, the shops and all the public institutions. There are lots of courses on offer to those who wish to learn and doing so is bound to increase understanding of the town, the region and the country.Politics can be lively here. This is a Plaid Cymru heartland – the nationalist party has represented the constituency since 2017.There is lovely architecture in Aber. Elegant Victorian and Edwardian terraces look out on to beaches of dark sand and shingle. The pier was built in 1864 and was once 242m long but heavy storms over the years have reduced it to 91m, a reminder that this place can be wild in the winter.There is a nice alternative feel to Aberystwyth. For decades people with an interest in the environment and a desire to escape the rat race have found a new home here.Where to goThe delicatessen Ultracomida is a favourite for people seeking a taste of Spain. Try Sophie’s on North Parade for the hearty breakfasts, Siop y Pethe for your Welsh books and gifts.What to doThe longest electric funicular railway in Britain shuttles visitors up 237 metres to one of the world’s largest camera obscuras. Loads of exhibitions are held at the National Library and Aberystwyth Arts Centre. Take a boat and head out to see the dolphins if you don’t fancy getting in yourself.Where to breatheThe Victorian promenade is great for runs, walks, moments of mindfulness. Fill your lungs at the top of Constitution Hill, from which – on a clear day – you can see 26 mountain peaks.Where to buyA characterful three-bedroomed townhouse in the town centre, a short walk from the beach, costs around £225,000. A five-bedroomed house with sea view on Marine Terrace could set you back about £425,000.SMLondonThe Ridgeway, EnfieldView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianOpposite Chase Farm hospital in Enfield is a small network of roads off The Ridgeway that serve as a gateway to the countryside north of London. The Ridgeway itself goes on for miles, but it’s the neighbourhood around the hospital that features on our list. The Ridgeway Tavern sits here, but further up the road is the Robin Hood, which is well regarded for its food. Two minutes’ walk from that is the Botany Bay Farm and Shop, which sells locally sourced goods.Gordon Hill station is the quickest way into the city, with trains to Finsbury Park (21 minutes) and Moorgate (37 minutes). Lavender Hill, with its postwar terraces and 1930s houses, leads from the station to The Ridgeway where mock-Tudor homes and new builds sit side by side.Just north of the hospital, cyclists and walkers can join the Enfield Greenways, a part of the National Cycle Network. For shopping, nearby Enfield will provide for most of your needs.Where to goThe Sunday roasts in the Robin Hood pub are a local favourite.What to doThe Ridgeway pub holds live music nights while the Chickenshed theatre is 10 minutes by car.Where to breatheNearby Trent Country Park has 413 acres of woods, lakes and meadows, a Go Ape and a cafe.Where to buyA modern two-bed on Farorna Walk, across from the hospital, has a guide price of £570,000. A one-bed 548 sq ft flat in the new Old Royal Chace development is priced at £375,000.Shane HickeySurbiton NorthView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Greg Balfour Evans/AlamyThis is suburbia straight out of central casting … but (it could be argued) just the good bits. It’s definitely leafy, with some lovely parks and green spaces, and lots of tree-lined streets. You can hear birdsong as you stroll along them. And you’ve got the Thames right at your doorstep.For those of a certain age, Surbiton, on the south-west fringes of London, will be forever associated with classic 70s sitcom The Good Life.The Surbiton North neighbourhood still feels like a place for anyone looking to escape the urban bustle, but it’s also perfectly located for those who need quick and easy access to the Big Smoke. One of its biggest selling points is its speedy commuting time into Waterloo: the fastest trains take just 15 minutes.A walk down St James’ Road and along one of the “River Roads” will take you to the Thames in a few minutes. Via a slightly more circuitous route you can sample Claremont Gardens, a tranquil crescent-shaped park with paths, benches and a small pond.Maple Road is probably about as buzzy as this area gets. One local estate agent described it as “a bustling and trendy community stacked with coffee shops, independent stores and a diverse dining scene,” which might be overdoing it a bit, but it’s certainly a nice spot, with a lovely little park (St Andrew’s Square) and a parade of shops including well-regarded eateries, clothing boutiques and the like. Its award-winning farmers’ market held on the third Saturday of each month typically features more than 25 stalls.The top of Ewell Road also falls within this neighbourhood, as does the residential area known as Berrylands, which is popular with families.Where to goThe Harts Boatyard is a great place to watch the world go by.What to doIf you’re into messing about on the water, Thames Sailing Club, founded in 1870, is the UK’s oldest river sailing club. Just up the road is Kingston’s Rose theatre.Where to breatheFishponds Park, down the road, is a great spot for a stroll.Where to buyThe River Roads, are a top spot: you might be looking at around £475,000 for a two-bed flat in Grove Road or Cadogan Road. You can add a bit more for a Thames view.Rupert JonesClapham JunctionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: M Sobreira/AlamyEstate agents always bang on about “good transport links, close to green spaces, a variety of amenities,” but in the case of the neighbourhood around Clapham Junction, it’s not hyperbole.For journeys between Clapham Junction and London Victoria or Waterloo, you can be looking at as little as six and eight minutes respectively. For motorists, this area is ideally located for both the A3 and the A205 South Circular.On the greenery front, Clapham Common and Wandsworth Common are just down the road. While Northcote Road is loaded with trendy cafes, independent retailers, galleries, bars and clothes shops.For comedy, club nights, gigs and bingo check out the Clapham Grand or for more left-field fare, Battersea Arts Centre.The other main drag is Battersea Rise, where night owls will find bars and fast food joints. Keep walking east and you will soon get to Lavender Sweep, a residential crescent as lovely as it sounds.Where to goLocals big up The Eagle Ale House on Chatham Road. Italian restaurant Taverna Trastevere on St John’s Hill is highly rated.What to doIn terms of the wider area, there’s loads happening for people with babies and kids.Where to breatheClapham and Wandsworth Commons. Walk west or north and you’ll soon reach the Thames.Where to buyA five-bed terrace in Shelgate Road for £2.1m. Offers over £700,000 for a two-bed flat in Northcote Road.RJBounds GreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianIt’s hard to pin down where Bounds Green starts and ends but that amorphousness is no bad thing: shops and cafes that may actually be in Muswell Hill and the amenities of Bowes Park are all easily accessible.Just off the crossroads that the (Zone 3) tube station sits on are a couple of popular cafes: Hot Milk and the White Fig Bakery. On Durnsford Road you’ll find the independent Sunshine Garden Centre.There are tennis courts at Oliver Tambo Rec, which teems with footballers at the weekend, while the Bounds Green Bowls and Tennis Club is a hidden gem.The area is popular with families keen to get into the catchment area of Alexandra Park secondary school.From several points you can see Alexandra Palace, and the London landmark is a short walk away. Handy for exercise and culture, as well as headline music acts in the main hall, the theatre also regularly hosts comedy and plays.Where to goThe Ranelagh for drinks and live music. The Prince is probably technically Wood Green, but worth the walk for its excellent menu.What to doSports classes in the rec. Ally Pally for ice-skating, a go on the boating lake or something a bit more cultural.Where to breatheBluebell Wood, a patch of ancient woodland. For 200 acres of fresh air try Alexandra Park.Where to buySemi-detached 1930s properties near Alexandra Park school are upwards of £1.2m. Nearer the station, one-bedroom flats are on sale for around £300,000.HOBromleyView image in fullscreenGravel Road, Bromley, Greater London, EnglandPhotograph: Greg Balfour Evans/AlamyBromley is part large town with plenty of green space, parks and a bustling shopping centre and part London with the transport and infrastructure typical of the capital.The centre is a shopping destination and the main street backs on to the Glades shopping centre. Both are filled with a mix of chain stores and independent shops, while the main drag is the site of the weekly Charter Market.The Churchill theatre hosts comedians and shows, while St Mark’s Square houses a multiscreen cinema. The Pavilion leisure centre offers 10-pin bowling and the large pool has flumes and a wave machine.One of the town’s biggest advantages is the multiple fast rail links into central London and down to the Kent coast.There are numerous green spaces, including Jubilee Country Park, and the National Trust’s Petts Wood and Hawkwood. Bromley Common offers multiple fields, horses and Norman Park. The recently promoted Bromley FC provides EFL League Two sporting action.Where to goThe Barrel & Horn on the High Street has craft beer, a games room and music nights.What to doTake in a show at the Churchill theatre.Where breatheGo for a walk through the woods and fields of Petts Wood and Hawkwood estate and you’ll forget you’re in London.Where to buyMansions around Chislehurst from £1.5m, plentiful 1930s semis closer into town from £600,000, Victorian terraces about £400,000 and flats from £250,000.Samuel Gibbs"

After acclaimed runs in Australia and the US, she’s kicking off the UK leg of her Tension tour, celebrating an era that started two years ago with lead single Padam Padam – a phenomenon everywhere from gay clubs to TikTok – and continued with her equally hook-filled albums Tension and Tension II.In contrast to some recent over-complicated arena tour concepts from the likes of Katy Perry, the Tension show is admirably straightforward after Kylie’s big entrance, allowing her to remain the focus at all times. She races through hits – some condensed into medleys – at an astonishing pace; from 1991’s What Do I Have To Do, to Good As Gone from Tension II. For Better the Devil You Know, she changes into a red sequin jumpsuit and matching mic, leading a troupe of highlighter-coloured dancers in front of a minimalist, impressionistic backdrop. There’s something of the Pet Shop Boys’ art-pop flair in the show’s considered design choices, and in Kylie’s inherent – rather than costume-driven – flamboyance.View image in fullscreenClubby vibes … Kylie Minogue.Photograph: Martin Grimes/Getty ImagesThe primary aesthetic is the bright electropop of both Tension albums, but there’s frequent reminders of the kaleidoscope of genres in Kylie’s back catalogue. The country-inflected single Dancing would fit perfectly among the current wave of Stetson-clad pop. After briefly missing a lyric – the only break in her consummate professionalism – Kylie invites a backing dancer to join in with her. This relaxed mood continues as she moves to the B-stage, where she sings a cappella snippets of fan requests: early single Never Too Late, Nick Cave duet Where the Wild Roses Grow, even Spinning Around B-side Paper Dolls. A sweet acoustic sing-along of 2020 single Say Something harks back to its lockdown-era genesis (its parent album Disco was “finished in my kitchen” during the pandemic) kicking in to full party mode before we think too much of real-world worries, past or present.Stock Aitken Waterman’s 20 greatest songs – ranked!Read moreIt’s not the only song to get a refreshing revamp. Many of Kylie’s best known hits are dolled up to suit the clubby vibes of her current era: the tropical noir of On a Night Like This is transformed into a near-future techno odyssey; The Locomotion (“from a far away place … called the 80s!”) gets a clubby sheen while retaining its kitsch charm; and Spinning Around has a new piano house mix, a reinvention worthy of this ultimate comeback anthem. The finest rework comes towards the end, as Kylie takes the stage in a gold and black cape for the penultimate act. Shrouded in dry ice, and bolstered by heavy, propulsive drums, she performs cult 1994 single Confide In Me as a drama-laden doom metal ballad, upping the already high stakes of the original to stratospheric levels. It’s also a fine showcase for her vocals, allowing her to stretch and reach for big sustained notes. It’s a six-star moment in a five-star show: someone get her in the studio withStephen O’Malley.After this emotional high, there’s just enough time to collect ourselves for the final run: taking us from the moody swagger of 2003’s Slow to the open-hearted emotion of All the Lovers, to a high energy encore of Padam Padam and Love at First Sight. At the show’s end, Kylie seems endearingly overwhelmed by the raucous audience response, but this belies supreme confidence: she knows she doesn’t need extraneous bells and whistles to carry this bravura show.Explore more on these topicsKylie MinoguePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

After her elder son Vincent died in 2017, at the age of 16, Li wrote a novel for him.Where Reasons Endis a conversation, sometimes an argument, between a mother and her dead son, and it is a work of fiction that doesn’t feel fictional at all, because it’s also an encounter between a writer in mourning and the son she can still conjure up on the page. “With Vincent’s book there was that joy of meeting him again in the book, hearing him, seeing him, it was like he was alive,” she says. The book had 16 chapters, one for each year of his life, and Li felt she could have spent the rest of her life writing it, and also that she could not linger.When her younger son James died in 2024, aged 19, Li wanted to write a book for him, too. James was harder to write for. Her sons were best friends but “such different boys”, she says. She and James did not argue in the same way as she did with Vincent, and he would hate to be thrust into the spotlight, or for her to write a “sentimental” book. James had a mind so brilliant that his inner workings were often unreachable – by seven or eight he’d open meal-time conversations with “apparently the Higgs boson …” or “apparently the predatory tunicates …”. He did not speak often, but could converse in eight languages and his phone was set to Lithuanian, a ninth. He once described Daniel Tammet’s Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant as the only book that captured how he felt about the world. If Vincent lived “feelingly”, James lived “thinkingly”, Li says, and she wanted her book for him to be “as clear as James, as logical and rational”.View image in fullscreenFor months after his death, Li worried that she lacked the vocabulary to write about James, but then she began writing and realised “of course I could do this, this is what I do”. Things in Nature Merely Grow, her memoir of losing her sons, is resolutely unsentimental, and yet it might wind you with its emotional force. She wrote it in less than two months. Often people ask her if writing the book was cathartic. “No, never!” she replies. If it offered solace, “it was the solace of thinking”. “When I was writing the book it felt like I was at the centre of a hurricane. The eye of the hurricane is the stillest place. It’s very quiet and clear,” she says. And then she finished writing, and she stepped back into the hurricane. “My life goes on as a very strange woman,” she tells me, strange because her losses are so extreme: “Going out, people will always look at me and say, ‘Poor woman’.”We meet at her home in Princeton, where photographs of her sons and paintings by Vincent decorate the walls, and every bookshelf is stacked two-deep. It is early spring, still cold, and the trees remain bare, but Li planted 1,600 bulbs in autumn and in the garden are bright clusters of daffodils, hyacinths and tulips. Gardening, which requires a constant revision of ambitions, is good practice for novel-writing and for life, Li observes, but these flowers are not a metaphor. She rejects the idea that grief is a process, that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Even if she could “turn the page”, as the Chinese phrase goes, she would not want to. Li often looks up the etymology of words and notes that “grief” derives from burden. “My children were not my burden. My sadness is not my burden,” she says.View image in fullscreenYiyun Li’s husband, Dapeng, with sons Vincent, left, and James.Photograph: Yiyun LiLi is the author of 12 books – among them novels, short-story collections, memoirs and literary criticism – and in 2010 she won a MacArthur genius grant. She is 52, slight, with cropped hair and a gentle manner. Soon after I arrive, she asks if I have children, which I do, and she says she realises this interview must be hard for me, too. She makes tea and puts out a plate of biscuits and checks several times that I am not cold or hungry. Later, she cooks lunch. At Princeton University, where she is a professor of creative writing, she says she tries to cultivate the right distance with her students, neither aloof nor maternal – and then sometimes she finds herself asking whether they’ve drunk enough water that day.In her fiction classes, Li bans her students from writing about car crashes. In high emergencies people’s feelings are always the same, she tells them, and these extreme emotions are almost impossible to describe. She agrees with the poet Marianne Moore that “the deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; not in silence, but restraint”. Very occasionally in her writing, Li conveys a feeling directly, and then it is often startling, a highly contained explosion. “Sometimes I am so sad I feel like a freak,” the mother tells her son in Where Reasons End. But mostly we understand something of Li’s pain because she conveys it indirectly. “I am in an abyss,” she writes in Things in Nature Merely Grow. “If an abyss is where I shall be for the rest of my life, the abyss is my habitat.”Another reason extreme pain is so hard to convey is because everyone’s abyss is different. She tells me that her husband is the only person who can ever understand hers. Li says she feels grateful if anyone finds comfort in her writing, but she knows some will not, and she does not want to become a figurehead for bereaved parents. “I realise we all have our own pain, and I cannot represent anyone,” she says. After Vincent’s death she received many messages from suicidal teenagers and parents who have outlived their children, and after James died, she received even more, this time from families who had lost twin boys, or multiple siblings, to suicide. She has recently removed her contact information from the internet. “I have given my words, that’s the only thing I can give,” she says; she is not a mental health professional, and she does not have the capacity to support strangers in severe distress.After her sons died, she reread Shakespeare, Grief Lessons (Euripides’s plays translated by Anne Carson), CS Lewis’s A Grief Observed and Joan Didion’s accounts of losing her husband and daughter,The Year of Magical ThinkingandBlue Nights. Li feels that Didion’s approach to writing about bereavement is closest to her own: both focus on their thoughts, rather than their feelings. When Didion describes how after her husband died a hospital social worker called her a “good customer”, because she remained calm, Li recognised herself. Both times the police arrived at her home with bad news, Li remained composed and noticed every detail. “Two things are good about me,” she tells me at one point. “I’m sturdy and I’m low maintenance.”Li has always used reading as an “escape”. “Children of abusive parents might grow into rebels, or they might become escape artists,” she writes, and Li, who grew up in Beijing with an abusive mother, chose the latter. Her father was a nuclear physicist, and Li was a highly gifted mathematician. After completing a year’s compulsory military service, she studied science at Peking University before moving to the US at the age of 23 to study immunology at the University of Iowa. Her husband, Dapeng Li, a software engineer whom she met at university in China, did not join her until a year later. Feeling bored, Li took an evening adult education class in fiction. She loved it. When she wrote her first story, about a military training exercise, her instructor asked her if she’d ever thought of publishing. Inspired, she joined undergraduate creative writing classes and then applied to the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop.They took their own lives knowing we would accept and respect their decisionThe first time she applied she was rejected, but the story she had submitted was published in the Paris Review. After she got into Iowa, on the second attempt, she started publishing stories in the New Yorker. For many years, she continued her PhD in immunology, studying asthma in mice, and because she also had small children, she wrote from midnight to 4am each night. In 2005, she published her debut short story collection, A Thousand Years of Good Prayers, to critical acclaim.Li has always written in English, and she will not permit her books to be translated into Chinese. She describes this decision as so deeply personal that she resists any political interpretation. She and her husband speak to one another in Mandarin Chinese, but she now thinks and dreams in English and says she retains the advantage of not writing in her mother tongue. “I’m very careful with my words. Every time I put down a word, I think through it and make sure it’s the right word. But when you’re a native speaker you sometimes just use it automatically, right?” She says she has “a more precise personality” in English. Her writing, and her decision to do so in English, has made her a target in the Chinese media, and since her sons’ deaths she has been subject to vicious coverage.In 2017, Li wrote a memoir,Dear Friend, from My Life I Write to You in Your Life, detailing how she was hospitalised twice with depression in 2012 after trying to kill herself. She believes her chronic sleep deprivation, as well as coming off psychiatric medication, played a role in her breakdown. In her new memoir, Li wonders how much her two suicide attempts, and her writing about them, affected her children. By trying to end her own life, did she also make them see suicide as a possibility to end their suffering? “I ask that question without any self-incrimination. I ask that question because it’s a very natural question,” she tells me. She is aware that people like to seek neat explanations for suicide and someone to blame, and usually they blame the parents. “I am very realistic in that I would always acknowledge that I am limited as their mother. I was limited, and I am still limited as a mother, so I can only do my best.”She knows, however, that she parented them with thoughtfulness and care, and she fought to create space for them to live as they wanted and be fully themselves. She has been thinking a lot recently about how her son Vincent, who as a young teenager insisted on walking to school alone, a two-mile route through woodland, would often leave the house armed with pepper spray. The pepper spray would not protect him, she knew, but it gave him a sense of control and independence. “That pepper spray is about how we brought up our children, or how people bring up their children. You have to let them be, but the world is so bad, right? It’s not a safe place.” As hard as it is, she accepts her children’s decision to end their lives. “Respect and understanding are the two most important things I’ve given them,” she says. “This is a very sad fact of our lives, they took their own lives knowing we would accept and respect their decision.”Since James’s death, Li has published two New Yorker short stories featuring a protagonist named Lilian, who has also lost two children to suicide. “I gave Lilian my life, but Lilian is not me,” she says. She has just completed a third Lilian story and there will probably be more. “I’m still learning how to live as me,” she says, and by writing her experiences into fiction she can think through her life, but at a distance. The Lilian stories are a side project. She has also just completed a big, more than 500-page novel, the first of a trilogy set around the turn of the 19th century. When she is writing fiction, she can feel fully immersed in her work. “It’s just you and your characters and you can spend a lot of time away with them, sort of away from the world,” she says. She feels like she discovers her characters, rather than makes them. “I believe God creates characters,” she says, and then she laughs at herself, “but I don’t believe in God.”Sometimes Li thinks that writing fiction helped her prepare for her own tragedies. In her first novel, The Vagrants, published in 2009, she writes of an older couple, both beggars, who adopted seven girls, all of whom were later taken from them by the government. Li’s children were still young when she wrote the book, but when she reread it recently, she noticed how the elderly couple were always talking to one another about their lost children, in order to preserve their memories, just as she and her husband do now. “Even when I was younger, maybe I was rehearsing,” she says. “I think you have to be very clear-eyed to write fiction well, and that’s also probably a very good rehearsal for meeting my life.” Then she adds, sounding for a moment surprised, “It’s very strange, isn’t it?”Extract‘My children are timeless now’A mother gives birth to a firstborn, and blunders through the baby’s infanthood. Then she gives birth to another baby. The second time things are somewhat familiar, less daunting, and yet just as many things can go wrong.Losing a child for the second time, I knew some things to be important: sleep, hydration, small and frequent snacks, exercise every day. Get out of bed at the regular time and never ruminate while lying in bed. Make the effort to brew good coffee in the morning. Read – one act of Shakespeare is good enough, so is a page of Euclid’s geometry, a chapter of Henry James’s biography, or one poem – from Wallace Stevens’s collection. Write – there is no reason to stop working and there is also no reason to strive for regular working hours. Anything that prevents agitation or rumination is good for the mind. And, most important of all, for me: radical acceptance. The death of a child realigns time and space. If an abyss is where I shall be for the rest of my life, the abyss is my habitat. One should not waste energy fighting one’s habitat.I have only this abyss, which is my life. And an inevitable part of existing in this abyss is exhaustion, which the second time I learned to accept without protest. After James died, flowers arrived in front of our door. The flowers deserved attention, but I had to turn myself inside out to find the energy needed for that attention. (Here’s a small thing I’ve learned: if one is to send flowers as a gesture of condolence, better to ensure the flowers arrive already arranged in a vase.)In that exhaustion, still there is some living to do. What was within my capacity I would not shy away from, as work is as essential as breathing and sleeping.I did not stop writing or take time off from teaching when Vincent died. Writing, teaching, gardening, grocery shopping, cooking, doing laundry – all these activities are time-bound, and they do not compete with my children, who are timeless now. There is no rush, as I will have every single day, for the rest of my life, to think about Vincent and James, outside time, outside the many activities of everyday life.And this, among other reasons, is why I am against the word “grief,” which in contemporary culture seems to indicate a process that has an end point: the sooner you get there, the sooner you prove yourself to be a good sport at living, and the less awkward people around you will feel. Sometimes people ask me where I am in the grieving process, and I wonder whether they understand anything at all about losing someone. How lonely the dead would feel, if the living were to stand up from death’s shadow, clap their hands, dust their pants, and say to themselves and to the world, I am done with my grieving; from this point on it’s life as usual, business as usual.I don’t want an end point to my sorrow. The death of a child is not a heatwave or a snowstorm, nor an obstacle race to rush through and win, nor an acute or chronic illness to recover from. What is grief but a word, a shortcut, a simplification of something much larger than that word? Thinking about my children is like air, like time. Thinking about them will only end when I reach the end of my life.Things in Nature Merely Grow by Yiyun Li is published by 4th Estate on 22 May.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Behind him, on a white shelf, is an enormous plastic mouth with perfectly aligned teeth.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Among stacks of files on the shelves below the oversized mouth, there are board games, a crystal-making kit, a pottery craft set – unwelcome reminders that this is not actually a dental clinic but a family home. The toys will need to be covered up before Mew’s new plans can be put into action. “The final thing for me to do is to go to Ikea and buy some white boxes,” he tells me. “Then I can sit here and I can change the world.”Mew’s desk is the pulpit from which he spreads his gospel about optimal posture, how it can make our faces more attractive and – he claims – save us from an early death. (It is an adjustable desk, with a digital scale displaying its height; every three hours, an alarm goes off reminding Mew to stand up.) He is obsessed with posture, and with suboptimal faces. All around him he sees a world plagued by avoidable ugliness that he fears is leading to a public health crisis with existential consequences for humankind. It’s an obsession that has made Mew the world’s first viral orthodontist, and turned his name into a verb.If you haven’t heard of “mewing” – the postural technique that involves lodging your tongue in the roof of your mouth for hours on end to “align the teeth, accentuate your cheekbones, sharpen your jawline and even straighten your nose naturally”,as he promises in hisUltimate Mewing Guide– ask a teenager to explain it to you. First popularised on “incel” forums a decade ago, Google searches for mewing spiked last year whenlooksmaxxing– the practice of doing whatever you can to make the most of what nature gave you – exploded on TikTok. Mewing promises visible results without expense, surgery, braces or any clinical intervention. The same algorithm that introducedAndrew Tateto the masses has caused mewing videos to be seen billions of times on TikTok alone; most feature boys, but girls are now doing it, too.Over the past year, teachers across the US and UK have complained that students are refusing to answer questions in class because opening their mouths would interrupt their mewing. Themewing subreddit– filled with before-and-after images of mostly young men pulling expressions that call to mindZoolander’s Blue Steel– has 64,000 members. Mew’sYouTube channelhas more than half a million subscribers; his Ultimate Mewing Guide alone has attracted 9m views since it was uploaded a year ago. Mewing has been discussed everywhere from Vogue to The Joe Rogan Experience to ITV’s This Morning. Mewing has gone mainstream.Mew, 55, has a remarkable jaw. It is a lantern jaw, wide and square, framed by sinuous, muscular chops, the love child of a Disney prince and an XL bully. His jaw, he tells me, is the product of both constant mewing and the intervention and experimentation of his father, theorthodontist John Mew, now 96, who made him wear a bespoke palate-expanding device throughout his childhood. John Mew came up with the ideas that Mike Mew promotes in his videos. The latest of three generations of orthodontists, Mew is determined to continue his father’s crusade against weak jaws and what his family calls “poor facial form”.But at the same time as mewing was going gangbusters online, Mike Mew’s orthodontic career was disintegrating. In November, three decades after he qualified as a dentist, he was struck off the register of the General Dental Council (GDC) following complaints of unnecessary and harrowing treatment of two children in his clinic; a six-year-old patient was said to have suffered “seizure-like episodes” when asked to comply with Mew’s treatment plan. Mew is nowofficially suspended, pending his appeal.Your face is the CV of your health. Intrinsically, you know what looks healthy. We’ve got a word for that – attractiveMew thinks the disciplinary investigation against him was ideologically motivated. He was first reported to the GDCin 2017; years of uncertainty over the case destroyed his business, his family and his mental health, he tells me. He and his wife have separated; on the day I visit he’s taking care of his two young daughters alone. It is also the day after he met with liquidators. “The company went bust yesterday,” he laments. “I’m struggling. Until last week, I couldn’t sit down at a keyboard. Right now, the whole mission is stuck.”I am here to find out what that mission really is. Over the five hours I will spend with Mew in Tunbridge Wells, he will appraise the attractiveness of my face no fewer than four times, entirely unbidden. (I am “middle of the road”, unfortunately – more on that later – but there are measures I can take to improve things, should I have the necessary will and commitment.) He will refer to some of the children who appeared at his clinic as “little shits”. He will make breathtaking generalisations about beauty, linking them to alarming claims about health. And within all this will be a simple question that traditional orthodontics cannot yet fully answer: why do so many people in the developed world now have misaligned jaws and wonky teeth?Mew argues that modern lifestyles are to blame. He intends to use his home studio to spread the message around the world. And it is likely to travel far: it chimes with prevailing anxieties about masculinity, our growing mistrust of mainstream doctrine and our total obsession with our looks. Mew provides an accessible solution and an easy answer, but it comes with uncomfortable implications: if your face is unattractive, he argues, it’s your fault.“The beauty of faces is predominantly in the maxilla, the top jaw, the mid-third of the face,” Mew tells me, gesturing across his cheekbones from ear to ear. He turns to one of his massive monitors and clicks on a file entitled “Excellent natural development”. Thumbnails of 20 or so square-jawed people fill the screen: the models Tyson Beckford, Jordan Barrett and Tara Lynn; Nelson Mandela and Kurt Cobain. Most of the images are of Indigenous men and women – Inuit people, members of different Amazonian tribes, people from east and southern Africa in traditional dress. His cursor lingers over an image of Kylie Jenner. (The extent to which Jenner’s face is an example of “natural development” is, of course, open to serious question.)If this is good facial form, I ask, what’s bad? A few clicks and Mark Zuckerberg fills the screen. “He’s a great example. Look!” Mew says, with disgust. “His whole face is lengthened. And look at thistiny, narrow smile.”Next, he pulls up an image of some Maasai people, all with broad jaws and perfect teeth. “They stand bolt upright, big, broad smiles with all 32 teeth in, including the wisdom teeth, and space behind the wisdom teeth. They look just like our ancestors.” He is talking about skulls he says he has seen in museums. And while I can’t find studies that indicate all Maasai people have good teeth, Mew’s observation about our ancestors does appear to be backed up by anthropologists: examples of jaw misalignment – malocclusion – in human skulls from the time of hunter-gatherers arevanishingly rare.Most orthodontists argue there is a strong hereditary component to malocclusion.The American Association of Orthodonistssays facial structure results from “a complex interplay of genetics, bone growth and muscle development”. But Mew says genes can’t explain it. “There’s been a massive change in craniofacial structure. It’s been too fast to be genetic. It doesn’t add up.”Mew has been writing letters to dental journals asking for a debate on the causes of malocclusionsince 2009. Orthodontists who work with fixed braces are pulling the teeth straight without widening the jaw to accommodate them, he says, treating the effects without bothering to investigate the causes. “It’s rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic: it looks nice, but does anyone notice the deck is starting to tilt? We’re treating almost certainly over half the children in the developed world.”Two things have changed in the developed world that Mew holds responsible. First, he says, our food is much softer: we don’t chew enough, so our jaw muscles are weaker than our ancestors’, or those of people who don’t eat processed food. “I’ve got a strong jaw. A strong jaw is also a big jaw. I have more space for my teeth in that big jaw.” He slaps his chops with his palms. “I’veworkedit. You get a strong jaw byusingit. That’s why I think kids should be chewing gum. It’snot rocket science.” (Despite Mew’s admittedly mighty jaw, I can’t help noticing that two of his teeth are crossing slightly on his bottom jaw, in visible disobedience.)View image in fullscreen‘There’s a scandal going on here.’Photograph: Murray Ballard/The GuardianSecond, Mew argues, we’re getting blocked noses – perhaps from pollution or allergies or colds – and it’s leading to an epidemic of mouth-breathing. “I don’t know what’s caused the nasal obstructions; that’s not my area,” he says with a dismissive wave of his hand. “But if you’ve got a blocked nose, you’re going to have to take the tongue off the roof of the mouth, separate your lips and hang your mouth down. If you have weak jaw musclesandyou hang your mouth open, then you look like this.” He stands up to pose – slack-jawed, tongue fat, neck curved – in a grotesque parody of a mouth-breathing nerd. “Your face lengthens. The face drops down as the mandible opens and it gets longer and thinner.”Mew’s father invented the concept of “orthotropics”, meaning “correct growth”. He theorised that the face can be made to develop in a certain way if a person exercises their jaw and adopts the correct posture. “Bones are slaves to the muscles,” Mew tells me: hold yourself properly and your face will grow accordingly.But Mew makes onerous demands of his disciples. “You need to have a complete change in not only your tongue posture but also how you use the muscles in your face and the posture you have for sitting and standing,” he tells his YouTube audience, recommending that they mew whenever they are not talking or eating; he suggests those who find it difficult begin with eight hours of mewing a day.I ask for a mewing lesson. He makes me take a sip of water, hold it on my tongue, bite my teeth together, pull a big cheesy smile, raise my eyebrows and then swallow. This isn’t even mewing yet – it’s so I can identify the back third of my tongue. Next, I need to pull my tongue back, put my teeth together, swallow with a “Mona Lisa” face (expressionless above my mouth) again and again, with my tongue sucked on to the roof of my palate. “Then all the soft tissues will mould into that position. And once you’ve got that working really well, it stays there. You can hold the suction indefinitely.”I feel silly doing it. But I need to, Mew says. “Most people who look suboptimal are using the wrong muscles.Youhave narrow lips because you tend to suck them in. If you did this” – he pouts – “they’d look bigger.”This completely throws me. You’re talking specifically aboutmylips, I ask. “Your upper lip’s narrow,” he replies, matter-of-factly. “You should be more hollow here.” He motions either side of my cheeks. “You need your tongue on the roof of your mouth a little bit, because you’re just alittlebit deficient here.” He shrugs. “It’s not rocket science.”This is about more than beauty, Mew insists. If people are mouth-breathing with weak jaws, he claims, they are putting themselves in danger. “The space for the tongue, the airway and the teeth – the vital space – israpidlydecreasing.” He has invented a term for this: craniofacial dystrophy. “A long time ago, I realised we needed a pathology,” he tells me, sagely. He shows me an animation entitled “Craniofacial Dystrophy – General”. It features a bald head, ghostly white, its face growing downwards, its nose lengthening, its eyes drooping, until it ends up cartoonishly hideous. I imagine teenagers watching this animation, listening to Dr Mew in the blue scrubs he wears in his videos, and reacting in horror. Craniofacial dystrophy sounds very medical, I say. “It’s the correct term.” Isn’t he just talking about ugliness? “Incorrect facial form,” he shrugs. “If your face isn’t formed properly you won’t live as long, because of sleep apnoea – 20% of people over 60 are going to die a decade early from sleep apnoea and its consequences.”When I ask what the evidence is that links stop-start breathing during sleep with malocclusion, he draws two exponential graphs in the air. “You can see malocclusions going up like this. You can see sleep apnoea going up like this.” But correlation is not causation. How can he prove that misaligned jaws are causing sleep apnoea? Mew pauses for several seconds, with his hand over his mouth. “I’m going to have to come back to you on that,” he says. An hour later, he will find on his shelves a book entitled Sleep Disorders in Paediatric Dentistry, which he will slam down on the desk in front of me. “There we go – you wanted the information. It’s bound to be in there.” When it comes to hard evidence, Mew can be frustratingly vague.If you listen carefully to the wording in Mew’s videos, you can hear caveats: mewing “may” diminish your wrinkles; it’s only “potentiallyextending your lifespan by enlarging your airways”. But I can imagine the delicate phrasing will be lost amid some of his genuinely alarming claims. In his Ultimate Mewing Guide, he compares a pair of identical twins: one used orthotropic techniques; the other went to a traditional orthodontist and had braces. “The twin treated with orthodontics has a downward developed upper jaw. That means he probably has less air space, which means he will probably be more prone to sleep apnoea, which is likely to reduce life expectancy.” Amid theprobablysand thelikelys, the message Mew wants viewers to take away is clear: the twin who had braces will die first.You’d be crazy to try this because it’s so hard, but you’d be crazy not to because what else are you doing with your tongue?“I think it’s true,” Mew shrugs when I put this to him. “I stand by those statements. I would love to argue these points with someone. I want to go as close to the line as I can to provoke a discussion.”Sleep apnoea is only one of an extraordinary range of problems Mew attributes to malocclusion. He reels them off. “Jaw joint issues, tinnitus, sinusitis, deviated septums, all ENT [ear, nose and throat] problems from glue ear to you name it, forward head posture, ADHD.” He claims that ADHD is caused by sleep deprivation, which is caused by sleep apnoea, which comes from malocclusion. While people with ADHD are muchmore likelyto have sleep disorders, the problems may be caused by the ADHD. Again, correlation does not prove causation.The twins in his Ultimate Guide to Mewing video make me think of my sister, who needed braces, when I never did. We grew up in the same environment; we were being fed the same foods. How does Mew explain that? “You might have enjoyed chewing more. She might have hung her mouth open when you didn’t,” he replies. “Now, is your sister’s face more or less aesthetically pleasing than yours?”I can’t answer that, I say, flummoxed – she’s my sister.“The theory I would propose,” he declares, “is you would have a more balanced facial form than she did.”For Mew, beauty and health are intertwined. “Your face is the CV of your health. Intrinsically, you know what looks healthy. We’ve got a word for that, and it’sattractive.” We have evolved to be attracted to healthy people; if you have “craniofacial dystrophy”, “people are aware that you are not as good partner material”.It’s easy to see how the sweeping statements Mew makes would gain traction online – particularly on incel message boards. They make intuitive sense, they are alarming enough to go viral and they purport to contain truths hidden by the orthodontic establishment, an industry that’s profiting from people who, Mew argues, can achieve better results for free. He claims to be giving powerless people agency – over their looks, their health, their love lives, their whole destinies.“The kids have realised that not only did they not want orthodontics,” Mew says, “but their parents were being deceived to get orthodontics. This has caused damage to their health, and they’re desperately trying to recover. They are an angry group. And there’s a hell of a lot of them.”Mew swears that he never knew what the manosphere was before he began to become a phenomenon among incels. He started making videos in 2014 as a marketing device to bring customers to the family practice in Purley, south London, which he took over after his father retired. Parents were coming to the clinic with no understanding of the treatment their children would receive there. The Mews advocated the use of “bioblocs” – bespoke palate-expanding devices invented by Mew’s father – to encourage “correct” facial growth; they are designed to hurt if your posture is wrong. (After a career spent arguing that traditional fixed braces were unnecessary and even dangerous, the GDC took away Mew’s father’s licence to practise in 2017, when he was 89, following claims of false advertising and breaching patient confidentiality.)“At the time, we weren’t getting in the right type of patients,” Mew tells me. “People turned up to see us expecting someone to make them better, and when you tell them they’ve got to make themselves better, it’s never going to work.”A tech-savvy nurse at the clinic suggested they churn out lots of quick videos with Mew going through a few technical terms, explaining his father’s ideas and his belief that faces aren’t fixed and can be trained to change. The videos didn’t get much of an audience until he got an invitation to speak at something called the 21 Convention at a hotel in London. Mew says he knew “absolutely nothing” about21 Studios, the organisation behind it. But its homepage tells you everything you’d need to know. “Since 2006, 21 Studios has been at the cutting edge of masculine self-improvement for men and fathers,” it reads. “100% Toxic Masculinity. Zero Compromise. Zero Apology.”Jaws have long been associated with masculinity. Testosterone makes jaws more pronounced during puberty, which has led some to assume that the bigger the jaw, the manlier the man. Some transgender womenpay thousandsto have their jaw narrowed with facial feminisation surgery;some young menhave been paying similar amounts to have implants to make their jaw appear broader. A chiselled jaw is a defining feature of a “chad” – a term used on incel message boards for the men who are supposed to get all the women. The manosphere had been crying out for a man like Mew.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But you need to do thisall the time.’” Instead of using a biobloc to expand the dental arches – the curved row of teeth – in the jaws of children, Mew was advocating a postural technique for adults, with the tongue lodged in the palate. Thus mewing was born.It wasn’t called mewing yet – the name emerged organically, on the message boards. “We had a Google alert on my name, and we saw some people were starting to ask questions in a wonderful forum called Sluthate,” Mew tells me with an overexaggerated chuckle that makes his shoulders bounce up and down. Now defunct, Sluthate was a notorious platform that, in a previous incarnation (PUAHate), had been the home ofElliot Rodger, the self-described incel whokilled six people and himselfin a California mass shooting in 2014.What did he know about Sluthate? “Zero,” Mew replies immediately, as if the clue wasn’t in the name. He started engaging with forum members, sharing tips on how to mew properly, making videos responding to their questions. They liked his outsider status and loved his message: that the orthodontic elites had been lying to them, and that they had agency over their looks. He put his previous marketing strategy aside; instead of trying to reach parents of young children, he now wanted to talk to anyone who would listen. “Getting the information out is my life’s mission.”His clinic was supposed to treat only patients under the age of 12, but it began to be bombarded with inquiries from young men. “It became painful. Reception would complain that people were calling back-to-back and no one else could get through.” Mew says he did take on a few adults – “people that I liked” – but the bulk of his patients were still children. Just before Covid hit, a third of his clients were travelling from overseas.At one point, he tells me, he had a consultation with a woman and her three children who were prepared to fly over from their home in Houston, Texas, for regular treatment with Mew. “I just refused her. I said, ‘It’s not going to work. If I was treating you, with your motivation, that would be great. But you’ve got three little shits here. I can just see from the way they’re standing there, they ain’t going to do anything I ask.’”A woman waves at Mew as we walk past and he waves back, warmly. Then he turns to me, horrified. ‘You see that gummy smile?’An orthotropic approach requires serious commitment. “Unless you, as an individual, put the effort into change, you won’t get a result,” Mew continues. “I’ve had one or two cases that didn’t go well, and the parents literally said to me, ‘Mike, you tried your best. I know the little shit here never did what you wanted.’”This is perhaps the biggest problem with orthotropics, in empirical, scientific terms: the theory that, with enough dedication, people can direct the growth of their faces is impossible to disprove. If a child with a biobloc doesn’t see results, Mew can point to the child’s lack of commitment. If someone who mews doesn’t achieve “correct facial form”, he can simply claim that the mewer hasn’t been mewing correctly, or for long enough.Mew’s keenest disciples have documented their success. Some, such asAstroSky(with 57,000 YouTube subscribers), have become looksmaxxing influencers themselves. And many of the before-and-after mewing pictures on TikTok and Reddit appear to show visible changes over several years in the lives of young people. But couldn’t those same people just be going through puberty and emerging with a more defined face?“I’m sure there’s an element of truth there,” Mew concedes. “However, I’ve seen enoughmajorchanges from mewing that are not questionable. The change is so extreme – their friends are talking about it, the family’s talking about it – but it’s not always obvious in photographs.” Like much of what Mew argues, it’s supposed to be obvious to everyone, even if it can’t yet be scientifically proved.An alarm goes off on Mew’s phone, reminding him that he has to pick up his daughters from primary school. He invites me to join him on the school run. “Bad,” he mutters as we approach the school. “Bad. One in two so far. It’s not going well.” And then I realise – he is assessing the faces of the children as they come out of the gates towards us. “It’s going to ruin their lives.” His teeth are clenched. “This is a lovely school, it really is.Reallyhelpful teachers. If only I could get them to get the kids to keep their mouths fucking closed.” A woman – perhaps a teacher – waves at Mew as we walk past and he waves back, warmly. Then he turns to me, horrified. “You see that gummy smile?”Back at home, Mew fixes his daughters a drink and a snack (bread and butter, surprisingly soft), and reminds them that they should be chewing gum at all times while not eating. The girls entertain themselves in the living room while Mew and I return to his office/television studio.“All those kids.” He takes a deep breath. “We have a national health system. Isn’t it in our interests to help them grow up? The newspapers are contacting me, and I’m going, ‘There’s a fucking scandal going on here. There should be no excuse for ugly people. Twenty per cent of people are going to die a decade early because of sleep apnoea.’ And everyone’s going, ‘Oh, well. Tell me a bit more about mewing.’” He sighs in frustration.Mew was not struck off the GDC register because of his claims linking early deaths to poor facial form. He was found unfit to practise on three counts: providing unnecessary treatment to a six-year-old girl, Patient A; harming a six-year-old boy, Patient B, with unnecessary treatment; and making claims in a YouTube video that encouraging growth in craniofacial structure could lead to “expansion of the brain”.“As far as I was concerned, Patient A got a stunning success,” Mew says, scratching at some invisible blemish on his desk. “The mother thinks that; the father thinks that.” The tribunal accepted that the family had no complaints. Mew was reported to the GDC by a hospital consultant who happened to see Patient A in the middle of her treatment with Mew and was concerned by what he saw.View image in fullscreen‘I was being had up for being a heretic.’Photograph: Murray Ballard/The GuardianPatient B’s parentsdidcomplain. They had paid Mew £12,500 for three years of treatment, during which their six-year-old son was supposed to wear a head and neck appliance 24 hours a day. (The tribunal heard that Mew initially wanted the boy to begin treatment at age two, but decided against it as he didn’t have enough teeth at the time.) They said he struggled to keep the devices on for as long as the treatment demanded. A dentist who worked with Mew at his clinic told the tribunal that the boy would have “seizure-like episodes if pushed too far” to wear them.Tantrums, Mew says. “Basically, he would have a meltdown, scream and shout. It was obvious that the child was in charge of this family,” he declares. “You’ve got children. Have you had any experience with ‘seizure-like episodes’? Banging fists on the floor? Clearly, the boy was playing them up.”The boy’s mother told the tribunal Mew was a “dangerous professional who needs to listen to his patients more”. But Mew claims the problem was that the boy’s parents were neither enforcing compliance nor stopping the treatment, and the devices hurt because they weren’t being used as directed. “I’d already said to the mum, ‘If this is not for you, then please stop.’”In the third count against him, the GDC claims Mew stated in a YouTube video that creating enough space for the tongue can influence “expansion of the brain, expansion of the dental arches as well”. But when Mew shows me the video and I hear his words in context, it’s clear to me that he is making a joke: he’s saying if people change their mindset and are open to new ideas, their dental arches might expand, too. Still, the GDC ruled against him on all counts and he lost his licence to practise. Mew’s appeal against the ruling will reach the high court this summer.After Mew was struck off in November, the British Orthodontic Society (BOS)issued a statement: “There is no scientific evidence to suggest patients can change the shape of their face or improve their intelligence by chewing or holding teeth and the tongue in a closed position, or indeed making any kind of facial movements. The BOS funds research into orthodontics and is always willing to consider alternative views provided these are backed by scientific evidence.”Mew still maintains that he has all the evidence – the establishment is just unwilling to recognise it. “I was being had up for being a heretic,” he says, simply. For producing wildly popular videos that went against the orthodontic orthodoxy – and raising questions about prevention of malocclusion, rather than simply treatment – he believes he has been martyred.While Mew was going through the tribunal, the world began to pay attention to the danger ultra-processed foods may pose to our health. A growingbody of evidencehas begun to emerge suggesting that soft foods may indeed be making our jaws narrower. But rather than writing research papers and submitting them to scientific journals, Mew has been setting up his home studio. He wants the debate on the causes of malocclusion to take place on TikTok and YouTube.The legal proceedings have already cost Mew £600,000, he says, as well as his clinical practice and his former family home. Last November, he wrotea blog postcalling on the GDC to take seriously the number of suicides among dentists facing fitness-to-practise tribunals. Today, he looks like a broken man.“Everyone’s screaming at me to start making videos,” he tells me. “The whole marketing team is incapable of moving forward because I am not producing enough stuff. I’ve just been depressed.”Mew now depends on his mewing content to make a living. But it’s a tricky business model: the beauty of mewing was the promise that people could achieve good looks for free if they worked hard enough. Mewers can mew without Mew.In his Ultimate Guide to Mewing – over images of smashed clocks, endless calendars and stacks of $100 bills – he says attempting to do so could be a big mistake, warning of “lost time spanning months or even years as you wade through the complexity of mewing without guidance. In the long run, this could prove costlier.” He points viewers towards his new paid-for app. Prices start at £25.The experts: dentists on 22 quick, easy ways to care for your teethRead moreOnce he feels mentally strong enough, he tells me, he will “go hard for the truth” on his YouTube channel, from which he still earns revenue. “I think that we’re probably going to have to push on the sensationalism a little bit, because I need to gain traction. I genuinely want the best for the population, so I’m willing to bend the rules.”His big mission is to get everyone to start documenting their faces on their phones and send the images to him, along with details of their lifestyle, so he can collect data. “I want research by the people, for the people,” he says. Parents should be uploading images of their kids’ faces, too. “Theyneedto. If you have a child that’s growing, it is your responsibility that that child grows well.” He drums his finger on his desk for emphasis. “Do you want your daughter to grow well or badly?” Of course I want her to grow well, I say. Does that mean we should be doing this with our kids’ faces? “Yes,” he replies immediately. “Why not?”I can think of so many reasons why not. But, in an age of looksmaxxing, whenskincare for tweens is booming, when looking less than perfect is increasingly considered a moral failure, one immediately comes to mind. Shouldn’t we be teaching young people that there’s more to life than what your face looks like?When I put this to Mew, he sighs in disappointment. “Yeah, there’s lots more to life, but this isa hell of a lot of life. That’s my whole thing – how goddamn important how your face grows is. Maybe I’m wrong. Please prove me wrong! Please prove anything I’ve said wrong.” He genuinely believes this – enough to stake his marriage, his home and his business on these arguments.Before I go, Mew wants to ensure I leave with the right message. “Your tongue position: that’s what you’vegottowork on,” he says, drumming his finger on his desk once again. “Your tongue is hung down. That’s why this area of your face” – he motions to my upper lip – “isdull.” The word lands with a thud between us, and he cocks his head, sympathetically. “Sorry.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleDentistsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Experts say this is “flawed” advice because many ultra-processed foods still meet the definition of “healthier”, including some energy drinks, crisps, snacks, cereal bars, pizzas, burgers and ice-creams.The U-turn, revealed for the first time, occurred on 1 June 2023 under Rishi Sunak’s government, the Guardian found.The change remainsin the current government’s guidance being issued to retailers ahead of the law change in October.It came after the FDF waged a campaign to put pressure on the DHSC to rewrite its nutrition policy, lobbying officials to remove the push to minimally processed food in the guidance issued to retailers, according to documents and emails reviewed by the Guardian.In response to a freedom of information request, the government released a cache of emails between the FDF and the DHSC.Most of the correspondence was heavily redacted. The government cited section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act, “which provides for the protection of personal information”, and section 35(1)(a), “which provides protection for the information that relates to the formulation or development of government policy”.The emails, sent between October 2022 and April 2023, reveal how the FDF, which represents firms with a combined annual turnover of more than £112bn, lobbied the DHSC to drop the guidance pushing retailers to promote minimally processed food.Email from [redacted], 2 October2022View image in fullscreenEmail from [redacted], 2 October 2022“This is a real bone of contention with the companies … Please can you give me a date when this will be deleted from the guidance?”“I see the promotions guidance was re-issued on Friday to reflect the new implementation date of the volume-based promotions,” an FDF official wrote in an email to a DHSC official on 2 October 2022. “My understanding was that when the guidance was updated the reference to the aim of the policy being to shift choices to ‘minimal [SIC] processed foods’ would be removed but it’s still there.”“This is a real bone of contention with the companies,” the FDF official added. “Please can you give me a date when this will be deleted from the guidance?”Four days later, on 6 October 2022, the FDF official emailed the DHSC official again. “It would be great to understand when this change is going to happen. Clearly the policy and guidance is live and as discussed before, we consider this reads that government policy is that processed foods are inherently unhealthy, not something we agree with or believe the scientific evidence supports.”Email from [redacted], 6 October2022View image in fullscreenEmail from [redacted], 6 October 2022“I had thought we had agreement that this change would happen, and whilst I appreciate you don’t want to keep re-opening guidance documents, this discussion was several months ago now.”The FDF official said: “I had thought we had agreement that this change would happen, and whilst I appreciate you don’t want to keep re-opening guidance documents, this discussion was several months ago now.”In an email to DHSC officials on 23 November 2023, an FDF official wrote: “Please do also let us know as soon as possible when you have clarified next steps for removing the reference to ‘minimally processed’ from the promotions guidance – as mentioned on the call, this is a particularly contentious issue for our members.”Email from [redacted], 23 November2022View image in fullscreenEmail from [redacted], 23 November 2022“Please do also let us know as soon as possible when you have clarified next steps for removing the reference to ‘minimally processed’ from the promotions guidance – as mentioned on the call, this is a particularly contentious issue for our members.”On 3 January 2023, the FDF was told the advice to promote minimally processed food would be deleted from the guidance issued to retailers, the emails show.Email from [redacted], 3 January2023View image in fullscreenEmail from [redacted], 3 January 2023“I can confirm that as part of these changes, we intend to remove the wording ‘such as minimally processed and nutritious food’.”“We are considering a number of changes to the HFSS promotions implementation guidance as minor points of clarification and will update on these in due course,” an email to an FDF official said. “I can confirm that as part of these changes, we intend to remove the wording ‘such as minimally processed and nutritious food’.”View image in fullscreenBefore and after Gov.ukThere is no longer any reference to either term in the current version of the document,which remains liveon the government’s website.Cathy Cliff, campaigns coordinator at the Soil Association, provided the emails to the Guardian after obtaining them under freedom of information laws. “This move to block discounts on healthy foods is clearly one that benefits the profits of UPF manufacturers more than the health of their consumers,” she said.After the guidance was dropped, the FDF boasted about its lobbying success, hailing the victory in a “key wins” section of its website, the Guardian found.“The FDF’s engagement with Department of Health and Social Care officials … resulted in the removal of the reference to ‘minimally processed’ in the HFSS promotions guidance.”The FDF also said it had successfully lobbied to stop ultra-processed food being mentioned in separate legislation in Scotland. “FDF Scotland’s engagement with the Scottish government ensured the prevention of the term ‘ultra-processed food’ [UPF] being used in the good food nation bill.”The page has since been deleted from the FDF website. It now reads “sorry, page not found”.View image in fullscreenBefore and after FDFHalf the average diet of Britons now consists of ultra-processed food (UPF). For some, especially those who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical.All food is processed to some degree, and processing can be necessary and beneficial. But UPF is different. It is often high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) but also engineered and marketed in ways that cause excess consumption, fuelling the obesity crisis, which costs the NHS more than £11bn a year.Last montha study foundthat consuming large amounts of UPF increases the risk of an early death. It is so damaging to health that it is implicated in as many as one in seven of all premature deaths, including at least 17,000 every year in England.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This change took place under the previous government. This government is committed to tackling obesity and building a healthier Britain.“We are taking action to end the targeting of junk food adverts to children across TV and online and we have handed local authorities stronger powers to block applications for takeaways near schools. We are also commissioning research to improve the evidence on the health impacts of UPF.”A Scottish government spokesperson said: “The good food nation bill was framework legislation, the term ‘ultra processed food’ was therefore not omitted, as it was agreed that the bill would not include reference to specific policies.”An FDF spokesperson said: “FDF regularly engages with government on behalf of food and drink manufacturers, on regulation that underpins nutrition, food safety and food security; as well as on how we play our part in helping people follow healthier diets.“In the instance cited, we asked the government to phrase their business guidance on new HFSS regulations in a way that was consistent with that legislation. We were concerned that references to processing in the guidance, which was not covered in the legislation, would cause confusion.”Do you have information about this story?

The president has repeatedly cited a death toll for the conflict that ismuch higherthan any official figures, orestimates based on an open-source investigation, without explaining why.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to a state-run Russian news agency that preparations were under way for a call between the US and Russian presidents.‘Very disturbing’: Trump receipt of overseas gifts unprecedented, experts warnRead moreTrump’s call with the Russian president will be followed by a separate conversation with Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s leader, and Nato leaders as part of the US effort to end the war that has raged since the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. “HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump wrote.Russia and Ukraine have just concluded mostly fruitless talks, the first of their kind since the start of the war, in Istanbul. Ukraine said it was ready for a ceasefire but was faced by “unacceptable” demands from Russia, which attempted to fully invade its neighbor and has occupied the eastern flank of the country.It’s unclear what kind of progress Trump will be able to spur, if any, in the peace process. The US president has been heavily critical of Ukraine, freezing military aid and having an infamous argument with Zelenskyy at the White House in full view of the media, before appearing to soften after a face-to-face conversation at the funeral of Pope Francis in the Vatican.Trump had offered to travel to Turkey for the talks after his trip to the Middle East last week if Putin would also attend, and urged Zelenskyy to go, but Putin sent a team of low-level negotiators instead.Trump’s ire with Ukraine’s president does not seem to have abated, however, with the president telling Fox News on Friday he is upset with what the country has done with the aid handed to it by the US. “What bothered me, I hated to see the way it was, you know, excuse me, pissed away,” he said.“I think he’s the greatest salesman in the world. Far better than me,” Trump said of the Ukrainian president. “Where is all this money going?”Ina social media postof his own, Zelenskyy mourned the death of nine civilians in “a Russian drone strike on an ordinary passenger bus”. He added: “Yesterday, as on any other day of this war, there was an opportunity to cease fire. Ukraine has long been offering this – a full and unconditional ceasefire in order to save lives.

It is the third time the country has won, with JJ following in the footsteps of Udo Jürgens in 1965 and Conchita Wurst in 2014.Switzerland, which hosted the first ever Eurovision song contest in 1956, was the venue this year after Nemo won in Malmö last year with their song The Code. They presented the trophy to JJ, who called for “more love”. After finishing a reprise of their winning song, a clearly emotional JJ said “thank youEurope, I love you all”Austria’s winnerViennese-born JJ has a range from counter tenor to soprano, and studies classical music. He co-wrote the winning song with Teodora Spiric and Thomas Turner.

In recent years,Sam Ryder’s Space Manhas been the only song that has bucked the trend for poor results, finishing second in 2022. No other UK entry since 2012 has finished higher than 15th, and this year’s effort by Remember Monday continued that record.The girl band’s song about the aftermath of a wild night out –What The Hell Just Happened?– was granted automatic entry to the final, as the UK is one of the largest net contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) which organises the show. They finished 19th, having scored zero with the public vote, the second year in a row that has happened to the UK entry.

The intensified bombing campaigns came as Israel’s total blockade on humanitarian aid has prompted fears of a famine in the Palestinian territory.“Since midnight, we have received 58 martyrs, while a large number of victims remain under the rubble. The situation inside the hospital is catastrophic,” said Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza early on Saturday. The death toll in the last 24 hours was at least 146, according to Reuters.View image in fullscreenIsraeli tanks and bulldozers on the border with Gaza.Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty ImagesThe escalation in attacks was condemned by the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday, who said the bombing campaign was meant to displace Palestinians and that it was equivalent to ethnic cleansing.Israel committing genocide in Gaza, says EU’s former top diplomatRead more“This latest barrage of bombs … and the denial of humanitarian assistance underline that there appears to be a push for a permanent demographic shift in Gaza that is in defiance of international law and is tantamount to ethnic cleansing,” he said.Turk’s comments were also echoed by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who called for a permanent ceasefire while speaking at an Arab League summit in Baghdad on Saturday.1:25'They kill us without warning': dozens killed in new Israeli Gaza offensive – videoIsrael said the bombardments were the initial phases of Operation Gideon’s Chariots, an expansion of the campaign in Gaza meant to “achieve all of the war goals in Gaza”. The strikes were accompanied by a large troop buildup along Gaza’s borders, aimed at establishing “operational control” of parts of Gaza.The campaign, as well as the aid blockade on the territory, was meant to forceHamasto release hostages, Israeli officials said. The terrorist organisation took about 250 hostages during its October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people. Fifty-seven hostages are still held by Hamas.The attacks came asDonald Trumpdeparted the Middle East after a four-day visit to Arab Gulf countries, during which Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar made pledges to invest billions in the US.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman mourning a family member.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHopes that Trump’s visit might bring renewed progress on truce talks in Gaza were dashed after the US president reiterated his desire to turn Gaza into a “freedom zone”. This was seen as a likely nod to his plan of the US assuming control over the Palestinian territory and turning it into the “riviera of the Middle East”.A January ceasefire broke down in mid-March after Israel refused to move to a scheduled second phase that could have led to ending the war. Prospects of a lasting truce seemed further away as Israel’s security cabinet approved plans in early May that could involve seizing the entire Gaza Strip.Gaza ceasefire talks were also expected to dominate the Arab League summit, where Arab officials met on Saturday. The Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, said that attending ministers would endorse a reconstruction plan for Gaza, a contrast to Trump’s offer to take over the Palestinian territory. Ministers later pledged $40m in reconstruction funds for Gaza and Lebanon.Later on Saturday Hamas confirmed a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks with Israel was under way in Qatar’s Doha. A group official, Taher al-Nono, told Reuters both sides were discussing all issues without “pre-conditions”.Israel’s offensive in Gaza, launched in retaliation for the October 2023 attacks, has killed about 53,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian health authorities.Widespread hunger and malnutrition among children have also soared, after Israel cut off vital humanitarian aid to the territory on 2 March. There is little medical care in Gaza, due to scarce supplies and repeated Israeli strikes on hospitals and medical facilities.View image in fullscreenInjured Palestinians are brought to al-Ahli Baptist hospital.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe UN aid chief, Tom Fletcher, urged a resumption of aid to Gaza in a speech to the UN security council on Tuesday, where he said famine loomed.Israel has consistently denied that its 10-week blockade is causing hunger in Gaza. However, Trump acknowledged on Thursday that “a lot of people are starving in Gaza”.Israel, which claims Hamas hijacks aid to fund its military, has proposed a plan to distribute aid from hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and guarded by Israeli troops. The US has backed the plan, and a body called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is set to begin carrying out the plan by the end of the month.Aid groups described the plan as unworkable and potentially unlawful as it could lead to forced displacement. They urged Israel to lift its blockade and to rely on the UN and other existing humanitarian bodies, which have long experience in transporting aid into Gaza.“We can save hundreds of thousands of survivors,” Fletcher said. “We have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians, and not to Hamas.”The European Council president, António Costa, said on Saturday: “Shocked by the news from Gaza: starving civilians, hospitals hit again by strikes. The violence must stop!”.Germany’s foreign ministry said on Saturday it is “deeply concerned” about the situation in Gaza, and that the offensive “could put the lives of the remaining hostages, including those of German hostages, in danger”.“A broad military offensive also risks worsening further the catastrophic humanitarian situation for Gaza’s population and the remaining hostages,” it added.On Saturday the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called for pressure to stop Israel’s “massacre in Gaza” and said Madrid plans a UN resolution requesting a world court ruling on aid access to the Palestinian territory.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaMiddle East peace talksHamasUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Travellers from the EU have continued to have access to UK e-gates, despite Brexit, without needing to have their passports stamped or checked by a border officer.An agreement enabling British travellers to use European e-gates could reduce airport queueing times considerably, particularly if it lifts the requirement for passport stamping.The EU is preparing to set up a new entry and exit system that will apply to British travellers in October. The scheme, which was meant to be launched in 2022 buthas been delayed several times, would replace passport stamping but would require British travellers to provide biometric data at the border, such as fingerprints and face scans. A separate EUtravel authorisation systemis also being developed, and is expected to be operational before the end of the year.The UK has already set up its own travel authorisation scheme for EU and other international travellers which came into force last month. Modelled on the system used by the US, it costs £16 and allows multiple visits to the UK of up to six months over a two-year period.Several other mobility-related issues are also under discussion by British and European negotiators ahead of Monday’s summit.‘I feel smug going in the short queue’: UK readers on getting EU passportsRead moreThe UK is eager to make it easier for musicians and other performing artists to tour in Europewithout undergoing an onerous visa process. The EU haslong pursued a youth mobility dealto allow young Europeans to temporarily live and work in the UK, and vice versa.The prime minister indicated this weekend that he was open to a youth mobility agreement. Ministers want any such scheme to be time-limited and capped, however, because of Labour’smanifesto commitment to reduce net migration.Visa barriers for touring artists are unlikely to be lifted on Monday but are expected to be among the issues the two sides agree to explore further.The two sides are also in talks over a veterinary agreement to reduce barriers for the farming and food industries. Downing Street said the deal would bring improvements for UK producers and supermarkets.It will be the third trade deal announced by the government in a fortnight, after the conclusion ofa multibillion-pound free trade agreement with Indiaanda deal to lift steel and aluminium tariffsand reduce car tariffs with the US.Speaking ahead of the EU summit, Starmer said an agreement with Brussels was “another step forward” for the UK and would “be good for our jobs, good for our bills and good for our borders”.“In this time of great uncertainty and volatility, the UK will not respond by turning inwards, but by proudly taking our place on the world stage – strengthening our alliances and closing deals in the interests of British people,” he said.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor,told the Guardian this weekendthat the deal would be a “step towards” a deeper and ongoing partnership with Europe. “I am ambitious for our future. This isn’t a one-off. There will be things that we achieve, some concrete outcomes on Monday, but there will also be a step towards where we want to go next,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAir transportEuropean UnionBrexitEuropeLabourKeir StarmerRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

The person killed was near the vehicle that had been blown to pieces outside the clinic, operated by American Reproductive Centers (ARC), Davis said.The bomb, which detonated before 11am, was either in or near a car parked outside the clinic when it exploded, said mayor Ron deHarte of Palm Springs.“Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,” Davis said. He did not comment on the relationship - if any - between the victim and the person of interest in the investigation.Aerial images of the damage to the facilityshowedthe burned-out remains of a vehicle in a parking lot behind the clinic.Despite damage to the building, ARC said the facility would be fully operational on Monday.View image in fullscreenDebris after a bomb exploded in Palm Springs on Saturday.Photograph: ABC affiliate KABC/ReutersThe Desert Sun reported that the explosion could be felt as far as 2 miles (3km) away after it occurred by the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic.The US attorney Bill Essayli of the central district of California weighed in on the explosion,saying on X: “We are aware of the explosion that occurred this morning in Palm Springs.

The south London club were on a mission to avenge previous Wembley pain, specifically the FA Cup final defeats by Manchester United from 1990 and 2016; to win a first major trophy. They put their supporters through the wringer because it is written that they must suffer. But when the final whistle blew, the joy was boundless. Who knows when it will feel real?The goalscorer was Eberechi Eze, Palace’s sorcerer-in-chief, and it came in the 16th minute from an assist by Daniel Muñoz, who was irrepressible up and down the right. But the real hero was surely Dean Henderson, who saved a penalty just after the half-hour from theManchester Cityforward Omar Marmoush and it was hardly the goalkeeper’s only vital intervention.Crystal Palace 1-0 Manchester City: FA Cup final player ratings from WembleyRead moreShould Henderson have been on the field to distinguish himself? The former Manchester United player had handled outside his area on 24 minutes to thwart Erling Haaland and if there was considerable doubt over his continued involvement, he was given the benefit of it. When it was all over, he appeared to have a forthright exchange of views with Pep Guardiola on the pitch; the passions bubbled throughout.Palace defended with everything they had, one of the hallmarks ofOliver Glasner’s stunning yearor so at the helm and, in the final analysis, City did not do enough. Their patterns were formulaic and when opportunity knocked, they either seized up or found Henderson in the way.There was agony for the Palace supporters when the board went up to show 10 additional minutes. They had seen Nico O’Reilly hesitate for City at the crucial moment towards the end of regulation time after a Kevin De Bruyne pass. And Henderson saved smartly from the City substitute Claudio Echeverri, who had come on for his debut.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze scores Crystal Palace’s goal against the run of play after 16 minutes.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty ImagesIn stoppage time, De Bruyne shot wide with the outside of a boot and Henderson once again denied Echeverri, setting the scene for one of the images of the season – or any other from a Palace point of view; virtually every player in red and blue slumped to the turf, utterly overcome.Eagles are flying high: FA Cup final 2025 – in picturesRead moreFor City, it set the seal on a deeply underwhelming season, the first time since 2016-17 – Guardiola’s first in charge – that they had finished without silverware. There was no fairytale sendoff for De Bruyne before his departure in the summer. Guardiola and his players must now pick themselves up to ensure a top-five Premier League finish and a return to the Champions League.As Palace’s jubilant players celebrated with the trophy, it was easy to overlook the fact that the glory carried the bonus of Europa League qualification; the club have never previously played in a major European competition.View image in fullscreenPenalty! City’s Bernardo Silva is fouled by Tyrick Mitchell, but Omar Marmoush missed from the spot.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWhat must have flashed through the mind of the chairman, Steve Parish? Possibly how his club had gone to the brink in financial terms, twice surviving administration. And definitely gratitude to Glasner, who has brought cohesion and identity. Apart from the sticky spell in the first eight league games of the season, the manager has regularly hit the high notes.Glasner had said beforehand that victory would mean more for Palace and it was hard to disagree. It was only Palace’s third major final; it was City’s third in three seasons in theFA Cupalone.Palace had sunk into a 5-4-1 shape at the outset, ceding possession, and there were a couple of nervous moments for them. Henderson made his first save to keep out a hooked Haaland volley. But when Palace broke upfield for the first time, they did so into acres of space and how they made the punch count. Jean-Philippe Mateta’s hold-up work was sound and Muñoz ran with characteristic willingness. Eze timed his move, getting in front of Manuel Akanji and the volley from Muñoz’s cross was executed with exemplary technique.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The centre-forward ran for the ball towards the edge of the Palace box and saw Henderson come out and paw it away from him, looking suspiciously outside his area as he did so. The freeze-frame pictures would confirm that Henderson did handle outside the box. Without the intervention, it was difficult to argue that something promising for Haaland would not have happened.City’s grievances deepened when Henderson made the penalty save shortly after. Bernardo Silva essentially bought the decision; he was already going down when Tyrick Mitchell slid in, anticipating the contact towards the byline. It was an unwise move from Mitchell, inviting the worst.Henderson plunged to his right to repel Marmoush’s kick, then keep out Haaland’s rebound and there were further heroics from him before the interval when he pushed Jérémy Doku’s curling shot up and out. On the second phase of the move, De Bruyne lashed high when well placed; a big miss.View image in fullscreenDean Henderson saved Omar Marmoush’s penalty and made two other outstanding saves in the first half.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGuardiola’s selection had an all-or-nothing feel; no recognised holding midfielder. His team pushed at the start of the second half, Palace resisting, never more so than when Doku played in Silva and he was denied by a body-on-the-line block by Daichi Kamada. Previously, Doku had bent a shot just off target.City caught a break when Muñoz had a goal disallowed for an offside against Sarr, who had been in front of Ortega, and the tensions pounded, spilling over into an argument between the benches. It was reported that Guardiola had clashed with the Palace first-team coach, Paddy McCarthy, in the tunnel at half-time. It was impossible for the Palace supporters to suppress their anxiety. It only added to the impossible sweetness when it was over.Explore more on these topicsFA CupCrystal PalaceManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The blaze was reported to police by firefighters in the early hours of Monday. Police said damage was caused to the property’s entrance but nobody was hurt.A car that Starmer had sold to a neighbour last year was set alight four days earlier on the same street.On 11 May, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of a house where the Labour leader is understood to have lived in the 1990s before it was converted into flats. One person was helped to safety by firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, the London fire brigade said.Anyone with information that could assist the investigation has been asked to contact the Met.A 21-year-old man, Roman Lavrynovych, has already been charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life and appeared in court on Friday.The Ukrainian national was remanded in custody after appearing at Westminster magistrates court. He did not enter any pleas to the charges.Lavrynovych will appear next at the Old Bailey for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 6 June.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Hur, who investigated Biden’s handling of classified material, subsequently described the then president as a “sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory” in his final report, which recommended against charging Biden with any sort of crime.Biden destroyed Harris bid by staying in race too long, top adviser says in bookRead moreAwritten transcript of the five-hour interview was released last year. But the newly released audio provides some context for Biden’s struggle to recall certain facts.At the time, White House officials strongly denied that Biden was impaired in his ability to do his job as president, with allies continuing to back Biden until a disastrous debate with Trump in June 2024 resulted in mounting pressure for him to step aside as the Democratic candidate. He did so in favor of his vice-president, Kamala Harris, a month later.Polling at the time showed that many Americans considered Biden, at the time 81 years old, to be too old to run again as president. Though he had beaten Trump in 2020, Biden’s decision to try to run against him again, with Trump just three years younger than him, has come under intensifying scrutiny.At the release of Hur’s report, Biden and his allies reacted angrily to its claims. “There’s even a reference that I don’t remember when my son died,” Biden said last year. “How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their damn business.”The audio also includes Biden talking about how Barack Obama – whom he served as vice-president – didn’t want him to run for the White House in 2016 due to the belief that Hillary Clinton “had a better shot of winning the presidency than I did”. There were also deviations to ponder the influence of the Gutenberg printing press and the experience of driving a Corvette with the comedian Jay Leno.Trump repeatedly mocked Biden’s age and gaffes before going on to defeat Harris in last year’s election.However, the current president has also had lapses of his own, appearing to confuse E Jean Carroll, who accused him of sexual abuse and was awarded damages, with his ex-wife Marla Maples when shown a photograph during a deposition. He also claimed that the audience “went crazy” during his televised debate with Harris last year (there was no audience whatsoever in the room).Trump has also continued his habit of delivering discursive speeches littered with multiple untruths and gross exaggerations while president and has even been accused of falling asleep during events, although the White House has denied these claims.On Friday, Trump further raised eyebrows when he referenced the most notorious racial epithet when discussing the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed countries, with Fox News.“It was getting deeper and more, I mean, more missiles,” Trump said. “Everyone was stronger, stronger, to a point where the next ones are going to be you know what: the N-word.”“You know what the N-word is, right?” he asked host Brett Baier, who replied: “nuclear”. Trump said “yeah”, and both men laughed over the exchange.Explore more on these topicsJoe BidenUS elections 2024Donald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Only three other districts backed Brexit to the same extent.“I just feel that it was a missed opportunity. Yes, people were sometimes fed bullshit. But they were asked if we wanted to come out and people around here literally voted in their droves for it. We’ve never really seen the investment we were promised.”His partner, Sarah, went further, accusing successive governments of a “betrayal”. Money that she believed had been saved by exiting the EU should have been channelled into improving it and other public services, she said.View image in fullscreenGrays, on north bank of the Thames, is close to Tilbury docks, part of the Thames freeport.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianSuch sentiments were not hard to find behind the bustle of Friday market day in Grays, nestled on the north bank of the Thames, a short drive and even shorter train ride from Tilbury docks, part of the Thames freeport.In the period before the EU referendum,Thurrock recordedthe lowest levels of life satisfaction of any place in the UK, while hostility towards immigration was tapped into first by the BNP and later Ukip.With similar messaging,Reform UKis now eyeing its electoral prospects here, where it came second in last year’s general election. But for the postponement of local elections, it could also well have added the Thurrock council – declared in effect bankrupt in 2022 – to the list of those it won on 1 May.'It's one big cesspit here': Thurrock, the country's capital of miseryRead moreYet economic green shoots have emerged, not least in Tilbury, where plans were submitted last week to expand the thriving port by as much as 40 hectares (100 acres).“Thurrock is very much like a red wall seat. It just happens to be in the south rather than the north,” said Jackie Doyle-Price, who was the local Conservative MP from 2010 until last year, when Jen Craft won the seat back forLabour, which had held it for most of the period after the second world war.“It’s close to London, but Brexit was still an opportunity for those who felt politics was leaving them behind to voice their dissatisfaction,” Doyle-Price said. “People have moved on from the vote in many ways, but one thing which really cut through during the referendum campaign – the immigration debate – has got worse. What was promised hasn’t materialised, because immigration has continued to remain high.”View image in fullscreenHassan Naeen said Grays had a ‘good community’ and praised the government’s plans to toughen immigration policy.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThose shifts in demographics are vividly illustrated by the changing face of Grays’ high street, where a diverse range of new restaurants, food stores and other retailers have arrived over the past decade.Those newcomers included Hassan Naeen, who was optimistic about the town’s future since establishing Sabina, a supermarket selling hair and body products to African-Caribbean customers and others.“There’s a good community here, and we have been promised that regeneration of the town is coming,” he said. As for the question of potential tensions over immigration, he had praise for the government’s plans to toughen policy.UK-EU summit will be step on path to better relations, says Rachel ReevesRead moreAt a west African restaurant next door, there was a candid if careful reflection from Father Paschal Uche as he fetched lunch with a fellow Catholic priest, Tochukwu Okonkwo.“It shouldn’t be overstated but sometimes you see divides that might be there even within our community. So, there are certain masses that might have more white, older crowds and others where you’ve got mainly west African or a migrant community.”View image in fullscreenFather Paschal Uche, right, and a fellow priest, Tochukwu Okonkwo.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianAs for Brexit, he said of his experience working elsewhere in Essex: “I think, speaking personally, that some people might have been hit by the realities, whether that’s about travel, certain conveniences or whatever else, and feel they are still waiting to see the benefits.”While they wait, however, house prices and rents in the area have been rising to levels beyond the reach of local people, a point emphasised by Neil Woodbridge, whose social enterprise employs 200 staff supporting local disabled people.“I don’t pick up on a huge amount of regret from my staff who voted Brexit. As with elsewhere, it was an ‘up yours to the government’ and I think they would do it again.“Keir Starmer might be right to the extent Brexit is in the past for them, but the reality is that they’re struggling. There’s a thing called the ‘Thurrock shrug’, and it’s where people go ‘yeah, whatever’ because they always feel let down by government.“There are such great opportunities, whether it’s the ports expansion locally or the direction the economy hopefully is going, but people need to be brought along. Otherwise it’s just storing up big problems.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitEssexLabourImmigration and asylumForeign policyEuropean UnionReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

As you enter, a gallery wall displays mugshots of “customers we don’t serve”, but instead of rowdy patrons, it features Polish political leaders, including at least five prime ministers.The wall presents a surreal indictment of the country’s political elite. There is a “meme museum”, a blown-up, fake “gazillion złoty” banknote with the face of a former prime minister, and a gold-plated figure of that leader with a begging bowl. In the toilets, you listen to Donald Tusk speaking German and bizarre speeches by other Polish politicians.The pub could be dismissed as eccentric if it wasn’t owned by Sławomir Mentzen, the tax adviser turned politician of the libertarian far-right Konfederacja (Confederation) party that has been tipped to come thirdin this Sunday’s presidential electionin Europe’s sixth-largest economy.And it is not just a commercial enterprise, but an expression of his politics.View image in fullscreenThe ‘meme museum’ display at Pub Mentzen in Toruń.Photograph: Jakub Krupa/The GuardianAbout 400 people gathered in the rain as Mentzen, 38, came to his home town to deliver a shotgun pitch covering taxes, political elites, public services, EU regulations, immigration, green policies, and the general state of the world.He first rose to notoriety in 2019, presenting “the Mentzen five”: “We don’t want Jews, homosexuals, abortion, taxes and the EU.” He has since distanced himself from that list, but remains on the far-right end of the spectrum.Emboldened by Donald Trump,he seeks to turn his unfiltered language, such as in his criticism of Ukrainians in Poland, into political strength.Runoffs, reruns and rightwingers: Europe prepares for electoral ‘super Sunday’Read moreHis rise as the “common sense” candidate – capturing the discontent among younger male voters, and with 1.6 million followers on TikTok – allowed him to briefly challenge the mainstream conservative candidate, Karol Nawrocki, for second place in polls. Recent comments on abortion and tuition fees reversed most of his gains, but in the weeks leading up to the vote he was on course to secure a double-digit vote share.In a well-rehearsed speech – Mentzen completed 348 rallies, visiting all of the country’spowiaty(counties) – he raged against 20 years of the duopoly between the country’s two main parties: Donald Tusk’s centrist Civic Platform (PO) and Jarosław Kaczyński’s populist-nationalist Law and Justice (PiS), which have dominated the country’s politics since 2005. In this election, they have the two frontrunners once again, in the centrist mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, and Nawrocki.“For God’s sake, how long can we wait for something to change?” Grzegorz Płaczek, a Konfederacja MP, tells the Guardian. “It’s the same faces, just swapping places.”This anti-establishment rhetoric strikes a chord. Never before in the country’s post-1989 history was the combined vote share of the top two candidates forecast to be as low as this year.Ben Stanley, a sociologist and political scientist at SWPS University in Warsaw, said: “PiS is far fromdetoxifying itself after eight years in power, while PO is seen as responsible for the government’s lack of ambition in key areas for younger voters,particularly abortionand housing. That leaves the race more open to others.”View image in fullscreenAdrian Zandberg speaking in Warsaw.Photograph: Paweł Supernak/EPAAnother challenger hoping to break the duopoly is Adrian Zandberg. Born in Denmark to Polish parents, the 45-year-old is a towering figure – literally, nicknamed “the Mighty Dane” – with a booming voice and hard-left socialist views.In the last parliamentary election in 2023, his party, Razem (Together), ran as part of the coalition against PiS but declined to join the government because it didn’t feel it was offered the tools to meet its promises to voters.Now “outside the tent pissing in”, he, too, has become a brutal reviewer of “two 70-year-old men” he says are stuck in disputes irrelevant to younger voters.Addressing about 800 people near Warsaw University on Wednesday, he focused on immediate challenges facing his audience, such as housing and healthcare, as well as Poland’s long-term ambitions.He spoke in an urgent, angry tone – the crowd shouted “disgrace” as he rhetorically asked them about the track record of previous administrations – and urged voters to back a Poland “made of nuclear power, silicon and steel, and not of plywood”.He resists one label that captures his views, havingrecently said: “I am less interested in the word ‘the left’, more in pro-social and libertarian change.”Aleks Szczerbiak, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex, says: “For this ‘stuff-them’ electorate, a reaction against the duopoly … the ideological profile doesn’t really matter that much.”Zandberg’s fellow Razem MP Maciej Konieczny says the left’s response to the far right needs to go beyond “old leftwing aesthetics”, adding: “Younger people may not have settled political opinions, but they can smell bullshit and want [politics] to be about something.“And we are credible: because we actually refused to play ball.”2:02'Something is changing': Poland's voters on the critical issues in presidential elections – videoPolls published before the country went into electoral silence on Friday night suggested Mentzen and Zandberg would take almost half of all votes from under-35s, streets ahead of the established candidates.Despite polarised views on migration and abortion, some of their voters even suggested they could see themselves voting for the other candidate, instead of mainstream parties.Angelika, a “campaigner on maternity leave”, is not surprised when asked about these views at Zandberg’s rally.“The young electorate of Zandberg and Mentzen want largely similar things: to get stability and live a dignified life,” even if their proposed solutions are largely incompatible, she says. “Instead we get this ping-pong from PO and PiS.”The two candidates could get up to a combined 20% of the vote share on Sunday. That would force the two mainstream candidates who are expected to advance to the runoff to at least consider how to court their supporters.If they fail to do that, they, too, will end up on the wall at Pub Mentzen. And the 2027 parliamentary election is just two years away, with that anger not going anywhere.Explore more on these topicsPolandEuropeThe far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he lost the vote and a fresh election was called.The unexpected election is unlikely to drastically alter Portugal’s political landscape. Recent polls suggest a similar result to the last election in March 2024, putting the AD on about 33%, the opposition Socialist party (PS) on 26% and the far-right Chega party on 17%.Last time round, the AD won 80 seats to the PS’s 78, while Chega, which isled by the former football pundit André Ventura, enjoyed a surge in support and increased its seat count from 12 to 50.Runoffs, reruns and rightwingers: Europe prepares for electoral ‘super Sunday’Read moreOnce again,Portugal’s housing crisishas become a major issue during this latest campaign.“We’re talking about the same things we did last year,” said Filomena Martins, the deputy editor of the online Observador newspaper.“We’re talking about housing, rental costs, and the lack of housing for everyone. There isn’t enough housing for everyone because there’s not enough housebuilding. There have been some measures from this government that havehelped young people get somewhere to live, but there isn’t enough housing for everyone and there isn’t enough housing that young people can afford on their salaries. It’s impossible.”Also in play are the issues of pensions, immigration, healthcare and crime and safety. Montenegro’s caretaker government was recentlyaccused of pandering to the far rightafter it announced the expulsion of 18,000 irregular migrants during the election campaign.But despite its efforts to push immigration up the political agenda – not to mention its massive growth at the last election – Chega looks set to find itself once again barred from any coalitions.Montenegro has maintained his veto on any deals with the party, saying: “Governing with Chega is impossible for three reasons: it isn’t reliable in its thinking; it behaves like a political weathervane, always changing its mind, and it’s not suited to the exercise of government.”The small Liberal Initiative party – which could throw its weight behind Montenegro, bringing his coalition a handful of seats but leaving him well short of a majority in the country’s 230-seat assembly – has alsocategorically refusedto do anything that would help Chega into power.The far-right party, which has promised to clean up Portuguese politics, has also been hit by a series of damaging allegations relating to some of its members. In January, Chega expelled one of its MPs from the party after he was accused of stealing suitcases at several airports. Another member of the party was caught drunk-driving the same month, while a third has been charged with paying for oral sex with an underage male who was 15 at the time.The party has returned to its attacks onPortugal’s Roma community, prompting angry protests at some of its events. Speaking earlier this week, Ventura – who has previously accused the country’s Roma population of having “a chronic problem of dependence on benefits, delinquency and violence – said he would stand up to “threats” from the Roma people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

President Marcelo [Rebelo de Sousa] has said the most important thing isn’t who wins, but who can offer the best conditions to get things through parliament … We don’t know what will happen.”Last year’s general election was triggered after the socialist prime minister, António Costa,resigned in November 2023after an investigation was launched into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects.Costa – who had been in office since 2015 and whowon a surprise absolute majorityin the 2022 general election – has not been accused of any crime and has gone on to become the president of the European Council.Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropeEuropean UnionThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Here is Richard Linklater’s impeccably submissive, tastefully cinephile period drama about the making of Godard’s debut 1960 classic À Bout de Souffle, that starred Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo as the star-crossed lovers in Paris. Linklater’s homage has credits in French and is beautifully shot in monochrome, as opposed to the boring old colour of real life in which the events were actually happening; he even cutely fabricates cue marks in the corner of the screen, those things that once told projectionists when to changeover the reels. But Linklater smoothly avoids any disruptive jump-cuts.It’s a good natured, intelligent effort for which Godard himself, were he still alive, would undoubtedly have ripped Linklater a new one. (WhenMichel Hazanavicius made Redoubtable in 2017about Godard’s making of his 1967 film La Chinoise, the man himself called that “a stupid, stupid idea”; Hazanavicius wasn’t even making a film about Godard’s first and biggest hit.Yet Linklater is of course unconsciously creating a stylistic homage – not to Godard, however, but to his much more emollient, accessible and Hollywood-friendly collaborator Francois Truffaut. Truffaut wrote the basic story for Breathless and thereby gave Godard his commercial success; it was based on a sensational true-crime story about a tough guy who shoots a cop and gets an American girlfriend on the run, grabbing at love and romance while he can, existentially aware that a cop-killer’s days are numbered.The real-life characters of the Breathless story, from the most famous to the most obscure (this latter category being of course treated with rigorous superfan respect) are introduced with static portrait shots, gazing at the camera with their names flashed up on screen; even in the action itself, these people are often addressed by their full name with an awestruck sentence about their importance so we know where we are.Godard himself, a Cahiers Du Cinéma gunslinger-critic yearning to graduate to film-making, is played by newcomer Guillaume Marbeck, incessantly dropping epigrams and wisecracks and shruggingly dismissive pouts on the subject of cinema – and perhaps Godard was like this, at least some of the time. Linklater mischievously allows the audience to wonder if Godard will ever remove his sunglasses and get a “beautiful librarian” moment, or at least a moment to confess that you shouldn’t watch movies through dark glasses. Aubry Dillon plays Belmondo and Zoey Deutch is Seberg, forever breaking into fluent and Ohio-accented French. Adrien Rouyard is Truffaut, Matthieu Penchinat is the brilliant cinematographer Raoul Coutard whose news background in covering wars made him an inspired choice for Godard’s guerrilla film-making adventures, Benjamin Clery is Godard’s first assistant director Pierre Rissient and Bruno Dreyfürst is Godard’s long-suffering producer George “Beau Beau” Beauregard - whose disagreements with Godard over money lead to an undignified physical scuffle in aPariscafe.The shoot begins, extended by Godard’s haughtily capricious delays to accommodate authentic inspiration, as the actors amusingly say whatever they like to each other and the tyrannical director while the camera is turning, because everything is to be dubbed later in the studio. Continuity supervisor Suzon Faye (Pauline Belle) crossly tells Godard that his cavalier disregard for matching the eyelines in successive shots mean a problem in the edit; a hint of the imminent revolution in film grammar, perhaps, though Linklater’s Godard has the humility to say he didn’t invent jump-cuts.By the end, Linklater’s Godard is as opaque and essentially imperturbable as he was in the beginning, seething with competitive anguish at the success of Truffaut’s The 400 Blows in Cannes and struggling to get into parties and film sets; and again, none of this, arguably, is inaccurate. But it’s all very smooth: a slick Steadicam ride through a historic, tumultuous moment.Nouvelle Vague screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalRichard LinklaterDrama filmsComedy filmsBreathless (A Bout de Souffle)ParisreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a ferociously intense study of a lonely, passionate woman and her descent into bipolar disorder as she is left alone all day with a new baby in a rambling Montana house originally belonging to her husband’s uncle, who took his own life in a gruesome way that we are not permitted to discover until some way into the movie.Die My Love is another film to remind you that Ramsay believes you should make movies the way VS Naipaul believed you should write books: from a position of strength. There is, simply, overwhelming muscular strength in this picture: in her direction, in Paul Davies’s sound design, in the saturated colour of Seamus McGarvey’s cinematography, and of course in the performances themselves. Robert Pattinson is Jackson, a guy whose job takes him away from home a lot of the time with a box of condoms in the glove-compartment, andJennifer Lawrenceis Grace, who is supposedly going to write a novel during the baby’s nap times – though, worryingly, there isn’t a single book in the house. Sissy Spacek brings her unfakeable presence to the role of Jackson’s mum Pam, who lives in the neighbouring property, a woman for whom the stress of caring for her husband Harry (Nick Nolte), who has dementia, has caused her to sleepwalk, laughing maniacally and carrying a loaded gun.At first, Jackson and Grace are insanely happy, having sex all of the time – and then most of the time and then some of the time and then none of the time. There is a brutally comic quasi-Victoria Wood scene in which she confronts Jackson on this, and demands that they have sex, right now, in the car, the way they used to. Grace’s drinking and mood swings are becoming more explosive - a tragically integral part of her sexiness, in fact - and you learn to tense when Jackson and Grace are in the car, quarrelling or pretty much making out, taking their eyes off the road as the music on the radio pounds ever louder. Grace tries to hold on to her sanity as she ranges around the fields surrounding the house, with suspicions about Jackson’s fidelity worsening her post-natal depression – and here Die My Love joins the long list of films influenced byAndrew Wyeth’s painting Christina’s World.Reality begins to merge into woozy hallucination as Grace begins to fantasise about a guy she saw in a parking lot, who merges with a guy on a motorcycle who periodically roars through a neighbouring forest; this is Karl, played by LaKeith Stanfield, whose relatively undeveloped presence is perhaps a flaw in the film. Grace’s imagination catastrophises everything she sees - creating painful, violent crises, in fact, and in the fiction of her imagination, a form of melodramatic self-harm; no sooner has one set of cuts begun to heal, then she gives herself another - the renewing stigmata of her private sadness Calvary.It hardly needs to be said that subtlety is not really among this film’s attributes - but it is fierce, angry, engaged, and intensely, sensually alert to every detail of its own pleasure and pain.Die My Love screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsJennifer LawrenceRobert PattinsonLynne RamsayNick NoltereviewsShareReuse this content"

TheCrystal Palaceplayers collapsed where they were standing, crumpled across the grass like a battle scene fresco. The colours made it beautiful, red and blue against the deep green, new optics, new names, the unstyled celebrations of players unused to these moments, Jean-Philippe Mateta face down, Will Hughes flat on his back, arms spread like a snow angel.There was a rush of noise as the clock began to tick again. And that was that. Sound the tram bells, unleash the smoke plumes from the Tasty Jerk shack – 119 years into Crystal Palace’s existence this mercurial club with the clanky corrugated stadium has finally won a major trophy.Crystal Palace stun Manchester City to win FA Cup amid drama and Henderson controversyRead moreOliver Glasner’s team did it in the best way, scoring early thenholding on to the 1-0 leadagainst a Manchester City team that played for most of this FA Cup final like a collection of ghosts stuck in the same deathly patterns. By the end City had managed the unusual combined feat of dominating all the key metrics but also never looking at any stage like they deserved to win.For Palace’s fans this was the best kind of final, one of those days that passes as a series of moments ready to be pored over and lovingly rewound. There was the oddly touching sight of Glasner on his touchline in all-black and huge white trainers, like a spy out for a jog, arms raised constantly in a mix of triumph and alarm through the final 10 minutes.There was the noise from the Palace fans, basically the Selhurst ultras scaled up across an entire Wembley end. The plume of red smoke caught in the light through the top of the stand. And below it the sight of people weeping with unaffected pleasure, overcome by the familiar but still always surprising catharsis of this shared spectacleBest of all for Palace’s tale of the day, they were granted a huge slice of luck by the dual incompetence of the refereeing team during an amazing 20-minute spell that settled the game. Palace were already 1-0 up by the time the referee failed to spot Dean Henderson batting the ball away from a rampaging Erling Haaland outside his area. This was then compounded by the VAR bizarrely concluding this was not, repeat not, a goalscoring opportunity and therefore a red card offence. To repeat. Haaland. Edge of the box. Ball in front of him. You have seen this bloke before? Or indeed this sport? Or any sport?View image in fullscreenFireworks are let off before the game in front of the massed Palace support.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMaybe there was something karmic here, a circular righting of wrongs, Henderson’s swipe of the arms an exact physical echo of Alan Pardew’s Cup final dance of shame back in 2016.

But this was one of those victories that deserves its own blarney. Wembley had been a lovely place at kick-off, drenched in a brittle late spring chill. It is an underrated vast grey concrete bowl on these occasions, the steep open tiers creating a proper noise cauldron effect. And the game was basically decided by that 20-minute first-half spell when the entire day turned a shade of Selhurst.Early on Palace had done little but press and chase. It was passive possession from City, even the midfield counterpress a little geriatric and creaky. And on 16 minutes Palace scored a brilliant goal with their first thrust, made by Mateta’s hold and spin and by Daniel Muñoz’s gallop into the empty space on the City left. His cross was just the right height for Eberechi Eze, the first-time finish beautifully soft, a man enjoying the sweetness of the contact, feeling his own moment rising up to meet him.Eight minutes later the game was waved on as Henderson handled outside his box. And of course it was Henderson who then saved brilliantly from the penalty spot from Omar Marmoush, a sequence of events that might have been designed with great care by a team of experts simply to annoy and enrage Pep Guardiola.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace fans react to Eberechi Eze’s goal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was odd that Haaland didn’t take the penalty. Three of his eight career missed penalties have come this season. But this is also the most lethal one-shot goalscorer in the world. It’s a final. What exactly is the point of Haaland if he’s not taking on these moments?For Palace the day began to take on a golden hue from that point. Adam Wharton was brilliantly committed, a footballer who slouches around the place like a man waiting for the supermarket to open on a Sunday morning, but whose brain is always whirring. Mateta played with heart and guile. There were cheers as Hughes was sent on toward the end like the pair of wellies you pull out of the car boot for a muddy walk. Eze made the key difference. He is another deceptive footballer, the cage baller who is actually hugely controlled and reliable in his output, who knows exactly how good he is.There was always a danger this could feel like a meeting of a team looking to achieve the most notable act in its history, and another trying to grab a consolation trophy on the way down. Objectively Palace’s victory has some obvious good things to tell English football. Premier League teams should be this good. Buy expertise, build a vast academy, develop players, spend well.It’s a victory for a place that makes footballers, the Concrete Catalonia, that square of suburban south-east London that produces a disproportionate ratio of top-tier English players. It is arguably a victory for something other than gruelling systems-ball, the super squad, the hoovering up of trophies. No doubt these points will now be advanced, as will the idea of a kind ofFA Cuprevivalism. Mainly though, this was just a lovely afternoon, and a day in the sun for a club that had waited long enough.Explore more on these topicsFA CupCrystal PalaceManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

It feels as if we have again witnessed precisely that.Quail Hollow’s devilish last three holes, the Green Mile, can ruin tournament aspirations.Scottie Schefflerdecided to play that stretch in two under par. The world No 1 had already produced an outrageous eagle at the 14th and birdied the next. Five holes, five under. Catch him if you can.Scheffler’s 65 and 11-under-par total means this US PGA Championship is suddenly his to lose. He leads Alex Norán by three in Charlotte. Daylight, such valuable daylight to a player of Scheffler’s strength. It is almost as if he has making up to do; a year ago, his US PGA planwas disrupted by an arrestoutside the gates of Valhalla. This is far more familiar stuff.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler on the 9th hole.Photograph: Matt York/APHistory is on Scheffler’s side. On the previous two occasions he has held 54-hole major leads, both at Augusta National, he has won. There feels inevitability about what comes next. Norén has never won a major before. Neither have JT Poston, Kim Si-woo or Jhonattan Vegas. Jon Rahm is six under and not without hope or motivation. Including, that is, in proving his switch to LIVGolfhas not undermined his major chances. The odds of toppling Scheffler in this mood, though, are long.“It is hard to express how hungry I may be for a major,” Rahm said. “About as hungry as anybody can be in this situation.“Me going to LIV and playing worse in majors had nothing to do with where I was playing golf. My swing was simply not at the level it had to be for me to compete. It’s easier to post a score on non-major championship courses and venues, and I think when you get to the biggest stages like this one and these courses, those flaws are going to get exposed.“There’s been weeks where I was able to play better, like the Open last year. The Masters wasn’t a good start but it got better as the week was on and I’m still working and trying to get my swing to a better spot.“I would say even in 2023, after winning the Masters, I did not play good at all until the Ryder Cup. So I think the problems began earlier than people think. But I’m now getting closer to a position of being comfortable. I think this week so far and this round has been a show of it.”View image in fullscreenJon Rahm of Spain hits from the rough on the 2nd.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAAs Rahm spoke, Scheffler was pressing upon the accelerator. This was his 25th major round in the 60s since 2022. These three in a row – 69, 68, 65 – will scare the field. And yet, Scheffler was merely one under for his day on the 14th tee. There, he cracked a three-wood from 304 yards to within 3ft of the cup. It was the moment of this slow burning major.“I battled hard out there, it was really tough today,” Scheffler said. “The winds were really gusting, the greens firmed up but I did a good job of staying patient. I struck the ball a lot better than in the first couple of rounds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was able to find some momentum there. I need more good golf, I need to stay in the present. I have a lot of very good players chasing me on the leaderboard.”Rahm’s fellow LIV man Bryson DeChambeau is a shot further back, a situation that would be even better but for a horrible finish. DeChambeau three-putted the 16th and found water on 17. When asked about his level of frustration, he replied: “That’s why golf is the worst four-letter word in the world.” DeChambeau at one point held the lead.

But later that evening Paquetá’s wife, Maria Fournier, detailed the anguish the case is causing, writing on Instagram: “My husband has a posture and a strength that I admire and impresses me. We have been living this nightmare for two years.”Paquetá was left on the bench for last weekend’s2-0 win at Manchester United, with Potter at the time explaining that he had a cold. But as he prepared for Sunday’s visit of Nottingham Forest, Potter said: “It was both. The week he had was a particularly tough week for him personally, which I think everyone can understand. And then as a result of that he was feeling under the weather on the day before the game and the day of the game.“So I didn’t want to risk him and make it worse for him. But he’s trained really well, he wants to be part of the team and we’ll see how to use him for the weekend.View image in fullscreenGraham Potter chose not to risk Lucas Paquetá against Manchester United.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“There’s a bit going round to be fair – I’ve had a bit of a sore throat as well. But you know what it’s like; sometimes stress, pressure, can manifest itself in a different way.”Potter is desperate for the case to be resolved before the start of next season. “For everybody concerned, yes,” he said. “It’s not my thing to talk about, but the sooner the better for everyone.“In fairness to Lucas I think he’s handled it brilliantly. I don’t know if I said it’s taken its toll on him. That week was a big week for him, but he has to go through what he has to go through.“But generally he’s come in and conducted himself in a really good way. He’s just ready to help the team. I think coming into work is a distraction for him, it takes his mind off things. He’s handled it really well. For me I’m just there to support him, the same with his teammates.”Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Pole position was claimed by McLaren’s Oscar Piastri but only after the session had been stopped twice because of two huge accidents, one involving Yuki Tsunoda and the other Franco Colapinto.High drama, from which both drivers emerged fortunately unhurt, was followed by an equally bruising blow which Lewis Hamilton described as leaving him “devastated”, in the form of disappointment for Ferrari fans at their home race, with a shock early exit for bothCharles Leclercand Hamilton in 11th and 12th.In the final moments, Piastri had put in a blistering lap to beat Red Bull’sMax Verstappeninto second place by just three-hundredths of a second, with Mercedes’ George Russell in third, Piastri’s McLaren teammate and title rival Lando Norris a disappointing fourth and Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso in fifth.It is all but impossible at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e DinoFerrarito escape the legacy of the death of Ayrton Senna who was killed here in an accident in 1994, the same weekend when Roland Ratzenberger died a day before in qualifying. Senna’s colours still adorn parts of the town on the walk to the circuit. His memorial, a simple brass casting of the driver in contemplation, attracts huge crowds over the race weekend and is flanked by countless flags.View image in fullscreenThe Ayrton Senna monument at Imola.Photograph: David Davies/PAThe circuit underwent major changes after that weekend for safety purposes and the sport also adopted new procedures that have proved extraordinarily successful in improving safety. Yet the fundamental challenge of some of these old-school tracks remains. Imola is still fearsomely quick and narrow, where inch-perfect commitment is rewarded but is also emphatic in punishing errors, as Tsunoda discovered, in a slight misjudgment that led to him crashing out at high speed with a major impact at the Villeneuve chicane during Q1.He had taken just a little too much kerb on the way in and was violently spat out, spinning before hitting the barriers backwards. The impact threw his car up and nearly over the tyre wall before smashing back into the ground upside down, then bouncing upright again on the track side of the barriers. He emerged and was able to walk away, appearing unhurt.Memorable F1 races at Imola, from Alonso v Schumacher to Hamilton’s hard rainRead moreIt was an exceptionally violent impact and the car’s safety cell and halo device functioned superbly to protect him.“I saw the replay, I’m like: ‘Jesus is he really OK?’” said hisRed Bullteammate Verstappen. “It was a big hit, was a big impact, a lot of damage as well but most important is that Yuki’s OK.”Russell also noted how well the car had protected the driver. “It’s great to see that he’s OK and with a crash like that it shows how impressive these cars are in a situation like that,” he said.Despite the severity of the accident Tsunoda’s overwhelming feeling was that he had let the team down. “First thing I thought was I was just very ashamed, disappointed, frustrated,” he said, having been pronounced fit at the medical centre.Shortly after the session restarted and with just seconds remaining in Q1 Colapinto, making his debut for Alpine, went wide, putting his left-rear wheel off at the exit of Tamburello. As he lost the rear, also at high speed, the car spun repeatedly and hurtled across the gravel trap before slamming into the barrier, entering front first with a jarring impact. He too was unhurt but apologetic at his error.For Ferrari, hopeful of at least putting on a decent show for thetifosiat Imola, there was only disappointment. Hamilton and Leclerc’s last laps were both marked by small errors and they then tumbled down the order as the cars behind went quicker. It left Hamilton shocked as Ferrari’s difficulties continue to hound them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norris could not match it and while Verstappen did improve in sector one he could do no better for the rest of the lap and Piastri had the place by just three-hundredths of a second with a time of 1min 14.670sec.Colapinto had set a good enough time to make it to Q2 so finished in 15th but has a one-place grid penalty for being released into the pit lane before the session had been restarted after Tsunoda’s crash. Tsunoda will start from the back of the grid.Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon were in sixth and seventh for Williams, Lance Stroll in eighth for Aston Martin and Isack Hadjar and Pierre Gasly in ninth and 10th for Racing Bulls.

On SundayManchester Unitedand Chelsea will face each other in the Women’s FA Cup final for a second time.Chelsea won1-0 in 2023to deny United in what was their maiden FA Cup final appearance, something Marc Skinner’s side avenged last season by beating the Blues in the semi-finals to limit Emma Hayes’ final season trophy haul to one. United went on tobeat Tottenham 4-0 in the finalto secure their first major trophy following promotion from the Championship. Now they have a chance to demonstrate exactly how far they have come, as they bid to retain their crown against a domestically unbeaten Chelsea looking to land a treble.More than 85,000 tickets have been sold for the showdown at Wembley, 10 years on from the first time the national stadium hosted the final. The hope is that the numbers through the turnstiles actually breach the 80,000 mark for the first time, having teetered just below that for the past two years. NewChelseaminority owner, Alexis Ohanian, is expected to be in attendance with his wife, the 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams, while Olly Murs will perform before kick-off. Increasingly a star-studded occasion, the Women’s FA Cup final continues to be a boundary-pusher, acting as an indicator of the potential in the women’s game for mainstream attention.‘We want to push for more’: a Chelsea treble would not be enough for Catarina MacarioRead moreThe last time Sonia Bompastor stepped on to the Wembley pitch was in 2012, when she lined up for France in the semi-finals of the Olympics against Japan in front of 61,482 spectators, a match the French lost 2-1 to miss out on a chance to return to the stadium for the final. Now she is back pitchside hoping to end her first season as Chelsea manager ingloriously dominant style.It is these sorts of occasions that persuaded Bompastor to manage in England after a lengthy career at eight-time Champions League winners Lyon, first as a player and later as the manager. “The fact you can play in front of thousands of people at a historic stadium and win one of the most famous trophies in England, the FA Cup, is something that potentially only happens a few times in your life,” she says, adding that winning the domestic treble would make this a “really good season” but “not a perfect one because we missed one trophy”.Defeat by Barcelonain the Champions League semi-finals still weighs heavily.Quick GuideWomen's FA Cup gets new TV dealShowThe Women’s FA Cup will be broadcast on Channel 4 and TNT Sports from next season in a three-year rights deal with the Football Association. They succeed the BBC as the broadcasters in the first standalone deal for the competition.The BBC extended its Women's FA Cup deal in 2019, agreeing to air both semi-finals and the final and to put out highlight reels and short videos.The new deal will bring a significant increase in the number of games broadcast live, with coverage guaranteed from the first round. TNT is to air 19 matches across the season and Channel 4 has committed to one match per round from the third round, with all six matches co-exclusive with TNT, which also holds rights to the men’s FA Cup and men’s FA Youth Cup.The Football Association's chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said: “This is a significant moment for the Adobe Women’s FA Cup. We have two broadcast partners who are deeply committed to growing the competition and taking it to new audiences over the next three seasons. Channel 4 and TNT are brilliant sports broadcasters and are the perfect combination for this very special tournament. We are delighted to be working with them and look forward to continuing to grow women’s football together.”Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I will be really proud for sure, really proud of my players, my staff, but this is a final,” adds Bompastor. “We play Man United, a team which is used to playing in this final now and they are a really strong team. They haven’t conceded many goals and I think we need to be reminded of that as well. This final will be 50-50.”Bompastor’s attempts to dull the perception that Chelsea are favourites to win will not get far. The Women’s Super League champions have won 13 of their last 15 games against United across all competitions and are heading into their eighth FA Cup final, of which they have won five. The gap is closing, though, with United having scored 18 goals and conceded only once on the way to Wembley.View image in fullscreenMary Earps, Ella Toone, Millie Turner and Manchester United’s manager Marc Skinner lift the FA Cup in May 2024.Photograph: Naomi Baker/The FA/Getty Images“We’re rebels,” United’s manager Skinner says. “I’m a rebel, my nature is rebellious. It’s about not accepting that because they have the best resources, they will be the best team on every occasion. When you set yourself up for that challenge, you know you will have to go through hell to get the victory. When you are prepared for that then you can do something special. I believe in our quality to do that.”Skinner adds that United will have to “structurally manage the game and be in it consistently” to prevail. “To beat Chelsea in a final would be another step for us,” he says. “It’s a big team, a big game and there’s no doubt it will be a tight game.”Skinner laughs when asked about the new £20m investment his rivals have received from Ohanian. “Do you know what I was thinking? I was thinking that Chelsea need a bit more money and more investment because they haven’t quite got enough,” he says. “Joking aside, I’ve said this before but I’m not a green-eyed monster. You would be envious of that budget, of course you would, but the investment probably adds more scrutiny to Sonia Bompastor because if you don’t deliver the Champions League … the challenge becomes harder in my opinion.“I do echo what Sonia said: it’s great that they want to be the frontrunners in terms of showing how we should invest in the women’s game. I don’t know how that money is going to be invested but it’s great the interest is there. I genuinely mean that, coming from someone who has been in the women’s game for so long. We have to find a way to beat that. That’s my job. But I’m sure you’ll agree, it’s fantastic for the game and hopefully more people can do that.”The respect for Chelsea also extends to the pitch but, as Skinner makes clear, that will not hold United back on Sunday. “They have achieved something incredible this season. But there is no fear.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupChelseaManchester UnitedWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If so Leicester will have to look for some different solutions. This meeting of the leagues’s top two was compared to a “heavyweight boxing clash” by Bath’s head of rugby, Johann van Graan, but even the ability of Leicester’s defence to soak up plenty of punishment could not save them in the end.Bath’s first-choice forwards are increasingly taking no prisoners and this seven-try victory on a glorious early summer evening was the latest reason to fancy they will eventually end up as champions. The highlight was a memorable score from Tom Dunn, setting a new club record for the most Premiership appearances in the famous blue, black and white striped jersey. The hooker’s extravagant dummy and subsequent 20-metre sprint to the line would have been collector’s items even in a game of social tag rugbyFriday’s Challenge Cup final against Lyon in Cardiff is Bath’s next target and, aside from a limping Cam Redpath, they are managing to sidestep serious injury to their star men. Maintain their current momentum for another month and this really could be a special season, with Finn Russell’s playmaking quality and their enviable bench resources once again conspicuous here. “We spoke about going 12 rounds for 80 minutes and I thought we did that,” said a satisfied Van Graan.Quick GuideSaints dent Saracens' playoff plansShowThe Northampton replacement prop Tarek Haffar scored two tries in the final quarter of a 28-24 home  Premiership win that put a huge dent in Saracens' hopes of securing an end-of-season playoff spot.The visitors, who were 24-7 ahead at one stage, looked surefire winners but a remarkable and spirited comeback saw Saints score three converted tries, one with the last play of the game.Saracens have now lost on their last five trips to Northampton and their defeat means that the playoff place is now out of their hands as a Bristol victory next week will secure the West Country side that coveted fourth-placed position.Tom Willis, Juan-Martín González, Alex Goode and Rotimi Segun each crossed over for Saracens, with Fergus Burke converting two. Haffar scored twice for the hosts, with Josh Kemeny also on the try-scoring sheet. There was also a penalty try award, with Rory Hutchinson kicking two conversions and Fin Smith adding one.The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, described his side’s defeat as “a painful experience”. He added: \"We were all over the place in the final 20 minutes. In the first half we played with intensity and exactly as we had planned to have the better of full-strength European Cup finalists, but after that we were really poor.”The winning try scored by Haffar in the final minute came from a flowing move but there were clear suspicions of two forward passes. As a result, there were lengthy television match official reviews but the try was allowed to stand despite the protestations of their skipper, Maro Itoje. McCall said: “Everybody knows if it doesn’t look right and it probably didn’t but I haven’t studied any replays in detail.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Leicester were also denied a losing bonus point and, for all their bristling competitiveness, were unable to muster a single point in a one-sided second half which Bath won 24-0. The Tigers, though, still have a home game against bottom-placed Newcastle to play and it remains all but certain they will have a home semi-final in next month’s playoffs.“We worked really hard in defence but I just don’t think we had that extra edge in attack,” said the Leicester head coach, Michael Cheika. “We learned a good lesson … but we’ve still got our destiny well and truly in our own hands.”Despite the final scoreline it was a genuinely absorbing contest for the first hour but Cheika’s side could not sustain their first-half competitiveness. Then again, the majority of sides would have wilted in the face of such prolonged forward pressure. It is reaching the point where the only team capable of stopping Bath from lifting their first domestic league title for 29 years is probably themselves.View image in fullscreenBath’s Cam Redpath is tackled by Leicester’s Hanro Liebenberg.Photograph: Nigel French/PAVan Graan is not yet counting any trophy-shaped chickens but, beneath a cloudless blue sky, Bath looked encouragingly sharp from the outset. Ben Spencer always has a keen eye for a gap but even he must have been surprised at the space that suddenly opened up as he ran 35 metres direct from a lineout to score in the right corner.The Tigers also had to cope with an early visit to the sin-bin for their England forward Ollie Chessum after a high challenge on Will Muir. Even with 14 men, though, they kept playing and a lovely chip over the top from Jack van Poortvliet yielded a try for a soaring Joe Woodward. Their lead proved only fleeting, Bath rumbling over through Beno Obano with Chessum still off the pitch.With Dunn also shown a yellow card the momentum was about to swing again. Some home fans felt Freddie Steward’s long scoring pass may have drifted forwards but there was absolutely no doubt about Adam Radwan’s flying finish in the corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was also Hill who burst clear at the other end to relieve a lengthy period of pressure and set up the position from which Russell put Quinn Roux over for Bath’s third try of the afternoon.It gave the hosts a four-point half-time lead that, given Bath’s bench depth, boded well for the hosts. So it proved, a delighted Dunn bringing the house down with his eye-catching try after 47 minutes, helped by a lovely one-handed offload from Russell.Will Stuart added a fifth from close range and further tries for Joe Cokanasiga and Will Butt sealed a win which rubber-stamped Bath’s place at the top of the regular season table.

Perhaps at the beginning of an extraordinary career, his release by Sheffield Wednesday and those days earning £30 a game at Stocksbridge Park Steels hounding defenders in the Northern Premier League. For six months an electronic ankle tag – after he was convicted of assault – meant midweek matches were off-menu and games often saw him being subbed after an hour so he could jump over fences and into his parents’ car to beat his 6pm curfew. By then, his work was usually done.Word of mouth spread. He signed for Halifax for £15,000 in 2010, then Fleetwood a year later for 10 times that. Ten months on he joined Leicester in the Championship in a £1m deal, a non-league record. The story goes that he first appeared on Nigel Pearson’s radar while scoring 66 goals across 107 Stocksbridge appearances. A friend of the Leicester manager who ran a fish and chip shop in Sheffield mentioned his name, a throwaway comment about a prolific striker in the eighth tier. Soon scouts were flocking to Fleetwood and Leicester beat off competition from Blackpool, Peterborough and Southampton to sign a 25-year-old by the name ofJamie Vardy.‘A total embarrassment’: Jamie Vardy apologises for Leicester’s awful seasonRead moreSteve Walsh, then an assistant manager and head of recruitment at Leicester, first scouted him when Fleetwood won an FA Cup tie at Yeovil in 2011. Vardy scored and Walsh made him his No 1 target. Leicester showed Vardy a montage of his best bits, and Pearson’s status as a Wednesday hero helped persuade him Leicester was the best destination. He scored a header on debut at Torquay but initially found things tough and, concerned the jump was too big, asked to return to Fleetwood on loan. “I think that’s the one and only time in his life where I would say he lost confidence,” Walsh recalls. “He was used to being the star of the show, scoring every week and people saying how good he was. All of a sudden there was a reality check. We had to point out that it takes time to adjust.”On Sunday Vardy, who turns 39 in January, will make his500th and finalappearance for Leicester, he hopes with a 200th goal to boot. No wonder Netflix is releasing a documentary charting his journey from turning up at sloping pitches in a clapped-out Renault Clio to breaking records on the biggest stage, chiefly scoring in 11 successive Premier League matches to eclipse Ruud van Nistelrooy, now his manager at Leicester. “His story is almost a fairytale, but they don’t need a script – just tell the truth,” says Walsh. “He is a living legend.”View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy at Stocksbridge Park Steels.Photograph: Stocksbridge Park SteelsVardy has won the Premier League, against all odds under Claudio Ranieri in 2016, the division’s Golden Boot, the FA Cup, played in the Champions League, for England at a World Cup and been nominated for the Ballon d’Or. He is joint 14th on the list of Premier League goalscorers, two shy of Teddy Sheringham. He even has a Guinness World Records certificate owing to thatrecord-breaking goal against Manchester Uniteden route to the title. “Not many managers would but Claudio mentioned it beforehand,” says the former Leicester winger Marc Albrighton. “‘Yes, we want to get the result but let’s do our utmost to help Vards break this record.’”Wearing gold boots, Vardy latched on to a no-look pass by Christian Fuchs and capped a devastating counterattack. “Everyone was so genuinely happy for Vards to have achieved the record,” Fuchs says. “It was pure joy. The only other moment that could top that was whenTottenham drew against Chelsea– that was probably more emotional and intense.”Fuchs is talking about theinfamous partyat Vardy’s old house in Melton Mowbray on the night Leicester achieved the unthinkable. Vardy, who spent the day at a tattoo parlour, invited his teammates around in case Spurs dropped points and Leicester were champions. Many arrived with crates of beer. Late on Eden Hazard equalised for Chelsea, prompting Vardy’s TV to be smashed and Fuchs to ask the Belgian if he could kiss his feet when they met on the final day. The celebrations went on until 4am. All the while television crews and supporters gathered outside. “Suddenly we saw Vards’s house on the telly in front of us … it was crazy,” says Fuchs. “We felt like Hollywood stars. When I drove out of the gates, you couldn’t see where you were going – just camera flashes.”Leicester’s No 9 gets a kick out of riling opponents and opposition fans. He even learns swear words in different languages to unsettle defenders. “He kills them with kindness,” says Fuchs, chuckling. Clips of Vardy mimicking an eagle after scoring against Crystal Palace, howling like a wolf after netting against Wolves and running the length of the pitch to shush supporters spring to mind. Last August, his final act against Tottenham was to point towards the Premier League badge on his shirt.“I never understand why fans wind him up because he’s one of the worst people you can wind up,” says the former Leicester defender Danny Simpson. “Because it gives him a lift. If he thinks he is a bit off the pace, he knows how to raise his game, be it smashing into defenders, having a bit of beef with the fans. He loves all of that. That’s a big part of his game when he’s in that zone.” Does Vardy get more stick than any other current player? “Probably,” was his own verdict this week.View image in fullscreenLeicester fans in a pub celebrate Chelsea’s second goal against Spurs in 2016, which sealed the title.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters“In a time where footballers are high-profile celebrities, famous figures, he is very relatable to the fans,” says Albrighton. “He has brought his non-league personality to the top level. A lot of players come through structured academies and are told to act a certain way. He’s got this raw personality and character that initially took everybody by surprise but I think now even most opposition fans actually love him.”Central to Vardy’s success has been his straight-talking and carefree character. “He is like a big kid; you hear him before you see him,” says one of his former coaches of a player known to blast balls against the windows of Leicester’s training pavilion. This is the Vardy who wore a “Chat shit, get banged” T-shirt on their title parade, a nod to his Facebook post from 2011, when he was an unknown.Then there is the Spider-Man costume he donned at training under Claude Puel in 2019. “Claude was giving him stick about his new red and blue ‘Spider-Man’ boots and I remember Vards saying: ‘If you want Spider-Man, you can have Spider-Man,’” says Albrighton. “He came in the next day with this morphsuit on, hid behind the bush, waited until Claude walked out, jumped out and scared him.”View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy turns up to training dressed as Spider-Man.Photograph: Getty ImagesThis month he blew the referee David Webb’s whistle while the official lay injured. “Endless stories … not many PG ones,” says Albrighton. “He was always up to something, whether it was winding the laundry girls up or, going back a bit, hurling bread rolls at the youth team as they were singing in front of us at Christmas to get their boot money. Suddenly pigs in blankets are flying all over the canteen. He is a one-off.” Vardy’s status as a joker was cemented while playing cards or Uno on the team bus, smashing eggs with Fuchs or pranking Demarai Gray by sending a bucket of water into his hotel room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Leicester’s title-winning season, on the eve of matches, he drank port out of a Lucozade bottle. “I had a few of those with him,” says Simpson. “If you compare his body 13 years ago with now, he hasn’t changed.”Vardy ditched his homemade Skittles and vodka cocktail only when the then Leicester physio, Dave Rennie, informed him it hampered his rehabilitation from a dead leg. “He ripped up the manual,” Walsh says.Vardy’s story is also one of rejection. He was heartbroken by Wednesday letting him go as a schoolboy. At the peak of his powers heturned down Arsenalafter they triggered his £22m release clause during Euro 2016. “He stuck with Leicester and people must give him credit for that,” Walsh says.View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy poses with the Golden Boot in the summer of 2020.Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC/Getty ImagesVardy has not always been the best trainer but teammates count on him to deliver and view him as the ultimate team player. “Some strikers just want to score and have all of these goal accolades but he just wants to win and I think that is what sets him apart,” says Simpson. Sometimes it means home truths. “In a Jamie Vardy way,” says Fuchs, laughing. In recent years Vardy had a cryotherapy chamber installed at his Lincolnshire home to aid recovery. This season he has reported to Leicester’s Seagrave base on days off to enhance his fitness or watch training. In terms of finishing, Van Nistelrooy is perhaps best placed to comment. “Jamie is never bothered about the occasion,” the Dutchman says. “He’s always ice-cold.”There are a trove of moments to cherish. His hat-trick in the9-0 rout of Southamptonin 2019, his strike from distance against Liverpool in 2016. “I can picture the ball coming over his shoulder, bouncing and him hitting it from about 30 yards,” says Walsh. Simpson highlights the run to the Champions League quarter-finals. “I will never forget the away goal he got against Sevilla … a good night.” Fuchs picks out Vardy’s volley against West Brom in 2018. “A ball from Riyad Mahrez came over his head, he took it first-time, just inside the box, left foot … it was one of those classic Vardy goals, something out of nothing.”Vardy represents the best £1m Leicester have spent. “I don’t think I’m ever going to top that one,” says Walsh, stressing the signing was a team effort, highlighting Craig Shakespeare, the scout David Mills and Kevin Phillips, who coached Vardy. “I had to go to the owner, Vichai [Srivaddhanaprabha], and ask if he was prepared to pay the money, which is always difficult. But Vichai had complete trust in the staff to build a team he expected would do well … it turned out all right.”Vardy is the last remaining member of the title-winning squad, many of whom will be present to witness him bow out against Ipswich. Vardy considers himself emotionless but the planned tributes will test his tear ducts. He plans to carry on playing but will for ever be synonymous with Leicester. “You don’t see him get too emotional away from the pitch,” Simpson says. “Maybe this time he will because it’s the last time his kids will walk on with him.”View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy celebrates a new Premier League record by scoring for the 11th consecutive game against Manchester United in November 2015.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThen, maybe, there will be one final knees-up. The class of 2016 WhatsApp group has been abuzz, the message from the firestarter typically to the point. “‘We’re having another Vardy Party, you better all make sure you’re there,’” Simpson says. “We need to celebrate him and what he’s achieved. It’s going to be weird not seeing him in a Leicester shirt, looking at the team and seeing Vardy’s not up front. Hopefully he gets that 200th goal which would be the perfect ending.”Explore more on these topicsJamie VardyLeicester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I feel like it’s been a long time coming,” he said. “Last year I got so close to the Giro so many times. And for today to happen is so, so special.”Wilco Kelderman of Visma-Lease a Bike finished second while XDS-Astana’s Ulissi came in third, with both riders finishing 38 seconds behind Plapp. Ulissi’s effort was enough for him to take the overall leader’s pink jersey from Primoz Roglic, with the Italian screaming in delight when he was told the maglia rosa was his.Ulissi will be the first Italian to wear the pink jersey since Alessandro De Marchi in 2021, ending an 86-stage drought. He leads his teammate Lorenzo Fortunato by 12 seconds while Roglic is 17 seconds behind.“I don’t easily let myself be taken by emotions but when I was presented with the Maglia Rosa and saw XDS Astana stamped on it, I became emotional, I have to admit,” Ulissi said. “I’m 35, soon 36 [in July]. I’ve had nice satisfactions in my cycling career with eight stage wins at the Giro, I’ve built a nice family with three daughters. So when I first saw this jersey, I thought of all my family members, especially those who took me to races when I was a kid.”View image in fullscreenDiego Ulissi dons the maglia rosa after stage eight.Photograph: Jennifer Lorenzini/ReutersPlapp attacked with 45km to go, kicking into a high gear to leave the field behind and riding solo to the top on the Montelago climb. He stayed in the lead after taking maximum points in the fight for the blue jersey and he had a minute’s lead on the chasers while the peloton was more than six minutes behind with about 20km to go.He showed no signs of slowing down as he conquered the Gagliole climb and remained more than five minutes ahead of the peloton on the descent. “I knew I couldn’t beat any of them in a sprint so I had to go at some stage pretty early. The way the racing’s been going this year, the long moves have been really, really successful,” he said.“The first one to make a move always has an advantage. I just thought I’d give it a crack. And, to be honest, I just wanted a bit of a head start on the descent as well.”Young Briton Max Poole, 22, dropped to sixth overall – 47 seconds down – while Simon Yates sits 10th, 56 seconds off the pace.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaCyclingAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s easy. It could say the cost of borrowing will tumble over the next year, step by certain step, until it settles at a level that is low enough to boost growth.Each cut in interest rates from today’s 4.25% to 3%, or even better 2.5%, would be used by businesses to boost production, make crucial investments or pay down debts, making them more financially secure.The economy would begin to move ahead, lubricated by cheaper loans. Younger homeowners – those with a mortgage – could spend more on furnishings and a meal out. Some people might make life-changing decisions, such as buying their first home, swapping a diesel car for an electric one, or taking on extra responsibilities, such as having children.Reform UK,which is topping many national polls, is the main beneficiary when the Bank conveys timidity and circumspection about what to do over the coming months. As the apparent opposition leader-in-waiting, Farage needs interest rates to stay where they are, paralysing the economy, depressing growth and making life difficult for Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer.At its last meeting,the Bank’s interest rate-setting committee split three ways, confusing the outlook even further. Two members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted for a half point cut and two voted to leave rates on hold. The winning majority split the difference, voting for a quarter-point cut, to 4.25%, though without indicating how they will vote in the coming months.Financial markets could provide some clarity. They think they know where interest rates are heading, and that is steadily downwards. However, on Tuesday the Bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, cautioned that investors may be getting ahead of themselves.Economic figures out this week have further muddied the waters. UK GDProse by 0.7%between January and March, which is a level of growth that some G7 countries will struggle to achieve by the end of the year. As a guide to how some other countries are struggling, Italy’s 2025 growth forecast was recently downgraded by the country’s central bank from 1.2% to 0.6%.Yet the UK’s recovery is discounted by the Bank as a blip in what is likely to be a long period of stagnation. Ask Threadneedle Street what it considers to be the underlying growth rate and it will say 0.1% in each quarter for the rest of the year. More important, says the MPC, is the strength shown by wages growth, which must be crushed before the war against inflation is won.The Bank has a good deal of support for its conservative stance. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is also convinced thatearnings are racing ahead(at more than 5% a year) and argues for only a slow easing of monetary policy.Higher wages could feed a surge in prices and delay inflation returning to the Bank’s 2% target. There is due to be a rise in the consumer prices index from 2.6% in March to a peak of about 3.5% in the autumn, and that could be just the start.NIESR tells those who worry about growth to badger the government and to leave the central bank alone. It is Reeves who should be pulling all the levers at her disposal, including borrowing more, to get the economy moving through the gears.In the last period of calm, between the euro crisis of 2012 and the pandemic in 2020, this argument made sense. Borrowing was cheap and the UK was in a position to increase public debt for the purpose of investment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Equally unfortunate wasa cack-handed attempt by Liz Trussin 2022 to burst through the debt ceiling, which shocked financial markets and put a constraint on the UK’s future borrowing capacity.Reeves, understandably fearful of a repeat, gave herself only a little room to spend more on investment in last year’s budget, paid for in part by heavy tax rises and a severe constraint on day-to-day spending. Even then,markets wobbled in January, concerned that Labour’s spending was unaffordable.Since then, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which initially upgraded its growth projections, hasbrought them back down again. It agrees with the Bank of England that the economy will expand by about 1% this year.In this situation, MPC members should do more than clutch their prayer beads, hopeful that they can maintain another year of punishingly high interest rates without any seismic political consequences. They should tell households and businesses that the Bank is aware of rising anxiety about job cuts and stagnant growth. The implication would be clear: that Britain doesn’t need Farage to break the chains holding back growth because the institutions we have at the moment can do the job.To give themselves cover, they could say interest rates will go up again if high wages growth persists above 5% next year. That’s a deal the public could understand. Then we can get moving.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesEconomic policyReform UKBank of EnglandEconomicsNigel FarageMonetary policy committeecommentShareReuse this content"

Gopi Hinduja and his family, who run the Hinduja Group, arecitedas Britain’s richest family in the latest Sunday Times rich list. The big story so far seems to be that their wealth has dropped to £35.3bn from £37.2bn the year before. But that story, and much of the discussion there will be this weekend, risks missing therealstory. “Rich list” is barely the right description for the extreme wealth we should be talking about.In 1989, when the Sunday Times first published its annual rich list, to be included someone would need to have 6,000 times the wealth of the average person in the UK. That’s already a pretty big gap – but this has now tripled to more than 18,000 times the average, according toa studyby the University of Greenwich.The problem is that wealth begets wealth. Those who own land, property and shares have seen huge returns on these investments and been able to accumulate more assets over time, generating even more returns. To make things worse, while income inequality can be tempered by measures like a minimum wage or progressive taxes, policymakers seem unable or unwilling to do anything about wealth accumulation.Successive governments have claimed to be for “working people” but have turned a blind eye to the fact that most wealth accumulation in recent decades has been through the passive collection of returns on existing wealth, rather than earned through hard work or entrepreneurial brilliance. Worst of all, there is no upper limit on how much an individual or family can acquire. Instead, we are asked to celebrate the vast fortunes of the super-rich and watch passively as we hurtle towards the world’s first trillionaires. One thing that could help curb the excesses of wealth inequality is an “extreme wealth line”, an idea that is starting to gain traction among campaigners and policy experts.Decades ago, economists at the World Bank formulated an extreme poverty line by calculating how much money someone would need to buy enough food and essentials to survive each day. That innovation helped us compare poverty across countries and eras, and helped policymakers prioritise interventions to reduce poverty. It was also an ethical statement: the point below which a society should not let any household fall.Today, I believe we need an equivalent line for the other end of the spectrum: the point above which a society should not let any household accumulate wealth, and above which policymakers should act proactively to curb wealth accumulation.View image in fullscreenThe Sunday Times rich list storyPhotograph: Sunday TimesThere is a point above which wealth gives you too much power to shape politics through lobbying, party donations or freebies, just as there is a point above which the environmental impacts of super-rich lifestyles cause extreme harm to the environment. And a point above which wealth concentration undermines economic competition and reduces productive investment. Meanwhile, rising inequality tears at the social fabric that binds us together. We risk becoming an island of have-yachts and have-nots, rather than an island of strangers.This is where it gets tricky. If you ask what that point is, you get a range of answers. Is it when someone becomes a billionaire? Is it the top 1% of wealth holders? Is it €10m, the suggestion made by the Dutch writer Ingrid Robeyns in her excellent bookLimitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth?Here’s where the work done by the compilers of the rich list to tot up the value of land, property, shares and “other assets such as art and racehorses” of the super-rich might come in handy. Turns out you need net assets of £350m to make it into this year’s list. I’m not sure whether they intended it, but this is about 1,000 times the medianhouseholdwealth in Great Britain. Interestingly, a recent surveyfoundnearly two-thirds of millionaires from G20 countries think wealth poses a risk to society when someone has 1,000 times the societal median. Even the rich think there is a line.King Charles’s wealth swells to match Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty on UK rich listRead moreI would love to put these options to a citizens’ assembly and ask a representative sample of British people to consider the evidence, hear the arguments, and come up with a point above which wealth should be considered extreme. Without some kind of independent understanding of when wealth becomes harmful, there will be the option to obfuscate, impede and nullify attempts to rein in extreme wealth harms.Finding a democratic way of defining an extreme wealth line could finally give politicians the mandate and a framework to tackle inequality before it is too late. It would give the chancellor a solid rationale for raising tax rates on those whose wealth exceeds the line. If she is not prepared to go that far, tax and inheritance rules could be changed to compel the rich to donate wealth above the line to charity. If even that feels too audacious, government could limit the inheritance that any nepo baby could have to below the extreme wealth line.Last week Bill Gatespledgedto give away 99% of his fortune, quoting an 1889essay(The Gospel of Wealth) by tycoon Andrew Carnegie, who wrote: “The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” This is admirable, but it is naive and dangerous for society to rely on the enlightened philanthropist to curb inequality. We need to stop glorifying wealth through rich lists and start drawing a line on extreme wealth.Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation and author of Power to the PeopleExplore more on these topicsRich listsOpinionInequalitySunday TimescommentShareReuse this content"

But it shines a light on a universal issueSat 17 May 2025 09.00 EDTShareJustice for Valeria MárquezValeria Márquez was killedin one of the most horrifically public ways possible. On Tuesday evening, the 23-year-old Mexican social media influencer, who had built up a large following with videos about beauty and makeup, was recording a TikTok livestream in the beauty salon where she worked in Jalisco, a state in west-central Mexico. A man entered the establishment and, with her video still running, shot her dead.Many details of the case are still unclear. However, Márquez’s death is being investigated as a femicide, according to a statement by the Jalisco state prosecutor.Femicide isdefinedas the intentional killing of a woman or girl with gender-related motivations. (The term for killing males because of their sex, something that has occurred during war andgenocide, is androcide.)While femicide is a universal and age-old issue, it is poorly understood. It is also sometimes wilfully misunderstood by some men’s rights activists, who like to argue that it is a nonexistent problem because men make upthe majority of victims(and perpetrators) of homicide. So it’s worth spelling out the parameters of femicide. If a woman is killed in a robbery gone wrong, that’s (probably) not femicide. If she is killed by an ex-boyfriend who views women as the property of men rather than autonomous human beings, that’s femicide. “Honour”-related killings are also obviously femicide.We are missing a lot of data on femicide. “Too many victims of femicide still go uncounted: for roughly four in 10 intentional murders of women and girls, there is not enough information to identify them as gender-related killings because of national variation in criminal justice recording and investigation practices,”UN Women wrote in a report last year.Naming the problem – understanding why femicide is different from homicide – is important, because it helps us solve it. If more institutions took misogyny and domestic violence seriously, we’d see fewer dead women. A report bythe World Health Organization notes, for example, that “stronger gun laws related to men previously cited for or convicted of intimate partner abuse are of particular importance in reducing rates of femicide”.Justice for Márquez doesn’t just involve finding her killer and ensuring they are punished. If this was femicide, it means being very clear about the misogyny that led to her death. It means holding all the lawmakers and institutions that perpetuate this misogyny to account. Justice means understanding that her death wasn’t some sort of tragic one-off, but part of a far larger problem.Biden still thinks he could have beaten Trump. Do we really need this? | Arwa MahdawiRead more“If I die, I want a loud death,” the Palestinianphotojournalist Fatima Hassounawrote on social media shortly before she was killed by an Israeli airstrike this year. “I don’t want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear, an impact that will remain through time … ”That quote has haunted me ever since I read it. So many women who die premature and violent deaths die quiet deaths. They become statistics. Márquez must not just become another femicide statistic. Let her death, which has shone a spotlight on femicide, be loud. Let it have an impact that will remain through time.Donald Trump, legally defined sexual predator, posts that Taylor Swift is ‘no longer hot’The president is obsessed with Swift and hasposted aboutthe pop star multiple times.The US military buys a LOT of ViagraThe big Viagra budget, which has beenwidely discussed for years, isn’t problematic in itself. The issue is that while the government has no problem spending this money on what is arguably gender-affirming care for cis men, it keeps yelling that trans people are a drain on resources. The issue is in the news once again after a judge in theTalbott v USA case, which challenges Trump’s transgender military ban, noted that the militaryspends eight times more on erectile dysfunction medicationthan on gender-affirming care for trans service members.British woman unknowingly had a criminal record for 56 years for being a lesbianLiz Stead, 78, got kicked out of the military in 1969 when higher-ups sniffed out proof (a love letter) of Sapphic activity. She was also given a criminal conviction for “perceived same-sex sexual activity”. As the BBC reports, she only found outabout the convictionwhen applying for a scheme that awards financial redress for veterans sacked during a ban on homosexuality.Ms Rachel is getting vile abuse for caring about dead and maimed Palestinian childrenDue to the fact that Israelisn’t allowing international journalistsinto Gaza andmurderingthe Palestinian journalists and aid workers who are trapped in the enclave, it’s impossible to really know how many children have been killed orstarved to deathby now. But we know there aremore child amputeesin Gaza than anywhere else in the world and,by one estimate, Israel kills a child in Gaza every 45 minutes. We also know that young children who do survive will never recover from beingmalnourishedand traumatized in those formative years. While many people stay silent about agenocidethat has been funded and enabled by the US, UK and Europe, the children’s educator and entertainer Rachel Accurso (known and loved by parents of toddlers everywhere as Ms Rachel) has been speaking upabout children in Gaza. And, quite predictably, she’s gettingvile abusefor it – including a piece in theNew York Timesthat amplifies baseless, ridiculous and dangerous claims that shemay be funded by Hamas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We don’t want to come anyway, Mr StarmerHanifa Safia AdanIn all the noise about borders and boats, one truth keeps getting ignored: most Africans don’t want to leave. We believe our home is worth fighting for – if western countries could just stop exploiting itSupported byAbout this contentSat 17 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareKeir Starmer said this week that Britain was becoming an “island of strangers”.“The current system is contributing to forces that are slowly pulling our country apart,” said the British prime minister. “I believe we need to reduce immigration, significantly.”Statements such as this are becoming more common across western democracies. Politicians and pundits portray immigration as a threat. It dominates election campaigns, drives public fear and above all distracts from domestic failures.But in all the noise about borders, smashing the gangs and stopping the boats, one truth keeps getting ignored: not all of us want to come.In fact, most of us are staying. Not because it’s easy, but because we believe in fixing what’s broken at home. But the west’s own policies make that harder.In the UK, immigration has gone from a fringe talking point to a national obsession. In 1997,just 3%of Britons thought immigration was a key political issue. By the time of the Brexit referendum in 2016, that number had shot up to 48%. Reform UK and its leader Nigel Farage have built entire political identities around stopping immigration. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump made anti-immigrant rhetoric central to his election campaign, once again promising mass deportations and calling migrants criminals who were “poisoning the blood of the nation”.But despite all this noise, the numbers tell a different story. According to the Mo Ibrahim Foundation,only 12% of migrants in Europe and 5% in North Americaare from Africa. Most African migrants don’t even leave the continent,they move to neighbouring countriesfor work, safety, or opportunity.Western countries make trade deals that gut local economies and extract resources, then act surprised when people search for alternativesOur governments can make it difficult to stay, however. In Kenya, we are dealing with high unemployment,inflated public debt,widespread corruptionand growing repression including enforced disappearances. Between June and November 2024, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights reported 74 enforced disappearances, with 26 individuals still missing.I’ve been part of youth-led protests against these issues. I’ve helped to organise medical support for victims of police violence. I’ve sat with families whose children were killed for asking questions. This is the painful truth behind why people leave – not because they don’t love home, but because they are pushed out by systems that don’t value them.Still, there has been a shift recently. Young people are beginning to see their presence as a form of resistance. More of us are asking: what if we stopped running and started rebuilding? InKenya, the phrase “Kenya ni home” (Kenya is home) has become a rallying cry. It’s a message of ownership, not resignation.And this isn’t just happening in Kenya. It’s part of a broader wave of youth-led resistance across the global south and beyond.Tortured over a tweet: how the war between Kenya’s Gen Z and their president has moved onlineRead moreIn Bangladesh, university students launchedmassive protestsin 2024 over a controversialjob quota system, which reserved a large portion of civil service positions for certain groups. What started as a campus issue grew into a national movement, students poured into the streets in Dhaka and other cities, demanding fairness and opportunity.InSerbia,protests began in November after the collapse of a newly renovated railway station canopy in Novi Sad, which killed 16 people and exposed systemic corruption and government negligence. Serbian students saw that corruption kills and are mobilising against authoritarianism.InMozambiquethe youth-led protests of 2024 were ignited by widespread allegations of electoral fraud in the October general election. Young people were fed up with the ruling party’s extended grip on power and their leadership’s persistent failure to provide answers to issues like unemployment and declining standards of living.What’s more troubling is how the west’s immigration panic actually contributes to the instability it claims to fear. Western countries continue to sign security deals with repressive governments,selling weaponsto the very regimes that push people to flee. They make trade deals that gut local economies and extract resources, then act surprised when people search for alternatives.They also delay climate justice. Africa contributes less than 4% of global emissions but suffers some of the worst effects of the climate crisis such as droughts, floods and hunger. Yet the countries most responsible areslow to acton climate finance and adaptation funding. When young people’s farms dry up or their homes are swept away, where do you expect them to go?Even the global financial system isn’t neutral: just look at Kenya. The 2024 finance bill wasn’t just a local decision, it washeavily influencedby the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which pushed the government to raise more domestic revenue as part of its loan conditions. These directives often come with little public transparency and force austerity measures that hit ordinary Kenyans the hardest. Under pressure to meet IMF targets, the government proposed painful tax rises on fuel, food and digital services, while public services such as healthcare and education remain underfunded.I believe in Kenya. Because it’s home. I’ve lived the hardship, corruption, police brutality and broken systems. But I’ve also seen people show up for each other. Young people raising money for gunshot victims, cleaning up flood-hit neighbourhoods, looking out for each other.Most of us stay because we believe home is worth fighting for.Hanifa Safia Adan is a Kenyan journalist and human rights defenderExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentOpinionImmigration and asylumMigrationMigration and developmentKenyaAfricaProtestcommentShareReuse this content"

Good – now we might have to face realityJason OkundayeIn 2015, the UK placed first on the rainbow map. But even then, as an 18-year-old gay man, I knew that wasn’t the whole storySat 17 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 17 May 2025 06.14 EDTShareIt should surprise no one that the UK has dropped to its lowest ever position on theannual “rainbow map” of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA), which ranks the best and worst European countries on the basis of laws and policies that affect LGBTQ+ people. The map assesses each country throughseven categories, including equality and non-discrimination, legal gender recognition and asylum.Thesupreme court’s rulinglast month that a person’s sex in the Equality Act 2010 refers only to “biological sex” – a redefining of trans people’s rights to their detriment, and a political and cultural victory for the gender critical movement – will have played a key role in the downgrading. Senior politicians immediately capitulated to the ruling,interpreting the implicationsof the verdict beyond the scope of the court, with the gay health secretary evenrenouncing his own supportfor the notion that “trans women are women”. Meanwhile, the Scottish government hasdropped plansto legislate for a ban on conversion therapy during this parliamentary session. At this rate of progress the ranking will be even lower next year, as it should be.While I despair at the UK’s decline on LGBTQ+ rights, I do not despair at the ranking. In 2015, the year I turned 18 and began to live as an openly gay man, the UK was ranked first on the rainbow map. Times were different then. There was a sense that the coalition and later Conservative government was on the side of LGBTQ+ people. Same-sex marriage had been legalised in 2013, David Cameron called for action totackle transphobic bullying, and in 2017 Theresa May wouldannounce reformto the gender recognition act to allow people to change gender without medical checks.It is tempting to be wistful for those days, but I had always found there to be a grating smugness to Britain’s celebration of its supposed progressiveness. Even the entire basis of the rainbow map, first published in 2009, felt suspect; I’m sure that it is innocently intended to provide analysis of LGBTQ+ rights in Europe, but so often metrics like this have been mobilised to present western, European countries as bastions of progress where countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East represented a backwards order.But that backwardness has always been present in the UK, including when we topped the rainbow map ranking. How could a country that had obliged LGBTQ+ asylum seekers to submit footage of “highly personal sexual activity” toback up asylum claimsever be held up as the pinnacle of European social progress (unless it was determined that some LGBTQ+ people counted more than others). Even with such practices from the Home Office, the UKscored positively on asylumin 2015.View image in fullscreenKate Litman marching for Alice with her parents and brother at Trans Pride 2022, London.Photograph: @kate__litman / XIn any case, the pretence has now dropped. Labourpledged a “fully trans-inclusive ban”on conversion therapy in its 2024 manifesto. Starmer has not mentioned the issue once since the King’s speech. LGBTQ+ people are no longer politically expedient – and trans people attract too much hostility, division and controversy – so advocacy for our collective rights no longer seems to be a priority. This is a disaster, but it is also instructive for future strategy: those activists who believed that legislative wins can secure true equality or progress, and that social progressivism was the natural order of history, are now seeing the consequences of such a delusion.One of the recommendations for how the UK can improve its standing in next year’s rainbow map is to “ensure timely and accessible trans healthcare, including addressing excessive waiting times and restoring access to puberty blockers for trans youth” – provision of which has beenindefinitely bannedfollowing the Cass review of April 2024. Alice Litman, a 20-year-old transgender woman,died by suicide in 2022after spending 1,023 days waiting for her first appointment with the now disbanded Gender Identity Development Service. I spoke to her sister, Kate, a university friend of mine, who, with her family, formed theCampaign for Alice. She told me that at Alice’s inquest it was heard that, if processes continued at the current rate, those entering the waiting list today would face amore than 20-year waitbefore their first appointment.Such delays had made Alice’s life “intolerable”, but added to that was “the general atmosphere of hostility towards trans people and her anxiety and fear about participating in public life”. I have previously spoken with trans people who had come out and transitioned around the so-calledtransgender tipping pointin the mid-2010s. Not all are convinced that they would do the same in the current political environment. As a lesbian woman, Kate feels further indignation that such regress has been presented as a “victory for lesbians”. She says “my identity is politicised and weaponised in a way that is antithetical to my beliefs.”Political parties banned from Pride events after UK gender rulingRead moreSo what is the roadmap for progress now? For the Campaign for Alice, some level of political will is needed to effect the “simple changes” to trans healthcare, such asproviding the fundingand training to enable GPs to prescribe hormones that could prevent further tragedies. Such will has disappeared from senior politicians. That today’s government would enact May’s pledges to ease gender transition is unthinkable.Repealing the 2022 Nationality and Borders Actwould facilitate LGBTQ+ asylum seekers to find safe residence with dignity, but Starmer’srecent rhetoric indicatesthat this problem will only worsen.For now, what is most important is clarity over who is truly on the side of LGBTQ+ people and who or what we can rely on. Following the supreme court ruling, organisers of upcoming summer Pride events in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Brightonhave banned political partiesfrom participating. That feels like a welcome recognition of reality: solidarity is to be found within our communities, and not in the whims of politicians who seek to divide and exploit us.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

His family’s wealth has ballooned by more than $3bn, according to press estimates, and the reported benefits fromcryptocurrenciesand other investment deals such as plans for new Trump-branded family properties may be far larger. Deals for billions more have been inked by business associates close to Trump, meaning that their political support for the White House can translate into lucrative contracts abroad.US and Qatar sign defense and aviation deal as Trump doubles down on luxury aircraft giftRead more“When we’re negotiating with other countries, the concern is that our negotiating position will change if someone does a favor or delivers a gift to the president of the United States,” Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the administration of George W Bush, said.“Whether it’s trying to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war, or the Middle East or anything else. You know the the impression is given that the position of the United States can be swayed and even bought.”Others argue that the message being sent by the White House is that American foreign policy is being sold to the highest bidder.View image in fullscreenA Boeing plane similar to the one Qatar offered to the US defense department.Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP“Trump has put a for-sale sign out front of the White House,” said Norm Eisen, the executive director of the legal advocacy group State Democracy Defenders Fund and a White House “ethics czar” and ambassador to the Czech Republic under Barack Obama. “Of course you’re going to see Qatar and UAE as like a bidding war. Qatar says: ‘I’ll give you a $400m plane,’ and the UAE says: ‘Hold my beer,I’ll give your crypto company $2bn.’”In a particularly eye-catching incident this week, Qatar offered to give the US Department of Defense a$400m Boeing 747-8that Trump had suggested could be used as Air Force One and then passed on to his presidential library after he leaves office.The plane has become a lightning rod among US Democrats, and critics have argued it violates the emoluments clause of the constitution that prohibits the president from receiving gifts from foreign entities.Trump had called the plane a “great gesture” from Qatar and said that it would be “stupid” for him not to accept the gift. A Democratic lawmaker had called the plane a “flying palace”, andeven diehard Maga supporterssuch as the commentators Laura Loomer and Ben Shapiro have criticised it publicly.2:59Trump in the Middle East: investments, end of Syria sanctions and a potential Iran deal – videoPainter suggested that it would be similar to King George III gifting George Washington a copy of the royal stagecoach for his use in office. “You think the founders wouldn’t have considered that a bribe?” he said.Trump 2.0 takes quid pro quo fears to new heights with $400m flying griftRead moreBut Gulf states have offered other incentives, including a$2bn investmentfrom a UAE-controlled funds into a Trump-linked stablecoin that could incentivise the president to shape foreign policy in favour of Abu Dhabi.An advisory sent to congressional Democrats this week and seen by the Guardian said: “President Trump and the Trump family have moved at breakneck speed to profit from a massive crypto scam on the American people.”The gifts, and in particular the potential gift of a jet, have led to a series of denunciations on Capitol Hill as they seek to build momentum for a legislative push.“This isn’t America first. This is not what he promised the American people. This is Trump first,” said Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut. “He is willing to put our nation’s security at risk, take unconstitutional bribes, just so he can fly himself and his Mar-a-Lago golf buddies around the world in gold-plated luxury planes gifted to him by foreign governments.”But is it illegal? AsQatarwould give the jet to the Department of Defense, some experts have said that it may not directly violate the emoluments clause or other laws, even if Trump were to make use of the plane while in office.“Never seen it before,” said Scott Amey, the general counsel of the Project On Government Oversight, a non-profit government watchdog group based in Washington. “Is it allowed? I’m still uncertain.”Past administrations would have run from the perceived conflicts of interest being welcomed by Trump. The former White House ethics advisers described crises such as when a Gulf state tried to present a Rolex to a national security adviser, or when the Boston Red Sox tried to gift the White House chief of staff a baseball bat signed by all the players (the addressee was forced to pay its estimated market value, said Painter). Eisen said that he forbade Obama from even refinancing the mortgage on his house in Chicago because of his capacities to influence the market.“The status quo has been saying no, because it’s an actual and apparent conflict of interest, and it could jeopardize our domestic and foreign policies,” said Amey. ”It certainly doesn’t pass the sniff test for a lot of Americans.”The lavish gifts and other investments come as Trump is reshaping America’s policy in the Middle East, skipping Israel and turning toward the Gulf states in a flurry of deal-making that could benefit both sides handsomely. And Trump’s family and other advisers, such as Steve Witkoff, with interests in the Gulf states are closely involved.View image in fullscreenTrump receives the Order of Zayed from the UAE president.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images“When the firstTrump administrationcame in, I saw that people in the Gulf said, ‘Finally, an American administration we understand. He sends us his son-in-law to talk to us,’” said Dr F Gregory Gause III of the Middle East Institute, a former professor of international affairs at the Bush School. “It’s a startling change in American norms … the notion that Trump family private business and US government business walk hand in hand is remarkable.”While potential gifts like a jet cannot be hidden, the potential to move billions of dollars in cryptocurrency secretly has watchdogs, the political opposition and other foreign observers deeply concerned. “We’re talking about billions of dollars, almost infinite money, that can be paid by anyone,” said one senior European diplomat. One little-known China-linked firm with no revenue last year bought $300m of a Trump meme coin this week, raising further concerns of dark foreign money moving intoUS politics.Chuck Schumer says he’ll obstruct Trump’s justice department picks over Qatar jet giftRead moreSenate Democrats have called for rewriting the Genius Act, Trump-backed legislation that they say would provide for far-too-lax regulation of so-called stablecoins, in order to ban him from benefiting. “If Congress is going to supercharge the use of stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, it must include safeguards that make it harder for criminals, terrorists, and foreign adversaries to exploit the financial system and put our national security at risk,” said the memo.The flood of foreign money has left former officials who used to carefully track the giving of gifts and other goods from foreign government infuriated.The rules can be “annoying and sort of stupid, but it is what separates the good guys from the bad guys, as it relates to corruption and good governance”, said Rufus Gifford, a former head of protocol for the state department, which also tracks gifts to US officials from foreign governments. “And I think that Trump just has no respect for those institutions that have been set up for a very specific purpose, which is to root out corruption.“It is very, very disturbing that a president of the United States could be in a position to profit off the office in which he holds,” he continued. “And that is, again, something that is never supposed to be able to happen. And it’s really quite extraordinary.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaQatarUnited Arab EmiratesSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

I didn’t hear any sound,” Marjanen was quoted as saying.One helicopter was registered in Estonia and the other in Austria, according to an Estonian Public Broadcasting report, citing Finland’s Helsingin Sanomat newspaper. Both belonged to Estonian companies. One was owned by NOBE and the other by Eleon, the report added.The helicopters were reportedly en route to a hobby aviation event, according to the Pori Aviation Club.The National Bureau of Investigation is leading a joint inquiry with local police, and Finnish and Estonian authorities are cooperating.Explore more on these topicsHelicopter crashesFinlandEstoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And yet fewer than ever are being born in the Nordic country.Although falling birthrates are a global trend, such is the concern in Oslo the government has commissioned a birthrate committee to investigate the causes and possible consequences and devise strategies to reverse the population’s current trajectory.Over the last two decades, Norway’sfertility rateplummeted from 1.98 children for each woman in 2009 to 1.40 in 2023, a historic low. This is despite a parental leave policy that entitles parents to 12 months of shared paid leave for the birth, plus an additional year each afterwards.If current fertility trends continue, the sparsely populated country of nearly 5.5 million people could face wide-ranging consequences ranging from problems caring for the elderly to a reduced labour force.Factors contributing to the decline include housing costs, postponing having children until ones 30s, fewer people having more than two children, and an increase in those not having children at all.View image in fullscreenA Gustav Vigeland sculpture in Vigeland Park in Oslo. Norwegians are postponing having children until their 30s.Photograph: Mariano Garcia/Alamy“It is uncertain what the cohort fertility of the younger generations will be, but the trend is downward,” said the Norwegian minister for children and families, Lene Vågslid. “Norway is among the countries where birthrates have dropped the most over the past 10 to 15 years,” she said.As well as leading to “long-term societal changes”, low birthrates could, she said, “eventually weaken the social model and the intergenerational contract”.The birthrate committee’s chair, Rannveig Kaldager Hart, said there had been a “tempo shift” among Norwegians in their 20s and 30s, leading to a fall in overall births.“There is a really marked fall among young adults in their 20s, both in their early and their late 20s,” she said from her office at the University of Oslo. “And then there was a long-term increase [in births] among adults in their 30s, but now that has stalled or even reversed.”View image in fullscreenThe average number of children women have in Norway fell to 1.40 in 2023.Photograph: Alexey Sizov/AlamyKaldager Hart, an associate professor at the university’s department of health economics and health management and a fertility researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said the changes among both age groups were important.“If you just look at the baseline, it’s very easy to just focus on the 20s picture,” Kaldager Hart said. “If Norwegians have a child, they often have one more. But then there also used to be a fair share that had three kids and that’s become less common.” A lack of time and more women working full-time are both factors, but another is the rise of “intensive parenting”.This is a shift away from informal family-based responsibility for raising children, where parents followed their intuition, to a more child-centred, expert-informed approach, where parents pour in more time, emotion and financial investment to ensure the success of their children for which they feel personally responsible.Chart of fertility rate“If you want to follow each child very closely and take them to their activities and all these things that you’re supposed to do, then maybe it’s just easier to have two children than to have three,” said Kaldager Hart.Raquel Herrero-Arias, an associate professor specialising in parenting at the University of Bergen, said there had been “a clear intensification of parenting” in recent years. “Raising children has become more demanding, more complex and more expansive, involving tasks and responsibilities that were not traditionally associated with the parental role.”Intensive parenting, she added, “promotes the idea of parental determinism – that parents are the primary architects of their children’s future” – rather than structural issues such as poverty, employment, discrimination or housing.Despite Norway’s family-friendly policies, this cultural expectation could make parenthood seem less appealing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next it will look at the impact of rising housing costs and what interventions could be made there.Unlike the cost of childcare, which is falling in Norway, the rising cost of owning a home is thought to be a barrier to having children because many aspiring parents see it as a prerequisite.Twenty-two-year-old Marita Løkken, a special needs education student at Oslo University, said she wanted to have two or three children in the future, and was not surprised that birthrates were falling because of the length of time it took to get on the career ladder.“To have a bachelors [degree] is just not worth anything when you’re looking for a job, then you have to study for even longer and then people wait even longer [to have children]. So it isn’t surprising at all,” said Løkken.“If the circumstances were different, I think more people would have had kids,” said Løkken. “Money is tight for a lot of people, especially as inflation now is crazy. It’s a lot of things coming together. It’s difficult.”A society with fewer children was not only bad for a country’s future prospects, but aslo had a marked impact on society, said Kaldager Hart.It can shift resources from schools to care homes, for example, meaning children might have to travel a long way to go to school. “A society with very few children can also be a society where it’s harder to be a child.Childrencontribute something to the lives of their parents but also to the life of society,” she said.Explore more on these topicsNorwayFertility crisisParents and parentingEuropeFamilyChildcareChildrenPopulationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A state-appointed commission, overseen by the national economy ministry, manages events at the Zappeion.“Here we have another monument, a newer monument, whose administration, if nothing else, should have sought approval from the ministry of culture before granting permission,” Mendoni, a classical archaeologist herself, added. “Here, too, we have a breach of archaeological law.”As the images circulated via social media and public outrage grew, Adidas hit back, saying Greek legislation had been meticulously followed. “All required permits were received and adhered to,” the German company said in an email statement cited by Reuters on Friday. “No image of the Acropolis monument was used by Adidas for advertising or other purposes.”In a nation where the ancient past often weighs heavily, the political opposition have had a field day questioning the centre-right government’s role in the furore.“The Acropolis, a global symbol of culture and democracy, cannot be treated as a backdrop for commercial use,” said the opposition Pasok party, accusing the government of negligence. “Serious questions arise about the role and responsibility of the culture ministry.”The leftwing Syriza party deplored the advertisement, describing it as the “commodification of Greece’s cultural heritage”.“The image of a sports shoe ‘stepping’ on the Acropolis, created using a drone swarm for advertising purposes, constitutes an offensive commercialisation of the core of our cultural heritage,” it said.Management of the Acropolis, Greece’s most visited attraction, is particularly sensitive because of the acrimonious debate that has long raged over artefacts, not least the Parthenon sculptures, removed from the site.With half of the temple’s famous frieze housed in the British Museum, Greek officials tread a fine line in the campaign to win the treasures back.Only weeks ago, the Greek culture ministryprovoked outcrywhen it rejected a request from the country’s leading contemporary director, the Oscar-winning Yorgos Lanthimos, to end his latest movie Bugonia on the monument.The proposed scenes were deemed “incompatible with the symbolism … and the values the Acropolis represents”. Social media this weekend was replete with criticism from users posting: “No to Yorgos Lanthimos. Yes to Adidas. No to art, yes to money.”Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking while on a trip to Albania, Starmer said: “We took difficult decisions, but the right decisions, at the budget, including the decision that we took on winter fuel.”“We are now seeing the benefits of that in the interest rate cuts and the growth figures. They were difficult decisions but the right decisions.”Simon Francis, the coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said that “any U-turn is welcome, but what matters now is the detail, especially if winter fuel payments are not restored to all pensioners.“We need to see the pension credit threshold raised significantly, a taper system introduced to stop people missing out on winter fuel payments for being just £1 over the line, and wider targeting of this support, including for those on non-means-tested disability benefits or carer’s allowance. Above all, ministers must learn lessons from this scandalous decision.”Nigel Farage’sReform UKparty, which won the Runcorn and Helsby byelection and 677 council seats this month, has pledged to reverse the cut.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said any unburnt stands of black sheoak were “of critical importance for the species”.A state government report intobiodiversity after the firesagreed that surviving black sheoak stands were of “great significance for this highly specialised bird species” and advised “great care” would be needed in managing the forests.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut conservation groups have expressed concern that the state’s forest fire management department plans to burn what they estimate is 13,000 hectares of the bird’s remaining habitat over the next three years.Gippsland Environment Group and the Victorian National Parks Association say the birds may never recover if the burns go ahead.View image in fullscreenLouise Crisp examines a fire-damaged sheoak grove near Lakes Entrance.Photograph: Lisa RobertsLouise Crisp, a founding member of the Gippsland organisation, said she was “horrified” that significant sheoak stands near Lake Tyers and Lakes Entrance were burned.“What they’re doing is burning the glossies’ pantry,” she said.Even a low-intensity fire could cause the cones to open and shed their seed, she said, which was a problem because the birds wouldn’t eat seed from the ground.“My biggest fear is that the population will not have a chance to recover from the incredible effects of the black summer bushfires because Forest Fire Management Victoria are continuing to burn their sole food resource.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA spokesperson for Forest Fire Management Victoria said uncontrollable fire was the greatest threat to cockatoo feeding habitat and low-intensity planned burns helped reduce fuel loads and protect sheoak trees.“Ensuring the protection of native wildlife and habitat in the short and long term is a key priority when implementing our planned burning program,” they said.Dr Daniella Teixeira, an ecologist who researches glossy black cockatoos at Queensland University of Technology and is chairing a species recovery team, said fires in sheoaks needed to be planned carefully to avoid areas where the birds were feeding, particularly if there were nest sites nearby. Fire that was too hot could kill the trees.The birds were “very fussy” about what they ate, she said, “even down to the individual trees”.Teixeira said the species was long-lived and slow to reproduce, laying a single egg every one or two years, and in decline across its range.BirdLife Australia’s president, Mandy Bamford, said Victoria’s glossy black cockatoo population was “tiny”, estimated at 250 birds. Those birds needed sheoaks to feed on and safe places to nest, she said, and BirdLife had worked with the department to map priority sites that needed protection.The department’s preferred burn window in autumn posed an additional risk, she said, as it overlapped with the bird’s breeding season. “If there are nestlings in hollows, they can’t get away. Also, potentially you’re reducing food sources at a critical time when they’re feeding chicks.”Concerns have been raised about Forest Fire Management Victoria activities after an endangeredgreater gliderwas found dead next to a tree-felling operation in Yarra Ranges national park in May 2024. Acritically endangered orchidreceived a last-minute reprieve from a planned burn last October after a local environment group threatened legal action to protect its habitat.Jordan Crook, a nature campaigner at the Victorian National Parks Association, said authorities had a duty to protect threatened species along with houses and infrastructure. He said fire management planning was happening “behind closed doors” without independent oversight.“We need to fundamentally change how we use fire in the landscape and manage bushfires,” he said. “The way we’re currently doing it is damaging our biodiversity and our wildlife habitat.”Explore more on these topicsVictoriaAustralian climate and environment in focusEndangered speciesTrees and forestsBushfiresConservationEnvironmental activismWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

A teacher, campaigner and mountaineer, he has been exploring the relationship between landscape and people since his breakthrough book, Mountains of the Mind, in 2003. His latest work,Is a River Alive?,was more than four years in the making, and, he says, the most urgent book he has written.Q: Yourbookis poignant and inspiring, but one part that made me laugh is where you first tell your son the title and he replies, “Duh, of course it’s alive. That’s going to be a really short book.” So, I should first congratulate you on stringing it out for more than 350 pages!A: Ha! Well there were times I dreamed of writing the haiku version, let’s say. But much as I would long for the answer to the question of the title to be as simple as [my son] Will found it, of course it is a profoundly difficult one. That’s why the title is a question not a declaration: by means of travel, encounter and immersion, the book explores the tributaries and watershed of this vastly complex question of how we imagine rivers – and indeed how we imagine life itself. So I suppose you could say that answering the question of the title couldn’t have taken any less time than it did, and couldn’t have been written in any fewer pages than it was, much as Will would have encouraged me to be more precise.View image in fullscreenRobert Macfarlane.Photograph: Bryan AppleyardQ: The idea of a river being alive is quite heretical these days, isn’t it?A: I love that description: ‘heretical’. Yes! I’m already finding that I’m getting people online who are, on the one hand, saying: “You idiot, of course a river is alive. Why bother even with the question mark?” And then on the other, I’m getting the rationalists who are like: “You idiot, of course a river isn’t alive. It’s just H2O plus gravity. What kind of hippy nonsense are you spouting?”Q: As you point out in the book, even listening to a river was once punished by the lash. Separating people and nature needed violent enforcement …A: Absolutely. The history of the rise of rationalism required the extirpation of “idolatry”, as the New World conquistadors and colonists called it, a version of which was also carried out across the British landscape during the Reformation, when a purging fury was visited upon water in particular as a site of supposedly iconoclastic belief. I’m fascinated by the ways in which the drive to eliminate the dissenting autonomy of water – of running water, of rivers, of springs – has marched often in lockstep with power that seeks to eliminate all forms of spiritual relationships with land and water, replacing the sacred with the fiscal. We are seeing this accelerated now in America, where Doug Burgum, the secretary of state for the interior, at his Senate confirmation hearing, described America’s public lands as America’s “balance sheet”. The assetisation of everything is under way. Everywhere now we see a war continuing to be waged between “anima”, between life, and a power that seeks to mortify that life because it knows that the imaginative “deadening” of land and water is the best step towards maximum extraction.Is this river alive? Robert Macfarlane on the lives, deaths and rights of our riversRead moreQ: Of all the books you’ve written so far, you state that none has felt as urgent as this one. Why?A: The world’s ecological precarity, I suppose, is the plainest answer to that, and especially the precarity of the world’s rivers and freshwater bodies.Q: Although much of the subject matter is quite grim in terms of the despoliation of ecosystems, what comes across is courage, intelligence, love and a desire to do right by future generations and other species. How did it evolve?A: This was initially imagined as a book about “life”. That was ridiculous hubris, of course, but that was really the source: what are the stories we tell about what is alive and what is dead, and how does that compare to the stories that power tells about what is alive and what is dead? Rationalism and instrumentalism tell a presently dominant story about rivers as “inanimate brute matter”, to quote Isaac Newton; about rivers as nothing more than “service providers”. But the total dominance of that story is perilous. I guess that, as a writer, one’s job is to seek other, better, new-old stories about rivers and our relations with them.In English, we have no verb 'to river', but what could be more of a verb than a river?Q: You dive into the lives and deaths of riverson four continents. But it is also very much about human activism –the defenderswho are trying to prevent ecocide on the ground, and the Nature Rights advocates who are trying to change the law at a national or global level. What started you off on this?View image in fullscreenMacfarlane has brought a case in the Ecuador court system to recognise the moral authorship of the cloud forest in the song called Song of the Cedars.Photograph: Robert MacfarlaneA: I wanted to immerse myself in the sheer tumbling vigour of the youngrights-of-naturemovement, which is one of the running currents in the book. I would wake up every morning, and there would be a new email, a new story, a new contact, a new case about rights ofnature. It feels as if that movement is presently stepping forwards very consequentially in terms of re-imagining and re-storying the law in order to strike at some of the deeply anthropocentric foundations of almost all nation-state jurisdictions.Q: Despite the global reach, the different elements seem to be brought together by relationships?A: Absolutely. Other than that of the river, if there is a motif that weaves through the book, it’s that of the mycelium. It’s the mycelium that sets the night-forest alight in the first pages of the Ecuadorian section, and I hope it is the mycelium that is what might be called the visible “ethos” of the book. All that emerges in the book emerges as a function of cooperation, of collaboration, of working together. I wanted to try to find a literary form and a kind of polyphonic texture, in order to reflect the many voices and agencies involved in river-thought and river-guardianship.Q: The book calls for revolution. How did you reflect this in the style?A: The revolution it calls for is a revolution of the imagination. The book’s language is intended to speak to, and of, a changed relationship with rivers – an animated relationship. To give a simple example of this, I write throughout about riverswhoflow, not riversthatorwhichflow. Now that feels totally normal to me. I’d love that usage to spread. Of course, it is already like that in other languages. In French, for instance, it’sla rivière qui coule,le fleuve qui coule.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

At the level of form and pattern, I sought to give the whole book the shape of the water cycle. So we begin at the springs who rise near my home, and we end back at the springs. In between, the book travels up to the mountains and from there descends eventually to reach the sea at the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. By the final pages, language has entered a sort of liquid state. Language has been rivered, as well as me. I strongly felt at times that I was writingwiththe river, or even being written by it.View image in fullscreenIs A River Alive? by Robert MacFarlane.Photograph: Hamish Hamilton/PAQ: How does that co-authorship with a river work?A: It is glaringly obvious to me that all thought is intersubjective. This book could not have been written by sitting still. It could not have been written from the archive. A great deal of it was written in its first form either on rivers, by the banks of rivers, or within earshot of rivers; having spent days following rivers, being buried within rivers, spat out by rivers. I find it bizarre that copyright law rejects the notion of nature or a natural entity as possessing the capacity to be recognised as a “moral author” (to use the term of art from copyright law). As I think you know, [the Earth rights scholar] César [Rodríguez-Garavito], [the mycologist] Giuliana [Furci] and [the musician] Cosmo [Sheldrake] and I, as well as, of course, the Los Cedros cloud forest, have brought a case in the Ecuador court system to recognise the moral authorship of the cloud forest in the song that was written in the course of the book’s research [called Song of the Cedars]. If you listen to the song, you can hear the voices of the forest (the howler monkeys, the bats, the wind, the rivers, the trees). They’re performers of, as well as the co-thinkers of, that song.View image in fullscreenVedanthangal, Chennai.Photograph: Robert MacfarlaneQ: The book starts and finishes in the little chalk streams of Cambridge. Do you feel people here have the same passion to defend rivers as those you met in India, Ecuador and Quebec/Nitassinan?A: I’m lucky to live on the chalk of southern England. We have around 85% of the world’schalk streamshere in England. You could liken it to the Great Barrier Reef, perhaps; a super-rare, remarkable ecosystem. It has brought life to the landscape here, but now we have largely forgotten its marvellousness, its fragility and its rarity. Nevertheless, amazing things are happening in England in terms of what we might call the river guardianship movement: communities rising up to take water companies to court, hold government to account, train a small army of citizen scientists to monitor and test river health. This community response is born of the same impulses, it seems to me, which animate those communities I travelled with and spent time with in other countries. That is to say: born of a belief in water as life, and a belief that our fate flows with that of rivers, and always has.View image in fullscreenRiver Itchen, one of England’s rare chalk streams.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianQ: One of the people in your book, the Waanyi writer Alexis Wright, sayshumanity has never been in more urgent need of powerful storytellers to address the environmental crisis. But I’ve also heard friends say the time for stories is over, we now need action. How do you respond to that?A: Storytelling remains, to me, central and vital in its powers. I reject the notion that storytelling is a fundamentally passive posture. Rather, it can crucially catalyse the conversion of passion into action. It has ways of reaching both heart and mind that argument or polemic can’t. Of course, there are bad stories told well by bad people, as well as good ones told well by good people. In terms of powerful storytellers for the good, as it were, I might take the example of the Innu poet, storyteller and community leader, Rita Mestokosho, who is an important character in the final third of the book. Rita is a lifelong activist for the Innu language, Innu people and Innu land. She sees no distinction between her work as a writer and as an activist. During the years of river research, I saw new-old stories being told again and again around the world, thrillingly and with consequence.Q: What would you like readers to take away from this book?A: I want readers to imagine rivers as having lives, having deaths and even having rights – and to see what flows from that re-imagining in terms of law, culture and politics. And I would like them to take the full downriver journey of the book, from mountain to sea.Q: And where do you go next?A: This book has taken a long time, but among its surprises is that it continues to flow; the stories, rivers and people who run through its pages continue to run through my life very consequentially. I remain closely involved with the ongoing guardianship of Los Cedros in Ecuador, and the need to support and maintain the implementation of the protective ruling there. Oh – and we’ve just completed a big cleanup fundraiser and organisation to airlift out a whole bunch of heavy-duty junk we found high up in the watershed of the Mutehekau Shipu inCanada.

We do not rely on the weather,” said its 83-year-old president, Miguel Torres. “I don’t know how long we can stay here making good wines, maybe 20 or 30 years, I don’t know. Climate change is changing all the circumstances.”The family business has been making wine in Catalonia since 1870, but Torres said: “In 30 to 50 years’ time maybe we have to stop viniculture here.“Tourists are very important for Catalonia and we are very close to Barcelona. This area could be for activity for tourists but viniculture, I don’t think is going to be here.”The group, which invests 11% of its profits every year to combatting and adapting to the climate crisis, may instead have to move at least some of its vineyards “more to the west because it is cooler and we have to have water”.Familia Torres has more than 1,000 hectares of vineyards in Catalonia, mainly in the Penedès region, as well as sites in other parts of Spain, Chile and California.It is now expanding to higher altitudes, producing grapes in Tremp, in the Catalan Pre-Pyrenees, at 950 metres, and acquiring plots in Benabarre, in the Aragonese Pyrenees, at 1,100 metres, where it is still too cold to grow vines. It is also using a variety of techniques to reduce or reuse water in its growing and processing practices.That came after the family recorded a 1C rise in the average temperature in the Penedès region over the past 40 years. The change is causing the harvest to take place 10 days earlier than it did a few decades ago, while the family employs a variety of techniques to slow the ripening of the grapes to protect the right qualities for winemaking.Torres’s comments come after a difficult few years for European vineyards. He said production was down as much as 50% in some of the winemaker’s regions in 2023 – “the worst year I have ever seen” – and still down on historic averages last year amid extreme heat and drought.This year so far has been better – amid winter and spring rains and wider use of irrigation – but Torres said he was concerned that damper conditions bring the threat of mildew.“In the future if we want to have more continuity in the harvest we have to stop the warming,” he said. “The warming is killing the trade.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of thousands of English people come to Spain on holiday and know the brand. We have to keep it alive in the UK.”He said Torres was considering bottling some of its cheaper wines in the UK in order to reduce cost – as it is less costly to import in bulk in tankers.“At least by next year we should be already importing that way in the UK,” Torres said. “British consumers are paying more for wine and there is not another possibility [to importing].

A spokesperson said the timing of the redundancies was unrelated.“We’ve always known this journey would be demanding,” said CEOs Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher in a joint statement about the job losses on Thursday. “Today, we find ourselves navigating a challenging time.”Climeworks attributed its decision to economic issues hitting the whole industry. The company, which is now in a consultation process required by Swiss law when more than 10% of a workforce is at risk, said it was also influenced by uncertainty about a third facility planned for the US, where President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked policies to cut pollution and pushed toscrap incentives for clean energy projects.Direct air capture is one of the most expensive forms of cutting carbon concentrations but has increasingly gained traction among companies seeking more credible ways to compensate their emissions than traditional offsets – which analyses have repeatedly found to be riddled withjunk projects. In recent months, Climeworks has signed deals to permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with Morgan Stanley, TikTok and British Airways.But the technology is still struggling to grow out of the pilot phase. The Icelandic investigation found that both plants had drastically underperformed on their promises. The company’s flagship Mammoth plant in Iceland, which has a nameplate capacity of 36,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year, captured 750 tons in the first 10 months since opening, according to Climeworks, with net removals after accounting for emissions in the supply chain coming to just 105 tons. The carbon savings amount to as much as eight average Americans will have emitted over the same period.The smaller and longer-running Orca plant, which is designed for net removals of 3,000 tons per year, has failed to reach 1,000 tons of net removals in any year since it began operations in 2021.While pilot projects should be expected to struggle and even fail in some ways, the scale of the undercapturing is surprising, said Mark Preston Aragonès, a carbon accounting analyst at environmental group Bellona, who visited the facilities for the launch of the Mammoth plant.“The mistakes I would link to hype and not managing expectations,” he said. “They have themselves to blame, but also the market actors that were kind of egging them on.”Climeworks initially said it could get the high costs of direct air capture down to $100 per ton of carbon by 2030 – the “holy grail” for carbon removal companies – but the company has since scaled that ambition back to $250-350 per ton. The cost of the energy-intensive process today is roughly triple that.A spokesperson for Climeworks said both of its plants in Iceland had delivered valuable progress, with Orca having steadily improved over years while the newer Mammoth was still in a “ramp-up phase” that doesn’t reflect its full potential.“As it often goes with any new infrastructure, we’ve encountered early mechanical issues that we’re actively addressing with upgrades already under way,” the spokesperson said.Carbon dioxide removal is considered a key tool in scientific roadmaps to keep the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century, both to compensate for residual emissions and to bring temperatures down after a likely period of overshoot, but critics have argued that direct air capture will increase emissions if it is powered by fossil fuels and strain limited renewable resources if run on clean energy. Some scientists have also grown alarmed by companies touting carbon removal asan alternative to getting rid of fossil fuels, rather than an add-on that makes sense once cheaper levers have been pulled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They were arrested on Saturday 3 May.Sepahvand was also charged with engaging in conduct; surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research, intending to commit serious violence against a person in the UK.Manesh and Noori have also been charged with engaging in surveillance and reconnaissance, with the intention of committing serious violence against a person in the UK.Another man, arrested on Friday 9 May under the National Security Act, was released without charge on Thursday.They were remanded into custody and will appear for a preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey on 6 June.The district judge Annabel Pilling told the defendants: “I’m sending your case to the central criminal court.“There will be a trial in due course before a judge and jury if you plead not guilty.“The next stage will be a preliminary hearing before the specialist judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb on 6 June.”The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said Iran must be “held to account for its actions”.Cooper said: “I want to thank the police and security services for their continuing work on this very serious investigation, and for their immense dedication to protecting our national security and the safety of our communities.“The charges that have been laid against these three individuals must now take their course through the criminal justice system, and nothing must be done to prejudice the outcome of those proceedings.“But we will also take separate action to address the very serious wider issues raised by this case. The police have confirmed that the foreign state to which these charges relate is Iran, and Iran must be held to account for its actions.“We must also strengthen our powers to protect our national security as we will not tolerate growing state threats on our soil.“Protecting national security is the first duty of government. The police and security services have our continued support in their vital work, and we will take whatever action is needed to tackle the complex threats we face and keep our country and our people safe.”Cmdr Dominic Murphy, from the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said: “These are extremely serious charges under the National Security Act, which have come about following what has been a very complex and fast-moving investigation.“Since the men were arrested two weeks ago, detectives have been working around the clock, and we have worked closely with colleagues in the CPS to reach this point. We have been in contact with the individuals directly affected, and we continue to provide them with support.“Now that these men have been charged I would urge people not to speculate about this case, so that the criminal justice process can run its course.”Frank Ferguson, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service’s special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: “Following a review of the evidence provided by the Metropolitan police service’s counter terrorism command, we have authorised criminal charges against three Iranian nationals.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m making decisions thinking that this is the new normal and we have to make this work,” she said, repeatedly referring to what she called a “0.3 world”.Chapman was the MP for Darlington from 2010 until 2019, when she lost her seat in Boris Johnson’s landslide general election victory. She was ennobled by Starmer in 2021.View image in fullscreenJenny Chapman in the courtyard of the Foreign Office.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianSpeaking in her spacious room in the Foreign Office, she acknowledged the dismay among many longtime supporters of development over the scale of Labour’s cuts, but claimed the sector needed to work differently to win back wavering public support.“I think the aid sector does amazing work and there are incredible people who’ve spent their lives working to make the world a better place,” she said.“At the same time, the truth is that the confidence that the public once had in this agenda has faded, and we need to be honest with ourselves about that. And I will work with them to improve that situation.”“I’m not going to shy away from tough messages when I think they need to be made.”Before the 20-year anniversary of theGleneagles G8 summit, at which the UK secured significant progress on aid and debt relief, Chapman claimed Labour can still lead on these issues.“I’m very proud that the last Labour government led thinking around development. We have to do the same now and we have to shape what development looks like for the next 20 years. That is the job.”Chapman attracted criticism earlier in the week for suggesting in an appearance at the cross-party international development committee that the UK had for too long been viewed as a “global charity”.But speaking after her grilling by the committee, she insisted that even without the necessity of making cuts, the way the government works with developing countries needed significant reform.“African governments are saying they want partnership, not paternalism.

They would agree with that,” she said.Asked where the cuts will fall, Chapman refused to make any specific budget commitments, but said the UK would prioritise humanitarian aid. She also hinted at other areas the government might focus on, including the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) arm, which gives grants and loans to low-income countries, and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).“Money that’s spent by the World Bank, you get £10 invested for every £1 that we put in. That’s a good use of money. The IDA fund performs very well, it’s got proven evidence based of having an impact,” she said.“We are one of the biggest, if not the biggest donors to Gavi; it works, it’s saved hundreds of thousands, millions of lives.”Cuts to welfare.

We’re working through those numbers, but what I would say is that the World Service do tremendous work that nobody else can do,” she said, calling it “an absolute gold standard resource”.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsAidLabourTax and spendingForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

If convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.The trial, which opened Monday in Lower Manhattan, has drawn enormous media attention, with TV vans crowding the block, and hundreds of spectators each day lining up outside the courthouse – all hoping to witness the non-televised proceedings first-hand.Access to the main courtroom, where Combs is present, is extremely limited. Only 21 members of the press and about 14 members of the public are allowed in daily on a first-come, first-served basis.Many outlets (including the Guardian) and eager spectators have hired professional line-sitters who camp overnight to secure spots at the front of the line.View image in fullscreenPeople wait in line to enter federal court for Combs’s trial in New York on Friday.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/ReutersThe dailycrowdhas included journalists, fans of Combs, content creators, livestreamers, true crime podcasters, a TikTok body-language analyst, a ventriloquist and some curious New York locals who said they were using some of their vacation days from work just to witness some of the proceedings.To accommodate demand, the court has opened three overflow rooms featuring live feeds from the courtroom. These rooms have become their own scene, with journalists scrawling notes by hand (as electronics are banned in federal court) and spectators often reacting audibly to dramatic or emotional testimony.Opening statements began on Monday morning, after a jury of 12 – eight men and four women – was seated.Prosecutors accused Combs of operating a criminal enterprise that facilitated his drug-fueled sex sessions, referred to as “freak-offs”, involving paid sex workers. They allege that Combs used threats, violence and drugs to coerce women into participating in the freak offs, including his former girlfriend, the singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura.Combs’s legal team pushed back, arguing that the encounters were consensual and part of a “swingers lifestyle”. In opening statements, his lawyers acknowledged Combs’s history of domestic violence and drug use, but said that this does not mean he is guilty of sex trafficking or racketeering, and denied any criminal enterprise.Janice Combs, Combs’s mother, and his children have been present in court, with Combs occasionally turning to them, forming a heart with his hands. Several of his friends have also been in attendance.View image in fullscreenJustin Dior Combs, Quincy Brown and Christian Combs depart for a lunch break on Thursday.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/ReutersMost of the focus this week has been on the testimony from Ventura, the prosecution’s star witness, who dated Combs from around 2007 to 2018.Ventura, who is eight and a half months pregnant, was on the stand for four days this week,detailing alleged physical and emotional abuse during their relationship. She also alleged that he raped her in 2018 after their breakup.Ventura testified that she was coerced into participating in the drug-fueled sex sessions she said were orchestrated and directed by Combs, known as freak-offs. She said she would participate in sex acts with male escorts in front of Combs, which could sometimes last for days, take place in various states, and were often filmed by Combs.It would often take her days to recover from the events, she said, and she felt “trapped” as Combs would sometimes threaten to release the videos he took and use them as blackmail.“Whatever was going to not make him angry or threaten me I was going to do,” she told the court, adding that during every freak-off she would use drugs, provided by Combs, to help “dissociate” and numb herself.Prosecutors painted Combs as controlling and abusive, and as someone who exerted power over nearly every aspect of Ventura’s life – including her appearance, career, where she lived, and which escorts would participate in the freak-offs, as well as what occurred during the freak-offs themselves.View image in fullscreenJanice Combs, Sean Combs’s mother, departs for a lunch break on Thursday.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/ReutersVentura repeatedly said she felt a “responsibility” to make Combs happy, even though the freak-offs left her feeling “horrible”, “humiliated” and “worthless”. She said she feared refusing would “make him upset” and lead to violence.“Make the wrong face and the next thing I knew I would get hit in the face,” she said.The jury were shown the infamoussecurity footage from 2016in which Combs is seen assaulting Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway.She added that Combs’s staff would sometimes take her belongings when he was angry at her. During some of these encounters, Combs or an escort would urinate on her at his request.Throughout her testimony, Ventura periodically teared up and dabbed her eyes with a tissue. She also often placed her hand on her pregnant midriff, sometimes rubbing it gently.She broke down in tears while talking about going to rehab and trauma therapy several years after their relationship ended. She also revealed she had thoughts of suicide.On Thursday cross-examination on Ventura began, during which defense attorneys for Combs tried to undermine her credibility and depict her as a willing – and at times enthusiastic – participant in the freak-offs that she said Combs coerced her into.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s sketch of Cassie Ventura in court on Thursday.Photograph: Jane Rosenberg/ReutersThe defense presented dozens of texts and emails between the couple during their relationship, some of them explicit.In one, Ventura was seen telling Combs “I’m always ready to freak off” and in another, “I love our [freak-offs] when we both want it.”Ventura told the court they were “just words at that point”.The defense also discussed their drug use. Ventura said that they both had struggled with opiate addiction at various points and frequently used drugs such as ecstasy and ketamine.Combs often stared at Ventura as she testified, whispering to his lawyers and passing them notes. Ventura didn’t look at him.At one point during cross-examination, defense lawyers seemed to be trying to establish that about the time of the 2016 video of Combs attacking Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway, Combs had been experiencing withdrawals from opiates.Venturareturned to the witness stand on Friday morningfor another day of cross-examination, and defense lawyers continued to try to portray Ventura as a loving partner and willing participant in the freak-offs rather than someone who was coerced.After her testimony concluded late on Friday afternoon, her lawyer Douglas Wigdor issued a statement on behalf of Ventura noting how the week had been “extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me. …“I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear. For me, the more I heal, the more I can remember. And the more I can remember, the more I will never forget,” Wigdor said on behalf of Ventura.Earlier in the week, two other witnesses testified. One was Israel Florez, a Los Angeles police officer and former security guard at the InterContinental hotel in LA, who testified about the 2016 assault, which occurred when Florez was working.He said that Combs tried to silence him by offering him cash and that Ventura had a “purple eye” and repeatedly asked to leave. Combs’s lawyers challenged his account, noting those details were not in his original incident report.The other witness was Daniel Phillip, who said he was paid thousands of dollars multiple times between 2012 and 2014 to participate in the so-called freak-offs, testified that Combs would direct the encounters, and that he witnessed Combs assaulting Ventura on two occasions, including once dragging her by the hair into a room, where Phillip heard screams, her saying sorry, and what sounded like slapping.The trial is expected to last around seven more weeks.Prosecutors said that among the next witnesses they are planning to call are singer Dawn Richard. Another accuser, known as “Jane” is also set to testify, as well as a former employee of Combs, known as “Mia”.In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

At least nine of those were reported after a tornado sparked what authorities called a mass casualty event in south-eastern Kentucky.The storms were part of a weather system on Friday that killed seven people inMissouriand spawned more than two dozen tornadoes in Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana, left several hundred thousand customers without power in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heatwave to Texas.Authorities inKentuckysaid there were also severe injuries when a twister tore across Laurel county late on Friday.“The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,” the office of sheriff John Root said in a statement posted on social media.April storms that killed 24 in US made more severe by burning fossil fuels – studyRead moreGilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, said rescuers had “been on the ground all night looking for possible survivors. That’s what we’re continuing to do.”Beshear said his office would release more information as soon as it became available.“We know this is a tragic event,” he said in a statement.In Laurel county, the tornado hit shortly before midnight.“Lives have been changed forever here tonight. This is a time we come together, and we pray for this community,” Randall Weddle, the mayor of London, told WKYT-TV. “I have never personally witnessed what I’ve witnessed here tonight. There’s a lot of devastation.”The mayor of St Louis, Missouri, Cara Spencer,confirmedfive deaths in her city and said more than 5,000 homes had been affected.The mayor of St Louis described the toll of storm damage in her city on Saturday.“This is truly, truly devastating,” she said, adding that the city was in the process of declaring an emergency and an overnight curfew on Friday had been put into place in the neighborhoods with the most damage.The number of people injured was not immediately known. The Barnes-Jewish hospital received 20 to 30 patients from the storm with some in serious condition and most expected to be discharged by Friday night, according to hospital spokesperson Laura High.The St Louis children’s hospital received 15 patients with two of them expected to remain in the hospital into the weekend, she said.National Weather Service (NWS) radar indicated a tornado touched down between 2.30pm and 2.50pm in Clayton,Missouri, in the St Louis area. The apparent tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, home to the St Louis zoo and the site of the 1904 World’s Fair and Olympic Games the same year.At the Centennial Christian church, St Louis fire department battalion chief William Pollihan told the Associated Press that three people had had to be rescued after part of the church crumbled. One of those people died.Stacy Clark said his mother-in-law, Patricia Penelton, had died in the church. He described her as a very active church volunteer who had many roles, including being part of the choir.Jeffrey Simmons Sr, who lives across from the church, heard an alert on his phone before the lights went out.“And next thing you know, a lot of noise, heavy wind,” he said. He and his brother sheltered in the basement. Later, he realized it had been worse than he’d thought, saying: “Everything was tore up.”Downed trees and stoplights also caused traffic gridlock during the Friday afternoon commute, and officials urged people to stay home.John Randle, a 19-year-old University of Missouri-St Louis student, said he and his girlfriend had been at the St Louis art museum during the storm and were hustled into the basement with about 150 other people.“You could see the doors flying open, tree branches flying by and people running,” he said. “A lot of people were caught outside.”Christy Childs, a St Louis zoo spokesperson, said in a text that the zoo would remain closed on Saturday due to downed trees and other damage. Childs said all animals were safe and that there were no reports of significant injuries to staff, guests or animals.A tornado struck in Scott county, about 130 miles (209km) south of St Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying multiple homes, sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media.Explore more on these topicsKentuckyMissouriTornadoesWisconsinTexasExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone before him just … lied. Look around – we can’t continue like this. I can’t afford food, or clothes for the children. I’m voting for George Simion. He will be different.”Twenty minutes’ drive away, chatting with a gaggle of colleagues outside the gleaming glass-and-concrete offices of his employer, Cosmin Ispas, a 31-year-old corporate lawyer, was equally clear.View image in fullscreenGeorgeta Petre with her children in Ferentari. She is planning on voting for Simion.Photograph: The Guardian“I get that people are pissed off,” he said. “I get that they want change. But they don’t see that the change Simion is proposing is an illusion. It’s just words: sovereignty, tradition … Nicuşor Dan may not be perfect, but he’s serious, responsible. The choice between him and fascism isn’t hard.”Days before a pivotal presidential election rerun that could set the face of their country for a generation, Romania’s voters are profoundly, hopelessly polarised. “For the first time in recent history,” said Cristian Pîrvulescu, a political scientist, “Romania is in real danger.”Simion, an impetuous, hard-talking, Maga-style ultranationalist who many observers fear could drag Romania from its hitherto steadfastly pro-European trajectory, won almost twice as many first-round votes as Dan, the independent mayor of Bucharest.In recent days the gap between the two has closed, with the more low-key Dan, an articulate, socially conservative mathematician known for his battles against corrupt property developers in the capital, performing strongly in a head-to-head TV debate.But the contest is Simion’s to lose, and – withRomania under caretaker governmentand experts predicting a Simion win could lead to a far-right administration in the near future – the country seems headed for at best damaging instability, and at worst a sharp anti-system turn.The far-right candidate stepped into the shoes of another ultranationalist firebrand, Călin Georgescu, after the original first round last November wascancelledamid allegations of Russian meddling and campaign finance violations – something fiercely criticised by the global right, not least the US’s vice-president, JD Vance.Georgescu, whosurged from nowhere to win that ballot, was barred from competing in the rerun.On the capital’s south-western fringe, Ferentari is often described as the city’s poorest and most marginalised district. Home to an estimated 80,000 people, many of them Roma, its Communist-era housing blocks are decaying and disintegrating.Poverty and unemployment are chronic; healthcare and sanitation perfunctory; crime – drugs, prostitution, mob activity – rife. More than 80% of residents connect illegally to the electricity grid; more than 60% have no sewage, because they are squatting.Petre survives on a disability allowance of 500 lei (about £83) a month, plus 250 lei for each of her three young children. Like many in Ferentari, she is placing her faith in Simion, a one-time football ultra and nationalist agitator turned brash populist.View image in fullscreenFerentari is often described as Bucharest’s poorest and most marginalised district.Photograph: Andrei Popoviciu/The GuardianȘtefan Șerban, 69, sitting on a bench with his friend Nicolae Carja, 74, said life had been better under the former Communist dictator, Nicolae Ceauşescu. “We were a rich country then,” he said. “Industry, petrol, gas, goldmines. And no debt.”Now, said Carja: “We have a mountain of debt. And we’ve sold everything we had to foreigners. It won’t be easy for Simion; he will have to fight hard and it may take a few years. But I think he really wants to shake things up – make people’s lives easier.”Doina Radu said Simion meant “more jobs, better services, higher pensions”. He would do even better, she said, if, as he has promised, he makes Georgescu his prime minister. “That would really be a top team,” she said.Simion, whose AUR party stands “for Christian faith, for family and for the love of our nation”, has moderated his rhetoric sincesweeping the first round, arguing that he is an “EU-realist” rather than a sceptic, supports Nato membership and is not pro-Russia.But he is an outspoken Trump fan, has compared the EU to the USSR, admires Viktor Orbàn – whom he has described as “a model” – and, like Hungary’s illiberal prime minister, he opposes aid to Ukraine. He says foreign companies are robbing Romania.Simion has been banned from neighbouring Moldova for calling for its reintegration into Romania, and from Ukraine – part of which was, before 1940, also Romanian – for “systematic anti-Ukrainian activities … violating state sovereignty and territorial integrity”.A Covid anti-vaxxer, Simion thinks “globalist elites” run the country. His rhetoric can be violent: he has called for rivals to be “skinned alive”, wondered of his critics “what will I do with you after 19 May?” and threatened to sexually assault a far-right MP.In an already heavily indebted country with a near-junk credit rating and the highest budget deficit in the EU, his economic policies – nationalising utilities, slashing public-sector employment – and unpredictability have seriously spooked markets.Yet some of Romania’s most disadvantaged people, including the historically marginalised Roma community, Europe’s largest, see him as their saviour. “They’ve been pushed into his arms,” said Nicu Dumitru of the NGO Roma for Democracy.View image in fullscreenNicolae Carja and Ștefan Șerban believe that life was better under the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu.Photograph: Andrei Popoviciu/The Guardian“They distrust the system and he’s not part of it. They’ve been denied the education to see through him,” he said of his community. “They are disappointed and disillusioned, they want a revolution and he is the only option.” Almost 50% of Roma cast their first-round vote for Simion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a copy-paste of the 1930s and 40s” – when many Roma supported Romania’s powerful interwarfascist Legionary movement and brutal Iron Guard, led by Corneliu Codreanu.Public anger at corrupt and ineffective mainstream politicians, high inequality and poor services plays a clear part in the present-day rise of Simion and Georgescu: household incomes are a third of the EU average; nearly 40% of Romania’s 19 million people are at risk of deprivation.But, noted Pîrvulescu, the dean of the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration, Romania’s long history of far-right and fascist movements is also a factor. “This is not a rich country, but it’s not poor either,” he said.EU membership had brought significant economic benefits since 2007, Pîrvulescu said; GDP per capita was greater than Hungary, Greece and Portugal. The minimum wage had risen by 80%. But the appeal of the nationalist authoritarianism runs deep.After the war, Ceauşescu pioneered “national communism” around a profoundly nationalist glorification of Romanian history. As recently as 2000, a foul-mouthed, Holocaust-denying ultranationalist made it to the presidential runoff.View image in fullscreenIonut Baban, an IT manager, says that Dan had served Bucharest well during his mayorship and that he will be voting for him in the presidential elections.Photograph: Andrei Popoviciu/The GuardianPolling by Grigore Pop-Eleches, a politics professor at Princeton, has found that voters expressing a “strong like” for Cordeanu and Ceauşescu are up to four times as likely to vote for Simion than those who strongly dislike the two authoritarian leaders.But the far right’s current resurgence, Pîrvulescu said, had also been fuelled by Covid, which Simion’s AUR weaponised as a culture war battle, and the spread of conspiracy theories on social networks, including Kremlin-sponsored hybrid warfare.Gelu Duminică, a sociologist and activist, pointed to straightforward democratic inexperience. “We had democracy for a decade in the 1930s, then barely three since the end of communism – for us, democracy still means ‘We can do what we want’,” he said.Dan’s voters insist they are all too aware of the importance of Sunday’s vote. Back at the business park, Raluca, a thirtysomething IT worker who asked not to be further identified, said it was “simple. It could define our future for the next 20 years.”Dan was a good candidate, she said: “He’s pro-European. Not corrupt. Respects the rule of law. He did a lot for Bucharest: fixed the water pipes, the buses.” Her colleague Richard said Dan was the first mayor to “actually tackle stuff, not just patch it up”.Ionut Baban, 33, an IT manager, agreed. “Dan may not be a crowd-pleaser, but he will take logical, evidence-based decisions,” he said. “Simion’s a mouthy provocateur. Between a mathematician and a Trump-loving hooligan, I know my preference.”Few doubt the consequences of a Simion victory. Elena Calistru, a civil society activist and cofounder of the Funky Citizens NGO, which Simion has warned will be “held accountable … for stirring up things that don’t exist”, said the fallout would not be confined to Romania.View image in fullscreenElena Calistru, a co-founder of the NGO Funky Citizens, said Simion winning the election would effect the EU.Photograph: Andrei Popoviciu/The Guardian“The president runs foreign policy and attends EU leaders’ summits,” she said. “That means decisions on the next seven-year budget, defence, enlargement – including Ukraine. The scope for disruption is enormous.” Domestically, she fears the worst.“The president is not particularly powerful, but he has a very visible pulpit he can use to become a real player,” she said. “He can send bills back to parliament. He makes the big judicial and intelligence appointments. He appoints the prime minister.”Crucially, he can also dissolve parliament if MPs twice reject his proposals for prime minister – and the centre-left Social Democrats (PSD) and centre-right Liberals (PNL), whose rulingcoalition collapsed this month, are desperate to avoid fresh elections.That, Calistru and others believe, could well lead to a minority far-right government led by Simion’s AUR – parliament’s second-biggest party – and backed by an “opportunistic” PSD, or even, if enough MPs switch parties, to a far-right majority.“And that would be a recipe,” she said, “for disaster.”Explore more on these topicsRomaniaEuropeEuropean UnionThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

It was 1995, we were both 20 years old, and we were drinking at our university bar in Leicester. We had formed a friendship over the previous three years, but I had never considered Gordon in a romantic light. He was a goth at the time, which I thought was very cool, and he had this fruity, posh voice – whereas I was a timid girl from south London with a terrible perm. I remember Gordon leaning in to give me this very innocent, tentative kiss, but it caught me off guard. I felt excited but also confused. For one thing, I’d only ever known Gordon to kiss his fellow goths.I avoided Gordon for weeks after that, which was difficult, considering we were on the same course. We bumped into each other almost every day in lectures but I made things awkward. Conversations between us didn’t flow in the same way. I’m an overthinker, whereas Gordon is much more relaxed. I think he would have been happy to keep kissing me in a casual sort of way and see where things led, but I was frightened of ruining our friendship. I was so shy at that time, and didn’t connect with people as easily as Gordon did. I had very deep feelings for him, but I wasn’t able to acknowledge them. Gordon was the closest person to me and I was terrified of losing him by having a fling.I really felt like Jarvis was mapping out my destiny. It was the push I neededOne morning about two months after the kiss I was lying in bed listening to the radio and Chris Evans’s show came on. I’ve always found him quite annoying, so I was about to switch channels, but then he said: “We’ve got a new song fromPulp.” Gordon was a huge Pulp fan so I lay back and listened. I remember it was Jarvis’s voice that really got me. He sings in such a beautiful way and it lets you hear the lyrics. The song was Something Changed, and it tells the story of a kind of sliding doors moment in the singer’s life. Jarvis sets the song hours before he meets the love of his life, and he imagines what life would have been like if he’d never bothered to go out that night. If he’d just gone home and stayed in bed instead. Listening to him sing about that, I had this moment of clarity. All my awkwardness and fear of rejection evaporated. I had this sudden, overwhelming certainty that Gordon was the one for me. I felt like this was the pivotal moment of my life, and that I didn’t want to stay in bed and miss it.There’s this line in the song where Jarvis asks: “Do you believe that there’s someone up above? / And does he have a timetable directing acts of love?” This sounds a bit daft, but lying in my bed at uni, I really felt like Jarvis was mapping out my destiny. It was the push I needed. I got dressed immediately after the song ended, and ran to university. I cornered Gordon after our lecture, looked him dead in the eyes and told him that I’d heard Pulp’s song and it had made me rethink everything between us.I think he was a little taken aback at first that I’d had such an abrupt change of heart after dodging him for months – but he’s such an open, loving person, he rolled with it. He was just extremely relieved that the massive wall I’d built between us had finally come down. The strange thing was that he’d heard Something Changed on the radio that morning too, but he hadn’t liked it. He said something dismissive like: “It’s not quite the same as Pulp’s usual stuff.” He definitely didn’t see the song in the way that I did. He wasn’t exactly on board with my grand theory that Jarvis Cocker had cosmically altered the course of our whole lives.We’ve been together for 30 years now, and I’m pleased to say Something Changed has grown on Gordon. We play it on our anniversaries, and it’s become Our Song. One of the very last lyrics is: “Where would I be now, where would I be now if we’d never met? / Would I be singing this song to someone else instead?” I often think about that line. I was so shy as a young woman, I really don’t think I would ever have had the courage to let down my wall and admit my feelings for Gordon if I hadn’t heard that song at that precise moment in my university bedroom. So maybe I would have just gone on with my life without Gordon, and heard the song a decade later, in the car alone, or with some other boyfriend. Today, Gordon and I could both be singing it with someone else instead – and I’m so happy we’re not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This is snappy satirical TV that goes down easy – and it’s only five episodes long. Woohoo!Rhik SamadderSat 17 May 2025 02.00 EDTShareIhave a theory that TV shows nowadays are all tonal variations on eitherThe White Lotus,Boiling Pointor possiblyYellowstone, but honestly I haven’t seen the latter. You might wish I had supporting evidence, but isn’t that what a theory is?Anyway, this week’s pick is definitely in the White Lotus mould. Sirens (Netflix, from Thursday 22 May) unfolds over Labor Day weekend in the Lloyd Neck peninsula of upstate New York, where a wealthy group of guests descend on a beachside estate for a charity gala. The raptor conservation organisation (think falcons, not velociraptors) is run by socialite Michaela Kell, a wellness-y guru who expects obedience from everyone around her. But preparations are interrupted by Devon, a chaotic falafel waitress who has come to save her sister Simone, Michaela’s assistant. Devon comes to believe Simone has been brainwashed, and that they’re mixed up in a murder, or several. It’s a long weekend.They’re serving cult, obviously, in addition to shrimp. Michaela – “Kiki” to her inner circle – is an insidious emotional vampire. She’s feared more than revered by the locals, and has the police on a leash. She concludes ceremonies and conversations with the weird, pseudo-spiritual mantra “Hey hey”, as if attempting to summon the spirit of the chicken from Moana. When Devon asks the exploited employees why they don’t complain, they clam up harder than the quahogs in the Long Island Sound.View image in fullscreenHas there been a brainwashing? … Milly Alcock as Simone with Julianne Moore as Michaela in Sirens.Photograph: NetflixCome for the set-up, stay for the execution.Milly Alcockplays Simone as a smothered scream. Her Barbie-perfect factotum is across everything from beach seating for bird funerals to misting Kiki’s underwear with lavender – and composing her boss’s sexts to her husband. Meanwhile, Meghann Fahy, whomwe’ve seen in– huh, The White Lotus – has acres of fun as Devon. “A transient person carrying hot garbage” is how a member of staff describes her when she turns up at the manicured estate, having spent the night in jail, in the middle of a day that sees her sleeping with two separate men on different boats. She’s the finest hot mess to hit our screens in an age.Then there’sJulianne Mooreas the titular siren. In the last few years, Moore has enjoyed sinister turns. There’s the Todd Haynes filmMay December, in which she weaponised childlike, cutesy-pie manipulations to control others. As Michaela, she devours relatively spare screen time to portray an enigmatic, hostile cult leader who seethes aggression beneath wellness bromides and a too-wide smile. Devon is drawn in to her spell while fully conscious of the danger. Her monstrousness is alluring, which is the point. “What would I do without you?” Michaela purrs disingenuously in one scene. “You’d hire a new assistant,” replies Simone, in a Freudian slip of honesty.The pedigree shines throughout. Sirens is based on a play by Molly Smith Metzler, and has an initial block of episodes directed by Nicole Kassel, who won Emmys for HBO’sWatchmen. For Michaela’s weed-toking, elusive husband Peter, Kassel reunites with functionally immortal film starKevin Bacon. The pair last worked together on Kassel’s superb 2004 debut The Woodsman. It’s nice to associate Bacon with something other than EE adverts isn’t it? That was rough for a while.View image in fullscreen‘A transient person carrying hot garbage’ … is how a member of staff describes her … Meghann Fahy as Devon in Sirens.Photograph: Macall Polay/NetflixWhere The White Lotus uses its glossy veneer to satirise our zeitgeist, Sirens digs at something deeper. Troubled female relationships, to be specific. There is the brittle intimacy of the boss-assistant relationship: an indentured labour demanding total emotional disclosure, an arrangement unimaginable between men. There are the sisters, vastly different, constantly at odds yet fiercely protective. More obliquely, and most affecting, the show investigates relationships of mothering warped by trauma. It’s a rich watch, in every sense.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A chance conversation at a barbecue can feel like being handed between 20 and 160 hours of homework. But like Devon, this show goes down easy. Snappy comic writing, Hollywood pedigree and a corkscrewing mystery make it fantastically bingeable. And you know the best thing about it? It’s five episodes long.

That in turn provoked one of the most extreme reactions we have ever seen from the lead character.It was all quite an abrupt turn tonally, in an episode that felt fun but thin for the opening act. It had a larger ensemble cast to play with than some other stories this season, although it was fortunate that, separated, both the Doctor and Belinda (Varada Sethu) found themselves trapped with somebody who turned out to have technical expertise working bits of the space station.View image in fullscreenRylan Clark with Sabine (Julie Dray).Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonThe episode tackled several big themes at once – the rapacious capitalist exploitation of a planet to harvest a product, widely held dismissive and racist attitudes to an entire species, the pain of Miriam-Teak Lee’s character having to endure mutilation in order to fit in and participate in society, and the Doctor’s judgment that none of these things in turn could justify the actions of someone with a “cold filthy heart” that just likes to kill.Before all that was the colour rush of watching the contest unfold. Your mileage may have varied here depending on how big a fan ofEurovisionyou are. Who could have guessed that Rylan would have more than a brief cameo? His self-deprecating persona was perfect for the part Dawson wrote for him, allowing him to roll with the jokes about his teeth and his career.View image in fullscreenFreddie Fox as Kid.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonBut perhaps the hardest thing to make believable was that any of the alien interstellar contestants and their songs from the future were as outlandish as some of the creations we have seen over the years on Earth at the real event.Sum it up in one sentence?What if Doctor Who did Eurovision in space, but in the middle of a terrorist attack?Life aboard the TardisLast season’s interactions between Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) and the Doctor relied on the audience taking at face value that they had become best buddies off-screen. The relationship between Belinda and the Doctor has been much more convincing. She looked genuinely taken aback when she witnessed the Doctor going into rage mode for the first time, and he was only ultimately held back when he saw his actions reflected in her expression.And then there was Carole Ann Ford, who played William Hartnell’s first Doctor’s granddaughter in 1963 in the show’s very first episode, seemingly on board the 15th Doctor’s Tardis. Last season had teased a return for her, only to bait-and-switch the viewer that it wasSUtekh notSUsan all the clues had been pointing to. But there Susan was. What can it all mean?Fear factorView image in fullscreenNcuti Gatwa as the Doctor.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonThe faceless robot guards were a classic Doctor Who background trope, extras deployed to deliver a bit of firepower but no real thrill. It was the Doctor who was by far the most frightening thing here. Gatwa has clearly had swagger, style and charisma to carry off the lighter side of his character, but here for the first time he was really able to flex being the oncoming storm, the Time Lord Victorious, the one thing you never put in a trap. In both his conversation with Kid over the video link, and the subsequent extended torture scene, Gatwa passed this Doctorly character test with flying colours.Mysteries and questionsIs it reading too much into the fact that last week out of the blue we saw Poppy, the captain from Space Babies, and this week the product driving the narrative was Poppy Honey? Probably. And there was dear old Mrs Flood, actively surveilling our heroes and clearly readying to put her dastardly bigeneration plan into action.Deeper into the vortexFord’s appearance won’t have taken William Russell’s world record for longest gap between appearances as the same character in the same show. She reprised her role as Susan in 1983’s The Five Doctors. Russell set the record when he appeared inThe Power of the Doctorin 2022, 57 years after his character, Ian Chesterton’s initial departure.The Rani, originally played by Kate O’Mara, first appeared as a renegade Time Lord in 1985’sThe Mark of the Rani.When Archie Panjabi said she was the definite article, she was echoing Tom Baker’s words in his 1974 debut story, Robot, where, newly-regenerated, he told Harry Sullivan “You may be a doctor, but I’mtheDoctor. The definite article, you might say.”In 2002, Sylvester McCoy’s Doctor and Bonnie Langford’s Mel visited the Intergalactic Song Contest in an expanded media audio adventure calledBang-Bang-a-Boom!Graham Norton got to deliver the news of Earth’s destruction in hologram format. He has previously made not one but two unscheduled Doctor Who appearances. First, a BBC One sound erroradded a cheering crowd and his hot mic voiceto the tense opening ofRosein 2005.

For the past two years, the 28-year-old has also worked evening shifts most Saturdays and Sundays at a nearby wine bar, with one clear aim – to save up for her summers.Heath has been a hugemusic festivalfan since she first went to Leeds as a teenager and each year, including day events, she takes in at least seven, some as a volunteer. Without that and her second job, she’d never be able to afford it, she says.View image in fullscreenJessica HeathIt’s not just the cost of tickets, “it’s so many other things”, says Heath. “The coach, the food, the drink, all the other elements.” Her most recent trip to Glastonbury cost £900 in total – “an insane amount of money for less than a week”.“It sounds like I’m saying, ‘Woe is me.’ I mean, I had an amazing time. But for me and a lot of my friends, you either do that or you go on holiday – you don’t do both.”It has been a turbulent few years in Britain’s festival industry, with huge commercial giants and smaller indies buffeted by a post-pandemic, post-Brexit surge in costs that leda record 72 eventsto postpone, cancel, or fold in 2024. Event organisers, often despite their best efforts, have beenforced to raise ticket prices, and are having to innovate to sell them. While festivalgoers caught in an ongoing cost-of-living squeeze are, in many cases, having to innovate to afford to buy tickets.As a result,industry analysis shows, the way festival tickets are bought and sold is changing. Pre-pandemic, some opted to pay in instalments; since then, however, the numbers opting to buy this way has soared, with ticket service Skiddle reporting a 48% increase in 2023/24, a figure expected to rise further this year.“My view would be, if you don’t offer split payments, then you really shouldn’t be running a festival in 2025,” says John Rostron, the CEO of theAssociation of Independent Festivals. Almost all festivals – even day events – now offer them, he says, often spread over a full 12 months.Early bird tickets, too, have boomed – up five-fold in 2023/24 at Skiddle. In part, says Rostron, that’s driven by live events beingforced to lock in their actsever earlier, but it also means some festivals are selling out in record time – even in early autumn, almost a year before their event.Many Guardian readers have said festival financing was a year-long pursuit. Charlotte Westwell, 23, a coffee shop supervisor from Wigan, said she and her partner had got the bug at Download Pilot in 2021, and have gone to two or three a year since then.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we inevitably need to dip into savings for various reasons, wind up with very little by festival season, and whack it all on the credit card in an endless cycle of festival debt.”But it’s worth it, she says. “I mean, we’re massively, massively into live music.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte LovieMany readers said they were able to get tickets only by volunteering – “a wonderful community” in itself, according to Charlotte Lovie, 55, a college lecturer from Southsea in Hampshire, who has worked in exchange for a ticket at several festivals for each of the past four years.But even coming by a volunteer place can be tough, and some have concerns that rising costs could make festivals increasingly inaccessible to those on low incomes.It’s something event organisers are acutely aware of, with some, such as thealternative music and arts festival Supersonic, inviting better-off attenders tobuy “solidarity” ticketsto subsidise a free or cheaper one for those from marginal groups.“The ethos of the festival is about this sense of community and people coming together,” says the Supersonic artistic director, Lisa Meyer. “And if that becomes elitist because it’s so expensive, then it’s not really for everyone.”Stuart Walker, 52, from Nottingham, says he and his partner had initially decided they couldn’t afford their usual couple of festivals this year: “It feels like a much bigger luxury than it used to be, and I’d have to cut back on a lot more things.” In the end, though, they decided to dip into their savings, and will go to Beautiful Days and Latitude later in the summer.Why? “We just decided, what’s the point of life if you don’t experience joy? That’s why.”Explore more on these topicsMusic festivalsFestivalsUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

I was 25 years old and knew it was time to “do the work”, as they say. I knuckled down and spent a long, lonely winter sorting myself out as best I could. By the spring my mood was thawing, and on the dancefloor at a Chicago house night at the Melbourne town hall I clocked Olwen for the first time.When we ran into each other and introduced ourselves at an afterparty, a frisson ran through me. That brief interaction with her left me so discombobulated I had to leave the party early. I was on the mend, but I definitely wasn’t ready for whateverthatwas.The moment I knew: standing on her shoulders, I was impressed she could bear my weightRead moreMonths went by and one weekend I found myself at a big, trashy party in the city. I was saying hello to a friend when I realised Olwen was standing with her. She recognised me from our electric and slightly odd encounter and we locked on to each other for the rest of the night. From then on we were inseparable.As we got to know each other over the next few weeks, I found myself saying all sorts of out-of-character things. About how I felt this intense familiarity with her and thought perhaps we were somehow fated. These were not concepts I would have believed in, let alone openly discussed, before I met her. But there was something so safe and magical about Olwen; it seemed to bring this cosmic side out in me.I was obviously feeling some monumental feelings, but my logical brain kept fighting them. Olwen told me she loved me about a week into our romance, but I held back.Then one summer’s day we were in a park with a group of friends and decided to go for pizza. On the walk, Olwen got a severe migraine that affected her vision and mobility. I wouldn’t call myself a natural nurturer, at least at that time in my life, but in that instant my sole priority became getting her to my house nearby, where she could rest and I could look after her. I was really, really freaking out – I had never been around somebody who had a migraine – and didn’t know what to do at first. I nearly called an ambulance. Through some gentle yet intense communication I was able to understand what she needed from me. Passersby looked concerned as we stood on some random footpath in Fitzroy, me gently rubbing her temples; but everything was becoming clear to me.View image in fullscreenOlwen and Sam in Bali in 2024. ‘I know our biggest adventures are yet to come,’ says Sam.Once I finally got her home and she was safe, asleep in my bed, with the lights off and curtains drawn, I knew I had fallen in love with her.At that moment I realised how foolish it was to deny my feelings. I knew that whatever happened, this relationship was going to be a positive and hugely impactful journey. Once the migraine had subsided, I told her so.Before I connected with Olwen I’d held a very intellectual view of relationships. I looked at the world through a logical lens. But being with her felt so safe that I was able to tap right back into the much more expansive perspective I had as a kid. Not in a silly way, but in this open-hearted, open-minded way that allowed me to really see and feel the beauty in the everyday. Magic comes from connections we make with others – even if we don’t know at the time.The moment I knew: I heard her sing for the first time and awe ran through meRead moreNot too long after the migraine incident, I saw a pair of overalls in her wardrobe. They reminded me of a time, a couple of years earlier, when I’d seen a person at a gig who had the most magnetic energy. When I asked Olwen if it was her, she couldn’t remember. When I described the Converse chucks she was wearing and the long dark hair and sharp bangs she no longer had, it became clear our lives had been orbiting for longer than we’d realised.I had fallen in love with Olwen three times, it just took the third for me to realise. Nine years later we are still finding new ways to connect. In 2021 we moved from Melbourne to Sydney. We’ve travelled extensively and road-tripped the east coast at least half a dozen times. Our journey together is a constant evolution and I know our biggest adventures are yet to come.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ilike to think of myself as a bit of a connoisseur of tinned seafood, and of tinned sardines, in particular. Well, of course I do: I’m Spanish, after all, and I’ve been eating this stuff since I was two (which, let me tell you, is averylong time ago indeed!). So I jumped at the chance to do a blind tasting of British supermarket tinned sardines – although, with the odd exception, I now think I perhaps jumped just a little too soon.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For me, the first thing you notice when you open a tin of sardines is the look of the fish, and then its smell and texture. They should be headless but otherwise whole, not boned fillets or skinned, and the flesh should feel firm to the touch; the bones, likewise, should still have some structure and substance to them (if you can barely feel them, the fish is likely overcooked). What I found especially illuminating about this blind tasting, however, was that three of the 10 products were pretty much identical, in pretty much every way, from the texture and taste of the fish to the quality of the oil, which is why I found it more or less impossible to tell them apart, or to find any points of difference between them.As for the oil that’s used to preserve the sardines, I’m afraid it simplyhasto be olive oil – yes, I would say that (again, I am Spanish, after all), but sorry, that’s just a plain statement of fact and I will not be taking questions.The best tinned sardinesBestall-rounder/bargain:John West sardines in olive oilView image in fullscreen£1.10 for 120g at Asda (92p/100g)£1.10 for 120g at Morrisons (92p/100g)★★★★☆Pretty great, especially considering the price. The flavour is very good, as is the consistency and texture of the fish, while the quality of the oil is up there, too. After the blind tasting, when I found out where these were from, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t very surprised indeed.Best splurge:Ortiz sardines a la Antigua in olive oilView image in fullscreen£5.75 for 140g at Sous Chef (£4.11/100g)£6.75 for 140g at Waitrose (£4.82/100g)★★★★★Simply the best: the flavour, the texture,everythingis perfect; it’s the reason why these cost top dollar, as they well should.And the rest …Sea Castle sardines in pure olive oilView image in fullscreen£2.70 for 125g at Sainsbury’s (£2.16/100g)£2.70 for 125g at Ocado (£2.16/100g)★★★☆☆These have been skinned, and are consequently dry. The flavour isn’t all that nice, either. In fact, it turns out they’re similar to theFish4 Ever offering below, with a pretty much identical taste and texture. I just didn’t get a sense that these fish had been treated with love or care, and they’re bloody expensive, too, considering.Fish 4 Ever filleted sardines in organic sunflower oilView image in fullscreen£2.95 for 90g at Ethical Superstore (£3.28/100g)£29.50 for 10 x 90g at Amazon (£3.27/100g)★★★☆☆As mentioned above, these are similar to the Sea Castle sardines, so pretty much the same comments apply here as well. Other than maybe to add that these are evenmoreexpensive.Brunswick sardines in soya oilView image in fullscreen£1.20 for 106g at Ocado (£1.13/100g)£17.59 for 12 x 106g at Amazon (£1.38/100g)★★☆☆☆A little spicy, which is something I’d normally be happy about, but there is no real balance going on in this tin, with the fish, the oil and everything all fighting against each other. The flesh is on the soft side, too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

When I first moved to London from Bahrain I was so homesick, but this place is like a home away from home. It has everything I need.I always buyDina Lebanese pitta bread, which is called khobez lebnani. They’re the thin, wide ones that are perfect for frying for fattoush salad. It’s also the bread you want for shawarma or tahdig (a Persian rice dish). I always keep some in my freezer.They have really goodza’atar; it’s a beautiful vibrant green, and I keep it in the freezer so it stays that way. It’s powdered, so you don’t have to defrost it. I use it to make za’atar pitta chips: spread the Lebanese pitta bread with olive oil and za’atar, and bake it. Break it up into shards to eat with dips or sprinkle it on salads, on fish, on eggs …TheBasra datesyrup, which is Iraqi, is justsogood. I use it the way people use honey or maple syrup: on porridge or on toast with tahini. Last Christmas, I used it in a sticky toffee pudding instead of treacle and it worked really well – it was less sickly.I also getwheat vermicelli noodleshere, which sometimes come broken, but often come in bundles that you break up yourself. I use them in soups and in a traditional Bahraini breakfast dish called balaleet, which is sweet noodles with salty eggs, scrambled or as an omelette. People have a ridiculously sweet tooth back home, so I do reduce the sugar.They have a wholemarinated olivebuffet, and I love it so much. Scoop them up and take them home to have in the fridge for a snack.There are loads of delicious hot sauces here, but there’s a brand calledCrystal, which I like. It’s not spicy, it’s really vinegary. It’s the hot sauce we have back home, and you put it in a wrap with cheese spread, spring onions, sometimes crisps, and just roll it up.I love anything with acidity, so I always havesumacto sprinkle on labneh (strained yoghurt), chicken or salads. It’s almost like salt and pepper. If you’re shopping in a supermarket, I quite likeRajahandEast Endspices, because you get more bang for your buck. I toast and grind the spices myself, so I buy them whole.I really like the frozen veggies: frozen broad beans, which are sometimes hard to get;molokhia, a green that has an okra-y consistency; and they sellokra(the short, chubby ones you use in stew). What’s also good is that they have already been trimmed.View image in fullscreenJulie Lin’s picks from Isan Thai, Glasgow‘The smell of fermenting food and burning incense is quite spiritual’Julie Lin, author ofSama Samaand co-founder of GaGa, Glasgow, onIsan Thai, GlasgowI didn’t realise how essential SeeWoo in Springburn, Glasgow, was to me, and for bringing the Asian community together, until it closed. Then this lovely little shop Isan Thai opened in the West End – they have amazing ingredients I haven’t seen in Glasgow in my 10 to 15 years of cooking. I love it so much, and they have incense sticks burning, which reminds me of walking into shops in Malaysia. That smell of fermented foods amid the smoke of burning incense – it’s quite a spiritual experience.I always getfresh ho fun noodles, which are the thick rice ones perfect for char kway teow (stir-fried prawns with noodles). Having fresh noodles makes a big difference, but they’re normally quite difficult to find. Here, they mix up the brands quite a lot.I’m always delighted that I can getkangkong, AKA Chinese morning glory, here. It’s amazing water spinach that absorbs fermented chilli and shrimp so well.They have a good stock offresh pandan leaves, so I always pick some up. I’ll also buy a bottle of pandan essence for making chiffon cake, because, as much as I use the natural colour from the fresh leaves, sometimes it needs a helping hand. I’ll use it for making kaya (coconut) jam from scratch, which is beautiful. You can also get frozen pandan leaves, as well as frozen lime leaves.I lovesalted plums, and I use them to make asam boi, an amazing sour drink that’s also a little bit salty.They make their own salad dressings with red bird’s-eye chillies and that balance of palm sugar, fish sauce and lime juice. Another thing I keep up my sleeve is their curry paste; people don’t always have time to make it from scratch, and they have some good own-brand ones. Tean’s Gourmet do a goodchicken curry pasteandlaksa paste; they’re super oily.There’s a fun range of Asian crackersandcrisps, such as shrimp, which I love. But for a snack I might get their papaya salad, or occasionally they have a gorgeouspandan chiffon cake.There’s a good range of shell-on and shell-off prawns. I getshell-onones to make a take on Singapore butter prawns, which uses a cereal you can’t get here but Quaker golden syrup oats are a good substitute.Supermarket own-brand rice is not great, instead, go to the world food section and pick up a 2kg bag, which ends up cheaper. UsingThai rice, such asGreen DragonorRoyal Umbrella, makes a real difference.View image in fullscreenZuza Zak’s picks from Klos Deli in London‘I buy sauerkraut from the big box fermenting on the floor rather than jars’Zuza Zak, author ofPierogi: Over 50 Recipes to Create Perfect Polish Dumplings, onMy Daily Bread, Eastbourne, East Sussex,andKlos Deli, Lewisham, LondonWhen I lived in London, my favourite Polish shop was Klos, which means a sheaf of wheat. It’s fantastic and I miss it; it’s very well stocked with beautifully sourced products – anything you pick up there will be good quality. Now, in Eastbourne, I go to My Daily Bread, which is a bakery with sporadic opening times. They have a refrigerator section where they sell nice cold cuts, but they also have grains.You’ll find all kinds of bread includingchalka, a traditional plaited loaf, and at Easter you can order a traditional bread bowl. They also make nicepaczki, which are Polish doughnuts, and buns.I buy my cold cuts here. I get a big pack ofsmoked country sausagesto put on sticks and cook over the fire. My favourite brand is Bacowka.Twaróg, which is a fresh curd cheese, is great for a pierogi filling, or as part of a dumpling mix. It’s a necessity.Smoked cheesesare a nice snack. My girls love them, too, and you can even get smoked cheese strings. We eat the cheese on the way back from the shops.Klos sometimes hashomemadepierogibehind the counter. They sell out very quickly, but you can call on the day to find out if they have any. I make my own – I enjoy the process – but I sometimes buy them if they’re on offer, just to see what they’re like. Everyone has their own way of making pierogi.We eat ogórki kiszone, which aregherkins in brine(as opposed to vinegar) with cold cuts – and if you’re buying meat from Klos, where there’s an entire counter, ask what they recommend, because they all have their favourites. For a traditional Polish snack, get good-quality lard and spread it on dark bread with a little salt on top and the gherkin on the side. If you go to a traditional Polish restaurant, you’ll often be given that before your meal.I always buysauerkraut, but from the big box fermenting on the floor rather than in jars. They do have some lovely jars there, but the important thing is to make sure there are no preservatives. Klos and Bacowka make a lot ofcondiments, such as beetroot and horseradish, as well as mushrooms in vinegar, to have with cold cuts. There’s alsosarepska mustard, which is a very mild mustard flavoured with tarragon – it tastes of Poland.Then there are grains, such askasha, toasted or roasted buckwheat groats, which has a specific flavour. We often have this as part of our Sunday meal – if you’re having meat with some kind of sauce, or mushrooms, it gives it a very eastern European flavour. I’ll also getsemolinato make porridge.Kefiris another essential. I’ll either drink it on its own or have it as an accompaniment to crispy fried potatoes and onions with a bit of dill. That’s a typical lunch for me.View image in fullscreenKwoklyn Wan’s picks from Tai Fat in Leicester‘My mum and dad used it for their restaurant … there is everything’Kwoklyn Wan, author ofChinese Made Easy,onTai Fat, LeicesterI’ve been going to this supermarket for years, and my mum and dad used it for their restaurant. It used to be called PKM – named after the founders, Peter, Kitty and Maureen – but now it’s called Tai Fat. They have everything I need on a day-to-day basis, as well as nice bits for a treat. If I’m doing a big shop and want to stock up on egg noodles or wontons, then I’ll go toWing Yipin Birmingham.I always getPearl River’s light soy sauce– it’s a Chinese brand and my dad has always used it – I think we tend to follow what our parents use. It’s the salty one, which is used for seasoning.Oyster sauce is a magic ingredient, because you can put it into soups, add it to stir-fries or vegetables, or use it to marinate meat, and it makes everything taste great. It’s packed with umami and it’s quite salty – like MSG without it being MSG. I useLee Kum Kee oyster sauce. They are the inventors of it, although completely by accident: they were boiling up oysters and let them stew for too long and came up with oyster sauce.Then, white rice vinegar for tenderising meat, for soups, for adding acidity to dishes to balance those salty, sweet and chilli notes. I getAmoy white rice vinegar, but it’s quite forgiving, so pick up any brand. I useShaoxing rice winein a lot of dishes, near the end of cooking, to add that funky, pungent, alcohol-y flavour. Because it’s fermented, it has quite a distinctive oriental flavour.I must have sesame oil in, and we always usepure sesame oil, never blended, because it is inferior. Sesame oil is just to finish a dish off; to season it and give it that nice nutty flavour.Then, for a snack, it’sdried cuttlefish, which we call Chinese chewing gum. It’s ready to eat and shredded, but takes for ever to chew. Also,Chinese peanut brittle, which has more peanuts than toffee, the reverse of the British stuff. It’s one of my treats. We also always pick up a packet offresh mochi(rice cakes)filled with peanut sugar. Great for your belly, not so good for your waistline.And I getfrozen lotus bunsfor my daughter: just pop them in a steamer, they’ll puff up, and you’ve got lovely, white, soft, steamed buns with lotus paste in the middle. I’m quite lazy when I’m cooking for myself, so I tend to pick uppre-made king prawn wontonsfrom the freezer section, too.View image in fullscreenAsma Khan’s picks from Fruity Fresh in LondonPhotograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian‘It stocksunfamiliar fruit and vegetables just waiting to be discovered’Asma Khan, author ofMonsoonand founder of Darjeeling Express, London, onFruity Fresh, WembleyThis has been a cornerstone of the vibrant south Asian community since the 1970s. It offers an extensive selection of Indian groceries, along with an impressive variety of fresh fruit and vegetables. What makes it truly special, though, is that it stocks everything you could possibly need, including unique fruit and vegetables that may be unfamiliar but are waiting to be discovered.From mildKashmiri chilliesto intensely fierynagachillies (ghost pepper), dried chillies add layers of heat and depth to dishes. They are essential for tempering dals and infusing meat and vegetable dishes with a complex chilli flavour. They can even be used in sweet dishes, like achilli and chocolate barfi.Jaggeryis an unrefined sugar with a deep, malty flavour and rich molasses notes; it’s perfect for balancing chutneys and makes a wonderful natural sweetener for chai.I try to resist the temptation of calculating the exchange rate and comparing prices with India, becauseParle-G biscuitsdipped in chai is more than a snack – it’s a taste of home, a moment of nostalgia.Confusingly, many recipes use cinnamon and cassia bark interchangeably. But the heavier and woodiercassia barkadds a deeply aromatic flavour to savoury dishes and can easily be fished out after cooking.Used more like a spice than a herb,dried fenugreek leaves(kasoori methi) impart a warm and slightly bitter smokiness to dishes. At my restaurant, it’s an essential ingredient in the base of the gravy in our methi chicken.In Bengal, almost everything deep‑fried, breaded or battered is served with ketchup. It’s often spiced up with chillies or other seasonings for an extra kick, and I always getKissan’s fresh tomato ketchup.Dal puriare flavour-packed, stuffed flatbreads, and a beloved, comforting street food classic. Having them in the freezer means I can enjoy them when I need them, paired with chutneys or a cup of chai.Most international food aisles in large supermarkets now carry a good selection of south Asian ingredients. One essential islentils– they’re affordable and open the door to making nourishing dals from scratch.View image in fullscreenAji Akokomi’s picks from Ades in London‘If they don’t have something, they’ll help you source it’Aji Akokomi, founder of Akoko and Akara, both in London, onAdes, Charlton and PlumsteadPretty much everything we use at Akoko – the spices, the rice and, most importantly, the black-eyed beans – come from Ades. They have all the produce and ingredients you could want, sourced from Nigeria. We use African produce that can travel well. Also, if they don’t have something, they’ll help you source it.Among the African community, we want our rice to be the best when it comes to cooking jollof. I usegoldensella basmati rice–I get bags of it every week for the restaurant. For the best jollof, always thoroughly wash the rice a couple of times before cooking, and don’t parboil it – that can lead to the grains becoming mushy and overcooked. To reduce the risk of burning, cook it in the oven to prevent it catching on the bottom. And keep the spices traditional: back home we use scotch bonnet, ginger, garlic, white peppercorns, curry powder and dried thyme.Black-eyed beans are very important, and Ades get thepeeled onesin for me, which we use to make moin moin, a traditional Nigerian steamed bean pudding wrapped in banana leaf.For home, I’ll getsuya spice. I’ll then get some chicken from my local butcher and rub a mix of butter and the spice all over the meat. Add a little bit of salt and roast it – it’s so good.Other spices I always get arepenja pepper;ehuru, which is African nutmeg and our most used spice, particularly in desserts; and theirpepper soup seasoningwhich is a mix of ehuru, uda (selim pepper), grains of paradise (a species of the ginger family), cloves, dried lime leaf and bay all pounded together.I always pick upchinchin(a fried Nigerian snack) andcrispy plantain chipsto snack on, as well as a bottle ofNigerianChapmans,FantaorMaltinafrom the fridge, to remember home. I’ll also buyNigerian (agege) bread, which I’ll eat in the car on the way home or to the restaurant.I buysmoked prawnsfrom here, which we use to make our own prawn powder, and also crayfish, which we then blitz with salt to give dishes that strong crayfish flavour.Explore more on these topicsFoodRestaurantsIndian food and drinkChinese food and drinkMalaysian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Traders are no longer wrapped up tightly to withstand the cold, and there is a spring in everyone’s step. At the fish stall, some dressed crab caught my eye, and while I love nothing more than crab on toast with thick aïoli or a nuttysalsa macha, there was a nip in the air on the night in question, so I was drawn to this rich, warming dish instead. The onions are a vehicle for the spices, adding sweetness and depth to both potato cake and crab. On the side, a gloriously refreshing, spicy salad makes the most of mango season.Warm potato cake with crab, onions and curry leavesA rich, beautifully spiced potato cake studded with peas and silky-sweet onions.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes44 tbsp vegetable oil40g butter700g white onions, peeled and finely slicedSea salt and black pepper1kg floury potatoes, peeled and quartered150g podded peas(fresh or frozen)2 large garlic cloves,peeled and minced30g thumb of ginger, peeled and minced2 tsp coriander seeds2 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp fenugreek2 tsp turmeric1 egg, beaten100g dressed crab– I like a mix of white and brown meat2 tsp black mustard seeds1 big handfulfresh curry leavesTo serveGreekyoghurtFresh coriander leaves1 lemon, cut into wedgesSet a heavy-bottomed frying pan on a medium heat, add half the oil and butter, then stir in the onions and a teaspoon of sea salt, and cook, stirring often, for 25 minutes, until the onions are soft and sweet; add a few tablespoons of water halfway, to stop them sticking to the pan.Meanwhile, simmer the potatoes in a large pan of salted boiling water for about 20 minutes, until tender, then drain, reserving the water. Put the reserved water back in the pan, bring back to a boil, drop in the peas and simmer for a few minutes until tender, then drain. Put the empty pan on a low heat, tip the drained potatoes back in, leave to steam dry for a few minutes, then mash thoroughly.Stir the garlic, ginger and all the spices bar the mustard seeds and curry leaves into the softened onions and cook for five minutes more. Put two-thirds of the onion mix in the potato pan (put the rest in a bowl), then add the drained peas and egg, and stir well.Put the remaining butter and a tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan and set it on a medium-high heat. Tip in the potato mixture, flatten evenly and cook on a medium heat for seven to eight minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for another seven to eight minutes. (Alternatively, make smaller potato patties by dividing the mixture into six, rolling into balls, then flattening in the pan before frying.) Once cooked, leave to cool slightly while you make the crab tarka.Put the remaining tablespoon of oil in a wok on a very high heat, stir-fry the reserved onion mixture with the crab, mustard seeds and curry leaves until sizzling hot, then season generously.Cut the potato cake into wedges, top with the crab tarka and spoonfuls of yoghurt, finish with a scattering of coriander and serve with lemon wedges on the side.Chopped mango salad with crispy chickpeasView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ chopped mango salad with crispy chickpeas.A beguiling salad that sparkles with fresh citrus, chilli heat and herbs to add accents to sweet mango and deliciously spiced chickpeas.Prep10 minCook25 minServes4250g cooked chickpeasOlive oil2 tsp mild curry powderSea salt and black pepper1 small red onion, peeled and finely dicedJuice of1 lemon½ cucumber2 ripe mangoes, peeled and pitted1 tsp amchoor(mango powder), or sumac1 tsp ground cumin1 red chilli, finely diced1 handful each fresh mintand coriander leaves, roughly choppedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.

It’s easy, flavourful and, as a bonus, it’s crispy, too. In fact, it’s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they’re jammy, and ready to top the patty. You don’thaveto do this, but I’m here to tell you that it is worthwhile (especially if there’s a six-year-old already making the burgers).Crispy black bean burgersIf you like, prep the patties a day in advance and chill until needed.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4Prep10 minCook30 minServes4Olive oil2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced1 tsp salt400g tin black beans, not drained80g dried breadcrumbs1 tsp dried garlic granules1 tsp dried onion granules1 tbsp chipotle paste2 tsp dijon mustard1 tbsp tomato ketchupTo serve4 burger bunsVegan mayonnaiseIceberg lettuceFinely sliced tomatoPut three tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan set over a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes, until quite reduced and frazzled. Take off the heat.Meanwhile, spoon a couple of tablespoons of the liquid (aquafaba) from the tin of beans into a small bowl or mug and set aside. Drain and rinse the beans, tip into a large bowl and roughly mash; leave a few whole or in big chunks. Stir in the breadcrumbs, garlic granules, onion granules, chipotle paste, mustard, ketchup and a half-teaspoon of salt, then use your hands to mix until well combined; if need be, add some or all of the reserved aquafaba.Divide the bean mix evenly into four, roll each piece into a ball, then put them one by one between two sheets of baking paper and press out to roughly 10cm- to 12cm-wide patties (I tend to make mine a wee bit bigger than the burger buns).To cook the patties, put two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan, then fry two of the burgers for about six minutes in total, turning them once halfway, or when the base is crisp and golden. Remove and set aside, add another two tablespoons of oil, then repeat with the other two patties.To serve, split and toast the buns, spread a generous dollop of mayo over the cut side of the bases and top with a leaf or two of iceberg lettuce. Add a bean patty and a couple of thin slices of tomato, and finish with a quarter of the caramelised onions. On with the lids and eat immediately.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe new veganVegetablesFoodBeans, pulses and legumesBurgersBreadMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Many of these people are worried about a big jump in payments when they switch to a new product.When someone’s existing mortgage deal is reaching its expiry date, their lender will usually be in touch offering a selection of rates.Nationwide completed its takeover of Virgin Money last October, and later revealed it hadbagged a £2.3bn gain from the dealas it had effectively bought the brand at a chunky discount.That in turn led to Nationwidedishing out £50 mini-windfallsto more than 12 million of its members last month – more than £600m in total.However the two brands continue to operate as separate lenders and offer differently priced mortgage deals to their respective customer bases.Borrowers who have reached the end of their deal with one cannot simply switch to the other – they would have to go through the process of remortgaging and pay any legal and valuation costs involved.The Guardian was contacted this week by a Virgin Money customer on a two-year fix with a rate of 4.54%, which ends on 31 July. The lowest product transfer rate being offered to her was another two-year fix priced at 3.84%, which is a competitive rate (her loan-to-value ratio is less than 60%).View image in fullscreenThere’s no handshake from one Virgin Money customer who questioned why Nationwide borrowers were being offered better deals.Photograph: Prostock-studio/AlamyBut this deal came with a big product fee: £1,995.Now she is a Nationwide group customer, she hoped to see what product transfer rates were being offered to Nationwide customers with the same amount of equity. Nationwide was also offering a 3.84% two-year fix to its existing borrowers – but at £999, the product fee was almost £1,000 lower.Virgin also offered a choice of base-rate tracker deals, including a two-year one at 4.48% (the bank base rate plus 0.23%) and a £995 fee.But an Nationwide borrower could benefit from a slightly cheaper deal: a two-year tracker at 4.39% (the base rate plus 0.14%) and a £999 fee.Another advantage of the Nationwide tracker is that it has no early repayment charges, whereas the Virgin one does during the two years. However, Virgin will let customers switch from this deal on to one of its fixed rates without having to pay a penalty.A Nationwide spokesperson says: “Nationwide building society and Virgin Money continue to operate as separate lenders following the acquisition and are being integrated over time.”They add: “Customers currently wishing to move provider must therefore do so as a remortgage.”David Hollingworth at the broker firm L&CMortgagessays it is “pretty typical that you wouldn’t be able to switch between one brand and another”.For example, Lloyds and Halifax are both part of Lloyds Banking Group but will price differently, he says. Meanwhile, The Co-operative Bank was recently taken over by Coventry building society, but still operates as separate lending brand.On whether Nationwide typically offered better deals than Virgin, or vice versa, Hollingworth says that “it moves around” and that they are both generally pretty competitive. “Virgin is just as likely to be right up there as Nationwide can be,” he says.Explore more on these topicsNationwideBanks and building societiesMortgage ratesMortgagesnewsShareReuse this content"

Also, learn Spanish. Go through the 10,000 photos on my phone, print out the nice ones of the kids and put them in nice frames, and create one of those charming gallery walls. Definitely get into meditating and journalling. Should probably write a will? I’m all set. I’m just waiting for, say, a clear week to magically appear in my diary and I’ll get started.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Except, the penny is starting to drop that those pristine, blank diary pages are never going to happen. Life doesn’t work like that. And anyway, say a week off did magically appear, which it isn’t going to, wouldn’t it make more sense to go on holiday than sit on the floor sorting jumpers? If I had even half a day off, surely it would be a shame to waste it on dull jobs when I could, maybe, go to the cinema on my own – or get the train to Paris for lunch?But, half an hour? That I can do. And I reckon you can, too. Half an hour is doable after having supper and loading the dishwasher, and you can still get an early night. Half an hour during baby nap time, and you might still get to sit down with a cup of tea. Plus you can change your life in half an hour. Obviously, you can’t learn an entire language or redecorate a room, but by breaking your challenges into half-hour chunks an impossible to-do list becomes possible. Making a start on changing the things you want to change is very powerful. And 30 minutes is a realistic time period over which you can maintain energy for jobs that would be too mind-numbing to commit a whole day to. Instead of imagining you are going to spring clean the whole house, take 30 minutes to tackle that one drawer of doom in the kitchen – the one with a pencil case that was left behind on a playdate four years ago, packets of dog worming tablets and keys that have lost their labels.Thirty minutes is all you need to point yourself in a new direction. One drawer, one fitness session, one lasagne, one window box at a time. True, you could start watching a new box set instead. But if you want to feel like a superhero, try a power half-hour.Jess Cartner-Morley,fashion editorThe one-cupboard clearoutLet’s start with your shoes. You will need: a roll of those transparent sandwich/food bags; a shoe brush;Magic Eraser sponges, the kind that get grubby marks off walls and cost about a fiver; a good podcast; a cup of tea. Gather all your shoes and sweep out the cupboard. The scuffed ballet flats that look like you fished them off the train tracks can go. And nobody needs more than one spare pair of trainers. Clean up the shoes you are keeping, then put aside anything that needs resoling or reheeling. Store the ones you are keeping in pairs in the bags: that way you can stack them to save space without anything getting dirty, and when you come to pack for a holiday you’ll thank yourself as you can put them straight into your case in their bags. Put them back with out-of-season shoes or boots at the back/bottom of the cupboard. Then put a bag by the front door for shoes to go to the charity shop/recycling centre and the cobblers. Shut the cupboard door. Marvel at efficiency and general excellence of self. Can be adapted for: your underwear drawer, or your jumpers, or the hallway coat rack that has become a dumping ground.JCMView image in fullscreenIllustration: Matt MurphyPractise shopping preloved clothesNot all power half-hours happen at home. Do you find it hard to get your bearings in a secondhand shop? I hear you. There is a whole generation of women, like me, who grew up in the era of fast fashion, who don’t have the shopping skills necessary to successfully navigate charity and vintage shops. Half an hour spent learning the ropes will give you confidence to shop preloved. Choose one store – this could fit into a lunch hour if there is one near where you work – and spend 30 minutes getting your eye in. Don’t try to flick through every piece on every rail – you will just get bored and disheartened. Instead, have a think about colours or prints that you like: leopard, or monochrome stripes, or pink – whatever makes you happy. Scan the room for those. When you spot something, pull it out, and if the style appeals, look at the fabric next, not the brand name. Quality fabric is what makes the difference between old clothes that still look great and old clothes that look past their best. If stumped, head to the rail of men’s shirts: a faded, good quality cotton shirt in a classic blue or a banker stripe is a great secondhand find that will look original and chic with a pair of jeans. So long as it’s roomy, you don’t need to be too precise about the fit, so with the aid of a mirror you can avoid the changing room and check the size just by holding it up against you.JCMMake a jewellery wallI have unashamedly stolen this idea from theMilan apartment of designer JJ Martin. I went for dinner there once and fell in love with her bathroom, which she had decorated with her collection of vintage necklaces. If there’s one thing more pleasing than a project that makes your home look nicer for nothing, it’s a project that makes your home look nicer for nothing and creates extra storage. You need a box of brass wall tacks and a hammer. Allowing the space of a piece of A4 for each one, tap in three tacks for each necklace in a triangle shape – one at the top, and the others below and two inches either side, so that when you hang the necklace it takes on roughly the shape it would around your neck. If you want to get fancy, have a look on eBay for some empty vintage picture frames, which you can stick to the wall with Command Strips without damaging your paintwork. As an added bonus, you will be inspired to actually wear the necklaces that are currently tangled in your jewellery box.JCMInstead of a frantic half-hour wardrobe crisis on the day, have a calm, half-hour styling session nowPlan occasion outfits in advanceWorrying about what you are going to wear to a party or wedding in the future is a waste of headspace and can spoil that feeling of pleasurable anticipation. Instead of a frantic half-hour wardrobe crisis on the day, have a calm half-hour styling session now. Shut the door, put some music on, let the room get messy until you find the outfit you want to wear. Check it for marks or falling down hems, then figure out the all important details: the right bra, socks, coat. Bonus points if you can decide on jewellery, too. Take a full‑length mirror selfie as an aide-memoire.JCMTry a 30-minute beauty blitzA few times a week, in the half-hour before I go to sleep, I slip into a ritual that feels relaxing and helpful – a 30-minute beauty blitz. It starts with my face: a careful rotation between retinol and a nourishing face oil each night keeps my skin looking fresh. Then comes the red-light mask, casting an eerie glow as it delivers itscirculation-boostingbenefits to my face – and the helmet version I use for scalp health, too. As all of this works its magic, I layer on the extras: a foot mask with urea for softening hard skin; a heavy hand cream and cuticle oil to combat the effects of hand-washing and the cold; a deep-conditioning overnight hair mask; and acastor oil packapplied to my stomach, which is said to help with digestive issues. Mouth tape goes on last, a controversial trick that I believe helps me withnasal breathing and better sleep. Throughout it all, a podcast plays – something soothing and engaging but not too gripping. The rhythm of voices keeps me company as I move through each step, hands busy, mind unwinding. By the time I’m done, I also feel cocooned and primed for rest. The next morning, I unmask – literally and figuratively – emerging just that bit fresher.Anita Bhagwandas,beauty journalist and author ofUglySlim down your walletIf you’re still lugging around a proper wallet or purse, give it a clearout and see if you could travel a bit lighter. As well as getting rid of ancient receipts and expired vouchers, you could reduce the plastic by digitising your loyalty cards – you’ll need a smartphone to do so. Some banks, such as NatWest, let you put them all in one place on their platform. The Google/Apple wallet is another option. You will typically need to download the retailer’s app and add the loyalty card from there. Or if you don’t have Google Wallet or Apple Pay, you may as well just use the retailer’s app – the advantage of that is you will often see discount vouchers when you go to open your loyalty card details. As a backup, it’s worth still carrying around the plastic versions of the main ones that get you discounts (Tesco or Sainsbury’s Nectar card, for example) as you don’t want a dead battery to cost you money. Some gift cards can also be added to digital wallets, so it’s worth going through any left over from Christmas.Hilary Osborne, money and consumer editorView image in fullscreenIllustration: Matt MurphySort out your savingsPerhaps you’ve been meaning to set up a regular savings account, you have money languishing in an instant access account, or a fixed-term deal has just ended. If so, you could be earning just 0.25%, when it’s possible to earn almost 20 times that elsewhere.Start with best-buy tables – websites likeMoneyfactsand thePrivate Officeoffer lists of the best deals. Make sure you are seeing accounts from across the market, regardless of whether the site is getting commission – on Moneyfacts you need to sort by “rate” rather than provider links first; the Private Office automatically shows everything. How much interest you can earn will depend on a range of factors, including whether you can get hold of your cash instantly and how much you have to put away. Focus on the accounts that suit your needs. See what your bank is offering, too – sometimes there are higher rates for customers with particular current accounts. Don’t be put off by having too many choices: any move to a better rate is worthwhile.Once you’ve chosen, you can apply. This might be directly through the best-buys website, or you may need to go to the provider. The best rates are typically for accounts operated online, so you won’t have to leave your home. First, read the small print – there should be a summary sheet explaining the account details and a sheet of T&Cs. Look out for restrictions around withdrawing your money, or adding money to the account later. Even if you’re new to a provider, you might not need to provide any ID to get started; instead, it might verify you using a credit referencing agency – but don’t worry, this won’t affect your credit score. Once you’re up and running, you can pay in your money and look forward to better returns; 30 minutes well spent.HOTackle pesky gardening tasksGardening is, for the most part, a joyful practice despite – or perhaps because of – being made up of a series of repetitive tasks. I can find myself absorbed in certain jobs for hours. I’ll happily disappear into the rhythm of seed sowing and lose track of how much time I’ve spent hunched over a bench, rattling seeds out of paper packets into my compost-encrusted hands.But there are other jobs demanding a gardener’s attention that are far less compelling, and there’s no better example than the miserable task of getting rid of the perpetually reproducing bramble. It’s a prickly, painful and sisyphean task that is satisfying to make a dent in, but makes for a miserable all-day chore. Unwelcome plants – bindweed, couch grass, docks – will always outgrow our efforts to keep them in check, so a better approach to dealing with them is setting aside 30 minutes at least once a week to get as much weeding done as possible. That way, you feel like you are getting on top of it without being worn down by it, and you can quickly return to the tasks that make gardening a pleasure.Claire Ratinon, gardening columnistA full body workoutYou can easily do this at home using just aTRX band(available for about £20). It incorporates compound exercises which work more than one muscle group at a time for pull (which is good for your posture, working back and biceps), push (works chest and triceps), legs (glutes, quad and hamstrings) and core. If you do the routine below at a reasonable pace, it’ll improve strength while giving you a cardio workout, exercising your heart and lungs.Door pull-ups (pull)Attach a TRX band to the top of a closed door. Step away from the door and, holding the band’s handles, slowly lean back until your arms are extended, before pulling yourself up to the starting position. The stronger you are, the more parallel to the floor you will be able to get (you can lengthen the bands as your strength improves.) Aim for three sets of 10-15 reps.Press-up (push)Begin in the high plank position with your hands a little wider than your shoulders. Engage your core and keep your elbows tucked into your torso while lowering your chest towards the ground. Push the floor away from you until you are back in a high plank. If this is too hard, begin in a kneeling plank position. Aim for three sets of 10-15 reps.‘Do dull jobs for half an hour a week, and you can return to the tasks that make gardening fun’Lunges (legs)Holding something for balance if necessary, stand with your feet together before stepping your left leg backwards so that your right foot is flat and your left is on your toes. Drop your left knee to the floor without lurching forwards or backwards, before returning to an upright position. Now alternate legs. Aim for three sets of 10 reps on each leg.Shoulder touch plank (abs)Begin in a plank position. Using your right arm, tap your left shoulder, bracing your core so that your torso doesn’t rock. Now alternate, touching your right shoulder with your left arm. Aim for three sets of 10-15 touches.Repeat the above as many times as you can in 30 minutes, taking a 90-second rest between each round.Nick Finney, personal trainerView image in fullscreenIllustration: Matt MurphyGet to know your freezerHave you connected with your freezer recently? I mean really connected, sat down on the floor, taken a deep breath and had a long hard look inside? Cruel necessity (ie, no longer being able to close the door) recently forced me into just such a step, and I cannot fully convey the profound satisfaction it’s given me without slightly embarrassing myself. It’s amazing how a quick audit can make you feel like a domestic goddess. Get everything out, sort it into categories (raw ingredients, cooked food, desserts), and make a list of everything you have – I find it helpful to keep this on a magnetic pad on the fridge door. Assuming your past self was generous enough to label everything, include dates too, so you know what needs eating. Chuck (or defrost for a Russian-roulette dining experience) anything unidentifiable or freezer-burnt, and put the rest back in its categories so you can locate the ice-cream in an emergency. Shut the door with confidence, smug in the knowledge that you probably don’t need to go shopping again for a while – for frozen peas anyway.Felicity Cloake, food writerKeepthe cleaning surface level …Thirty minutes is enough time for a surface-level whiz around high-traffic areas in most homes. Blast your way through the most-used rooms, clearing away any visible piles of mess, plumping cushions and making everything look just put-together enough so you don’t want to scream. If you have loads of out-of-place items, shove stray bits in a washing basket and return them to their rightful home as you go. This method is most effective if you pretend you have a visitor coming and want to get everything looking sharp for their arrival – or better yet, actually have a visitor coming for an extra kick up the bum. Unless you’re superhuman, it’s unlikely your entire home will look completely spotless afterwards, but it will look tidy enough on the surface, which is definitely better than nothing.Roo Day, author ofGetting Sh*t Done(Ebury Press, £16.99)…or go deepFor a more targeted clean of one area, you can give your kitchen a really decent blitz in half an hour. Wash up or unload and reload the dishwasher, scrub the sink, wipe down all the sides and any visible marks on your cupboard fronts (just the dirty spots – there’s no point wasting time cleaning anything that already looks clean when you’re against the clock). Depending on how messy the kitchen was to start with, you might even have time to clear the fridge of any out-of-date food and sauces that have been festering there. If you can fit in a quick vacuum and spray mop, then you’ve absolutely smashed it.RDExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingBeautyGardening adviceHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But after a while, things got oddByCraig JeffreyFri 16 May 2025 20.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 17 May 2025 02.19 EDTShareDuring a 100 mile (160km) race around Mount Kosciuszko last year, I was caught in a lightning storm. I got talking to a fellow runner who was sheltering with me. She told me that there was an even longer race, out inWestern Australia. “You must do it!” she said. “The food is incredible, and people share disgusting pictures of their toes afterwards.”It sounded brilliant. The race is called Delirious West, a 200-mile run completed in a single push.Why run 200 miles? For me, it’s the adventure. The opportunity to find out more about myself.Ultra marathons – anything longer than the 42km marathon –are becoming more popular. These are usually 50km or 100km, with some running to 100 miles (160km). And then there’s 200 miles (340km) – a niche within a niche. A marathon often takes 3-4 hours; 100km may be more like 15 hours. And 200 miles can be over 100 hours of running.In Australia there used to be three 200-milers –Irrational South, Unreasonable East and Delirious West – each typically attracting 50 to 100 competitors.This year the only 200-miler left is the Delirious West.The format is simple – run 200 miles along the Bibbulmun track from Northcliffe to Albany (the route had to be changed this year because of bushfires), stopping at roughly 20 aid stations along the route, four of which double as sleep stations.Most runners try to get at least a couple of hours’ sleep each night, but some do it on virtually no sleep. Many mix hiking and running. But there’s no magic formula, except the obvious: keep moving forward.Wine and wilderness: a multi-day hike in South Australia’s Clare ValleyRead moreI’d heard from past runners that consistency was key. During the first few months of 2025, I ran 120km a week, including five or six hour long runs running up and down a 400m hill on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne, often starting at 4am. But I had no idea how I’d get on in Delirious West – it was a leap into the unknown.We started on a Wednesday morning at the Giant Tingle Tree, amid a stand of enormous gumtrees. The few hours before the start were tense. Runners checked their gear for the hundredth time, made tiny adjustments to backpacks and nervously shared good lucks. I tried to zone out. “Just get to the first aid station”, I thought.At 10am we got under way. We poured down the trail, lots of people cheering and waving. It was a relief to start. The first 100km was through dense, humid forest, along beach dunes and scrubby coastal bush. Not a massive number of hills, but a lot of energy-sapping sand. A bunch of us ran together, hooting and hollering as we went.View image in fullscreenCraig Jeffery: ‘It feels like it’s your job – somehow trudging on felt natural.’Photograph: Astrid Volzke/The Delirious WESTI got to the first sleep station after about 18 hours of running, just before dawn on Thursday morning. I tried to sleep but I was too wired. On the plus side, the waffles were delicious.On the next section I tried two “dirt naps”. I had prepared a laminated sign, “Please don’t disturb, I’m having a dirt nap”. I set this out beside the path and then lay down among the creepy crawlies on the forest floor. But I was still too wired.Even lying down briefly made a difference though, and I was keeping up a good jog as I headed to Tree Tops: some of the tallest and most impressive trees in Australia.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAfter Tree Tops the landscape changes, from forest through farmland and then back to the ocean at a place called Conspicuous Cliffs. I stopped at the Conspicuous Cliffs aid station, which marks roughly the halfway point, and ran along a stunning moonlit beach. At an estuary a jetskier was waiting, I jumped on the back, rode across the water and then jumped off and resumed my trudge up the beach.View image in fullscreenThe Delirious West ultra-marathon in Mandalay Beach, WA.Photograph: Astrid Volzke/The Delirious WESTBy midway through the second night I reached an aid station at a place called Peaceful Bay. Sore and exhausted, I slumped down on a camp bed and at last drifted to sleep.Forty minutes later, at about 1am, I got up, excited about restarting. Pack back on, I was off into the night.I had now been running for about 35 hours and was coming towards the end of my second night. After a while, it feels like it’s your job – somehow trudging on felt natural. I felt better on day three than day one. Several aid stations later, my legs felt strong.But as I entered my third night, things got odd. I was running along coastal paths where giant globe spiders had spun their webs, and I ended up with cobwebs and spiders across my shoulders and hair. On the ground there were thousands of little frogs. I was terrified of standing on one. I also started seeing robots along the path. Hallucinations are normal.More alarmingly, I lost track of being in a race and started to think I might be out there for another reason – inspecting the paths? Doing research? The sensible thing would have been to take a nap, but I just kept running.View image in fullscreenDelirious West runners in West Cape Howe, WA.Photograph: Astrid Volzke/The Delirious WESTAt about 20km to go I hit a wall. I’d done about 310km by this stage, pretty much non-stop and running for 64 hours. I started to have an out of body experience, seeing myself looking pitiful and tired on the path. I tried to talk to myself but couldn’t work out if I was one person or two people.But my “voice of reason” did just about cut through. I decided to break the next few km into 100m sections. I kept just thinking “Can you do the next 100m?” The answer was always yes, and so I kept going.I finally ran into the finish at Albany at 7.45am – nearly three days after I’d started, for a time of 69 hours something: good enough for third place.I’d done the run to learn more about myself. It felt amazing to know what I was capable of.And yes, the toe photos were disgusting.Explore more on these topicsRunningMarathon runningWestern AustraliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ayear ago, I discovered a bit of a travel hack – that if accompanied by an adult (obviously) children under the age of 12 can explore Europe by train for absolutely zilch. Profoundly susceptible to any sort of bargain, even those that promise a net deficit in the long run, I determined to take advantage of Interrail’s generous offer, despite lacking dependents of the specified vintage.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sourcing someone under 12 was far easier than I’d imagined. When I lodged an enquiry about my 10-year-old niece, asking if Annabelle might be available for an Interrailing stint at Easter, my brother couldn’t sign her up fast enough. (Though he did insist on some caveats: in bed by 10pm, out of bed by 9am, and no watching sweary Gordon Ramsay shows).View image in fullscreenBut where would we go? Well, after several discussions with my prospective companion over FaceTime (during which she utilised upwards of 100 filters, including one that made her look like Donald Trump), six locations were settled on: Paris, Zurich, Venice, Innsbruck, Berlin and Amsterdam. Annabelle citedEmily in Parisand The Diary of Anne Frankas inspirations, while confessing to a long-term interest in Toblerone. If the itinerary had been up to me, it would have looked a lot different. I’d justfinished writing a book, you see, in which I travel to some of the least fashionable cities in Europe, but when I mentioned to Annabelle the likes of Essen and Minsk, she raised one of her eyebrows and held it there for 10 seconds (which is something she does when deeply unimpressed).View image in fullscreenTrying snails and exploring Paris.So, first up, Paris. After checking in at The Hoxton hotel on Rue du Sentier, we quickly got stuck into some snails. (I won’t quote Annabelle’s verdict verbatim, but she likened them to a larger version of something you might find up your nose). A picnic near the Eiffel Tower – during which Annabelle stewed over my explanation as to why there was no point in us joining the massive queue to be elevated skywards (“Are you sure British people aren’t allowed, Uncle Ben?”) – was followed by a rapid ascent up 500 steps to the base of Sacré-Coeur basilica, Annabelle’s alacrity owing to a white lie on my part (I’d said there was a doughnut shop at the top).Our journey to Zurich involved changing at Strasbourg. A seat reservation was required for the first leg at a cost of €10 each. (It’s worth mentioning that Interrail pass-holders have to cough up for seat reservations on certain European train services, and all sleeper berths.) An honest breakdown of what we did during the four-hour run down the eastern flank of France to Switzerland reads as follows: 10 minutes considering the passing landscape, 80 minutes of screen time and roughly 19 games of hangman, in which I was able to smuggle a new pair of words into Annabelle’s evolving vocabulary, namely “exasperation” and “glee”.View image in fullscreenAnnabelle and Ben in Venice, left, and Zurich.We spent an hour exploring Zurich’s efforts to become the most eco-friendly city possible (including a hydroelectric power station that got the one-eyebrow treatment from Annabelle), and another sitting by the lake near the fetching old town watching the swans and coots squabble over pretzel scraps. Then I gave Annabelle’s palate the night off chocolate and took her to a plant‑based restaurant calledDar, run by the renowned Spanish-Moroccan chef Zineb “Zizi” Hattab. We loved everything about the place, but the highlights were the Kentucky-fried mushrooms and the vegan ceviche.In Venice, I changed my approach to travelling with a miniature human. I stopped trying to have conversations every 10 paces about bridges and sea levels and the role of Garibaldi in the reunification of Italy, and instead handed Annabelle the reins, telling her to lead the way and get us lost. She succeeded with aplomb, getting us lost in just about every gift shop we saw (her appetite for tat is astonishing).Annabelle suffers from a condition known as selective fatigue, which tends to flare up on the way to museumsWe stayed at the Avani Rio Novo, a stylish establishment near the train station. This meant it scored points with Annabelle, whose legs suffer from a disabling condition known as selective fatigue, which tends to flare up on the way to museums and so on. After a dinner of sardines and gelato (don’t ask), she spent the evening trying to teach me ballet moves, whereas I spent the evening thinking the sooner she starts drinking alcohol the better.The next morning, before we departed for pastures new, I asked Annabelle for an alternative verb to “move on” or “proceed” and she suggested “wobble”, and so it was that we bade Venice farewell and wobbled north to Innsbruck, a charming city of about 130,000-odd citizens surrounded by mountains.Having dumped our bags atAdlers Hoteland wolfed down a schnitzel at a restaurant calledStiftskeller, we took a 20-minute cable car ride up to the peak of Hafelekarspitze, a mountain topping 2,334 metres (7,657ft). We paid our dues to the vista – a pistachio river, a motley crop of rooftops, a ring of Austrian Alps – before commencing a protracted snowball fight that Annabelle would later put forward as the highlight of her trip, a comment that had me wondering if I should have just taken her to the Snozone in Milton Keynes.View image in fullscreenIn Berlin, left, and at the top of Hafelekarspitze near Innsbruck.We travelled the next day to Berlin, reaching the German capital in time to catch the sunset from the 368-metre tall TV Tower in Alexanderplatz. As I attempted to explain the significance of the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie, Annabelle appeared to be taking on board the gravitas of these historical monuments, an impression that was punctured somewhat when she asked, at the end of my summary, “Can you do this with your tongue?”We proceeded by tram to theKPM Hotel, in a former porcelain factory in the west of the city, which Annabelle gave 10 out of 10, mainly because there was a beanbag in her room. The next morning, a guided bike tour along the Berlin Wall provided an energising lesson on ideological warfare, Helmut Schmidt, David Hasselhoff and the various ways an East German might get over an obstacle. The tour was elevated by the incorporation of curry wurst and cherry trees, and by the good nature of our guide, Phillip. When he asked if Annabelle liked the sound of life in the German Democratic Republic, she quickly and firmly said “sure”, which I later discovered is her go-to response when she hasn’t been listening.Annabelle was rather rude about Rembrandt. Sizing up his self-portrait, she suggested in no uncertain terms that he really shouldn’t have botheredThe next day, we reached Amsterdam Centraal without fuss, the journey taking less than six hours and requiring neither reservation nor connection. From the station, we enjoyed a pleasant walk to our hotel, the NH Collection Amsterdam Flower Market, whose staff couldn’t do enough for Annabelle, even hastily organising an Easter egg hunt when it became apparent that I’d completely forgotten what the resurrection of Christ means to people of a certain age.Over the next day and a bit, we wandered along the canals, tried some Dutch pancakes (poffertjes), and had a butcher’s at the Rembrandts in the Rijksmuseum. No prizes for guessing which of these experiences Annabelle enjoyed the most. In truth, Annabelle was actually rather rude about Rembrandt. Sizing up the great painter’s self-portrait of 1628, she suggested in no uncertain terms that he really shouldn’t have bothered.View image in fullscreenOn one of many trains, left, and in Amsterdam.Annabelle’s verdict on our visit to the Anne Frank House was somewhat more measured. After spending a sobering hour listening to Anne’s story as we navigated the building in which the Franks hid from the Nazis, she contributed the following to the visitors’ book: “I wish this museum didn’t exist to be honest, but I’m really glad we came.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She’d like to do the same with her adopted tortoise, but is worried it will escape.I explain that my garden is bounded by high brick walls, safely sealing the tortoise in, but that I too am consumed by fear that he will escape. He’s very good at hiding, and this always strikes me as a strategy: wait until they think you’ve already gone, and their guard will drop.Also, he has form: my wife was eight years old when she got the tortoise. After her parents separated he went to live in the country with her father, and promptly escaped. He stayed missing for two years, until a farmer found him while combining in a field a mile south of his last known whereabouts. For 20 years the tortoise lived in a pen with the farmer’s sheepdogs, with a white stripe painted on his back to make him easier to spot whenever he got out.At some point in the 1990s the farm was sold, and the tortoise was returned to my father-in-law, who very quickly returned him to my wife. That was nearly 30 years ago, which can make the end result feel like destiny, although probably not from the tortoise’s point of view. To him it’s just one foiled escape attempt after another.This spring, our oldest son also returned to us: his lease is up, and he has yet to find a new place. When I arrive to pick him up from the flat he’s shared with friends for the last two years, his belongings are in bin liners, his furniture piled on stairwell landings.Once he stayed missing for two years, until found in a field a mile south of his last known whereabouts“It’s not usually this messy,” he says.“Don’t worry,” I say. “This is the only time I’ll ever see it.”The car is so full that the last things have to be crammed in and the doors quickly shut before they fall back out. The oldest one rides with a suitcase on his lap, and a potted plant on the floor between his knees. His mother is not thrilled to see all this stuff – another household, essentially – piled up in our hall and living room.“Lucky for you we’re going away,” she says. “You can figure out how to get it all upstairs before we come back.”“I will,” he says. “What’s for supper?”We’re setting off early in the morning for a long weekend, leaving little time to inculcate a fresh sense of residential responsibility in our new roommate.“You’ll need to get cat food,” my wife says. “Lock the back door if you go out.”“OK,” he says.“I’m expecting a package tomorrow,” I say.“Do your laundry,” my wife says, “and keep the kitchen clean.”The next morning the oldest one’s stuff is still piled in the hallway – it’s easier to pack the car by carrying the bags out through the side door, where I pause to show my wife the repaired fibreoptic cable that restored our internet.“They even repositioned it so it won’t happen again,” I say.“Are we ready?” she says. “I want to go before the school traffic starts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Somewhere along the M3 we begin to weigh the pros and cons of our new living situation.“On the one hand, he’s a terrible slob,” I say. “On the other hand, we now have two potato mashers.”“I’m going to set some ground rules when we get back,” my wife says.“But it’s also good we can go away and feel secure about things,” I say.“Are you kidding?” she says. “How secure do you feel right now?”When we arrive at our destination I check the weather in London – it’s due to get very hot. I then send a panicky, pleading text to the family WhatsApp group about the seedlings in my office, and their immediate watering needs. Half an hour later I receive a reply from the oldest one. It says: “where is the key”.I explain about the key – again. Eventually he texts back to say he’s now out all day. Then the middle one texts to say he will drop by to water that afternoon.My wife joins in, issuing a brief rebuke to the oldest one and a reminder of his renewed residential responsibilities.“He’s gone very quiet since then,” I say.“Well, he’ll be embarrassed, I hope,” my wife says.We don’t receive any kind of reply until late afternoon, when the oldest one finally replies:“I think you left the side door open,” he writes. “The tortoise has just been returned to me from across the street.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To live in an ancient cottage is to be close to the wild, with the weather permeating the daub plaster and creatures coming and going. This morning I have more in common with the starlings than just my home, as I must also head out to forage. I am midway through the wild biome project, a research initiative studying the effects of consuming a wild diet for three months, with a focus on the gut microbiome.I’d like to describe the exercise as a gentle rewilding, but in reality it’s more jarring than that, like turning feral. My body and mind are reverting to an ancestral blueprint, while modern life continues about me with its bemusing artifice. Happily, hunger trumps such philosophical thoughts. The day begins with a broth of braised venison, three-cornered leek, watercress and St George’s mushrooms, jewelled with glistening discs of fat.The first month was a challenge, but my body, tastes and, more importantly, my gut bacteria have altered, transforming my perception of breakfast from a greasy bowl to a satisfying meal. To further my appreciation, I remember that I’m not eating roadkill fox or polecat today, two profoundly musty meats that I have no intention of revisiting.View image in fullscreenMichael's breakfast broth.Photograph: Michael WhiteTopped up with soup, I follow the starlings into the verdant landscape that has become my ever-evolving larder. The lane verges are tall with vegetation now, and where I once searched for hogweed shoots, I now pick their bulging flower buds while lamenting the passing of lady’s smock, which lent a welcome kick to my simple food.As the available ingredients alter, so does my gut biome, affecting me physically, mentally and emotionally. Changed though I am, this project is still a challenge. Survival is not a problem, but to thrive there must occasionally be sumptuous variety, so tonight I feast. I sit down to a plate of sweet-fleshed signal crayfish from the stream, crispy acorn fritters and roasted hogweed buds seasoned with wild garlic salt. For once I am sated, and, thinking of my early alarm call, retire to bed noisily in a mild act of neighbourly retribution.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsForagingCountry diaryRural affairsWildlifeBirdsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now he says that after three years working with the RHS, he has lost hope that it genuinely wants to become more accessible.Announcing his resignation on Instagram this week, on the eve of the RHS’s biggest annual event, the Chelsea flower show, Hayden-Smith said: “I entered this role well intentioned and optimistic. On reflection, I now see that I was also naive.“What I’ve come to learn is that representation without redistribution – of power, resources or decision-making – is not justice. And working within institutions that aren’t prepared to listen, adapt or truly share space only goes so far.”He was particularly critical of the Chelsea flower show: “Year after year [the event] sets a precedent that celebrates spectacle over sustainability, exclusivity over equity.”The Royal Horticultural Society is one of the world’s oldest horticultural societies, founded in 1804 as a forum for experimental ideas on gardening. It runs one of the UK’s national community gardening schemes, investing millions of pounds in projects and outreach around the country.Its flagship event, the Chelsea flower show, has been held for more than a century in the grounds of the Royal hospital Chelsea, and is one of the world’s leading international horticultural events.Hayden-Smith became known as a gardener in the aftermath of the catastrophic fire at Grenfell Tower, which loomed over his home, in 2017. While some in his community turned to art or music to express their grief at the 72 lives lost, he began tending a nearby plot of unused green space, which eventually grew to become the Grenfell Garden of Peace.Encouraged by its success, he started a non-profit organisation, Grow2Know, to empower young and disadvantaged people through guerrilla gardening, reclaiming unused spaces in their nature-deprived inner-city community.In 2022, just five years after picking up a trowel for the first time, Hayden-Smith was given funding to exhibit at the Chelsea flower show. But even then he expressed misgivings over its exclusivity.“The five-day festival … has never felt like it was meant for the likes of me,” hewrote for the Guardian. Shortly after, the RHS asked Hayden-Smith to become one of its ambassadors.Hayden-Smith told the Guardian that a particular flashpoint had emerged around this year’s Chelsea flower show. He said RHS bosses had rejected his proposals to open up the event, traditionally seen as a highbrow affair, to members of the communities living nearby.Hayden-Smith lives and was raised in North Kensington, minutes away from the affluent neighbourhood where the show takes place, but where life expectancies can be as much as 20 years lower.“The hope was that because of the locality, because of the disparity and inequality within the borough that Chelsea flower show has existed in for over 100 years, this was a unique opportunity to redistribute, to create access, to really be bold in engaging a wider community of people,” Hayden-Smith said.“The response to that was, you know, we can’t justify supporting this specific community, despite it being on the doorstep of Chelsea flower show.”A spokesperson for the RHS said: “The RHS supported Grow2Know on a project in the North Kensington borough by providing direct funding towards a community garden (£30,000).“We also hosted and funded a fundraising event for the same community garden, asked local RHS members to support the project, and took part in a community engagement event with planting activities.“The RHS delivers one of the biggest national community gardening initiatives, investing millions in school gardening, community outreach and grassroots projects around the whole country.“We have a major partnership with the NHS delivering community wellbeing gardens and a partnership with the Natural History Museum supported by Department for Education to bring nature to schools across England.“All gardens at RHS Chelsea flower show live on to be community green spaces in places like hospitals and schools around the UK. The world-famous event also raises vital funds for the RHS to do community outreach as part of its national programme of community work.”In recent years, as well as showcasing the cutting edge garden design, the show has included a growing number of gardens focused on inclusivity, such as the ADHD foundation garden, which celebrated neurodiversity.It has also newly tapped into container and balcony gardens, in the understanding that some do not have access to a large plot of land.In 2022 Jason Williams, known as the Cloud Gardener, designed his balconyCirrus Gardento act, he said, “like a beacon of hope to anyone like myself who struggles with mental health and to show them that anything is possible”.Williams has just confirmed that he will be part of the presenting line up for the show this year.But Hayden-Smith says his efforts to get the charity to understand the lived experiences of people like him were met with resistance – and, on occasions, even hostility.“There’s many different layers of discomfort that I felt in the three years as an ambassador at the RHS,” Hayden-Smith said. “No one wants to feel like an annoyance or a nuisance under the guise of trying to do something positive.”He added: “It feels like there was kind of a need to protect Chelsea flower show as it is … I feel like it has become quite self-serving, and there’s this kind of status, and there’s this influence, and there’s this network that Chelsea flower show offers, that not many places do offer.”Explore more on these topicsChelsea flower showGardensCommunitiesLondonGrenfell Tower firenewsShareReuse this content"

The program will cost $318m over four years.The public transport minister, Gabrielle Williams, said it would save “many struggling families thousands of dollars a year”.“Cheaper school runs, cheaper weekends at the footy – and one less thing for families to worry about,” she said.In its 2025-26 budget, which the treasurer, Jaclyn Symes, will hand down on Tuesday, the government has also funded free weekend transport for seniors. Allan said it would save seniors more than $360 every year.Seniors card holders across the state can currently travel for free in neighbouring zones, but this move will expand to encompass the whole state.The 50% weekday discount will continue.“We’ve added hundreds more weekend services and now we’re making it free for seniors to travel on the weekend – making public transport an even better option, whether it’s for a trip to see family or to explore Victoria,” Williams said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most of that money – $4bn – is to start major works turning Sunshine station into a “superhub” connecting train lines, including a future airport line, while $727m is going to “switch on” the Metro Tunnel and $98.7m to boost service frequency on seven train lines.In a recent report, Infrastructure Victoria said barriers to using public transport included accessibility and frequency. People might not use public transport if they do not feel safe, the independent body said, and established suburbs have better access than newer developments.Its recommendations included faster bus services running more often, a new bus rapid transit network, more bus and coach services in the regions, and the extension and electrification of trains in the west.Ratings agencies including S&P Global Ratings class Victoria’s economic outlook as stable. The S&P analyst Rebecca Hrvatin said she expects debt to continue to rise, and forecast the government’s “hefty” infrastructure program would cost $23.5bn a year.“What we will be looking for in the next budget is the state’s commitment to controlling operating costs and stabilising debt levels,” she said.– with AAPExplore more on these topicsVictorian politicsVictoriaJacinta AllanTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

He said any unburnt stands of black sheoak were “of critical importance for the species”.A state government report intobiodiversity after the firesagreed that surviving black sheoak stands were of “great significance for this highly specialised bird species” and advised “great care” would be needed in managing the forests.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut conservation groups have expressed concern that the state’s forest fire management department plans to burn what they estimate is 13,000 hectares of the bird’s remaining habitat over the next three years.Gippsland Environment Group and the Victorian National Parks Association say the birds may never recover if the burns go ahead.View image in fullscreenLouise Crisp examines a fire-damaged sheoak grove near Lakes Entrance.Photograph: Lisa RobertsLouise Crisp, a founding member of the Gippsland organisation, said she was “horrified” that significant sheoak stands near Lake Tyers and Lakes Entrance were burned.“What they’re doing is burning the glossies’ pantry,” she said.Even a low-intensity fire could cause the cones to open and shed their seed, she said, which was a problem because the birds wouldn’t eat seed from the ground.“My biggest fear is that the population will not have a chance to recover from the incredible effects of the black summer bushfires because Forest Fire Management Victoria are continuing to burn their sole food resource.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA spokesperson for Forest Fire Management Victoria said uncontrollable fire was the greatest threat to cockatoo feeding habitat and low-intensity planned burns helped reduce fuel loads and protect sheoak trees.“Ensuring the protection of native wildlife and habitat in the short and long term is a key priority when implementing our planned burning program,” they said.Dr Daniella Teixeira, an ecologist who researches glossy black cockatoos at Queensland University of Technology and is chairing a species recovery team, said fires in sheoaks needed to be planned carefully to avoid areas where the birds were feeding, particularly if there were nest sites nearby. Fire that was too hot could kill the trees.The birds were “very fussy” about what they ate, she said, “even down to the individual trees”.Teixeira said the species was long-lived and slow to reproduce, laying a single egg every one or two years, and in decline across its range.BirdLife Australia’s president, Mandy Bamford, said Victoria’s glossy black cockatoo population was “tiny”, estimated at 250 birds. Those birds needed sheoaks to feed on and safe places to nest, she said, and BirdLife had worked with the department to map priority sites that needed protection.The department’s preferred burn window in autumn posed an additional risk, she said, as it overlapped with the bird’s breeding season. “If there are nestlings in hollows, they can’t get away. Also, potentially you’re reducing food sources at a critical time when they’re feeding chicks.”Concerns have been raised about Forest Fire Management Victoria activities after an endangeredgreater gliderwas found dead next to a tree-felling operation in Yarra Ranges national park in May 2024. Acritically endangered orchidreceived a last-minute reprieve from a planned burn last October after a local environment group threatened legal action to protect its habitat.Jordan Crook, a nature campaigner at the Victorian National Parks Association, said authorities had a duty to protect threatened species along with houses and infrastructure. He said fire management planning was happening “behind closed doors” without independent oversight.“We need to fundamentally change how we use fire in the landscape and manage bushfires,” he said. “The way we’re currently doing it is damaging our biodiversity and our wildlife habitat.”Explore more on these topicsVictoriaAustralian climate and environment in focusEndangered speciesTrees and forestsBushfiresConservationEnvironmental activismWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

In the last three years, it has improved the speed of its decision making, partly reversing some significant declines between 2019 and 2022.

No one was injured, and the man and woman involved were escorted from the venue.A spokesperson for Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR, which is organising the contest, said: “At the end of the Israeli performance, a man and a woman tried to get over a barrier on to the stage. They were stopped. One of the two agitators threw paint and a crew member was hit.“The crew member is fine and nobody was injured. The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police.”A spokesperson for Israeli broadcaster Kan said the protesters “were blocked by security officials but Raphael was shaken and upset”.“At the same time, a big anti-Israel protest takes place in the centre of Basel. Israeli national security council issued a warning to Israeli civilians in the city to keep a low profile,” he added.Raphaelfinished second to Austrian singer JJin the competition’s final, after winning the public vote.A spokesman for Basel police said: “The organiser handed the two people over to the police.

Travellers from the EU have continued to have access to UK e-gates, despite Brexit, without needing to have their passports stamped or checked by a border officer.An agreement enabling British travellers to use European e-gates could reduce airport queueing times considerably, particularly if it lifts the requirement for passport stamping.The EU is preparing to set up a new entry and exit system that will apply to British travellers in October. The scheme, which was meant to be launched in 2022 buthas been delayed several times, would replace passport stamping but would require British travellers to provide biometric data at the border, such as fingerprints and face scans. A separate EUtravel authorisation systemis also being developed, and is expected to be operational before the end of the year.The UK has already set up its own travel authorisation scheme for EU and other international travellers which came into force last month. Modelled on the system used by the US, it costs £16 and allows multiple visits to the UK of up to six months over a two-year period.Several other mobility-related issues are also under discussion by British and European negotiators ahead of Monday’s summit.‘I feel smug going in the short queue’: UK readers on getting EU passportsRead moreThe UK is eager to make it easier for musicians and other performing artists to tour in Europewithout undergoing an onerous visa process. The EU haslong pursued a youth mobility dealto allow young Europeans to temporarily live and work in the UK, and vice versa.The prime minister indicated this weekend that he was open to a youth mobility agreement. Ministers want any such scheme to be time-limited and capped, however, because of Labour’smanifesto commitment to reduce net migration.Visa barriers for touring artists are unlikely to be lifted on Monday but are expected to be among the issues the two sides agree to explore further.The two sides are also in talks over a veterinary agreement to reduce barriers for the farming and food industries. Downing Street said the deal would bring improvements for UK producers and supermarkets.It will be the third trade deal announced by the government in a fortnight, after the conclusion ofa multibillion-pound free trade agreement with Indiaanda deal to lift steel and aluminium tariffsand reduce car tariffs with the US.Speaking ahead of the EU summit, Starmer said an agreement with Brussels was “another step forward” for the UK and would “be good for our jobs, good for our bills and good for our borders”.“In this time of great uncertainty and volatility, the UK will not respond by turning inwards, but by proudly taking our place on the world stage – strengthening our alliances and closing deals in the interests of British people,” he said.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor,told the Guardian this weekendthat the deal would be a “step towards” a deeper and ongoing partnership with Europe. “I am ambitious for our future. This isn’t a one-off. There will be things that we achieve, some concrete outcomes on Monday, but there will also be a step towards where we want to go next,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAir transportEuropean UnionBrexitEuropeLabourKeir StarmerRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

The intensified bombing campaigns came as Israel’s total blockade on humanitarian aid has prompted fears of a famine in the Palestinian territory.“Since midnight, we have received 58 martyrs, while a large number of victims remain under the rubble. The situation inside the hospital is catastrophic,” said Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza early on Saturday. The death toll in the last 24 hours was at least 146, according to Reuters.View image in fullscreenIsraeli tanks and bulldozers on the border with Gaza.Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty ImagesThe escalation in attacks was condemned by the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday, who said the bombing campaign was meant to displace Palestinians and that it was equivalent to ethnic cleansing.Israel committing genocide in Gaza, says EU’s former top diplomatRead more“This latest barrage of bombs … and the denial of humanitarian assistance underline that there appears to be a push for a permanent demographic shift in Gaza that is in defiance of international law and is tantamount to ethnic cleansing,” he said.Turk’s comments were also echoed by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who called for a permanent ceasefire while speaking at an Arab League summit in Baghdad on Saturday.1:25'They kill us without warning': dozens killed in new Israeli Gaza offensive – videoIsrael said the bombardments were the initial phases of Operation Gideon’s Chariots, an expansion of the campaign in Gaza meant to “achieve all of the war goals in Gaza”. The strikes were accompanied by a large troop buildup along Gaza’s borders, aimed at establishing “operational control” of parts of Gaza.The campaign, as well as the aid blockade on the territory, was meant to forceHamasto release hostages, Israeli officials said. The terrorist organisation took about 250 hostages during its October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people. Fifty-seven hostages are still held by Hamas.The attacks came asDonald Trumpdeparted the Middle East after a four-day visit to Arab Gulf countries, during which Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar made pledges to invest billions in the US.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman mourning a family member.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHopes that Trump’s visit might bring renewed progress on truce talks in Gaza were dashed after the US president reiterated his desire to turn Gaza into a “freedom zone”. This was seen as a likely nod to his plan of the US assuming control over the Palestinian territory and turning it into the “riviera of the Middle East”.A January ceasefire broke down in mid-March after Israel refused to move to a scheduled second phase that could have led to ending the war. Prospects of a lasting truce seemed further away as Israel’s security cabinet approved plans in early May that could involve seizing the entire Gaza Strip.Gaza ceasefire talks were also expected to dominate the Arab League summit, where Arab officials met on Saturday. The Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, said that attending ministers would endorse a reconstruction plan for Gaza, a contrast to Trump’s offer to take over the Palestinian territory. Ministers later pledged $40m in reconstruction funds for Gaza and Lebanon.Later on Saturday Hamas confirmed a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks with Israel was under way in Qatar’s Doha. A group official, Taher al-Nono, told Reuters both sides were discussing all issues without “pre-conditions”.Israel’s offensive in Gaza, launched in retaliation for the October 2023 attacks, has killed about 53,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian health authorities.Widespread hunger and malnutrition among children have also soared, after Israel cut off vital humanitarian aid to the territory on 2 March. There is little medical care in Gaza, due to scarce supplies and repeated Israeli strikes on hospitals and medical facilities.View image in fullscreenInjured Palestinians are brought to al-Ahli Baptist hospital.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe UN aid chief, Tom Fletcher, urged a resumption of aid to Gaza in a speech to the UN security council on Tuesday, where he said famine loomed.Israel has consistently denied that its 10-week blockade is causing hunger in Gaza. However, Trump acknowledged on Thursday that “a lot of people are starving in Gaza”.Israel, which claims Hamas hijacks aid to fund its military, has proposed a plan to distribute aid from hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and guarded by Israeli troops. The US has backed the plan, and a body called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is set to begin carrying out the plan by the end of the month.Aid groups described the plan as unworkable and potentially unlawful as it could lead to forced displacement. They urged Israel to lift its blockade and to rely on the UN and other existing humanitarian bodies, which have long experience in transporting aid into Gaza.“We can save hundreds of thousands of survivors,” Fletcher said. “We have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians, and not to Hamas.”The European Council president, António Costa, said on Saturday: “Shocked by the news from Gaza: starving civilians, hospitals hit again by strikes. The violence must stop!”.Germany’s foreign ministry said on Saturday it is “deeply concerned” about the situation in Gaza, and that the offensive “could put the lives of the remaining hostages, including those of German hostages, in danger”.“A broad military offensive also risks worsening further the catastrophic humanitarian situation for Gaza’s population and the remaining hostages,” it added.On Saturday the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called for pressure to stop Israel’s “massacre in Gaza” and said Madrid plans a UN resolution requesting a world court ruling on aid access to the Palestinian territory.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaMiddle East peace talksHamasUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

With the sale of the US’s most advanced technology, he also sold the American model of the industry that made it: enormous amounts of power concentrated in the hands of a few men.The announcements poured in last week: the US and the United Arab Emiratesagreedon Abu Dhabi as the site of the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the US. The deal reportedly allows the UAE to import half a million Nvidia semiconductor chips, considered the most advanced in the world for the creation of artificial intelligence products. Saudi Arabia struck a similar deal for semiconductors, obtaining the promise of the sale of hundreds of thousands of Nvidia Blackwell chips to Humain, an AI startup owned by its sovereign wealth fund. Cisco said it had signed a deal with a UAE AI firm to develop the country’s AI sector. The agreements also directed some investment by Saudi firms into US technology and manufacturing. Amazon Web Services and Qualcomm likewise announced deals on cloud computing and cybersecurity.The agreements were remarkable for several reasons. Styling himself the broker-in-chief, Trump brought along an entourage of dozens of CEOs to the Middle East, including Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, OpenAI’sSam Altman, Elon Musk, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, Palantir’s Alex Karp and two dozen others.Those executives negotiated their deals face-to-face with Gulf country leaders. Many of those agreements broke with the policies of Joe Biden’s administration, which imposed strict controls on the sales of the US’s most cutting-edge technology. Biden forbade Nvidia and other chipmakers from selling their latest wares to Middle Eastern powers because of the latter’s links to China. Whether the Gulf states keep the tech for themselves as stipulated – the enormous datacenter is to be built by an Emirati company but managed by American ones – or proffer it to China in a geopolitical backroom deal remains to be seen.Despite the uncertainty that arose from some corners, the Trump White House put out three press releases that trumpeted how the president had “secured historic investment commitments” that total in the trillions from the three oil-rich nations. A section ofone fact sheetwas headlined: “Never tired of winning.”The deals stand to enrich the tech CEOs substantially by opening up new audiences for their products. These are the same men at the helm of AI development, and Trump’s use of them as surrogates seems likely to propagate the American model of technological power in new places.Also notable throughout the trip:Elon Muskdemonstrated he still wields considerable influence in the White House. The world’s richest person may have pivoted from the government cost-cutting project of Doge, but there he was, beside the president once again.Musk’s presence on the trip had less to do with AI than Altman’s or Huang’s, though. His value to the president’s dealmaking was his power over global internet connectivity. Starlink, the satellite internet division within Musk’s SpaceX that controls more than half the satellites orbiting Earth, inked an agreement for maritime and aviation use inSaudi Arabia. There he goes again: his Tesla Optimus robots performed a dance for Trump and the Saudi crown prince to the tune of YMCA.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpArtificial intelligence (AI)Saudi ArabiaQatarUnited Arab EmiratesTrump administrationSam AltmananalysisShareReuse this content"

His family’s wealth has ballooned by more than $3bn, according to press estimates, and the reported benefits fromcryptocurrenciesand other investment deals such as plans for new Trump-branded family properties may be far larger. Deals for billions more have been inked by business associates close to Trump, meaning that their political support for the White House can translate into lucrative contracts abroad.US and Qatar sign defense and aviation deal as Trump doubles down on luxury aircraft giftRead more“When we’re negotiating with other countries, the concern is that our negotiating position will change if someone does a favor or delivers a gift to the president of the United States,” Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the administration of George W Bush, said.“Whether it’s trying to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war, or the Middle East or anything else. You know the the impression is given that the position of the United States can be swayed and even bought.”Others argue that the message being sent by the White House is that American foreign policy is being sold to the highest bidder.View image in fullscreenA Boeing plane similar to the one Qatar offered to the US defense department.Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP“Trump has put a for-sale sign out front of the White House,” said Norm Eisen, the executive director of the legal advocacy group State Democracy Defenders Fund and a White House “ethics czar” and ambassador to the Czech Republic under Barack Obama. “Of course you’re going to see Qatar and UAE as like a bidding war. Qatar says: ‘I’ll give you a $400m plane,’ and the UAE says: ‘Hold my beer,I’ll give your crypto company $2bn.’”In a particularly eye-catching incident this week, Qatar offered to give the US Department of Defense a$400m Boeing 747-8that Trump had suggested could be used as Air Force One and then passed on to his presidential library after he leaves office.The plane has become a lightning rod among US Democrats, and critics have argued it violates the emoluments clause of the constitution that prohibits the president from receiving gifts from foreign entities.Trump had called the plane a “great gesture” from Qatar and said that it would be “stupid” for him not to accept the gift. A Democratic lawmaker had called the plane a “flying palace”, andeven diehard Maga supporterssuch as the commentators Laura Loomer and Ben Shapiro have criticised it publicly.2:59Trump in the Middle East: investments, end of Syria sanctions and a potential Iran deal – videoPainter suggested that it would be similar to King George III gifting George Washington a copy of the royal stagecoach for his use in office. “You think the founders wouldn’t have considered that a bribe?” he said.Trump 2.0 takes quid pro quo fears to new heights with $400m flying griftRead moreBut Gulf states have offered other incentives, including a$2bn investmentfrom a UAE-controlled funds into a Trump-linked stablecoin that could incentivise the president to shape foreign policy in favour of Abu Dhabi.An advisory sent to congressional Democrats this week and seen by the Guardian said: “President Trump and the Trump family have moved at breakneck speed to profit from a massive crypto scam on the American people.”The gifts, and in particular the potential gift of a jet, have led to a series of denunciations on Capitol Hill as they seek to build momentum for a legislative push.“This isn’t America first. This is not what he promised the American people. This is Trump first,” said Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut. “He is willing to put our nation’s security at risk, take unconstitutional bribes, just so he can fly himself and his Mar-a-Lago golf buddies around the world in gold-plated luxury planes gifted to him by foreign governments.”But is it illegal? AsQatarwould give the jet to the Department of Defense, some experts have said that it may not directly violate the emoluments clause or other laws, even if Trump were to make use of the plane while in office.“Never seen it before,” said Scott Amey, the general counsel of the Project On Government Oversight, a non-profit government watchdog group based in Washington. “Is it allowed? I’m still uncertain.”Past administrations would have run from the perceived conflicts of interest being welcomed by Trump. The former White House ethics advisers described crises such as when a Gulf state tried to present a Rolex to a national security adviser, or when the Boston Red Sox tried to gift the White House chief of staff a baseball bat signed by all the players (the addressee was forced to pay its estimated market value, said Painter). Eisen said that he forbade Obama from even refinancing the mortgage on his house in Chicago because of his capacities to influence the market.“The status quo has been saying no, because it’s an actual and apparent conflict of interest, and it could jeopardize our domestic and foreign policies,” said Amey. ”It certainly doesn’t pass the sniff test for a lot of Americans.”The lavish gifts and other investments come as Trump is reshaping America’s policy in the Middle East, skipping Israel and turning toward the Gulf states in a flurry of deal-making that could benefit both sides handsomely. And Trump’s family and other advisers, such as Steve Witkoff, with interests in the Gulf states are closely involved.View image in fullscreenTrump receives the Order of Zayed from the UAE president.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images“When the firstTrump administrationcame in, I saw that people in the Gulf said, ‘Finally, an American administration we understand. He sends us his son-in-law to talk to us,’” said Dr F Gregory Gause III of the Middle East Institute, a former professor of international affairs at the Bush School. “It’s a startling change in American norms … the notion that Trump family private business and US government business walk hand in hand is remarkable.”While potential gifts like a jet cannot be hidden, the potential to move billions of dollars in cryptocurrency secretly has watchdogs, the political opposition and other foreign observers deeply concerned. “We’re talking about billions of dollars, almost infinite money, that can be paid by anyone,” said one senior European diplomat. One little-known China-linked firm with no revenue last year bought $300m of a Trump meme coin this week, raising further concerns of dark foreign money moving intoUS politics.Chuck Schumer says he’ll obstruct Trump’s justice department picks over Qatar jet giftRead moreSenate Democrats have called for rewriting the Genius Act, Trump-backed legislation that they say would provide for far-too-lax regulation of so-called stablecoins, in order to ban him from benefiting. “If Congress is going to supercharge the use of stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, it must include safeguards that make it harder for criminals, terrorists, and foreign adversaries to exploit the financial system and put our national security at risk,” said the memo.The flood of foreign money has left former officials who used to carefully track the giving of gifts and other goods from foreign government infuriated.The rules can be “annoying and sort of stupid, but it is what separates the good guys from the bad guys, as it relates to corruption and good governance”, said Rufus Gifford, a former head of protocol for the state department, which also tracks gifts to US officials from foreign governments. “And I think that Trump just has no respect for those institutions that have been set up for a very specific purpose, which is to root out corruption.“It is very, very disturbing that a president of the United States could be in a position to profit off the office in which he holds,” he continued. “And that is, again, something that is never supposed to be able to happen. And it’s really quite extraordinary.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaQatarUnited Arab EmiratesSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

But the growing British view is that France – a country that has debated recognition for more than a decade – will decide the conditions are not ripe.The UK has for years said it will recognise a Palestinian state, but only at the point of maximum impact, without defining that moment any further.But British officials admit anger at the Israeli blockade of aid intoGaza, and backbench Labour MPs’ frustration with their party’s response in government is putting pressure on the Foreign Office to back an initiative.The UK Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, was forced in the Commons this week to defend claims by government lawyers in the high court thatthere is no genocide in Gaza, or that women and children were being targeted by Israel. Edward Leigh, father of the house and a Conservative, asked Falconer if he was “aware that many friends of Israel worldwide, notwithstanding narrow legal definitions, are asking this moral question: when is genocide not genocide?”A Palestinian human rights group, Al-Haq, is seeking a judicial review that the government has acted unlawfully in continuing to supply components and spares for F-35 fighter jets to a global pool that can then be transferred to Israel in Gaza.A Ministry of Defence official in a heavily redacted 11-page submission discussed in closed court on Friday, claimed the F35 jet fighter programme is largely owned by the US government and consensus is required for approval to be given to any UK request that its parts are not transferred to Israel.Labour defends its Palestine policy by pointing to September’s suspension of arms exports to Israel for use in Gaza. But figures released on Thursday showedthe government approved $169m worth of military equipment to Israelin the three months that followed the Labour government’s partial suspension. The export data show that 20 different licences in categories such as military aircraft, radars, targeting equipment and explosive devices were approved between October and December 2024.Arms campaigners say the three-month total is more than what was approved altogether under the Tory government between 2020 and 2023.The business department said: “The majority of military licences by value approved in 2024 is made up of components for items being produced in Israel for third countries, including our Nato allies, and we continue to assess all licence applications on a case-by-case basis against our strict criteria.”The controversy is relevant to Britain’s recognition of Palestine in that ministers are now under political pressure to point to practical steps being taken to show disapproval of the methods Israel is using to eliminate Hamas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The General Assembly resolution passed in September 2024 set a 12-month “deadline” for action to be taken on the ICJ ruling.France has a long history dating back to the former president François Hollande of suggesting that it is on the brink of recognising Palestine, but in the end has always pulled back, arguing the timing was not right, or there was a lack of international diplomatic consensus.Macron in April said: “We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the coming months […] I also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must also allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do.”Michel Duclos, senior fellow at the Institut Montaigne, said: “My impression is that there are as many opinions on recognition as there are advisers to the president. But if the president has to wait for Saudi Arabia to recognise Israel, it is clear from the Trump visit to the Gulf, he will have to wait for a long time.”The formal aim of the UN conference is to “urgently chart an irreversible pathway towards the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution”.If Macron requires Saudi recognition of Israel as a quid pro quo for his recognition of Palestine, it is unlikely to happen in June without at minimum a permanent ceasefire. The Saudi foreign ministry this week again accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, and normalisation remains off its agenda.WithinEurope, only Spain, Ireland, Sweden, Slovenia and Norway have recognised Palestine. The US last vetoed full recognition of Palestine at the UN in April 2024. The UK abstained and France backed the move.A group of French politicians and academics in an article in Le Monde this week argued recognition was a “moral imperative, a political necessity, a strategic requirement” and the only way for France to escape “an untenable diplomatic paradox” in proclaiming its commitment to the two-state solution while refusing to recognise one of them.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeDavid LammyUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The blaze was reported to police by firefighters in the early hours of Monday. Police said damage was caused to the property’s entrance but nobody was hurt.A car that Starmer had sold to a neighbour last year was set alight four days earlier on the same street.On 11 May, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of a house where the Labour leader is understood to have lived in the 1990s before it was converted into flats. One person was helped to safety by firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, the London fire brigade said.Anyone with information that could assist the investigation has been asked to contact the Met.A 21-year-old man, Roman Lavrynovych, has already been charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life and appeared in court on Friday.The Ukrainian national was remanded in custody after appearing at Westminster magistrates court. He did not enter any pleas to the charges.Lavrynovych will appear next at the Old Bailey for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 6 June.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts say this is “flawed” advice because many ultra-processed foods still meet the definition of “healthier”, including some energy drinks, crisps, snacks, cereal bars, pizzas, burgers and ice-creams.The U-turn, revealed for the first time, occurred on 1 June 2023 under Rishi Sunak’s government, the Guardian found.The change remainsin the current government’s guidance being issued to retailers ahead of the law change in October.It came after the FDF waged a campaign to put pressure on the DHSC to rewrite its nutrition policy, lobbying officials to remove the push to minimally processed food in the guidance issued to retailers, according to documents and emails reviewed by the Guardian.In response to a freedom of information request, the government released a cache of emails between the FDF and the DHSC.Most of the correspondence was heavily redacted. The government cited section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act, “which provides for the protection of personal information”, and section 35(1)(a), “which provides protection for the information that relates to the formulation or development of government policy”.The emails, sent between October 2022 and April 2023, reveal how the FDF, which represents firms with a combined annual turnover of more than £112bn, lobbied the DHSC to drop the guidance pushing retailers to promote minimally processed food.Email from [redacted], 2 October2022View image in fullscreenEmail from [redacted], 2 October 2022“This is a real bone of contention with the companies … Please can you give me a date when this will be deleted from the guidance?”“I see the promotions guidance was re-issued on Friday to reflect the new implementation date of the volume-based promotions,” an FDF official wrote in an email to a DHSC official on 2 October 2022. “My understanding was that when the guidance was updated the reference to the aim of the policy being to shift choices to ‘minimal [SIC] processed foods’ would be removed but it’s still there.”“This is a real bone of contention with the companies,” the FDF official added. “Please can you give me a date when this will be deleted from the guidance?”Four days later, on 6 October 2022, the FDF official emailed the DHSC official again. “It would be great to understand when this change is going to happen. Clearly the policy and guidance is live and as discussed before, we consider this reads that government policy is that processed foods are inherently unhealthy, not something we agree with or believe the scientific evidence supports.”Email from [redacted], 6 October2022View image in fullscreenEmail from [redacted], 6 October 2022“I had thought we had agreement that this change would happen, and whilst I appreciate you don’t want to keep re-opening guidance documents, this discussion was several months ago now.”The FDF official said: “I had thought we had agreement that this change would happen, and whilst I appreciate you don’t want to keep re-opening guidance documents, this discussion was several months ago now.”In an email to DHSC officials on 23 November 2023, an FDF official wrote: “Please do also let us know as soon as possible when you have clarified next steps for removing the reference to ‘minimally processed’ from the promotions guidance – as mentioned on the call, this is a particularly contentious issue for our members.”Email from [redacted], 23 November2022View image in fullscreenEmail from [redacted], 23 November 2022“Please do also let us know as soon as possible when you have clarified next steps for removing the reference to ‘minimally processed’ from the promotions guidance – as mentioned on the call, this is a particularly contentious issue for our members.”On 3 January 2023, the FDF was told the advice to promote minimally processed food would be deleted from the guidance issued to retailers, the emails show.Email from [redacted], 3 January2023View image in fullscreenEmail from [redacted], 3 January 2023“I can confirm that as part of these changes, we intend to remove the wording ‘such as minimally processed and nutritious food’.”“We are considering a number of changes to the HFSS promotions implementation guidance as minor points of clarification and will update on these in due course,” an email to an FDF official said. “I can confirm that as part of these changes, we intend to remove the wording ‘such as minimally processed and nutritious food’.”View image in fullscreenBefore and after Gov.ukThere is no longer any reference to either term in the current version of the document,which remains liveon the government’s website.Cathy Cliff, campaigns coordinator at the Soil Association, provided the emails to the Guardian after obtaining them under freedom of information laws. “This move to block discounts on healthy foods is clearly one that benefits the profits of UPF manufacturers more than the health of their consumers,” she said.After the guidance was dropped, the FDF boasted about its lobbying success, hailing the victory in a “key wins” section of its website, the Guardian found.“The FDF’s engagement with Department of Health and Social Care officials … resulted in the removal of the reference to ‘minimally processed’ in the HFSS promotions guidance.”The FDF also said it had successfully lobbied to stop ultra-processed food being mentioned in separate legislation in Scotland. “FDF Scotland’s engagement with the Scottish government ensured the prevention of the term ‘ultra-processed food’ [UPF] being used in the good food nation bill.”The page has since been deleted from the FDF website. It now reads “sorry, page not found”.View image in fullscreenBefore and after FDFHalf the average diet of Britons now consists of ultra-processed food (UPF). For some, especially those who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical.All food is processed to some degree, and processing can be necessary and beneficial. But UPF is different. It is often high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) but also engineered and marketed in ways that cause excess consumption, fuelling the obesity crisis, which costs the NHS more than £11bn a year.Last montha study foundthat consuming large amounts of UPF increases the risk of an early death. It is so damaging to health that it is implicated in as many as one in seven of all premature deaths, including at least 17,000 every year in England.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This change took place under the previous government. This government is committed to tackling obesity and building a healthier Britain.“We are taking action to end the targeting of junk food adverts to children across TV and online and we have handed local authorities stronger powers to block applications for takeaways near schools. We are also commissioning research to improve the evidence on the health impacts of UPF.”A Scottish government spokesperson said: “The good food nation bill was framework legislation, the term ‘ultra processed food’ was therefore not omitted, as it was agreed that the bill would not include reference to specific policies.”An FDF spokesperson said: “FDF regularly engages with government on behalf of food and drink manufacturers, on regulation that underpins nutrition, food safety and food security; as well as on how we play our part in helping people follow healthier diets.“In the instance cited, we asked the government to phrase their business guidance on new HFSS regulations in a way that was consistent with that legislation. We were concerned that references to processing in the guidance, which was not covered in the legislation, would cause confusion.”Do you have information about this story?

They were arrested on Saturday 3 May.Sepahvand was also charged with engaging in conduct; surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research, intending to commit serious violence against a person in the UK.Manesh and Noori have also been charged with engaging in surveillance and reconnaissance, with the intention of committing serious violence against a person in the UK.Another man, arrested on Friday 9 May under the National Security Act, was released without charge on Thursday.They were remanded into custody and will appear for a preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey on 6 June.The district judge Annabel Pilling told the defendants: “I’m sending your case to the central criminal court.“There will be a trial in due course before a judge and jury if you plead not guilty.“The next stage will be a preliminary hearing before the specialist judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb on 6 June.”The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said Iran must be “held to account for its actions”.Cooper said: “I want to thank the police and security services for their continuing work on this very serious investigation, and for their immense dedication to protecting our national security and the safety of our communities.“The charges that have been laid against these three individuals must now take their course through the criminal justice system, and nothing must be done to prejudice the outcome of those proceedings.“But we will also take separate action to address the very serious wider issues raised by this case. The police have confirmed that the foreign state to which these charges relate is Iran, and Iran must be held to account for its actions.“We must also strengthen our powers to protect our national security as we will not tolerate growing state threats on our soil.“Protecting national security is the first duty of government. The police and security services have our continued support in their vital work, and we will take whatever action is needed to tackle the complex threats we face and keep our country and our people safe.”Cmdr Dominic Murphy, from the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said: “These are extremely serious charges under the National Security Act, which have come about following what has been a very complex and fast-moving investigation.“Since the men were arrested two weeks ago, detectives have been working around the clock, and we have worked closely with colleagues in the CPS to reach this point. We have been in contact with the individuals directly affected, and we continue to provide them with support.“Now that these men have been charged I would urge people not to speculate about this case, so that the criminal justice process can run its course.”Frank Ferguson, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service’s special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: “Following a review of the evidence provided by the Metropolitan police service’s counter terrorism command, we have authorised criminal charges against three Iranian nationals.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve never really seen the investment we were promised.”His partner, Sarah, went further, accusing successive governments of a “betrayal”. Money that she believed had been saved by exiting the EU should have been channelled into improving it and other public services, she said.View image in fullscreenGrays, on north bank of the Thames, is close to Tilbury docks, part of the Thames freeport.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianSuch sentiments were not hard to find behind the bustle of Friday market day in Grays, nestled on the north bank of the Thames, a short drive and even shorter train ride from Tilbury docks, part of the Thames freeport.In the period before the EU referendum,Thurrock recordedthe lowest levels of life satisfaction of any place in the UK, while hostility towards immigration was tapped into first by the BNP and later Ukip.With similar messaging,Reform UKis now eyeing its electoral prospects here, where it came second in last year’s general election. But for the postponement of local elections, it could also well have added the Thurrock council – declared in effect bankrupt in 2022 – to the list of those it won on 1 May.'It's one big cesspit here': Thurrock, the country's capital of miseryRead moreYet economic green shoots have emerged, not least in Tilbury, where plans were submitted last week to expand the thriving port by as much as 40 hectares (100 acres).“Thurrock is very much like a red wall seat. It just happens to be in the south rather than the north,” said Jackie Doyle-Price, who was the local Conservative MP from 2010 until last year, when Jen Craft won the seat back forLabour, which had held it for most of the period after the second world war.“It’s close to London, but Brexit was still an opportunity for those who felt politics was leaving them behind to voice their dissatisfaction,” Doyle-Price said. “People have moved on from the vote in many ways, but one thing which really cut through during the referendum campaign – the immigration debate – has got worse. What was promised hasn’t materialised, because immigration has continued to remain high.”View image in fullscreenHassan Naeen said Grays had a ‘good community’ and praised the government’s plans to toughen immigration policy.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThose shifts in demographics are vividly illustrated by the changing face of Grays’ high street, where a diverse range of new restaurants, food stores and other retailers have arrived over the past decade.Those newcomers included Hassan Naeen, who was optimistic about the town’s future since establishing Sabina, a supermarket selling hair and body products to African-Caribbean customers and others.“There’s a good community here, and we have been promised that regeneration of the town is coming,” he said. As for the question of potential tensions over immigration, he had praise for the government’s plans to toughen policy.UK-EU summit will be step on path to better relations, says Rachel ReevesRead moreAt a west African restaurant next door, there was a candid if careful reflection from Father Paschal Uche as he fetched lunch with a fellow Catholic priest, Tochukwu Okonkwo.“It shouldn’t be overstated but sometimes you see divides that might be there even within our community.

As with elsewhere, it was an ‘up yours to the government’ and I think they would do it again.“Keir Starmer might be right to the extent Brexit is in the past for them, but the reality is that they’re struggling. There’s a thing called the ‘Thurrock shrug’, and it’s where people go ‘yeah, whatever’ because they always feel let down by government.“There are such great opportunities, whether it’s the ports expansion locally or the direction the economy hopefully is going, but people need to be brought along.

Speaking while on a trip to Albania, Starmer said: “We took difficult decisions, but the right decisions, at the budget, including the decision that we took on winter fuel.”“We are now seeing the benefits of that in the interest rate cuts and the growth figures. They were difficult decisions but the right decisions.”Simon Francis, the coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said that “any U-turn is welcome, but what matters now is the detail, especially if winter fuel payments are not restored to all pensioners.“We need to see the pension credit threshold raised significantly, a taper system introduced to stop people missing out on winter fuel payments for being just £1 over the line, and wider targeting of this support, including for those on non-means-tested disability benefits or carer’s allowance. Above all, ministers must learn lessons from this scandalous decision.”Nigel Farage’sReform UKparty, which won the Runcorn and Helsby byelection and 677 council seats this month, has pledged to reverse the cut.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Morgan said last week that voters were “very frustrated” by the cut and that “it’s the number one issue that comes up on the doorstep” in Wales.Any change to the policy could be announced as soon as next month, with Reeves due to deliver a spending review on 11 June.Meanwhile, Starmer is facing the biggest rebellion of his premiership next month over separate cuts to disability benefits, with dozens of MPswarning last weekthat they were “impossible to support”.Explore more on these topicsBenefitsOlder peopleRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourFuel povertyNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

At least nine of those were reported after a tornado sparked what authorities called a mass casualty event in south-eastern Kentucky.The storms were part of a weather system on Friday that killed seven people inMissouriand spawned more than two dozen tornadoes in Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana, left several hundred thousand customers without power in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heatwave to Texas.Authorities inKentuckysaid there were also severe injuries when a twister tore across Laurel county late on Friday.“The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,” the office of sheriff John Root said in a statement posted on social media.April storms that killed 24 in US made more severe by burning fossil fuels – studyRead moreGilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, said rescuers had “been on the ground all night looking for possible survivors. That’s what we’re continuing to do.”Beshear said his office would release more information as soon as it became available.“We know this is a tragic event,” he said in a statement.In Laurel county, the tornado hit shortly before midnight.“Lives have been changed forever here tonight. This is a time we come together, and we pray for this community,” Randall Weddle, the mayor of London, told WKYT-TV. “I have never personally witnessed what I’ve witnessed here tonight. There’s a lot of devastation.”The mayor of St Louis, Missouri, Cara Spencer,confirmedfive deaths in her city and said more than 5,000 homes had been affected.The mayor of St Louis described the toll of storm damage in her city on Saturday.“This is truly, truly devastating,” she said, adding that the city was in the process of declaring an emergency and an overnight curfew on Friday had been put into place in the neighborhoods with the most damage.The number of people injured was not immediately known. The Barnes-Jewish hospital received 20 to 30 patients from the storm with some in serious condition and most expected to be discharged by Friday night, according to hospital spokesperson Laura High.The St Louis children’s hospital received 15 patients with two of them expected to remain in the hospital into the weekend, she said.National Weather Service (NWS) radar indicated a tornado touched down between 2.30pm and 2.50pm in Clayton,Missouri, in the St Louis area. The apparent tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, home to the St Louis zoo and the site of the 1904 World’s Fair and Olympic Games the same year.At the Centennial Christian church, St Louis fire department battalion chief William Pollihan told the Associated Press that three people had had to be rescued after part of the church crumbled. One of those people died.Stacy Clark said his mother-in-law, Patricia Penelton, had died in the church. He described her as a very active church volunteer who had many roles, including being part of the choir.Jeffrey Simmons Sr, who lives across from the church, heard an alert on his phone before the lights went out.“And next thing you know, a lot of noise, heavy wind,” he said. He and his brother sheltered in the basement. Later, he realized it had been worse than he’d thought, saying: “Everything was tore up.”Downed trees and stoplights also caused traffic gridlock during the Friday afternoon commute, and officials urged people to stay home.John Randle, a 19-year-old University of Missouri-St Louis student, said he and his girlfriend had been at the St Louis art museum during the storm and were hustled into the basement with about 150 other people.“You could see the doors flying open, tree branches flying by and people running,” he said. “A lot of people were caught outside.”Christy Childs, a St Louis zoo spokesperson, said in a text that the zoo would remain closed on Saturday due to downed trees and other damage. Childs said all animals were safe and that there were no reports of significant injuries to staff, guests or animals.A tornado struck in Scott county, about 130 miles (209km) south of St Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying multiple homes, sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media.Explore more on these topicsKentuckyMissouriTornadoesWisconsinTexasExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The person killed was near the vehicle that had been blown to pieces outside the clinic, operated by American Reproductive Centers (ARC), Davis said.The bomb, which detonated before 11am, was either in or near a car parked outside the clinic when it exploded, said mayor Ron deHarte of Palm Springs.“Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,” Davis said. He did not comment on the relationship - if any - between the victim and the person of interest in the investigation.Aerial images of the damage to the facilityshowedthe burned-out remains of a vehicle in a parking lot behind the clinic.Despite damage to the building, ARC said the facility would be fully operational on Monday.View image in fullscreenDebris after a bomb exploded in Palm Springs on Saturday.Photograph: ABC affiliate KABC/ReutersThe Desert Sun reported that the explosion could be felt as far as 2 miles (3km) away after it occurred by the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic.The US attorney Bill Essayli of the central district of California weighed in on the explosion,saying on X: “We are aware of the explosion that occurred this morning in Palm Springs.

The president has repeatedly cited a death toll for the conflict that ismuch higherthan any official figures, orestimates based on an open-source investigation, without explaining why.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to a state-run Russian news agency that preparations were under way for a call between the US and Russian presidents.‘Very disturbing’: Trump receipt of overseas gifts unprecedented, experts warnRead moreTrump’s call with the Russian president will be followed by a separate conversation with Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s leader, and Nato leaders as part of the US effort to end the war that has raged since the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. “HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump wrote.Russia and Ukraine have just concluded mostly fruitless talks, the first of their kind since the start of the war, in Istanbul. Ukraine said it was ready for a ceasefire but was faced by “unacceptable” demands from Russia, which attempted to fully invade its neighbor and has occupied the eastern flank of the country.It’s unclear what kind of progress Trump will be able to spur, if any, in the peace process. The US president has been heavily critical of Ukraine, freezing military aid and having an infamous argument with Zelenskyy at the White House in full view of the media, before appearing to soften after a face-to-face conversation at the funeral of Pope Francis in the Vatican.Trump had offered to travel to Turkey for the talks after his trip to the Middle East last week if Putin would also attend, and urged Zelenskyy to go, but Putin sent a team of low-level negotiators instead.Trump’s ire with Ukraine’s president does not seem to have abated, however, with the president telling Fox News on Friday he is upset with what the country has done with the aid handed to it by the US. “What bothered me, I hated to see the way it was, you know, excuse me, pissed away,” he said.“I think he’s the greatest salesman in the world. Far better than me,” Trump said of the Ukrainian president. “Where is all this money going?”Ina social media postof his own, Zelenskyy mourned the death of nine civilians in “a Russian drone strike on an ordinary passenger bus”. He added: “Yesterday, as on any other day of this war, there was an opportunity to cease fire. Ukraine has long been offering this – a full and unconditional ceasefire in order to save lives.

They scaled a fence, using blankets to avoid being cut by barbed wire, after which some could be seen sprinting across the nearby interstate and into a neighborhood.A photograph obtained by numerous news outlets, including the Guardian, showed the opening the men escaped through after a toilet in a cell had been removed. Above the hole were scrawled messages that included profanities: “To Easy LoL” with an arrow pointing at the gap, and “catch us when you can”.The absence of the 10 men, who also utilized facility deficiencies that officials have long complained about, went unnoticed for hours. It was not until a routine morning headcount, more than seven hours later, that law enforcement learned of the escape.View image in fullscreenThe hole in the wall from which the men escaped.Photograph: Provided to the GuardianOfficials from the sheriff’s office say no deputy had been at the pod where the fugitives were being held. There was a technician – a civilian employee of the jail rather than one of the sheriff’s office’s sworn deputies – there to observe the pod, but she had stepped away to get food, they said.Soon after the escape, attempted murder suspect Kendall Myles, 20, was apprehended after a brief foot chase through the French Quarter. He had previously escaped twice from juvenile detention centers.By Friday evening, two more fugitives had been captured. Officials found battery suspect Robert Moody, 21, inNew Orleans’ Central City section thanks to a Crimestoppers tip, according to the Orleans parish sheriff’s office, which runs the jail. Dkenan Dennis, an armed robbery suspect, was found near an eastern New Orleans highway, the Louisiana attorney general, Liz Murrill, announced on the social media platform X.The Orleans parish sheriff, Susan Hutson, said the men were able to get out of the Orleans Justice Center because of “defective locks”. Hutson said she has continuously raised concerns about the locks to officials and, as recently as this week, advocated for money to fix the ailing infrastructure.Hutson said there are indications that people inside her department helped the fugitives escape.“It’s almost impossible, not completely, but almost impossible for anybody to get out of this facility without help,” she said of the jail, where 1,400 people are being held.The escapees yanked open a door to enter the cell with the hole at about 1am Friday.At least one of the steel bars protecting plumbing fixtures “appeared to have been intentionally cut using a tool”, according to a statement from the Orleans sheriff’s office on Friday night.The men shed their jail uniforms once out of the facility, and it is still unclear how some of them obtained regular clothing so quickly, officials said.Three sheriff’s employees have been placed on suspension pending the outcome of the investigation. It was not immediately clear whether any of the employees were suspected of helping with the escape. Officials also didn’t say whether the technician who left to get food was among the three suspended.The escapees range in age from 19 to 42. Most are in their 20s.One of the fugitives, 27-year-old Derrick Groves, was convicted on two charges of second-degree murder and two charges of attempted second-degree murder at a trial in October for his role in a deadly quadruple shooting on Fat Tuesday in 2018. He also pleaded guilty to two charges of manslaughter in connection with a double killing in 2017, and an unrelated charge of battery of a correctional facility employee filed against him in April 2024.Murder convictions in Louisiana carry mandatory life imprisonment. But Groves remained at New Orleans’ jail rather than at a state prison after his attorney was suspended from practicing law and there were post-conviction proceedings related to his double-murder trial pending against him.Law enforcement warned that Groves may attempt to locate witnesses in the murder trial.Two others – Jermaine Donald, 42, and Corey Boyd, 19 – had been jailed on charges of murder. Leo Tate, 31, had previously faced murder charges that were dismissed as part of a plea deal.Gary Price, 21, is charged with attempted murder.Hutson said the police department was actively working with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to search for the fugitives.The sheriff said the jail she runs is about 60% staffed and thus staff are “stretched thin”.Hutson is facing re-election in October. And at least one of Hutson’s opponents, the former interim New Orleans police superintendent Michelle Woodfork, demanded she answer questions about the escape.The New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams appointed Woodfork to a position in his office last year and said Friday’s escapes represented “a complete failure of the most basic responsibilities entrusted to a sheriff or jail administrator”.According to Hutson, her agency had “indication” that those who escaped “received assistance … from individuals inside of our department”, USA Todayreported.Hutson added that a jail employee saw the men escape through surveillance footage but did not notify authorities.Photos shared by the Louisiana state police on Saturday morningshowedthe three escapees who were caught on Friday being flown out of New Orleans by helicopter to a state prison.“During the transfer, one of the inmates exhibited hostile behavior, requiring troopers to use a spit hood to ensure their safety,” the state police’s social media account said.In response, the Louisiana governor, Jeff Landry,wroteon social media: “Great work by Louisiana state police and assisting law enforcement agencies. The job is NOT finished!”The FBI hasoffereda reward of up to $5,000 for tips leading to the arrest of the escapees.Maya Yangandthe Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew OrleansUS policingUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Hur, who investigated Biden’s handling of classified material, subsequently described the then president as a “sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory” in his final report, which recommended against charging Biden with any sort of crime.Biden destroyed Harris bid by staying in race too long, top adviser says in bookRead moreAwritten transcript of the five-hour interview was released last year. But the newly released audio provides some context for Biden’s struggle to recall certain facts.At the time, White House officials strongly denied that Biden was impaired in his ability to do his job as president, with allies continuing to back Biden until a disastrous debate with Trump in June 2024 resulted in mounting pressure for him to step aside as the Democratic candidate. He did so in favor of his vice-president, Kamala Harris, a month later.Polling at the time showed that many Americans considered Biden, at the time 81 years old, to be too old to run again as president. Though he had beaten Trump in 2020, Biden’s decision to try to run against him again, with Trump just three years younger than him, has come under intensifying scrutiny.At the release of Hur’s report, Biden and his allies reacted angrily to its claims. “There’s even a reference that I don’t remember when my son died,” Biden said last year. “How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their damn business.”The audio also includes Biden talking about how Barack Obama – whom he served as vice-president – didn’t want him to run for the White House in 2016 due to the belief that Hillary Clinton “had a better shot of winning the presidency than I did”. There were also deviations to ponder the influence of the Gutenberg printing press and the experience of driving a Corvette with the comedian Jay Leno.Trump repeatedly mocked Biden’s age and gaffes before going on to defeat Harris in last year’s election.However, the current president has also had lapses of his own, appearing to confuse E Jean Carroll, who accused him of sexual abuse and was awarded damages, with his ex-wife Marla Maples when shown a photograph during a deposition. He also claimed that the audience “went crazy” during his televised debate with Harris last year (there was no audience whatsoever in the room).Trump has also continued his habit of delivering discursive speeches littered with multiple untruths and gross exaggerations while president and has even been accused of falling asleep during events, although the White House has denied these claims.On Friday, Trump further raised eyebrows when he referenced the most notorious racial epithet when discussing the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed countries, with Fox News.“It was getting deeper and more, I mean, more missiles,” Trump said. “Everyone was stronger, stronger, to a point where the next ones are going to be you know what: the N-word.”“You know what the N-word is, right?” he asked host Brett Baier, who replied: “nuclear”. Trump said “yeah”, and both men laughed over the exchange.Explore more on these topicsJoe BidenUS elections 2024Donald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The chapter lasted 40 days.The page has already been turned. But the impact of those six chaotic weeks, fromhigher pricestoslowing growth, is still unfolding – and the US president is alreadythreatening further adjustments. The story continues.Trump had been steered away from his aggressive instincts on trade during his first term, and persuaded to walk back several tariff threats in the opening months of his second. But back in early April, he was determined to plough ahead.“April 2nd, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump declared at an event in the White House Rose Garden, before an audience of his top officials and supporters.The measures were blunt and severe: a blanket 10% tariff on all imported goods, and higher individualized rates,of up to 50%, on dozens of markets – those of economic allies and rivals alike – deemed to have treated the US poorly on trade.‘Be cool’First came the questions. How exactly did the Trump administration come up with such an array of specific duties to impose upon goods from so many countries and territories? And why was agroup of barren, uninhabited islands near Antarcticaamong them?Then came the panic. Global stock markets tanked, with Wall Street enduring its steepest fallssince the onset of the Covid-19 pandemicfive years ago, as the president repeatedly insisted he was serious this time.Trump’s officials were sent out to hold the line. “The announcement today is the most significant action on global trade policy that has taken place in our lifetimes,” said Stephen Miller, his deputy chief of staff for policy. “We’re just going to have to wait and see” what happens, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,told Bloomberg. One thing’s for sure, the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick,told CNN: “The president is not going to back off.”On day five of the new chapter, the 10% baseline tariffs came into force. On day seven, the higher, individualized rates followed. Beijing vowed to retaliate. Business leaders, including some who had backed Trump’s run for the White House, urged him to reconsider.A sell-off in treasury bonds, typically deemed a safe haven during periods of economic volatility, took hold. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding a few minutes later: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT”This advice seemed prescient four hours later. Seven days into the new chapter, with his individualized tariffs imposed for all of 13 hours, Trump announced a 90-day pause – in effect reducing the universal duty on all US imports from almost all countries to 10% – and markets surged higher.Almost all countries, that is, exceptChina. Beijing’s pledge to hit back infuriated the president, who blamed its “lack of respect” as he announced a new US tariff of 125% (in effect, once other duties were included, 145%) on Chinese goods. It retaliated in kind.Getting yippyThe same officials who had been dispatched to defend Trump’s initial plan were sent out again, to explain his latest climbdown.“You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,” Miller claimed on X.“Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, scolded reporters, referring to the president’s 1987 bestseller, in which the real estate tycoon presented himself as a consummate dealmaker.While his aides claimed that more than 75 countries had been in touch following his initial tariff announcement, even the president struggled to present the reversal as part of a carefully orchestrated negotiating strategy. Asked what had prompted it, Trump told reporters people had been “getting a little bit yippy” about his plan.But some of the US’s largest companies were still feeling pretty yippy. Apple, for example, relies on factories in China to churn out the iPhone, which is responsible for almost half its business.Late on day 10, away from the noisy press gaggles and all-caps social media posts, US Customs and Border Protection posted a list of products that would be exempt from the Chinese tariffs – including smartphones, computers and semiconductor chips.While the administration had walked back much of Trump’s initial plan, concern lingered over what remained. Trump maintained that high tariffs were the way forward, but fears of widespread shortages and dramatic price increases loomed large. Polling made clear consumers wereincreasingly concerned.Americans putting life on hold amid economic anxiety under Trump, poll showsRead moreOn day 28, at the end of a cabinet meeting, the president tried to play down the risks of his assault on China. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know,” he said. “And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”Blame gameEarlier that morning, dismal economic figures for the first quarter had underlined how – as the last chapter drew to a close – the mere threat of Trump’s economic assault appeared to dent growth. US gross domestic product (GDP)shrank for the first time in three years, abruptly turning negative after a spell of robust growth as imports surged 41% while companies scrambled to pre-empt tariffs.US economy shrinks in first quarter of Trump 2.0 amid sweeping tariffsRead moreTrump raced to pin the blame on his predecessor. “I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy,” hetold NBC’s Meet the Press.Many economists said the growth decline in the first quarter, as firms braced for Trump’s new chapter, raised troubling questions about the second, when the president finally launched it at his “liberation day” event.Aside from dolls, the administration started to indicate it might be willing to adjust tariffs on China that were hitting goods – like baby car seats and cribs – that the US almost entirely imports from the country. Such exemptions were “under consideration”, Bessent told Congress, potentially averting a spike in prices for young families.But as the weeks drew on, after promising his trade strategy would prompt countries around the world to trip over themselves to strike deals with the US, Trump was finding it harder to explain why none had materialized.On day 34, as questions mounted, he complained the media had become fixated. “You keep writing about deals, deals,” he said, adding that he wished journalists would stop asking. “Some deals” would be signed, the president said, but tariffs were a “much bigger” focus.On day 36, the first deal wasdeclared done. Trump summoned back reporters to unveil what he called a “maxed-out deal that we’re going to make bigger” with the UK. In reality, there was still work to do: both he and Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, conceded certain details had yet to be finalized.Trump and Starmer confirm ‘breakthrough’ US-UK trade dealRead moreBy the next morning, Trump’s focus had returned to China. Bessent was preparing for talks with the country’s officials in Geneva, fueling hopes that the world’s two largest economies might lower their eye-watering tariffs. “80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,” the president wrote on social media.‘This is going to crush us’Trump was also watching the liberal MSNBC network, where the business commentator Stephanie Ruhle argued his strategy on tariffs was not working. “You’re seeing day in, day out, more business leaders – whether it’s Warren Buffett, or Jamie Dimon, or Ken Griffin, on big global stages – saying this is going to crush us economically,” she said. “And then you’ve got congressmen, senators, from every state saying to this White House: our small businesses are … dying here.“I’m not saying Donald Trump has changed what he thinks in his heart. But he’s backed into a corner, and he needs to get off this crazy tariff train, and he knows it.”Trump punched back. “Few people know Stephanie Ruhle, but I do, and she doesn’t have what it takes,” he wrote on Truth Social, accusing her of lies. “We’re going to make a fortune withTariffs, only smart people understand that, and Stephanie was never known as a ‘High IQ’ person.”If only smart people understood the US stood to make a fortune from tariffs, they might have been surprised by what happened next.Away from TV studios, some of the most senior people in the White House, including the chief of staff, Susie Wiles, reportedly started to warn the president of risks not unlike those laid out by Ruhle. “The key argument was that this was beginning to hurt Trump’s supporters – Trump’s people,” one person briefed on internal conversationstold the Washington Post. “It gave Susie a key window.”On day 40, after discussions in Geneva, Bessent confirmed that US and Chinese officials woulddrastically reduce the tariffsthey had aggressively ratcheted up just a few weeks before. With US tariffs on Chinese goods falling to 30%, Trump hailed a “total reset” in relations between Washington and Beijing.The reversal, although far from a total reset, confined the latest “liberation day” measure to history.2 April 2025, is not yet remembered as the day American industry was reborn. Much of what was announced that afternoon has already died.The page has been turned. On Friday, Trump claimed about 150 countries would soon receive letters “essentially telling” them of new US duty rates on their exports. Many learned of similar rates last month, only for the plan to change in a matter of days.A new chapter, without pomp or ceremony, is now under way. What this one will entail – or how long it lasts – is anyone’s guess.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We do not rely on the weather,” said its 83-year-old president, Miguel Torres. “I don’t know how long we can stay here making good wines, maybe 20 or 30 years, I don’t know. Climate change is changing all the circumstances.”The family business has been making wine in Catalonia since 1870, but Torres said: “In 30 to 50 years’ time maybe we have to stop viniculture here.“Tourists are very important for Catalonia and we are very close to Barcelona. This area could be for activity for tourists but viniculture, I don’t think is going to be here.”The group, which invests 11% of its profits every year to combatting and adapting to the climate crisis, may instead have to move at least some of its vineyards “more to the west because it is cooler and we have to have water”.Familia Torres has more than 1,000 hectares of vineyards in Catalonia, mainly in the Penedès region, as well as sites in other parts of Spain, Chile and California.It is now expanding to higher altitudes, producing grapes in Tremp, in the Catalan Pre-Pyrenees, at 950 metres, and acquiring plots in Benabarre, in the Aragonese Pyrenees, at 1,100 metres, where it is still too cold to grow vines. It is also using a variety of techniques to reduce or reuse water in its growing and processing practices.That came after the family recorded a 1C rise in the average temperature in the Penedès region over the past 40 years. The change is causing the harvest to take place 10 days earlier than it did a few decades ago, while the family employs a variety of techniques to slow the ripening of the grapes to protect the right qualities for winemaking.Torres’s comments come after a difficult few years for European vineyards. He said production was down as much as 50% in some of the winemaker’s regions in 2023 – “the worst year I have ever seen” – and still down on historic averages last year amid extreme heat and drought.This year so far has been better – amid winter and spring rains and wider use of irrigation – but Torres said he was concerned that damper conditions bring the threat of mildew.“In the future if we want to have more continuity in the harvest we have to stop the warming,” he said. “The warming is killing the trade.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of thousands of English people come to Spain on holiday and know the brand. We have to keep it alive in the UK.”He said Torres was considering bottling some of its cheaper wines in the UK in order to reduce cost – as it is less costly to import in bulk in tankers.“At least by next year we should be already importing that way in the UK,” Torres said. “British consumers are paying more for wine and there is not another possibility [to importing]. Production in the UK is very little.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryWineFoodSpainEuropeClimate crisisFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

The win marked McCarthy’s second Preakness triumph and Rispoli’s first Triple Crown victory, making him the first Italian jockey to secure a win in one of America’s three most prestigious races.Gosger finished second in the $2m race for three-year-old, Sandman took third, while Goal Oriented, trained by Hall of Famer Bob Baffert, came in fourth. Gosger, the 20-1 longshot who was collared by Journalism in the final yards, finished a half-length behind the winner. Journalism completed the 1 3/16 miles in 1:55.37, a strong showing on a day that saw the track dry out after a week of heavy rain.\"A REMARKABLE RECOVERY BY JOURNALISM!\"JOURNALISM WINS THE 150TH PREAKNESS STAKES!#Preakness150pic.twitter.com/f2IOVEyUy9— NBC Sports (@NBCSports)May 17, 2025Clever Again shot out to an early lead, breaking sharply out of the gates and setting the pace into the first turn. Journalism was tucked along the inside, boxed in and trailing by five lengths at the final turn. Rispoli swung him outside and the colt responded with a powerful stretch drive, overtaking Clever Again and Gosger in the final strides. Stewards reviewed the race after a bump between Journalism, Clever Again and Goal Oriented, but no changes were made to the result.“I still can’t realize what this horse did today,” saide Rispoli afterwards, overcome by emotion. “I got in trouble at the corner pole. But it’s all about him. It’s a pleasure and a privilege to ride a horse like him. It’s just unbelievable. I won one of the legs of the Triple Crown and I’m crying like a kid.”The win provided a measure of redemption for Journalism, a son of 2007 Preakness winner Curlin, who finished second by one and a half lengths to Sovereigntyin the Kentucky Derby two weeks ago. Sovereignty’s connections opted to skip the Preakness and target the Belmont Stakes instead, citing the short turnaround. That decision marked the fifth time in seven years that the Preakness was contested without a Triple Crown on the line.View image in fullscreenUmberto Rispoli became first Italian jockey to secure a win in one of America’s three most prestigious races.Photograph: Emilee Chinn/Getty ImagesAlso bidding for history at Pimlico was Saffie Osborne, who came in fifth aboard English import Heart of Honor. The 23-year-old Briton was attempting to become only the second female jockey to win any leg of the Triple Crown after Julie Krone in the 1993 Belmont. Heart of Honor, trained by her father Jamie Osborne, had shown promise in Dubai earlier this year, finishing second in the UAE Derby. “It’s an adventure for us,” Jamie Osborne said before the race. “We didn’t set out for the Triple Crown, but here we are.”The Preakness, staged at Pimlico since 1873, is set to move to Laurel Park in Prince George’s County next year while the storied Baltimore track undergoes a $400m redevelopment. “A lot of history here,” McCarthy said. “Of all the good horses who have run through the lane here, I think one of the things that really got it started for me was Sunday Silence and Easy Goer [in 1989]. I remember where I was watching that race that day.“Things kind of come full circle. Will be sad to see this place go, but we’ll try to get back here next year, whichever locale it’s at.”Journalism became just the fourth Kentucky Derby runner-up to win the Preakness since 1961, joining a roll that includes Summer Squall (1990), Prairie Bayou (1993) and Exaggerator (2016). Bought for $825,000 as a yearling at the 2023 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga sale, his lifetime earnings climbed to $2,838,880 after Saturday’s fifth win in seven career starts.Although his connections have not yet decided if Journalism will enter the Belmont Stakes for a rematch with Sovereignty, anticipation is already building for a showdown in upstate New York. The Triple Crown’s final leg, held at Saratoga Race Course this year due to the ongoing two-year renovation of Belmont Park, could serve as the defining race of Journalism’s season.View image in fullscreenUmberto Rispoli, top right, atop Journalism, wins the 150th running of the Preakness Stakes by a half-length.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP“We would love to go,” said Aron Wellman, Journalism’s co-owner and the managing partner of Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners. “I think this ownership group, Eclipse on down, has made it very clear we take these American classics very seriously and hold them in high regard and we want to be good ambassadors for the industry and the sport at large. … We feel very fortunate to be in the position we’re in and if Michael gives him the green light, we’ll be there.”As the dust settled on Saturday night by Pimlico’s ramshackle grandstand, fans were left to savor one final memory: Journalism’s thrilling surge to the wire, etching his name into the storied history of Old Hilltop before its doors close for good. But for McCarthy, the southern California-based trainer whose family has been displaced for months by the wildfires, Saturday’s second Preakness win was even more emotional thanhis first with Rombauerfour years ago.“We’ll get back there,” McCarthy said. “Everybody will get back there. We’ll rebuild. This is for Altadena.”Explore more on these topicsPreakness StakesHorse racingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Daylight, such valuable daylight to a player of Scheffler’s strength. It is almost as if he has making up to do; a year ago, his US PGA planwas disrupted by an arrestoutside the gates of Valhalla. This is far more familiar stuff.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler on the 9th hole.Photograph: Matt York/APHistory is on Scheffler’s side. On the previous two occasions he has held 54-hole major leads, both at Augusta National, he has won. There feels inevitability about what comes next. Norén has never won a major before. Neither have JT Poston, Kim Si-woo or Jhonattan Vegas. Jon Rahm is six under and not without hope or motivation. Including, that is, in proving his switch to LIVGolfhas not undermined his major chances. The odds of toppling Scheffler in this mood, though, are long.“It is hard to express how hungry I may be for a major,” Rahm said. “About as hungry as anybody can be in this situation.“Me going to LIV and playing worse in majors had nothing to do with where I was playing golf. My swing was simply not at the level it had to be for me to compete. It’s easier to post a score on non-major championship courses and venues, and I think when you get to the biggest stages like this one and these courses, those flaws are going to get exposed.“There’s been weeks where I was able to play better, like the Open last year. The Masters wasn’t a good start but it got better as the week was on and I’m still working and trying to get my swing to a better spot.“I would say even in 2023, after winning the Masters, I did not play good at all until the Ryder Cup. So I think the problems began earlier than people think. But I’m now getting closer to a position of being comfortable. I think this week so far and this round has been a show of it.”View image in fullscreenJon Rahm of Spain hits from the rough on the 2nd.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAAs Rahm spoke, Scheffler was pressing upon the accelerator. This was his 25th major round in the 60s since 2022. These three in a row – 69, 68, 65 – will scare the field. And yet, Scheffler was merely one under for his day on the 14th tee. There, he cracked a three-wood from 304 yards to within 3ft of the cup. It was the moment of this slow burning major.“I battled hard out there, it was really tough today,” Scheffler said. “The winds were really gusting, the greens firmed up but I did a good job of staying patient. I struck the ball a lot better than in the first couple of rounds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

DeChambeau three-putted the 16th and found water on 17. When asked about his level of frustration, he replied: “That’s why golf is the worst four-letter word in the world.” DeChambeau at one point held the lead.

She also was called for a flagrant-1 foul on rival Angel Reese in a third-quarter sequence that called to mind some of the controversial moments of the Indiana-Chicago rivalry last year.Caitlin Clark’s winter transformation has the Indiana Fever dreaming bigRead moreKelsey Mitchell and Fever newcomer Natasha Howard each added 15 points. Another offseason signing, DeWanna Bonner, scored seven to become the WNBA’s No 3 all-time scorer (7,489 points). She made two free throws late in the fourth to pass Tina Thompson on the scoring list.Reese led the Sky with 12 points and 17 rebounds and new acquisition Ariel Atkins scored 11 points.Reese’s first points of the season came on a layup, which Clark answered mere seconds later by pulling up for a 28-footer, her first triple of 2025.Mitchell connected on a pair of three-pointers in the first quarter to help Indiana take a 22-17 lead.Reese made a rare three-pointer early in the second to cut a 26-20 deficit in half. Bonner pilfered the ball from Reese on the next Chicago possession and took it for an easy layup.Coming off a pass from Clark, Boston swished a midrange jumper for Indiana’s first double-digit lead at 36-25 with 4:01 till halftime. On the final play of the half, Clark got herself open on the left wing for a last-second three to give the Fever a 45-32 advantage.With 4:38 left in the third quarter, Reese found herself wide-open after getting an offensive rebound. The nearest defender was Clark, who stepped in to give a take foul that featured an extra shoving motion at the end. Reese was incensed and started yelling at Clark, who walked away from the play. A referee and Boston held back Reese, who appeared to continue shouting toward Clark once ushered to the bench.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

This was noteworthy because as soon as the game ended, Soto was a free agent.He had been traded to New York from the San Diego Padres – where he landed after a bombshell trade from the Washington National team that drafted him and with whom he won a World Series in 2019 – just ahead of his walk year. But Soto had endeared himself to the fervent fanbase quickly. In 2024, he was 80% better than average at the plate according to wRC+ and, with the towering Aaron Judge hitting behind him, led the American League in runs scored. And it seemed his swagger fit with the famous franchise that brought him back to the Fall Classic for the first time since he was 20 years old.Pete Rose returns to the Hall conversation as baseball embraces his original sinRead moreAnd so, even as the season dwindled around them, Yankees fans sprang for the pricey pinstripes sold in team stores. Some of them were Dominicans who vowed to root for their countryman wherever he went. Some of them simply wanted a souvenir from a summer in the Bronx worth commemorating. Some of them assumed he would be back.On Friday night, he was. Soto roaming right field at Yankee Stadium. Soto sauntering to the plate and doffing his cap to the crowd. But now the gesture was cheeky, a joke with his new teammates who had tittered in the dugout about how funny it would be, and the crowd met it with resounding boos.Over the winter, the New York Mets made Soto the richest professional athlete in North America, signing himto a 15-year, $765 million contract. It was the capstone of an evolution several years in the making for the Mets from charmingly hapless to heavy hitters that coincided with über-billionaire Steve Cohen buying the club. Of course, Soto could have been the richest professional athlete in North America who still played for the Yankees – reportedly he rejected their offer of a 16-year deal worth $760m. Whatever affinity he felt for the Yankees was worth less than $5m. Or maybe it was just New York that he loved.Friday night was the start of a Subway Series between the Mets and the Yankees that might have been the best matchup of MLB’s debut ‘Rivalry Weekend’ even without the Soto of it all. For just the third time since the debut of the Subway Series in 1997, both teams have sole possession of first place in their respective divisions. Both entered the season with skyscraper-high expectations and have thus far lived up to them.There was reason to believe Yankee Stadium might be evenly split. Even-ish, anyway. However far Yankees fans traveled to be at the game Friday night, Mets fans couldn’t have traveled much further. And yet, Soto’s reception left no doubt which fanbase dominated the 47,400-strong crowd. They booed him at every at-bat. As he ran out to right field in the bottom of the first, the entire section of seats turned their back on him. When they turned around it was to hurl profanity at him. Soto met their middle fingers with a wry salute.View image in fullscreenYankees fans heckle Juan Soto of the Mets during the first inning of Friday night’s game in the Bronx.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesAs for the No 22 jerseys bought back when he was one of their own, some Yankees fans made their own alterations – one added a choice four-letter word scrawled on tape atop the nameplate, another wrote “Arroz” over the number, a nod to the newest Yankee No 22, Ben Rice.At one point, Soto tossed a ball into the stands as he jogged off the field at the end of a half inning on defense. The Yankees fans around there roared with cheers when whoever caught it threw it back rather than relish a keepsake tainted by an ex.“It’s New York, it’s what you sign up for,” said Clay Holmes before the game about the raucous atmosphere. An All-Star reliever with the Yankees, he, too, only went as far as a borough away in the offseason. He signed with the Mets, who have since turned him into a capable starter. “It’s what you want. You can feel the energy, the buzz. It’s a lot more fun to show up to the park.”To underscore that this is a clash of true baseball titans, we should say that the Yankees, scorned by Soto, did not go on to wallow away the offseason. The money that could have gone to a single preternaturally gifted young star instead was instead used to plug holes around the roster with additions from baseball’s B list: lefty pitcher Max Fried, closer Devin Williams, and a couple of post-peak former MVPs in Paul Goldschmidt and Cody Bellinger. Fried, in particular, has proven essential and ascendant – he currently owns the lowest ERA in baseball, especially necessary on a contending Yankee club that has lost Cy Young award winner Gerrit Cole for the season and has thus far been without Cole’s worthy replacement from last year and reigning Rookie of the Year, Luis Gil.Cohen, for all his largess, never would have sprung for Fried, whose eight-year, $218m contract is the largest ever for a lefty. Under new general manager David Stearns, the Mets philosophy has favored splurging on position players and finding value on the margins when it comes to pitching. The converted Holmes, for example.It’s ironic, then, that the Yankees, who lost a player most often compared to Ted Williams, have started the season with perhaps the strongest offense in the sport. And the Mets, who eschewed top-of-the-line starters to budget for a $700m hitter, have the best starting rotation ERA.Ultimately, the Yankees bats overpowered the Mets pitching in a 6-2 trouncing that almost got exciting in the ninth inning before Soto flied out with the bases loaded. It sent the Yankees fans who booed him home happy, but it elides the otherwise perfectly acceptable day he had at the plate: three walks, a stolen base, a run scored.In the lead up to the Subway Series, both sides were asked about the presumed impending boos that would rain down on Soto specifically. Which is to say, it was no surprise.“I was ready for it,” Soto said after the game, confirming that it was likely the loudest he’d ever been booed in his career. “You’ve got to embrace it at the end of the day.”If his new union with the Mets works out the way both sides hope, the Yankees will be the last team Soto leaves on bad terms. The dynamic has added spice to a rivalry that was heating up anyway. The era of the must-see Subway Series has just begun.Explore more on these topicsMLBNew York MetsNew York YankeesBaseballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The NBA’s social media peanut gallery had previously taken issue with Knicks fans for their overly exuberant early-round victory celebrations, but after landing in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in a quarter-century, this party was as legit as the Knicks newfound title hopes.New York had beaten their rivals by a franchise playoff-record margin of 38 points, ending Boston’s reign asNBAchamps. If you watched the way they suffocated the Celtics, you know it wasn’t even that close. The way this series ended was as stunning as how it began, with consecutive historic Celtic meltdowns at TD Garden, when the home team surrendered 20-point second-half leads not once but twice. Then New York were moments from wrapping up another improbable victory in Game 4 when Boston cornerstone Jayson Tatum went down with an achilles injury. Back in Boston, down three games to one, with their season on the brink and their all-NBA player in the hospital recovering from season-ending surgery, Boston powered through Game 5 on pure adrenaline. That wave of raw energy had crashed by the start of Game 6, and the Celtics finally tapped out. The Garden crowd let out 25 years ofshpilkesas they watched their team bounce the champs.Rampant Knicks blow out Celtics to advance to first East finals since 2000Read moreAnd so after a season of trying to figure out who they are and what their identity is, the Knicks have finally found a label: Eastern Conference finalists. Up until the clock struck zero in Game 6, accurate adjectives to describe New York’s on-court personality were quite limited, but “resilient” and “inconsistent” probably summed them up best.Injuries, trades and roster turnover meant that the lunch-pail defense-first teams that had marked theTom Thibodeau-coached Knicksprior to this season were no more. The loss of their beastly, rim protecting, offensive rebounding big men – Isaiah Hartenstein to free agency and Mitchell Robinson to an ankle injury until late February – were glaring. That weakness in the paint meant newly acquired defensive stalwart Mikal Bridges, and defensive Swiss army knife OG Anunoby were hopeless against perimeter shooting for most of the season.Moment of the game, moment of the year, moment of the decade, moment of the quarter-century…pic.twitter.com/nKLqqhjg62— zach (@_zachblatter)May 17, 2025That said, Karl-Anthony Towns, who came to New Yorkin a late preseason blockbuster deal, jumped out of the gate early, looking like the alpha dog Minnesota rarely got to see, setting a career high for rebounds while combining with Jalen Brunson to average more than 50 points a game. Knicks fans were being treated to blistering ball movement and some of the most explosive offensive play the franchise has ever produced, but as the games piled up, the warts began to show.Around mid-season, the excitement that had followed the team since their 2021 playoff appearance seemed to crest, with doubts creeping in about the team’s ceiling. The team was haunted by a stat that followed them around for months: since 2003, among teams that have won 50 games or more, the Knicks had the worst winning percentage against teams .500 or better. They were whipped by the Celtics, the Cavs and the Thunder. New York winning their first title since 1973? This team couldn’t even beat the pre-Luka Lakers at home. Fans braced themselves for another playoff letdown.Such negativity has context: the New York Knickerbockers, despite their stature as a pillar of the NBA, are mostly a losing franchise that have had just three extended runs of success in their history, one of which was during the NBA’s prehistoric early-1950s. Under the ownership of James Dolan, their fans’ fandom has repeatedly been tested by a leadership that’s provided two of the most inept, perplexing and sometimes dastardly decades a professional sports team has ever known.Then suddenly, Dolan hired Leon Rose as team president and finally got out of the way. Knicks fans expected the former prominent player agent to attract sparkly free agents such as Kevin Durant. It didn’t happen, but a meticulous rebuild did, and in the span of five seasons, the team transitioned from NBA laughing stock to legitimate title contenders.View image in fullscreenNew York Knicks fans stand on a subway entrance canopy as they celebrate Friday’s win.Photograph: Leonardo Muñoz/AFP/Getty ImagesThese Knicks are arguably one of the most oddly constructed basketball teams in recent memory, and that’s because the Knicks have consistently been one of the worst drafting franchises in NBA history. In an era where teams have tanked to rebuild their franchises, New York’s renaissance hasn’t been buoyed by a homegrown star, or stars, such as the Celtics’ Tatum and Jaylen Brown, but rather a delicate series of trades and under-the-radar free-agent signings made by their under-the-radar president. Rose has not held a single press conference since being hired in March 2020, which is wild in a town of quote-thirsty tabloids.The result is a starting five that’s arguably unmatched in the NBA, and now that Mitchell Robinson has worked his way back into impacting games with his menacing paint presence and timely offensive rebounds, Knicks fans are starting to see the full complement of what Rose had in mind when he went all-in on pairing Towns with Brunson, and what he saw in Bridges when he gambled a stack of draft picks on the league’s iron man. They figured out a way to get past the NBA’s new junkyard dogs in Detroit, then ousted the champs in six. When it’s all working, Brunson is pushing the ball and finishing with his footwork, Bridges is sticking mid-range jumpers and ripping the ball from his opponents, Anunoby is stifling opponents’ most prolific players, Robinson’s active hands are flummoxing offenses, Towns is involved early, sticking threes and working the post, Hart’s engine is wearing teams out and bench players like Deuce McBride and Cam Payne are making meaningful contributions.Now they meet Indiana, who beat them in the Eastern Conference semi-finals last season. A year ago the Knicks’ roster was eviscerated by injuries, allowing the Pacers to sneak past New York over seven games. Now the Knicks are a completely different team, a healthy group that’s figuring it all out at just the right time. Meanwhile the Pacers are also much improved, having played some of the best basketball in the league over the past several months. We don’t know who will emerge in what is sure to be a grueling Eastern Conference finals, but we do know the Knicks are taking nothing for granted. I feel like we have a long way to go,” said Brunson after Friday night’s win. “Just the confidence we have in each other and everything. Just knowing who we are. We have to be unsatisfied.”Explore more on these topicsNew York KnicksUS sportsNBABoston CelticsBasketballIndiana PacersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

TheCrystal Palaceplayers collapsed where they were standing, crumpled across the grass like a battle scene fresco. The colours made it beautiful, red and blue against the deep green, new optics, new names, the unstyled celebrations of players unused to these moments, Jean-Philippe Mateta face down, Will Hughes flat on his back, arms spread like a snow angel.There was a rush of noise as the clock began to tick again. And that was that. Sound the tram bells, unleash the smoke plumes from the Tasty Jerk shack – 119 years into Crystal Palace’s existence this mercurial club with the clanky corrugated stadium has finally won a major trophy.Crystal Palace stun Manchester City to win FA Cup amid drama and Henderson controversyRead moreOliver Glasner’s team did it in the best way, scoring early thenholding on to the 1-0 leadagainst a Manchester City team that played for most of this FA Cup final like a collection of ghosts stuck in the same deathly patterns. By the end City had managed the unusual combined feat of dominating all the key metrics but also never looking at any stage like they deserved to win.For Palace’s fans this was the best kind of final, one of those days that passes as a series of moments ready to be pored over and lovingly rewound. There was the oddly touching sight of Glasner on his touchline in all-black and huge white trainers, like a spy out for a jog, arms raised constantly in a mix of triumph and alarm through the final 10 minutes.There was the noise from the Palace fans, basically the Selhurst ultras scaled up across an entire Wembley end. The plume of red smoke caught in the light through the top of the stand. And below it the sight of people weeping with unaffected pleasure, overcome by the familiar but still always surprising catharsis of this shared spectacleBest of all for Palace’s tale of the day, they were granted a huge slice of luck by the dual incompetence of the refereeing team during an amazing 20-minute spell that settled the game. Palace were already 1-0 up by the time the referee failed to spot Dean Henderson batting the ball away from a rampaging Erling Haaland outside his area. This was then compounded by the VAR bizarrely concluding this was not, repeat not, a goalscoring opportunity and therefore a red card offence. To repeat. Haaland. Edge of the box. Ball in front of him. You have seen this bloke before? Or indeed this sport? Or any sport?View image in fullscreenFireworks are let off before the game in front of the massed Palace support.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMaybe there was something karmic here, a circular righting of wrongs, Henderson’s swipe of the arms an exact physical echo of Alan Pardew’s Cup final dance of shame back in 2016.

But this was one of those victories that deserves its own blarney. Wembley had been a lovely place at kick-off, drenched in a brittle late spring chill. It is an underrated vast grey concrete bowl on these occasions, the steep open tiers creating a proper noise cauldron effect. And the game was basically decided by that 20-minute first-half spell when the entire day turned a shade of Selhurst.Early on Palace had done little but press and chase. It was passive possession from City, even the midfield counterpress a little geriatric and creaky. And on 16 minutes Palace scored a brilliant goal with their first thrust, made by Mateta’s hold and spin and by Daniel Muñoz’s gallop into the empty space on the City left. His cross was just the right height for Eberechi Eze, the first-time finish beautifully soft, a man enjoying the sweetness of the contact, feeling his own moment rising up to meet him.Eight minutes later the game was waved on as Henderson handled outside his box. And of course it was Henderson who then saved brilliantly from the penalty spot from Omar Marmoush, a sequence of events that might have been designed with great care by a team of experts simply to annoy and enrage Pep Guardiola.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace fans react to Eberechi Eze’s goal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was odd that Haaland didn’t take the penalty. Three of his eight career missed penalties have come this season. But this is also the most lethal one-shot goalscorer in the world. It’s a final. What exactly is the point of Haaland if he’s not taking on these moments?For Palace the day began to take on a golden hue from that point. Adam Wharton was brilliantly committed, a footballer who slouches around the place like a man waiting for the supermarket to open on a Sunday morning, but whose brain is always whirring. Mateta played with heart and guile. There were cheers as Hughes was sent on toward the end like the pair of wellies you pull out of the car boot for a muddy walk. Eze made the key difference. He is another deceptive footballer, the cage baller who is actually hugely controlled and reliable in his output, who knows exactly how good he is.There was always a danger this could feel like a meeting of a team looking to achieve the most notable act in its history, and another trying to grab a consolation trophy on the way down. Objectively Palace’s victory has some obvious good things to tell English football. Premier League teams should be this good. Buy expertise, build a vast academy, develop players, spend well.It’s a victory for a place that makes footballers, the Concrete Catalonia, that square of suburban south-east London that produces a disproportionate ratio of top-tier English players. It is arguably a victory for something other than gruelling systems-ball, the super squad, the hoovering up of trophies. No doubt these points will now be advanced, as will the idea of a kind ofFA Cuprevivalism. Mainly though, this was just a lovely afternoon, and a day in the sun for a club that had waited long enough.Explore more on these topicsFA CupCrystal PalaceManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

He said: “As football players or managers our biggest achievement is to give the fans a moment for their lives. We had a difficult start to the season [winning none of the first eight league games] – in difficult moments you need someone who hugs, not kicks you, so this is for the fans. The connection with theCrystal Palaceplayers will stay for ever.”Guardiola pays for overthinking again as striking decisions cost City FA Cup | Jonathan WilsonRead moreGlasner was asked to compare the Cup victory to winning theEuropa League with Eintracht Frankfurtin 2022. “It’s difficult to compare … no one expected Palace or Frankfurt to win. I can’t believe it. We had to defend so much. The spirit and togetherness on the pitch was amazing.”Palace host Wolves in their penultimate league game on Tuesday but Glasner said: “Tomorrow’s training is already cancelled. The players want to cancel Monday too. Special credit to the players, they’ve never lost belief in me and the coaching staff.“If you play this game 10 times, we win it once and that happened today. We scored the first time we were in their half and then we defended with every single phase of the body and a great goalkeeper, a great mentality and togetherness. I’m really proud of the team and the staff – congratulations, all the credit goes to them.”Henderson turned away Omar Marmoush’s 36th-minute penalty and impressed with a number of other vital saves. But he might have been sent off before repelling the spot-kick if the video assistant referees, Jarred Gillett and Michael Salisbury, had ruled that his handball as Erling Haaland ran through was an obvious goalscoring opportunity and sent Stuart Attwell to the screen for a review.View image in fullscreenDean Henderson clips the ball away from Manchester City’s Erling Haaland.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGuardiola refused to criticise the decision of Attwell or his video assistants. “I am not a referee,” City’s manager said. “Ask the referee or the VAR.”Glasner was asked about Henderson’s handball. “I thought: ‘Why did you not kick it?” the Austrian said.After the final whistle, Guardiola appeared to have a disagreement with a celebrating Henderson.

Everyone can do what they want. You have to score goals. We didn’t lose because Henderson was time-wasting. They gave nine or 10 minutes extra time, but it’s also the rhythm [when this is broken up]. In my teams I never tried, because I try to play the game the people deserve to watch. Saying that, congratulations to Henderson and Palace because they defended really well and we were not able to score a goal.”Henderson dedicated the triumph to his deceased father, Dougie. “I lost my dad at the start of the season, but he was with me today. He was with me every kick of the game. I dedicate that win to him.”The Palace keeper was surprised that Marmoush took the penalty, not Haaland. “Haaland might have stepped up. He gave it to Marmoush and I knew which way he was going. I knew I would save it.”Guardiola was asked about Marmoush taking it. “I thought he would want to take it but these are things for them,” said the 54-year-old. “They decided Omar was ready to take it.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupCrystal PalaceManchester CityVideo assistant referees (VARs)RefereesnewsShareReuse this content"

But later that evening Paquetá’s wife, Maria Fournier, detailed the anguish the case is causing, writing on Instagram: “My husband has a posture and a strength that I admire and impresses me. We have been living this nightmare for two years.”Paquetá was left on the bench for last weekend’s2-0 win at Manchester United, with Potter at the time explaining that he had a cold. But as he prepared for Sunday’s visit of Nottingham Forest, Potter said: “It was both. The week he had was a particularly tough week for him personally, which I think everyone can understand. And then as a result of that he was feeling under the weather on the day before the game and the day of the game.“So I didn’t want to risk him and make it worse for him. But he’s trained really well, he wants to be part of the team and we’ll see how to use him for the weekend.View image in fullscreenGraham Potter chose not to risk Lucas Paquetá against Manchester United.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“There’s a bit going round to be fair – I’ve had a bit of a sore throat as well. But you know what it’s like; sometimes stress, pressure, can manifest itself in a different way.”Potter is desperate for the case to be resolved before the start of next season. “For everybody concerned, yes,” he said. “It’s not my thing to talk about, but the sooner the better for everyone.“In fairness to Lucas I think he’s handled it brilliantly. I don’t know if I said it’s taken its toll on him. That week was a big week for him, but he has to go through what he has to go through.“But generally he’s come in and conducted himself in a really good way. He’s just ready to help the team. I think coming into work is a distraction for him, it takes his mind off things. He’s handled it really well.

The 20-year-old defender, who has also been targeted by Chelsea, Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Newcastle, will join the Spanish club at the end of the season after they agreed to pay a £50m release clause.Real tried to sign the Netherlands-born Spain international when he was a youth player at Málaga and have continued to track the former Juventus and Roma defender’s progress. Huijsen’s footballing idol is Sergio Ramos, the former Spain and Madrid defender. After a loan spell at Roma, Huijsen signed for Bournemouth in July 2024.‘I’ve always been pretty chilled’: Dean Huijsen on Bournemouth, defending and his celebrationRead moreHis recruitment comes as Xabi Alonso is set to take charge as Madrid’s manager from Carlo Ancelotti, who istaking over the Brazil national team, and marks the start of the La Liga club’s rebuild.

Perhaps at the beginning of an extraordinary career, his release by Sheffield Wednesday and those days earning £30 a game at Stocksbridge Park Steels hounding defenders in the Northern Premier League. For six months an electronic ankle tag – after he was convicted of assault – meant midweek matches were off-menu and games often saw him being subbed after an hour so he could jump over fences and into his parents’ car to beat his 6pm curfew. By then, his work was usually done.Word of mouth spread. He signed for Halifax for £15,000 in 2010, then Fleetwood a year later for 10 times that. Ten months on he joined Leicester in the Championship in a £1m deal, a non-league record. The story goes that he first appeared on Nigel Pearson’s radar while scoring 66 goals across 107 Stocksbridge appearances. A friend of the Leicester manager who ran a fish and chip shop in Sheffield mentioned his name, a throwaway comment about a prolific striker in the eighth tier. Soon scouts were flocking to Fleetwood and Leicester beat off competition from Blackpool, Peterborough and Southampton to sign a 25-year-old by the name ofJamie Vardy.‘A total embarrassment’: Jamie Vardy apologises for Leicester’s awful seasonRead moreSteve Walsh, then an assistant manager and head of recruitment at Leicester, first scouted him when Fleetwood won an FA Cup tie at Yeovil in 2011. Vardy scored and Walsh made him his No 1 target. Leicester showed Vardy a montage of his best bits, and Pearson’s status as a Wednesday hero helped persuade him Leicester was the best destination. He scored a header on debut at Torquay but initially found things tough and, concerned the jump was too big, asked to return to Fleetwood on loan. “I think that’s the one and only time in his life where I would say he lost confidence,” Walsh recalls. “He was used to being the star of the show, scoring every week and people saying how good he was. All of a sudden there was a reality check. We had to point out that it takes time to adjust.”On Sunday Vardy, who turns 39 in January, will make his500th and finalappearance for Leicester, he hopes with a 200th goal to boot. No wonder Netflix is releasing a documentary charting his journey from turning up at sloping pitches in a clapped-out Renault Clio to breaking records on the biggest stage, chiefly scoring in 11 successive Premier League matches to eclipse Ruud van Nistelrooy, now his manager at Leicester. “His story is almost a fairytale, but they don’t need a script – just tell the truth,” says Walsh. “He is a living legend.”View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy at Stocksbridge Park Steels.Photograph: Stocksbridge Park SteelsVardy has won the Premier League, against all odds under Claudio Ranieri in 2016, the division’s Golden Boot, the FA Cup, played in the Champions League, for England at a World Cup and been nominated for the Ballon d’Or. He is joint 14th on the list of Premier League goalscorers, two shy of Teddy Sheringham. He even has a Guinness World Records certificate owing to thatrecord-breaking goal against Manchester Uniteden route to the title. “Not many managers would but Claudio mentioned it beforehand,” says the former Leicester winger Marc Albrighton. “‘Yes, we want to get the result but let’s do our utmost to help Vards break this record.’”Wearing gold boots, Vardy latched on to a no-look pass by Christian Fuchs and capped a devastating counterattack. “Everyone was so genuinely happy for Vards to have achieved the record,” Fuchs says. “It was pure joy. The only other moment that could top that was whenTottenham drew against Chelsea– that was probably more emotional and intense.”Fuchs is talking about theinfamous partyat Vardy’s old house in Melton Mowbray on the night Leicester achieved the unthinkable. Vardy, who spent the day at a tattoo parlour, invited his teammates around in case Spurs dropped points and Leicester were champions. Many arrived with crates of beer. Late on Eden Hazard equalised for Chelsea, prompting Vardy’s TV to be smashed and Fuchs to ask the Belgian if he could kiss his feet when they met on the final day. The celebrations went on until 4am. All the while television crews and supporters gathered outside. “Suddenly we saw Vards’s house on the telly in front of us … it was crazy,” says Fuchs. “We felt like Hollywood stars. When I drove out of the gates, you couldn’t see where you were going – just camera flashes.”Leicester’s No 9 gets a kick out of riling opponents and opposition fans. He even learns swear words in different languages to unsettle defenders. “He kills them with kindness,” says Fuchs, chuckling. Clips of Vardy mimicking an eagle after scoring against Crystal Palace, howling like a wolf after netting against Wolves and running the length of the pitch to shush supporters spring to mind. Last August, his final act against Tottenham was to point towards the Premier League badge on his shirt.“I never understand why fans wind him up because he’s one of the worst people you can wind up,” says the former Leicester defender Danny Simpson. “Because it gives him a lift. If he thinks he is a bit off the pace, he knows how to raise his game, be it smashing into defenders, having a bit of beef with the fans. He loves all of that. That’s a big part of his game when he’s in that zone.” Does Vardy get more stick than any other current player? “Probably,” was his own verdict this week.View image in fullscreenLeicester fans in a pub celebrate Chelsea’s second goal against Spurs in 2016, which sealed the title.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters“In a time where footballers are high-profile celebrities, famous figures, he is very relatable to the fans,” says Albrighton. “He has brought his non-league personality to the top level. A lot of players come through structured academies and are told to act a certain way. He’s got this raw personality and character that initially took everybody by surprise but I think now even most opposition fans actually love him.”Central to Vardy’s success has been his straight-talking and carefree character. “He is like a big kid; you hear him before you see him,” says one of his former coaches of a player known to blast balls against the windows of Leicester’s training pavilion. This is the Vardy who wore a “Chat shit, get banged” T-shirt on their title parade, a nod to his Facebook post from 2011, when he was an unknown.Then there is the Spider-Man costume he donned at training under Claude Puel in 2019. “Claude was giving him stick about his new red and blue ‘Spider-Man’ boots and I remember Vards saying: ‘If you want Spider-Man, you can have Spider-Man,’” says Albrighton. “He came in the next day with this morphsuit on, hid behind the bush, waited until Claude walked out, jumped out and scared him.”View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy turns up to training dressed as Spider-Man.Photograph: Getty ImagesThis month he blew the referee David Webb’s whistle while the official lay injured. “Endless stories … not many PG ones,” says Albrighton. “He was always up to something, whether it was winding the laundry girls up or, going back a bit, hurling bread rolls at the youth team as they were singing in front of us at Christmas to get their boot money. Suddenly pigs in blankets are flying all over the canteen. He is a one-off.” Vardy’s status as a joker was cemented while playing cards or Uno on the team bus, smashing eggs with Fuchs or pranking Demarai Gray by sending a bucket of water into his hotel room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionVardy has his pre-match routine nailed down: three cans of Red Bull and a cheese and ham omelette. “It frustrates the fitness coaches and the nutritionists when they’re telling everyone what they should be eating and Vards, the main guy, has his own diet,” says Albrighton. In Leicester’s title-winning season, on the eve of matches, he drank port out of a Lucozade bottle. “I had a few of those with him,” says Simpson. “If you compare his body 13 years ago with now, he hasn’t changed.”Vardy ditched his homemade Skittles and vodka cocktail only when the then Leicester physio, Dave Rennie, informed him it hampered his rehabilitation from a dead leg. “He ripped up the manual,” Walsh says.Vardy’s story is also one of rejection. He was heartbroken by Wednesday letting him go as a schoolboy. At the peak of his powers heturned down Arsenalafter they triggered his £22m release clause during Euro 2016. “He stuck with Leicester and people must give him credit for that,” Walsh says.View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy poses with the Golden Boot in the summer of 2020.Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC/Getty ImagesVardy has not always been the best trainer but teammates count on him to deliver and view him as the ultimate team player. “Some strikers just want to score and have all of these goal accolades but he just wants to win and I think that is what sets him apart,” says Simpson. Sometimes it means home truths. “In a Jamie Vardy way,” says Fuchs, laughing. In recent years Vardy had a cryotherapy chamber installed at his Lincolnshire home to aid recovery. This season he has reported to Leicester’s Seagrave base on days off to enhance his fitness or watch training. In terms of finishing, Van Nistelrooy is perhaps best placed to comment. “Jamie is never bothered about the occasion,” the Dutchman says. “He’s always ice-cold.”There are a trove of moments to cherish. His hat-trick in the9-0 rout of Southamptonin 2019, his strike from distance against Liverpool in 2016. “I can picture the ball coming over his shoulder, bouncing and him hitting it from about 30 yards,” says Walsh. Simpson highlights the run to the Champions League quarter-finals. “I will never forget the away goal he got against Sevilla … a good night.” Fuchs picks out Vardy’s volley against West Brom in 2018. “A ball from Riyad Mahrez came over his head, he took it first-time, just inside the box, left foot … it was one of those classic Vardy goals, something out of nothing.”Vardy represents the best £1m Leicester have spent. “I don’t think I’m ever going to top that one,” says Walsh, stressing the signing was a team effort, highlighting Craig Shakespeare, the scout David Mills and Kevin Phillips, who coached Vardy. “I had to go to the owner, Vichai [Srivaddhanaprabha], and ask if he was prepared to pay the money, which is always difficult. But Vichai had complete trust in the staff to build a team he expected would do well … it turned out all right.”Vardy is the last remaining member of the title-winning squad, many of whom will be present to witness him bow out against Ipswich. Vardy considers himself emotionless but the planned tributes will test his tear ducts. He plans to carry on playing but will for ever be synonymous with Leicester. “You don’t see him get too emotional away from the pitch,” Simpson says. “Maybe this time he will because it’s the last time his kids will walk on with him.”View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy celebrates a new Premier League record by scoring for the 11th consecutive game against Manchester United in November 2015.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThen, maybe, there will be one final knees-up. The class of 2016 WhatsApp group has been abuzz, the message from the firestarter typically to the point. “‘We’re having another Vardy Party, you better all make sure you’re there,’” Simpson says. “We need to celebrate him and what he’s achieved. It’s going to be weird not seeing him in a Leicester shirt, looking at the team and seeing Vardy’s not up front. Hopefully he gets that 200th goal which would be the perfect ending.”Explore more on these topicsJamie VardyLeicester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Niko Kovac’s Dortmund won six of their last seven matches to climb from 10th to fourth in the standings and finish on 57 points, two ahead ofFreiburg, who lost 3-1 at home to third-placedEintracht Frankfurtand drop into the Europa League.Dortmund, needing a three-goal win to be guaranteed a top-four finish irrespective of results in the other games, got off to a dream start when Serhou Guirassy converted a third-minute penalty for the lead. Kiel were then left with 10 players when Carl Johansson was sent off with a straight red card but the hosts could not make the extra man count until the break.They did, however, score two minutes after the restart, with Marcel Sabitzer slotting in from the edge of the box to make it 2-0 and Felix Nmecha added another in the 72nd minute to seal their European spot.Dortmund players will now go into a two-week break before returning in early June ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States. Niko Kovac, who had taken over in February with the team in 11th place after the departure of Nuri Sahin after a disappointing first half to the season, said: “For a long time we were just passengers and on the final matchday we were in the driving seat and did it just in time,” said the Croat.

MacKenzie, an unused substitute, was struck by a seat thrown from the section holding Aberdeen fans and was given lengthy treatment before being taken away in a wheelchair with a bloodied bandage around his head and stitches were required.A Police Scotland statement read: “Part of a chair was thrown from the upper deck of the Fair Play Stand striking an Aberdeen player. He received treatment at the scene and will require further medical assessment.”United’s lap of honour was called off and Thelin said: “What’s happened is totally unacceptable. It is a bad injury, but Jack is OK so let’s see how it feels after more minutes. It really, really bad. I haven’t seen exactly what happened but our player got hurt, bad. Everyone understands that is not OK.”His United counterpart, Jim Goodwin, who was pelted with missiles from Dons fans when they visited in December, was equally condemnatory. The former Aberdeen manager said: “It’s an absolute disgrace. I’m gutted for Jack MacKenzie, who’s a terrific young player, and for him to be hit and seriously damaged by an object thrown by his own supporters, it’s crazy. And it’s not the first time.View image in fullscreenFans invade the pitch after Dundee United’s victory over Aberdeen at Tannadice Park.Photograph: Ronnie Esplin/PA“I’ve had a number of objects thrown at me throughout the season by the Aberdeen supporters and nothing has been done about it. So maybe it’ll take a serious incident like this to happen in order for the authorities to really step in, take notice and punish those guys and ban them from football for life.”Fraser Wishart, the PFA Scotland chief executive, said: “Jack MacKenzie is one of the PFA Scotland management committee so he was at a meeting the other day. When you see him being wheeled off you are pretty concerned.“I have been warning for a long time that something like this would happen if we don’t stop it. I don’t get the mentality of anyone who would throw an object of any kind at a player. I have always said if someone was to get hurt we are into a different domain.“It is difficult for the authorities and the clubs, I get all of that, but we are denying there is an issue here. Over the whole season we have seen incidents and our members endangered. Something has to be done. There has to be conversations between the governing bodies, the clubs, ourselves, the managers and coaching associations to try to find a way out of this as it can’t go on. These incidents are on the rise.”A statement from Aberdeen read: “The club is dismayed and outraged at the scenes that unfolded following this afternoon’s Premiership tie with Dundee United at Tannadice Park. Our player, Jack MacKenzie, has sustained a serious facial injury after being struck by a part of a chair that was thrown towards the pitch.“We await further information, but what we know for sure, the chair was thrown from the stand in which the Aberdeen supporters were being housed. As such, we are calling on all fans who may have witnessed this event to contact the club to provide any information that may assist us in our investigations and wider discussions with the relevant authorities. When the perpetrator is identified, we will take the strongest possible action available to us.”Dundee United leapfrogged Aberdeen into fourth place with their comeback win. Jeppe Okkels scored his first goal for the Dons since signing on loan from Preston in January after 15 minutes with the visitors controlling the game. United gradually came back into it and in the 56th minute Declan Gallagher levelled with a header from a Glenn Middleton corner.Sam Dalby put United ahead with a penalty in the 62nd minute.View image in fullscreenCeltic’s players hoist the trophy after finishing their season against St Mirren.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersJames Forrest gaveCelticfans the finale they craved as he equalised in stoppage time againstSt Mirrento extend his run of scoring for the club to 16 consecutive seasons.

On SundayManchester Unitedand Chelsea will face each other in the Women’s FA Cup final for a second time.Chelsea won1-0 in 2023to deny United in what was their maiden FA Cup final appearance, something Marc Skinner’s side avenged last season by beating the Blues in the semi-finals to limit Emma Hayes’ final season trophy haul to one. United went on tobeat Tottenham 4-0 in the finalto secure their first major trophy following promotion from the Championship. Now they have a chance to demonstrate exactly how far they have come, as they bid to retain their crown against a domestically unbeaten Chelsea looking to land a treble.More than 85,000 tickets have been sold for the showdown at Wembley, 10 years on from the first time the national stadium hosted the final. The hope is that the numbers through the turnstiles actually breach the 80,000 mark for the first time, having teetered just below that for the past two years. NewChelseaminority owner, Alexis Ohanian, is expected to be in attendance with his wife, the 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams, while Olly Murs will perform before kick-off. Increasingly a star-studded occasion, the Women’s FA Cup final continues to be a boundary-pusher, acting as an indicator of the potential in the women’s game for mainstream attention.‘We want to push for more’: a Chelsea treble would not be enough for Catarina MacarioRead moreThe last time Sonia Bompastor stepped on to the Wembley pitch was in 2012, when she lined up for France in the semi-finals of the Olympics against Japan in front of 61,482 spectators, a match the French lost 2-1 to miss out on a chance to return to the stadium for the final. Now she is back pitchside hoping to end her first season as Chelsea manager ingloriously dominant style.It is these sorts of occasions that persuaded Bompastor to manage in England after a lengthy career at eight-time Champions League winners Lyon, first as a player and later as the manager. “The fact you can play in front of thousands of people at a historic stadium and win one of the most famous trophies in England, the FA Cup, is something that potentially only happens a few times in your life,” she says, adding that winning the domestic treble would make this a “really good season” but “not a perfect one because we missed one trophy”.Defeat by Barcelonain the Champions League semi-finals still weighs heavily.Quick GuideWomen's FA Cup gets new TV dealShowThe Women’s FA Cup will be broadcast on Channel 4 and TNT Sports from next season in a three-year rights deal with the Football Association. They succeed the BBC as the broadcasters in the first standalone deal for the competition.The BBC extended its Women's FA Cup deal in 2019, agreeing to air both semi-finals and the final and to put out highlight reels and short videos.The new deal will bring a significant increase in the number of games broadcast live, with coverage guaranteed from the first round. TNT is to air 19 matches across the season and Channel 4 has committed to one match per round from the third round, with all six matches co-exclusive with TNT, which also holds rights to the men’s FA Cup and men’s FA Youth Cup.The Football Association's chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said: “This is a significant moment for the Adobe Women’s FA Cup. We have two broadcast partners who are deeply committed to growing the competition and taking it to new audiences over the next three seasons. Channel 4 and TNT are brilliant sports broadcasters and are the perfect combination for this very special tournament. We are delighted to be working with them and look forward to continuing to grow women’s football together.”Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I will be really proud for sure, really proud of my players, my staff, but this is a final,” adds Bompastor. “We play Man United, a team which is used to playing in this final now and they are a really strong team. They haven’t conceded many goals and I think we need to be reminded of that as well. This final will be 50-50.”Bompastor’s attempts to dull the perception that Chelsea are favourites to win will not get far. The Women’s Super League champions have won 13 of their last 15 games against United across all competitions and are heading into their eighth FA Cup final, of which they have won five. The gap is closing, though, with United having scored 18 goals and conceded only once on the way to Wembley.View image in fullscreenMary Earps, Ella Toone, Millie Turner and Manchester United’s manager Marc Skinner lift the FA Cup in May 2024.Photograph: Naomi Baker/The FA/Getty Images“We’re rebels,” United’s manager Skinner says. “I’m a rebel, my nature is rebellious. It’s about not accepting that because they have the best resources, they will be the best team on every occasion. When you set yourself up for that challenge, you know you will have to go through hell to get the victory. When you are prepared for that then you can do something special. I believe in our quality to do that.”Skinner adds that United will have to “structurally manage the game and be in it consistently” to prevail. “To beat Chelsea in a final would be another step for us,” he says. “It’s a big team, a big game and there’s no doubt it will be a tight game.”Skinner laughs when asked about the new £20m investment his rivals have received from Ohanian. “Do you know what I was thinking? I was thinking that Chelsea need a bit more money and more investment because they haven’t quite got enough,” he says. “Joking aside, I’ve said this before but I’m not a green-eyed monster. You would be envious of that budget, of course you would, but the investment probably adds more scrutiny to Sonia Bompastor because if you don’t deliver the Champions League … the challenge becomes harder in my opinion.“I do echo what Sonia said: it’s great that they want to be the frontrunners in terms of showing how we should invest in the women’s game. I don’t know how that money is going to be invested but it’s great the interest is there. I genuinely mean that, coming from someone who has been in the women’s game for so long. We have to find a way to beat that. That’s my job. But I’m sure you’ll agree, it’s fantastic for the game and hopefully more people can do that.”The respect for Chelsea also extends to the pitch but, as Skinner makes clear, that will not hold United back on Sunday. “They have achieved something incredible this season. But there is no fear.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupChelseaManchester UnitedWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eddie Howe and Newcastle have had their fair share of often lazy theories – about the manager’s future and the limits of the club’s potential – but they travel to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday having trampled all over assorted hypotheses.Should Newcastle win, Arsenal will have been beaten an unprecedented four times by one team in a single season and St James’ Park executives should feel sufficiently confident to start sprucing the stadium up for Champions League combat in early autumn.Premier League and FA Cup final: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreIn many ways Newcastle’sCarabao Cup semi-final triumphover Mikel Arteta’s team (aggregate score 4-0) and the1-0 Premier League victoryat St James’ Park last November are emblematic of their recent transformation into members of the top tier’s elite. It is a step up that, despite the Saudi Arabian cash injection in October 2021, few pundits expected to happen so quickly – and certainly not with Howe continuing at the helm.When, in November 2021, the then Bournemouth manager was offered a job rejected by first Rafael Benítez and Unai Emery, the Saudis’ third choice was widely regarded as a stopgap. All very well for averting relegation but in need of upgrading once Newcastle began challenging for Europe.Even after Howe first achieved Champions League qualification two years ago while leading Newcastle to the2023 League Cup final, a certain sniffiness endured. Early this season Manchester United’s then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, suggested to Sir Jim Ratcliffe that Howe might be a suitable successor to Erik ten Hag but United’s co-owner reportedly poured scorn on the notion, making it plain he want a coach with “more charisma”.Since then Newcastle haveovercome Liverpoolto lift the Carabao Cup, their first domestic silverware in 70 years, and could pip Arsenal to a second-place league finish.Few now doubt that a 47-year-old once described as “the fella that got Bournemouth relegated” by his St James’ Park predecessor, Steve Bruce, is an elite coach. Let alone underestimate a Newcastle side that, in order to comply with Premier League spending rules, have not signed a first-team ready player during the past three transfer windows.View image in fullscreenAnthony Gordon (right) is another player, alongside Alexander Isak, to have been linked with a move to their side’s Sunday opponents.Photograph: Richard Sellers/Getty Images/AllstarAfter watching his Arsenal players left bewildered by Howe’s switch to a back three and deployment of Fabian Schär as Declan Rice’s man-marker in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final, Arteta must wish that last autumn’s chatter about José Mourinho becoming close to Newcastle’s chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan, had resulted in a change of the managerial guard on Tyneside.Howe knew better than to react to those stories. Yet on Friday he did betray rare “frustration” with the idea that Arsenal will cherry pick Newcastle’s Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon this summer.“It’s a source of frustration because I don’t see why our players are getting linked, here, there and everywhere with other clubs,” said Howe. “I’d like to think the players are happy here. I’d like to think again that they’re seeing us grow and develop into a team that hopefully can compete at the top end of the division.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I don’t see any reason why we can’t strengthen, not weaken, ourselves.”Newcastle managers past – with Benítez the notable exception – have complained that top players, and particularly their wives and partners, simply do not want to live in the north-east. Howe, though, believes such impressions about the region are outdated.“I’ve not sensed that problem here,” he said. “I think the biggest issue with players is that they want to come to a club they believe is moving forward and has a chance to win trophies. Of course, financial terms are an issue so there are challenges. But the north-east is a brilliant place to live and I’ve never had any issues over that with new signings.”After spending most of his life in southern England, Howe arrived with an open mind. “I came in here without any knowledge of the north-east,” he said. “I’d never spent any time in the area but I’ve been pleasantly surprised. My family love it and I enjoy being here as well. There’s been no issues with it.”He also debunked ideas that the Saudis might be losing interest in disrupting the Premier League’s pecking order. “We’ve got a lot of areas to grow in,” countered Howe. “I still feel we’re just starting. There’s a totally different feel about this place to when I came in yet we still have more to deliver to be at the very elite level; we’re in the very early stages of that. But the owners’ ambition to improve is really aggressive. Things will change pretty quickly in the next few years. There’s no doubting the ambition.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But despite the diligence of the batting, that wasn’t why the people came. The only batter to get a standing ovation? Number 11: James Anderson, 309 days since his last Test, 318 days since he did a turn for Lancashire at Southport.The spectators, allowed on the field of play between innings, paused to stare at the heavy roller then drifted over to where Lancashire were warming up, phones pointed at Anderson as he flexed a hip there, shimmied through a rope ladder there.The mechanics all seemed good. Still lean as a race horse. Still wearing the fat white wristbands. Still a sharp haircut. Still immaculately turned out. He took the ball at the Jimmy Anderson End to huge applause. And back the clock wound – puffed cheeked approach, head down unwind. And if he wasn’t quite pitch perfect immediately, it only took 18 balls for him to angle in the ripest peach from the peachiest tree and clip the top of Caleb Jewell’s off stump.A second followed soon afterwards, David Lloyd, discomforted by a series of bouncers, jagging his head back but gloving behind. Anderson finished with two for 24 from his five overs and Derbyshire, four down at stumps, will see more of him on Sunday.The 22-year-old George Bell, who made a useful 57, was watching closely: “That was class. I always enjoy it when he’s bowling, especially when I’m stood in the slips, something I didn’t think I’d ever have the chance to do.

Pole position was claimed by McLaren’s Oscar Piastri but only after the session had been stopped twice because of two huge accidents, one involving Yuki Tsunoda and the other Franco Colapinto.High drama, from which both drivers emerged fortunately unhurt, was followed by an equally bruising blow which Lewis Hamilton described as leaving him “devastated”, in the form of disappointment for Ferrari fans at their home race, with a shock early exit for bothCharles Leclercand Hamilton in 11th and 12th.In the final moments, Piastri had put in a blistering lap to beat Red Bull’sMax Verstappeninto second place by just three-hundredths of a second, with Mercedes’ George Russell in third, Piastri’s McLaren teammate and title rival Lando Norris a disappointing fourth and Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso in fifth.It is all but impossible at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e DinoFerrarito escape the legacy of the death of Ayrton Senna who was killed here in an accident in 1994, the same weekend when Roland Ratzenberger died a day before in qualifying. Senna’s colours still adorn parts of the town on the walk to the circuit. His memorial, a simple brass casting of the driver in contemplation, attracts huge crowds over the race weekend and is flanked by countless flags.View image in fullscreenThe Ayrton Senna monument at Imola.Photograph: David Davies/PAThe circuit underwent major changes after that weekend for safety purposes and the sport also adopted new procedures that have proved extraordinarily successful in improving safety. Yet the fundamental challenge of some of these old-school tracks remains. Imola is still fearsomely quick and narrow, where inch-perfect commitment is rewarded but is also emphatic in punishing errors, as Tsunoda discovered, in a slight misjudgment that led to him crashing out at high speed with a major impact at the Villeneuve chicane during Q1.He had taken just a little too much kerb on the way in and was violently spat out, spinning before hitting the barriers backwards. The impact threw his car up and nearly over the tyre wall before smashing back into the ground upside down, then bouncing upright again on the track side of the barriers. He emerged and was able to walk away, appearing unhurt.Memorable F1 races at Imola, from Alonso v Schumacher to Hamilton’s hard rainRead moreIt was an exceptionally violent impact and the car’s safety cell and halo device functioned superbly to protect him.“I saw the replay, I’m like: ‘Jesus is he really OK?’” said hisRed Bullteammate Verstappen. “It was a big hit, was a big impact, a lot of damage as well but most important is that Yuki’s OK.”Russell also noted how well the car had protected the driver. “It’s great to see that he’s OK and with a crash like that it shows how impressive these cars are in a situation like that,” he said.Despite the severity of the accident Tsunoda’s overwhelming feeling was that he had let the team down. “First thing I thought was I was just very ashamed, disappointed, frustrated,” he said, having been pronounced fit at the medical centre.Shortly after the session restarted and with just seconds remaining in Q1 Colapinto, making his debut for Alpine, went wide, putting his left-rear wheel off at the exit of Tamburello. As he lost the rear, also at high speed, the car spun repeatedly and hurtled across the gravel trap before slamming into the barrier, entering front first with a jarring impact. He too was unhurt but apologetic at his error.For Ferrari, hopeful of at least putting on a decent show for thetifosiat Imola, there was only disappointment. Hamilton and Leclerc’s last laps were both marked by small errors and they then tumbled down the order as the cars behind went quicker. It left Hamilton shocked as Ferrari’s difficulties continue to hound them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norris could not match it and while Verstappen did improve in sector one he could do no better for the rest of the lap and Piastri had the place by just three-hundredths of a second with a time of 1min 14.670sec.Colapinto had set a good enough time to make it to Q2 so finished in 15th but has a one-place grid penalty for being released into the pit lane before the session had been restarted after Tsunoda’s crash. Tsunoda will start from the back of the grid.Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon were in sixth and seventh for Williams, Lance Stroll in eighth for Aston Martin and Isack Hadjar and Pierre Gasly in ninth and 10th for Racing Bulls.

I feel like it’s been a long time coming,” he said. “Last year I got so close to the Giro so many times. And for today to happen is so, so special.”Wilco Kelderman of Visma-Lease a Bike finished second while XDS-Astana’s Ulissi came in third, with both riders finishing 38 seconds behind Plapp. Ulissi’s effort was enough for him to take the overall leader’s pink jersey from Primoz Roglic, with the Italian screaming in delight when he was told the maglia rosa was his.Ulissi will be the first Italian to wear the pink jersey since Alessandro De Marchi in 2021, ending an 86-stage drought. He leads his teammate Lorenzo Fortunato by 12 seconds while Roglic is 17 seconds behind.“I don’t easily let myself be taken by emotions but when I was presented with the Maglia Rosa and saw XDS Astana stamped on it, I became emotional, I have to admit,” Ulissi said. “I’m 35, soon 36 [in July]. I’ve had nice satisfactions in my cycling career with eight stage wins at the Giro, I’ve built a nice family with three daughters. So when I first saw this jersey, I thought of all my family members, especially those who took me to races when I was a kid.”View image in fullscreenDiego Ulissi dons the maglia rosa after stage eight.Photograph: Jennifer Lorenzini/ReutersPlapp attacked with 45km to go, kicking into a high gear to leave the field behind and riding solo to the top on the Montelago climb. He stayed in the lead after taking maximum points in the fight for the blue jersey and he had a minute’s lead on the chasers while the peloton was more than six minutes behind with about 20km to go.He showed no signs of slowing down as he conquered the Gagliole climb and remained more than five minutes ahead of the peloton on the descent. “I knew I couldn’t beat any of them in a sprint so I had to go at some stage pretty early. The way the racing’s been going this year, the long moves have been really, really successful,” he said.“The first one to make a move always has an advantage. I just thought I’d give it a crack. And, to be honest, I just wanted a bit of a head start on the descent as well.”Young Briton Max Poole, 22, dropped to sixth overall – 47 seconds down – while Simon Yates sits 10th, 56 seconds off the pace.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaCyclingAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Hyde guided the team through an extensive rebuild and won manager of the year honors in 2023, but Baltimore’s performance slipped noticeably during the second half of last year, and the Orioles have put themselves in a significant hole so far in 2025.Bronx backlash for Juan Soto as Mets’ $765m star booed on Yankee Stadium returnRead more“As the head of baseball operations, the poor start to our season is ultimately my responsibility,” Orioles executive vice president and general manager Mike Elias said in a statement. “Part of that responsibility is pursuing difficult changes in order to set a different course for the future. I want to thank Brandon for his hard work, dedication and passion all these years, and for returning the team to the playoffs and winning an AL East championship.”Third base coach Tony Mansolino will serve as interim manager. The Orioles also fired major league field coordinator/catching instructor Tim Cossins.Hyde is the third major league manager fired in the last 10 days, joining Pittsburgh’s Derek Shelton and Colorado’s Bud Black.Such is the precarious life of a big league skipper.“Brandon and I are close. I love the guy,” said Nationals manager Dave Martinez, who once served with Hyde on the Cubs’ staff under Joe Maddon. “We all know what we sign up for when we take this job. It really just stinks. He’s a good man. I know he’ll land on his feet. I wish him all the best, but it’s a tough gig.”The Orioles players were informed of Hyde’s dismissal during a team meeting headed by Elias, about four hours before Baltimore was to host the Nationals.“Pretty surprised, honestly,” starting pitcher Cade Povich said. “It’s not something you expect to come in the morning and hear.”Outfielder Ramón Laureano said, “That’s unfortunate because Brandon Hyde is a great guy. We, as players, have got to play better. The players are the ones with the bats and gloves.”Hyde was in his seventh season as Baltimore’s manager. He endured seasons of 108 and 110 losses early on, but by 2023, the Orioles won the AL East with 101 victories – and the future looked incredibly bright thanks to young standouts like infielder Gunnar Henderson, catcher Adley Rutschman and right-hander Grayson Rodriguez.Baltimore had other top prospects in the organization as well, but after a 49-25 start last year, the Orioles played sub-.500 baseball the rest of the way and settled for a wild card. For a second straight season, Baltimore was swept out of the playoffs in their first series.Then came an offseason in which ace Corbin Burnes left via free agency, and the front office tried to patch up the rotation with one-year stopgaps like Charlie Morton, Tomoyuki Sugano and Kyle Gibson. Sugano has pitched well but the other two haven’t, and the Orioles have the worst ERA in the American League at 5.31.Meanwhile, an offense that was supposed to be the team’s strength has been spotty. Rutschman is batting .214, Ryan Mountcastle is at .233 and Cedric Mullins has slumped all the way to .226 after a good start.All that probably isn’t Hyde’s fault. But the organization hopes things change under Mansolino, who’s been the third base coach for the Orioles since 2021 after working in Cleveland’s minor league system from 2011-20.“It hurts,” infielder Ramón Urías said of Hyde’s firing. “I feel like we let him down. But obviously we’re looking forward to changing things around mentally.”The organization apparently decided that removing Hyde now was better than standing pat through the summer.“Sometimes the case in baseball, change becomes necessary, and we believe this is one of those moments,” owner David Rubenstein said.The Orioles are hitting .192 with runners in scoring position, the worst mark in baseball. Friday’s 4-3 loss to the Nationals was a microcosm of the season so far. Baltimore left 15 men on base and allowed the winning run to score from second on an infield single in the top of the ninth.Top prospects Heston Kjerstad and Coby Mayo haven’t produced much, and injuries to Colton Cowser, Jordan Westburg and Tyler O’Neill have hurt the lineup as well. And the pitching staff could afford health problems even less. Rodriguez and reliever Andrew Kittredge haven’t pitched at all this year, and Zach Eflin missed time as well.The team’s poor start has put Elias under scrutiny after what looked like a very successful rebuild. If the Orioles don’t climb back into contention this year, he will be under a lot of pressure next offseason to bring the team back to the path it appeared to be on less than a year ago.Explore more on these topicsBaltimore OriolesMLBBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Game 1 is Wednesday night in Manhattan.The Knicks’ transition from laughing stock to title contenders is completeRead moreNew York overcame a sloppy opening quarter to lead by as many as 41 points during a non-competitive second half in front of a rollicking, celebrity-flecked crowd that included Timothée Chalamet, Ben Stiller, Bad Bunny and Lenny Kravitz. It marked the first time New York closed out a playoff series on their home floor since the strike-shortened season of 1999, when they reached theNBAfinals as a No 8 seed. Additionally, the 38-point margin of victory set a franchise playoff record.“I thought from start to finish we were terrific,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said afterwards. “[The Celtics] are a terrific team on both sides of the ball. They play their style no matter what, and so they’re not going to hand you anything. You have to earn it. And I felt we did that.“But we can’t get carried away. Obviously it’s a great win and we advance. But you also understand that you have to get ready for the next series. We know that Indiana is a terrific team and we’re going to have to be ready.”Boston’s doomed title defense ended with a whimper uncharacteristic of their team in the Brad Stevens era. The Celtics, who had staved off elimination in the best-of-seven-games series witha convincing Game 5 win, were blown off the floor in a display that lacked the grit, execution and fighting spirit that defined last season’s championship run. Missing Jayson Tatum afterhis season-ending achilles injuryin Game 4, Boston’s depleted supporting cast of Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser struggled to make an impact, failing to score either before or during the Knicks’ decisive 17-4 run that opened up a 33-20 advantage, New York’s biggest lead of the series to that point.“In Game 5 they got the best of us and we responded tonight,” Brunson said. “We just found a way to keep making plays on the defensive side, the offense was just rolling.”View image in fullscreenThe Knicks’ Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 21 points in Friday night’s win.Photograph: Frank Franklin II/APThat surge, sparked by Mikal Bridges’ perimeter shooting and Karl-Anthony Towns’ inside presence, ballooned into a 64-37 half-time advantage. Bridges drained four three-pointers on his way to 22 points, while Towns added 21, dominating Boston’s thin frontline. Josh Hart chipped in with a triple-double of 10 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists, marking New York’s first postseason triple-double since Walt Frazier in 1972.The Knicks kept their foot on the gas after the break, stretching their lead to as many as 41 points as Boston coach Joe Mazzulla began pulling his starters midway through the third quarter. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 20 points before fouling out before the final period, but his efforts came in isolation as New York’s defense forced Boston into rushed shots and clumsy turnovers. “At the end of the day, we set a goal out, and we didn’t achieve that goal,” Mazzulla said. “But you have to take your hats off to the Knicks. They played a great series and they’ve been great all year, and Thibs is a great coach.New York shot 46.2% from the field, including 16 of 46 (34.8%) from three-point range following a frigid start. The Knicks also dominated the glass, outrebounding Boston 55-36, while holding the Celtics to just 36% shooting and 29.3% from beyond the arc.After the final buzzer sounded, fans poured out of Madison Square Garden into the humid Manhattan night to join the awaiting masses along Seventh Avenue, chanting “Knicks in six!” and “Fuck you Boston!” as police barricades struggled to keep the crowds from spilling into traffic. Fire engine horns blared while fans scaled light poles and subway canopies.New York’s Game 6 demolition was a statement of intent, solidifying their return to the NBA’s elite after decades of mediocrity. It will also rekindle memories of those classic Knicks-Pacers showdowns, with Madison Square Garden now set to host Indiana in a throwback to their bruising battles of the 90s. For the first time in a generation, the Knicks will play a conference final series with genuine aspirations of returning to the NBA summit for the first time since 1973.“This is great. I mean, the fact that we haven’t been here since my dad was on the team – he’s not gonna like that – but it means a lot to this organization and this city,” Brunson said.Explore more on these topicsNBANew York KnicksBoston CelticsBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But it shines a light on a universal issueSat 17 May 2025 09.00 EDTShareJustice for Valeria MárquezValeria Márquez was killedin one of the most horrifically public ways possible. On Tuesday evening, the 23-year-old Mexican social media influencer, who had built up a large following with videos about beauty and makeup, was recording a TikTok livestream in the beauty salon where she worked in Jalisco, a state in west-central Mexico. A man entered the establishment and, with her video still running, shot her dead.Many details of the case are still unclear. However, Márquez’s death is being investigated as a femicide, according to a statement by the Jalisco state prosecutor.Femicide isdefinedas the intentional killing of a woman or girl with gender-related motivations. (The term for killing males because of their sex, something that has occurred during war andgenocide, is androcide.)While femicide is a universal and age-old issue, it is poorly understood. It is also sometimes wilfully misunderstood by some men’s rights activists, who like to argue that it is a nonexistent problem because men make upthe majority of victims(and perpetrators) of homicide. So it’s worth spelling out the parameters of femicide. If a woman is killed in a robbery gone wrong, that’s (probably) not femicide. If she is killed by an ex-boyfriend who views women as the property of men rather than autonomous human beings, that’s femicide. “Honour”-related killings are also obviously femicide.We are missing a lot of data on femicide. “Too many victims of femicide still go uncounted: for roughly four in 10 intentional murders of women and girls, there is not enough information to identify them as gender-related killings because of national variation in criminal justice recording and investigation practices,”UN Women wrote in a report last year.Naming the problem – understanding why femicide is different from homicide – is important, because it helps us solve it. If more institutions took misogyny and domestic violence seriously, we’d see fewer dead women. A report bythe World Health Organization notes, for example, that “stronger gun laws related to men previously cited for or convicted of intimate partner abuse are of particular importance in reducing rates of femicide”.Justice for Márquez doesn’t just involve finding her killer and ensuring they are punished. If this was femicide, it means being very clear about the misogyny that led to her death. It means holding all the lawmakers and institutions that perpetuate this misogyny to account. Justice means understanding that her death wasn’t some sort of tragic one-off, but part of a far larger problem.Biden still thinks he could have beaten Trump. Do we really need this? | Arwa MahdawiRead more“If I die, I want a loud death,” the Palestinianphotojournalist Fatima Hassounawrote on social media shortly before she was killed by an Israeli airstrike this year. “I don’t want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear, an impact that will remain through time … ”That quote has haunted me ever since I read it. So many women who die premature and violent deaths die quiet deaths. They become statistics. Márquez must not just become another femicide statistic. Let her death, which has shone a spotlight on femicide, be loud. Let it have an impact that will remain through time.Donald Trump, legally defined sexual predator, posts that Taylor Swift is ‘no longer hot’The president is obsessed with Swift and hasposted aboutthe pop star multiple times.The US military buys a LOT of ViagraThe big Viagra budget, which has beenwidely discussed for years, isn’t problematic in itself. The issue is that while the government has no problem spending this money on what is arguably gender-affirming care for cis men, it keeps yelling that trans people are a drain on resources. The issue is in the news once again after a judge in theTalbott v USA case, which challenges Trump’s transgender military ban, noted that the militaryspends eight times more on erectile dysfunction medicationthan on gender-affirming care for trans service members.British woman unknowingly had a criminal record for 56 years for being a lesbianLiz Stead, 78, got kicked out of the military in 1969 when higher-ups sniffed out proof (a love letter) of Sapphic activity. She was also given a criminal conviction for “perceived same-sex sexual activity”. As the BBC reports, she only found outabout the convictionwhen applying for a scheme that awards financial redress for veterans sacked during a ban on homosexuality.Ms Rachel is getting vile abuse for caring about dead and maimed Palestinian childrenDue to the fact that Israelisn’t allowing international journalistsinto Gaza andmurderingthe Palestinian journalists and aid workers who are trapped in the enclave, it’s impossible to really know how many children have been killed orstarved to deathby now. But we know there aremore child amputeesin Gaza than anywhere else in the world and,by one estimate, Israel kills a child in Gaza every 45 minutes. We also know that young children who do survive will never recover from beingmalnourishedand traumatized in those formative years. While many people stay silent about agenocidethat has been funded and enabled by the US, UK and Europe, the children’s educator and entertainer Rachel Accurso (known and loved by parents of toddlers everywhere as Ms Rachel) has been speaking upabout children in Gaza. And, quite predictably, she’s gettingvile abusefor it – including a piece in theNew York Timesthat amplifies baseless, ridiculous and dangerous claims that shemay be funded by Hamas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that distracts from a bigger problemSat 17 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 17 May 2025 07.01 EDTShareWith anew book outabout Joe Biden’s failed re-election campaign, a media reckoning is in full swing.It goes something like this: mainstream journalism failed the voters. Reporters were complicit; they didn’t tell us how much the elderly president had declined. They didn’t dig beneath the surface of whatBidenaides were doing as they covered up the physical and cognitive decline of the leader of the free world.And some of that is valid, no doubt. Under fire in recent days,CNN’s Jake Tapper, co-author of Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, has even nodded to his own role in downplaying Biden’s increasing frailty.Biden destroyed Harris bid by staying in race too long, top adviser says in bookRead moreThere’s plenty of blame to go around for Biden’s ultimate loss – and the horrors that it brought the whole world in the election of Donald Trump to a second term.Bruce Springsteen laid it outto a concert audience last week as he opened his European tour: “My home, the America I love, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”As a media critic, I’m always happy to see a good reckoning for the mainstream press.But this one makes me wonder. When is the reckoning coming for the failures to cover Trump effectively?At what point will there be a general acknowledgment and some serious self-scrutiny about the way big media failed to adequately convey what would happen if Trump were elected again?“I have a hard time watching journalists high-five each other over books on [the White House] covering up for Biden,”wrote the political scientist and scholar Norman Ornstein, one of the sanest commentators about politics in recent years.It’s “a diversion from their own deep culpability in Trump’s election”.What would be the elements of this reckoning?Here’s Ornstein again on what the mainstream press wrought with their hubris and their failures.“False equivalence, normalizing the abnormal, treating Trump as no real danger were the norm, not the exception.”From 2015 – when Trump first declared his candidacy for president – right through the 2024 election, the press in general didn’t get across the reality.When the New York Times infamously set the tone in 2016 by vastly overplaying the supposedly shocking scandal of Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server, that was only the beginning. But it was a consequential beginning since, even in our fragmented and polarized media system, the Times was then, and is now, still extremely influential.I’ve long believed that Times editors were so dedicated to proving that they could be tough on Candidate Clinton – convinced she would be the president and that Trump was no real threat – that they went way overboard.Was the fault for electing Trump entirely theirs or even the fault of the mainstream media in general led by them? Of course not. But they played a destructive role, one that has never been adequately acknowledged.Then, during Trump’s first term – and especially during the 2024 campaign – the mainstream press constantly normalized the would-be autocrat.The ever-so-apt term “sanewashing” was born to describe what was going on, and the media’s role. Talk about a cover-up. Trump’s rallies were exercises in lunacy, as he spun tales about sharks and Hannibal Lecter, rambling for hours.But the coverage seldom came close to getting across the reality. Instead, we’d hear descriptions about his “freewheeling” style or “brash” approach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs for the autocracy in waiting, there were excellent stories about the blueprint for his second term known asProject 2025, but it was far from obvious whether news leaders stopped to ask if voters really understood the stakes. Now we see the Trump administration quite literally enacting that same Project 2025 that he claimed he barely knew anything about.Horserace coverage prevailed, day after day. And then, when Biden’s decline became impossible to ignore – after that earth-shattering presidential debate last June – news organizations changed their tune.For weeks, there was nothing but “hey, Biden is old” coverage, once again failing to put the emphasis where it belonged: on the dangers of a Trump presidency.Heads of news organizations and reporters themselves are fond of distancing themselves from their real mission at times like these: to communicate the reality of an election’s actual stakes. Instead, they talk in lofty terms of merely covering the news, as if their daily decisions about the volume, choice and tone of coverage didn’t matter.It certainly mattered just before the 2016 election, when the entiretop of a front page– and many an evening newscast – were given over to the reigniting of the justice department’s investigation of Clinton’s emails.It certainly mattered when influential opinion sections were ceaselessly baying about Biden’s cognitive decline last summer in order to force him out of the race.Despite wishful thinking, there’s no such thing as “just the facts” or complete neutrality, because editorial decisions and reporting choicesalwaysmatter.What do you investigate? What is the precise wording of that news alert? How prominently do you display that story? Whom do you quote and to whom do you grant anonymity? What photo do you choose? Do you use terms like “straining the bounds of propriety” to describe what looks more like a bribe?So if the media were going to put their thumb on the scale – as they inevitably do – they ought to have done so in defense of democracy, the rule of law and human decency.The failure to do so is playing out in our shattered world, and at a frightening pace.That’s a reckoning we ought to have, but I doubt we ever will.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS press and publishingOpinionUS elections 2024Joe BidenDonald TrumpUS elections 2016US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

They asked how I was feeling about the result, a big and complicated question.Many Canadians I know feel immense relief at what they see as Canada’s rejection of the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre’s,Trump-style brand. But underneath it simmers dread about what might be coming down the pipeline.After all, a good chunk of the country dislikes (and even despises) the Liberal party. There’s the comment I heard about leaving the country if the Liberals get re-elected. The disinformation-laced lament from a small business owner about refugees and “woke” ideology. The friend who insisted Carney, not Poilievre, is more Trump-like. The Conservative stronghold of Alberta is so upset with the result itmight holda referendum on leaving the country. Danielle Smith, Alberta’s far-right premier, saidpeople in her province are “hurt and betrayed” that Canada re-elected the Liberals. Meanwhile, Poilievre has vowed to stay on as Conservative leader, with apending byelectionto secure him a seat in a reliably Tory riding.It’s still common to see “Fuck Trudeau” stickers, buttons and flags, even in the area around Toronto where I live. It’s a reminder that our former prime minister has become a bogeyman whom the Conservatives blame for everything. I’ve yet to see anything “Fuck Carney” but know it’s only a matter of time. The merchandise isalready for saleon Amazon. “Perfect,”says one reviewer. “Stupid af,” says another.The starkness of Canada’s polarisation is one of the election’s most significant outcomes. Some people fear we will fully descend into a two-party system, stuck in the kind of gridlock that has plagued the US. Certainly, the left-of-centre New Democratic party (NDP) – and to a lesser extent the separatistBloc Québécoisparty – fell victim to progressive voters’ fears of Donald Trump and Poilievre. The NDP won so few parliamentary seats that it lost official party status. But more noteworthy, and concerning, is theshift of some NDP supportersto the Conservatives, part of a broader trend of rightwing parties that had spent decades bashing unions refashioning themselves as pro-worker. (Or, in Poilievre’s parlance: “Boots, not suits!”)2:53Trump and Carney discuss US-Canada relations in tense meeting – video highlightsCanada has by no means escaped the rise of far-right politics plaguing the US, the UK and parts of Europe. The movement has grown and ranks highly withyoung voters,especially men. The Poilievre-Conservative victory we all thought was imminent a few months ago might be delayed, not thwarted. As one CBC commentatornoted on election night, Poilievre’s concession speech sounded a lot like the start of his next campaign.Existential issues plague this country: increasing impacts from the climate crisis, with deep divisions over the future of Canadian oil and gas; social media platforms saturated with misinformation, aconsequenceof Meta blocking news on its Canadian apps; chronic violations ofIndigenous sovereignty; million-dollar “starter homes”; corporate monopolies that have seized multiple industries; and more and more Canadiansrelying on food banks.So to answer my former colleague’s question: I feel like Canada’s driving on a dangerous highway at a dizzying speed. We swerved to avoid what would have been a deadly accident, but we’re still on that highway – in a clunky gas-guzzling SUV, I imagine, with outdated machinery.And then, of course, there’s Trump, questioning Canadian sovereignty and saying in hismeeting with Carneylast week that there’s nothing Carney can say to get him to drop the tariffs that are alreadyhurting Canadians.“Why not?” a journalist asked.Trump shrugged. “Just the way it is.”Handshakes, friendship and ‘never, never, never, never, never’: five takeaways from Carney-Trump meetingRead moreJust the way it is– a simple but slippery phrase that describes the impossible situation Canada and our new prime minister find ourselves in. A situation that has been, to some extent, decades in the making. For my entire life, Canada has edged closer to the US, assuming it would always be friendly. I think of my dad, who moved to Canada from the UK when he was 17, saying that if he knew Canada would become so Americanised, he might have stayed in Britain.Deep down, I think most Canadians understand the extent of the damage Trump can inflict, if he so chooses. But it’s something few people care to admit. I understand why. We are at the whim of the US’s authoritarian president. Poilievre can tell Trump to “knock it off” and Carney canremind himthere’s some real estate that’s not for sale. But more and more, it seems like there’s no line Trump won’t cross, if he wants to.In 1969, Canada’s prime minister, Pierre Trudeau, father to the much-maligned Justin,comparedliving next to the US to “sleeping with an elephant”. “No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt,” Trudeau said.Every twitch and grunt. Every intrusion on to what you thought was your side of the bed. Every yank of the duvet and gulp from your water cup.Just the way it is. Just the way it has become.Carney has perhaps the toughest job of any Canadian prime minister in recent memory. He must renegotiate Canada’s relationship with the US as it descends into fascism. Behind him is a divided country with divided interests.The election’s over, but we are in for a bumpy ride.Melissa Jean Gismondi is an award-winning Canada-based writer and audio producerExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionMark CarneyThe far rightDonald TrumpAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

Usually –remember the pandemic– Mr Crisis arrives unexpectedly and noisily and leaves Ms Opportunity sitting in the car drawing up lists of transformative things that might be done.The enormity of this moment, when the Australian people have acknowledged the crises but signalled they want decisive action – by electing a stable majority government that no longer needs to jump at aMurdoch-shaped shadow– should not be underestimated.This crisis is global thanks to climate change, a capricious rule-bending American president, a concentration of wealth almost without precedent and digital colonisation. And it is local. It affects the quality of life and safety, economic diversity and robustness, intergenerational equity and the foundational flaw of failing to meaningfully recognise the First Peoples.Anthony Albanese’s new cabinet suggests cautious PM will pick his battlesRead moreMs Opportunity has lots of ideas about how these crises might be addressed in a way that endures for decades, reshapes the economy, strengthens social relations and even, when she is feeling particularly ambitious, sets an example for the rest of the world.It has been done before – when Mr Crisis was big enough and his ambition unchecked. Solving it used to be calledthe Australian way, generally drawing on warning expert reports written a decade before. So the time is now right for the inquiries commissioned during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years.Ms Opportunity has read many of the reports: Garnaut on the climate opportunity, Henry on tax reform, the Asian century report, Gonski on education, Treasury on intergenerational equity, the referendum council, Uluru statement and Calma Langton reports on robust First Nations recognition.She knows that all these documents – and many others – were compiled by experts who consulted widely and distilled the best way forward. Sadly, most have since been gathering dust, jettisoned to a digital archive where a 404 error message is the likely result of a cursory search.When Jim Chalmers listed the achievements of Labor’s first term and the prospects for the second onInsiders after the election, his pride was palpable and well deserved. He was an adviser to the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, when many of these reports were written, and he saw the brutal pushback from miners and otherswhose interests were threatened. But he is now in a stronger position than any treasurer during that time.There is an important lesson from the Hawke government, in getting beyond the details to clearly address the bigger picture. It was elected promising to restructure the Australian economy, which had been enfeebled by protectionist policies and a lack of ambition.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBob Hawke’s last campaign event in 1983 was in Wollongong; the steel industry was on the brink of collapse. Five months earlier thousands of sacked workers had travelled to Canberra to be heard. Malcolm Fraser refused to meet them, and in furious despair the crowdsurged up the steps of old parliament house, breaking the glass doors and finding themselves in Kings Hall.Hawke’s Wollongong visit did not condone the action but he listened and acknowledged the crisis. He promised a steel plan, but did not say he would float the dollar or deregulate the economy. He used his narrative gifts to promise arestructured economy. In the process he and Paul Keating crafted a unique Australian model, neoliberalism with a heart. It was not perfect, but it was a lot better than it might otherwise have been.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is no longer the unionsstorming the parliamentbut people who are passionate about using the current crises to create another Australian moment – many who coalesced around the community independent movement.It is an enormous credit to the prime minister that he has won such overwhelming support from the Australian people. Many of the first-term achievements and promises for the second are important and have the potential to affect many lives.But, with some exceptions, most are gifts plucked from a more complex policy problem – reducing personal taxes a little, increasing government support for early childhood education, helping with energy bills, increasing bulk billing, increasing multinational company tax transparency, implementing Gonski, reducing Hecs debts a bit.There are no plans to implement a thorough review of the tax system to ensure a better mix between taxes on capital and individuals, nor to restore universities as a driver of economic and social possibility, nor transform the economy to take advantage of the green transition, nor challenge the for-profit mode of aged care and childcare and housing. There is no plan for meaningful Indigenous recognition.It is important to remember that despite the overwhelming numbers in the House of Representatives, many Labor members found their way to the government benches with the help of those who voted for Greens and independent candidates. This will now play out in the Senate, which is again poised to be the place where the innovative ideas generated on the ground by experts and through the committee process find their way into law and a new Australian way where a strong party listens and produces a national legacy, turning crisis into opportunity.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of Australia and Steel City BluesExplore more on these topicsAnthony AlbaneseOpinionAustralian politicsLabor partycommentShareReuse this content"

Good – now we might have to face realityJason OkundayeIn 2015, the UK placed first on the rainbow map. But even then, as an 18-year-old gay man, I knew that wasn’t the whole storySat 17 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 17 May 2025 06.14 EDTShareIt should surprise no one that the UK has dropped to its lowest ever position on theannual “rainbow map” of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA), which ranks the best and worst European countries on the basis of laws and policies that affect LGBTQ+ people. The map assesses each country throughseven categories, including equality and non-discrimination, legal gender recognition and asylum.Thesupreme court’s rulinglast month that a person’s sex in the Equality Act 2010 refers only to “biological sex” – a redefining of trans people’s rights to their detriment, and a political and cultural victory for the gender critical movement – will have played a key role in the downgrading. Senior politicians immediately capitulated to the ruling,interpreting the implicationsof the verdict beyond the scope of the court, with the gay health secretary evenrenouncing his own supportfor the notion that “trans women are women”. Meanwhile, the Scottish government hasdropped plansto legislate for a ban on conversion therapy during this parliamentary session. At this rate of progress the ranking will be even lower next year, as it should be.While I despair at the UK’s decline on LGBTQ+ rights, I do not despair at the ranking. In 2015, the year I turned 18 and began to live as an openly gay man, the UK was ranked first on the rainbow map. Times were different then. There was a sense that the coalition and later Conservative government was on the side of LGBTQ+ people. Same-sex marriage had been legalised in 2013, David Cameron called for action totackle transphobic bullying, and in 2017 Theresa May wouldannounce reformto the gender recognition act to allow people to change gender without medical checks.It is tempting to be wistful for those days, but I had always found there to be a grating smugness to Britain’s celebration of its supposed progressiveness. Even the entire basis of the rainbow map, first published in 2009, felt suspect; I’m sure that it is innocently intended to provide analysis of LGBTQ+ rights in Europe, but so often metrics like this have been mobilised to present western, European countries as bastions of progress where countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East represented a backwards order.But that backwardness has always been present in the UK, including when we topped the rainbow map ranking. How could a country that had obliged LGBTQ+ asylum seekers to submit footage of “highly personal sexual activity” toback up asylum claimsever be held up as the pinnacle of European social progress (unless it was determined that some LGBTQ+ people counted more than others). Even with such practices from the Home Office, the UKscored positively on asylumin 2015.View image in fullscreenKate Litman marching for Alice with her parents and brother at Trans Pride 2022, London.Photograph: @kate__litman / XIn any case, the pretence has now dropped. Labourpledged a “fully trans-inclusive ban”on conversion therapy in its 2024 manifesto. Starmer has not mentioned the issue once since the King’s speech. LGBTQ+ people are no longer politically expedient – and trans people attract too much hostility, division and controversy – so advocacy for our collective rights no longer seems to be a priority. This is a disaster, but it is also instructive for future strategy: those activists who believed that legislative wins can secure true equality or progress, and that social progressivism was the natural order of history, are now seeing the consequences of such a delusion.One of the recommendations for how the UK can improve its standing in next year’s rainbow map is to “ensure timely and accessible trans healthcare, including addressing excessive waiting times and restoring access to puberty blockers for trans youth” – provision of which has beenindefinitely bannedfollowing the Cass review of April 2024. Alice Litman, a 20-year-old transgender woman,died by suicide in 2022after spending 1,023 days waiting for her first appointment with the now disbanded Gender Identity Development Service. I spoke to her sister, Kate, a university friend of mine, who, with her family, formed theCampaign for Alice. She told me that at Alice’s inquest it was heard that, if processes continued at the current rate, those entering the waiting list today would face amore than 20-year waitbefore their first appointment.Such delays had made Alice’s life “intolerable”, but added to that was “the general atmosphere of hostility towards trans people and her anxiety and fear about participating in public life”. I have previously spoken with trans people who had come out and transitioned around the so-calledtransgender tipping pointin the mid-2010s. Not all are convinced that they would do the same in the current political environment. As a lesbian woman, Kate feels further indignation that such regress has been presented as a “victory for lesbians”. She says “my identity is politicised and weaponised in a way that is antithetical to my beliefs.”Political parties banned from Pride events after UK gender rulingRead moreSo what is the roadmap for progress now? For the Campaign for Alice, some level of political will is needed to effect the “simple changes” to trans healthcare, such asproviding the fundingand training to enable GPs to prescribe hormones that could prevent further tragedies. Such will has disappeared from senior politicians. That today’s government would enact May’s pledges to ease gender transition is unthinkable.Repealing the 2022 Nationality and Borders Actwould facilitate LGBTQ+ asylum seekers to find safe residence with dignity, but Starmer’srecent rhetoric indicatesthat this problem will only worsen.For now, what is most important is clarity over who is truly on the side of LGBTQ+ people and who or what we can rely on. Following the supreme court ruling, organisers of upcoming summer Pride events in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Brightonhave banned political partiesfrom participating. That feels like a welcome recognition of reality: solidarity is to be found within our communities, and not in the whims of politicians who seek to divide and exploit us.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

Treat it as suchDhananjayan Sriskandarajah is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation and author of Power to the PeopleSat 17 May 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 17 May 2025 13.48 EDTShareOnce again, it’s the Hinduja family. Gopi Hinduja and his family, who run the Hinduja Group, arecitedas Britain’s richest family in the latest Sunday Times rich list. The big story so far seems to be that their wealth has dropped to £35.3bn from £37.2bn the year before. But that story, and much of the discussion there will be this weekend, risks missing therealstory. “Rich list” is barely the right description for the extreme wealth we should be talking about.In 1989, when the Sunday Times first published its annual rich list, to be included someone would need to have 6,000 times the wealth of the average person in the UK. That’s already a pretty big gap – but this has now tripled to more than 18,000 times the average, according toa studyby the University of Greenwich.The problem is that wealth begets wealth. Those who own land, property and shares have seen huge returns on these investments and been able to accumulate more assets over time, generating even more returns. To make things worse, while income inequality can be tempered by measures like a minimum wage or progressive taxes, policymakers seem unable or unwilling to do anything about wealth accumulation.Successive governments have claimed to be for “working people” but have turned a blind eye to the fact that most wealth accumulation in recent decades has been through the passive collection of returns on existing wealth, rather than earned through hard work or entrepreneurial brilliance. Worst of all, there is no upper limit on how much an individual or family can acquire. Instead, we are asked to celebrate the vast fortunes of the super-rich and watch passively as we hurtle towards the world’s first trillionaires. One thing that could help curb the excesses of wealth inequality is an “extreme wealth line”, an idea that is starting to gain traction among campaigners and policy experts.Decades ago, economists at the World Bank formulated an extreme poverty line by calculating how much money someone would need to buy enough food and essentials to survive each day. That innovation helped us compare poverty across countries and eras, and helped policymakers prioritise interventions to reduce poverty. It was also an ethical statement: the point below which a society should not let any household fall.Today, I believe we need an equivalent line for the other end of the spectrum: the point above which a society should not let any household accumulate wealth, and above which policymakers should act proactively to curb wealth accumulation.View image in fullscreenThe Sunday Times rich list storyPhotograph: Sunday TimesThere is a point above which wealth gives you too much power to shape politics through lobbying, party donations or freebies, just as there is a point above which the environmental impacts of super-rich lifestyles cause extreme harm to the environment. And a point above which wealth concentration undermines economic competition and reduces productive investment. Meanwhile, rising inequality tears at the social fabric that binds us together. We risk becoming an island of have-yachts and have-nots, rather than an island of strangers.This is where it gets tricky. If you ask what that point is, you get a range of answers. Is it when someone becomes a billionaire? Is it the top 1% of wealth holders? Is it €10m, the suggestion made by the Dutch writer Ingrid Robeyns in her excellent bookLimitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth?Here’s where the work done by the compilers of the rich list to tot up the value of land, property, shares and “other assets such as art and racehorses” of the super-rich might come in handy. Turns out you need net assets of £350m to make it into this year’s list. I’m not sure whether they intended it, but this is about 1,000 times the medianhouseholdwealth in Great Britain. Interestingly, a recent surveyfoundnearly two-thirds of millionaires from G20 countries think wealth poses a risk to society when someone has 1,000 times the societal median. Even the rich think there is a line.King Charles’s wealth swells to match Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty on UK rich listRead moreI would love to put these options to a citizens’ assembly and ask a representative sample of British people to consider the evidence, hear the arguments, and come up with a point above which wealth should be considered extreme. Without some kind of independent understanding of when wealth becomes harmful, there will be the option to obfuscate, impede and nullify attempts to rein in extreme wealth harms.Finding a democratic way of defining an extreme wealth line could finally give politicians the mandate and a framework to tackle inequality before it is too late. It would give the chancellor a solid rationale for raising tax rates on those whose wealth exceeds the line. If she is not prepared to go that far, tax and inheritance rules could be changed to compel the rich to donate wealth above the line to charity. If even that feels too audacious, government could limit the inheritance that any nepo baby could have to below the extreme wealth line.Last week Bill Gatespledgedto give away 99% of his fortune, quoting an 1889essay(The Gospel of Wealth) by tycoon Andrew Carnegie, who wrote: “The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” This is admirable, but it is naive and dangerous for society to rely on the enlightened philanthropist to curb inequality. We need to stop glorifying wealth through rich lists and start drawing a line on extreme wealth.Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation and author of Power to the PeopleExplore more on these topicsRich listsOpinionInequalitySunday TimescommentShareReuse this content"

His deal with the European Union will provide answersTom BaldwinAfter a week of bruising criticism, the PM will show what he really stands for when he signs a pivotal agreement with BrusselsSat 17 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 17 May 2025 10.59 EDTShareKeir Starmer has had to grow a thicker skin over the past few years, but there are times when critics can still get under it. One such moment came this week, when he replied to a question about whether there was “any belief he holds which survives a week in Downing Street” bysnapping back: “Yes, the belief that she talks rubbish.”He probably knows it wasn’t a great response, not least because the MP who provoked this flash of tetchiness, Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts, is far from being the most deserving recipient. By way of explanation, if not justification, it’s worth pointing out that Starmer’s emotions were already pretty raw this week after asuspected arson attackon his family home in north London. And he was also frustrated that his announcement of proposals for lowering immigration numbers had been interpreted as dancing to Nigel Farage’s divisive tune, or even a deliberate echo of the overtly racist one played by Enoch Powell half a century ago.The best evidence that such attacks are well wide of the mark will be provided in London on Monday, when the prime minister signs a new deal with theEuropean Union.The precise wording is still being thrashed out this weekend amid the usual jumble of acronyms – SPS, ECJ, SDP, ETS – that can make European politics seem so impenetrable. Their meaning will doubtless be further obscured when Reform and the Tories blow stale breath into overinflated claims about it being a “betrayal” of Britain’s 2016 referendum on leaving the EU. And the impact on people’s lives probably won’t be entirely clear until further negotiations are completed on the detail. “This is a process, not a single event,” said one of those close to the talks yesterday.But the real significance is that they show that Britain has turned away from the very narrow, exclusionary idea of sovereignty – a go-it-alone nation that needed no one else to survive and thrive – that was at the heart of Powell’s post-imperial beliefs and provided the intellectual underpinning for the Brexit that Farage did so much to bring about.It is striking to hear Downing Street’s most senior advisers now describe how the threats facing Britain, from Vladimir Putin’s Russia to the climate crisis, are respectful neither of national sovereignty nor borders. “The way to tackle them all is with international cooperation,” one told me. But Starmer is not starry-eyed about the EU’s intentions. He knows it will do its best to extract painful concessions from the UK. At the same time, the government is still constrained by its election promises that ruled out rejoining the single market and a customs union or allowing freedom of movement with the EU.Even so, these “red lines” no longer seem so daunting as they once did. One catalyst for this change has been the recognition that the US is no longer a stable ally since Donald Trump resumed residence in the White House. The new security and defence pact being signed on Monday will not only enable democratic nations on this continent to coordinate the rearmament needed to protect Ukraine and defend themselves against Russia, but also make British military manufacturing firms eligible to bid for at least some of vast funding available from EU procurement contracts.Similarly, the shock of Trump’s tariffs has made it all the more imperative for the UK to have a closer trading relationship with the EU, with a deal finally being agreed on easing barriers for livestock and fresh food products. There will be cries of pain about any “food-for-fish” compromise that gives EU boats access to British waters, but the proposed agreement should also make it much easier for small traders to export seafood to Europe. Although plans to link the UK’s carbon emissions trading scheme with that in the EU may trigger scary headlines in rightwing newspapers about potential consequences for household energy bills, a deal is now regarded as essential and urgent to securing manufacturing jobs – not least at the steel plants of Scunthorpe.Downing Street is more robust than it would have been a few months ago about facing down opposition to “dynamic alignment” with EU rules to gain access to food and energy markets, or giving a role for the European court of justice in settling disputes. Advisers believe there is little appetite for such Brexit-era sovereignty arguments among voters who are more concerned about jobs and living standards.Although the Home Office remains fixated on reducing numbers of immigrants, Monday will see a “statement of intent” on agreeing a fixed number of visas for a youth mobility scheme between the UK and the EU, as well as some warm words about easing travel restrictions for musicians touring Europe. Further work needs to be done on data sharing to combat illegal immigration, but progress is being made on restoring some of the pre-Brexit cooperation on allowing the speedy return of asylum seekers to countries where they first claimed refugee status.What runs through all of this is not some ideological remainer-ish desire for Britain to rejoin the EU, but a series of calculations about pursuing the national interest on jobs, protecting borders and defending some recognisably British values. Some people may not like his choices, while others will complain that he changes his mind. But the best answer to the question of what Starmer really believes in and stands for is that, at a dangerous time in a very turbulent world, this prime minister is a relentless, hard-headed and rather patriotic pragmatist.Tom Baldwin is a journalist and former senior adviser to the Labour party.

Will the revolution’s children do the same?Larisa FaberSunday’s election could threaten the country’s place in Europe if Russia’s dark arts and historical amnesia win the daySat 17 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 17 May 2025 12.43 EDTShareSomewhere in my attic, among my rather extensive Polly Pocket and Barbie dolls collection, there’s a poster by the Romanian caricaturist Mihai Stănescu gathering dust. Truth be told it isn’t mine, it’s my mother’s. She passed it on to me a while ago and it spent most of my early adulthood taped to my bedroom door. On one line the poster reads “Before: EU – RO – PA”, with the RO dropping out. Beneath it: “After22 December 1989: EUROPA” with the RO restored: Romania finally a part of Europe again.Stănescu was one of the few caricaturists who dared to make subversive work mocking the Ceaușescu regime. He was under constant surveillance but his drawings encapsulated the hope many harboured for a democratic Romania. A Romania turned westwards. This same hope sustained the 1989 revolution. One of the best known placards held up by protesters in December 1989 read: “Copiii noștri vor fi liberi”. (Our children will be free.)Those children and their children will have the chance to vote in the decisive round of Romania’s presidential elections on Sunday. The man of the moment, both in Romania and among the Romanian diaspora, isGeorge Simion, a far right, anti-EU candidate who, to theglee of the Kremlin, won the first round on 4 May. Once again, the letters RO are on a tightrope. Will enough young Romanians care to put the RO back where it belongs?When I tell people that I was born during the Ceaușescu years, many reply that they remember seeing the dictator and his wife, Elena,being executed. The revolution was televised and remains a vivid memory for countless people who were around in the late 1980s.But the months-long youth-led protests that erupted in the immediate aftermath, themineriada,remain in the shadows. After the collapse of the dictatorship,chaos ensued, and not everyone was convinced about the world they had woken up in. Yesterday a communist, today a democrat! The saying perfectly captured the CV of Romania’s first post-Ceaușescu president, Ion Iliescu.A loyal Kremlin man, he had studied in Moscow, then rose through the Romanian Communist party ranks. When the old regime collapsed, he swiftly changed his job description from communist to democrat and ascended to power. His new government was entirely made up of figures from the nomenklatura. Ceaușescu was gone – but the old guard was the new guard, and some courageous citizens were not going to stand for it.As early as January 1990, people started to gather in Bucharest’s University Square to protest.Iliescu brazenlymischaracterised the demonstrators, laying the ground for future violence: “Some are pitying these punks who are wreaking havoc in the capital centre.”View image in fullscreenA couple run for cover during a battle between armed civilians and pro-Ceaușescu supporters in Bucharest, 24 December 1989.Photograph: Charles Platiau/REUTERSI know some of these punks (golaniin Romanian): my mum, then 30, my grandmother, then 59, her brother and his wife, then 49 and 40, respectively. The crowds were led by students and intellectuals, but people of all ages and backgrounds joined them, night after night, to demand real elections, true freedom and the removal of the old guard.There was an unspoken unity, my mother remembers. Romania was on the road to democracy and people weren’t going to let Iliescu hijack it. No more KGB, no more Securitate, no more Soviet Union, no more propaganda. “You represent Romania’s conscience for the entire European continent,” the dissident poetAna Blandianatold the crowd.The price of conscience doesn’t come cheap. Romania was on the brink of freedom but the so-called Russian sphere of influence was still gnawing at the edges. The old guard was far from ready to vacate the public square. Theprotesters chanted: “Iliescu nu uita, te votam la Moscova.” (Iliescu, don’t forget, you have Moscow’s vote.)Daily, people would take to one of the university balconies overlooking the square and make speeches. Some started hunger strikes. The new government knew, as did the protesters, that this was a moment of truth. Would Romania turn westwards or would the gangrene caused by decades of totalitarianism be impossible to cure?Of all the stories my mother and my grandmother have shared with me about their time under communism, the mineriadahas gripped me the most. It has never felt like ancient history. Rather, this uprising feels integral to a long history of protest in a region mangled by Russian expansionism. The protests of 1990 were gasps for liberty, agency and self-determination.After weeks of demonstrations, the governmentbussed thousands of minersinto Bucharest, infiltrated by secret police agents. Iliescu had set one segment of the population upon another. “Once the miners arrived,” my mother told me, “everything changed. Terror reigned. They were everywhere in the capital, beating people up.” Iliescu had learned from the best.Until recently, these events barely registered with today’s younger generation, and a2023 pollrevealed that 48% of Romanians think life was better under communism.But the shocking win by the rank political outsider Călin Georgescu in the first round of the presidential elections last November, and the subsequentcancellation of the voteon suspicion of Russian meddling, means the past is catching up with Romania’s youth, too.They were the target of Georgescu’s TikTok campaign and it worked:31% of those aged 18 to 24voted for the anti-EU, anti-Nato, pro-Kremlin candidate. After nearly two decades of Romania’s EU membership, Russia is tugging at its sleeves again and it seems that the current generation may not be entirely prepared for its dark arts, even though across the border Ukrainians are slaughtered for resisting, fighting for a future in the European project.In a wider sense, Romanian society has yet to reckon with its past. Thevictims and the perpetrators, the collaborators and the bystanders, the old guard and the new generations have been living side by side ever since.View image in fullscreenA poster by the Romanian caricaturist Mihai StănescuWhen we visited Romania after 20-odd years abroad and stayed at my gran’s flat – the flat I spent my early childhood in – the same neighbours were still there. The former secret police members, party members and informers, today harmless elderly people. The past? Who cares about that? We must move forward and stop banging on about it.I have often wondered how this lack of reckoning can possibly create healing and, most importantly, trust. How odd it must be to casually walk down the street, scrolling mindlessly perhaps, or chatting on the phone, or stopping here and there to window shop, and randomly pass by comrade so-and-so who you know informed on you or your family. Not all secondary-school children have beenformally taughtabout the communist regime and its impact on society. That will at least change from this September.There is another glimmer of hope: as Georgescu seemed headed for the presidency, many pro-European Romanianspoured into Bucharest’s University Squareagain, as the 1990 generation had done. This time, their placards read: “We want the EU not the KGB” and “Your children are free”, a nod to the iconic 1989 “Our children will be free” slogan. And hundreds marched into the square yet again last weekend, chanting “Niet Kremlin, yes Europe”.Iliescu, too, is facing his reckoning. At 94, he has beenindicted for crimesagainst humanity during the mineriadaprotests.On 18 May, Romanians have a stark choice between two visions for the country’s future: that of Simion, the far-right candidate, or Nicușor Dan, the centrist. The diaspora voted by an overwhelming majorityfor Simionin the first round.I have to search high and low for Stănescu’s Europa poster. It has been bugging me for some time that I seem to have misplaced it. But rummaging through boxes filled with childhood dreams gives me a chance to think of all the people who had the courage to risk their lives in 1989 and 1990, who clung to their aspirations for Romania after the fall of the dictatorship, who made sacrifices.Will the children of the revolutionaries vote with their parents’ and grandparents’ hopes, or will the spectre of the old narratives, bolstered by conspiracies and historical amnesia, gain the upper hand yet again?A line from a song that came to symbolise the protest movement in early 1990, entitled The Hymn of the Punks (Imnul Golanilor) by Cristian Pațurcă, comes to mind: “Out of all the dead and fallen, we’re rising again like ghosts”.The ghosts that put the “RO” back intoEurope.Larisa Faber is a writer and actor who was born in Romania and raised in LuxembourgExplore more on these topicsRomaniaOpinionEuropeThe far rightProtestcommentShareReuse this content"

I cannot overstate how unsound this assumption isGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastFri 16 May 2025 20.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 17 May 2025 01.41 EDTShareThe Coalition’s lopsided defeat in the 2025 federal election has been followed by a new round of attacks on preferential voting. No longer do anti-preferencing campaigners have the excuse that Labor “lost” the primary vote, with Labor currently 2.6% ahead. Nor can they say preferences won Labor the election, with Labor leading the primary vote in 86 of 150 seats.The latest complaint is just the scale of Coalition casualties. The Coalition will win at most 44 seats (29.3%) off a primary vote of about 32%. This will be the first time since 1987 that the Coalition parties’ seat share has been substantially below their primary vote.We may be waiting weeks for a result in the seat of Calwell – the most complex ever counted in an Australian electionRead moreAn article inThe Australianon Tuesday bemoaned the defeats of past Coalition frontbenchers (including Peter Dutton and Josh Frydenberg) and supposed future frontbenchers (Amelia Hamer and Ro Knox) who had topped the primary vote in their seats but lost after preferences. David Tanner said 15 seats at the 2025 election (including 13 Coalition defeats) “would have had a different winner had a first-past-the-post voting system been in place”. TheAustralian Financial Reviewmounted a similar argument on Wednesday.This, however, assumes voters would have voted the same way and parties made the same campaign decisions if Australia had first-past-the-post. I cannot overstate how unsound this underlying assumption is. In seats where the Greens are uncompetitive, many Greens supporters would vote Labor to ensure their votes helped beat the Coalition. Preferential voting is one of the reasons why the Greens maintain much higher vote shares in Australia than the US, UK and Canada.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailFurthermore, parties would make tactical choices about where to run to avoid losing seats through vote-splitting. An example of this came in the 2024 French elections. The far-right National Rally polled the highest primary vote in the first round of a runoff system. In many seats the leftwing NFP and centrist Ensemble alliances both qualified for the runoff round, but one or the other withdrew to avoid splitting the anti-National Rally vote. In the second round, the National Rally topped the popular vote by 11.2% but won fewer seats than either NFP or Ensemble. Such withdrawal pacts have far greater impacts on results than Australian how to vote cards (which hardly any minor party voters follow anyway), so the idea that scrapping preferences would stop “backroom deals” between parties is naive.Removing preferences would probably have changed very few seat outcomes at recent elections, at a massive and grossly unfair cost to the ability of those not supporting major parties to effectively say what they are really thinking at the ballot box. There are also some Coalition wins (at this election, Longman) that could be lost under first-past-the-post, because minor right party voters would be less willing to vote strategically than minor left party voters.In recent years I have seen some supporters of minor right parties opposing preferences too, claiming that preferences are a “uniparty” plot against the little guys. Preferences were actually introduced by the conservative parties in 1918 to stop Labor from scoring undeserved wins in three-cornered contests. In the past 35 years of federal, state and territory elections, preferences have been almostnine times more likelyto help non-major-party candidates beat the majors than the other way around.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is baffling that anyone who opposes major party domination would want a system that renders voting for minor parties pointless. If voters for minor right parties want to see their parties win more seats they should support proportional representation.Anti-preferencers, as I call them, also claim the UK system is the global norm. Actually just a few dozen countries use it alone to elect their lower houses. Most protect minority voting rights in some way – proportional representation, runoff voting, mixed systems or preferences. We should be proud of the way all voters get a say at all stages of our counts and not seek to import failed and primitive methods from countries that have not overcome their roadblocks to electoral reform.Kevin Bonham is an independent electoral and polling analyst and an electoral studies and scientific research consultantExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025OpinionAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

They finished 19th, having scored zero with the public vote, the second year in a row that has happened to the UK entry.

It’s a ferociously intense study of a lonely, passionate woman and her descent into bipolar disorder as she is left alone all day with a new baby in a rambling Montana house originally belonging to her husband’s uncle, who took his own life in a gruesome way that we are not permitted to discover until some way into the movie.Die My Love is another film to remind you that Ramsay believes you should make movies the way VS Naipaul believed you should write books: from a position of strength. There is, simply, overwhelming muscular strength in this picture: in her direction, in Paul Davies’s sound design, in the saturated colour of Seamus McGarvey’s cinematography, and of course in the performances themselves. Robert Pattinson is Jackson, a guy whose job takes him away from home a lot of the time with a box of condoms in the glove-compartment, andJennifer Lawrenceis Grace, who is supposedly going to write a novel during the baby’s nap times – though, worryingly, there isn’t a single book in the house. Sissy Spacek brings her unfakeable presence to the role of Jackson’s mum Pam, who lives in the neighbouring property, a woman for whom the stress of caring for her husband Harry (Nick Nolte), who has dementia, has caused her to sleepwalk, laughing maniacally and carrying a loaded gun.At first, Jackson and Grace are insanely happy, having sex all of the time – and then most of the time and then some of the time and then none of the time. There is a brutally comic quasi-Victoria Wood scene in which she confronts Jackson on this, and demands that they have sex, right now, in the car, the way they used to. Grace’s drinking and mood swings are becoming more explosive - a tragically integral part of her sexiness, in fact - and you learn to tense when Jackson and Grace are in the car, quarrelling or pretty much making out, taking their eyes off the road as the music on the radio pounds ever louder. Grace tries to hold on to her sanity as she ranges around the fields surrounding the house, with suspicions about Jackson’s fidelity worsening her post-natal depression – and here Die My Love joins the long list of films influenced byAndrew Wyeth’s painting Christina’s World.Reality begins to merge into woozy hallucination as Grace begins to fantasise about a guy she saw in a parking lot, who merges with a guy on a motorcycle who periodically roars through a neighbouring forest; this is Karl, played by LaKeith Stanfield, whose relatively undeveloped presence is perhaps a flaw in the film. Grace’s imagination catastrophises everything she sees - creating painful, violent crises, in fact, and in the fiction of her imagination, a form of melodramatic self-harm; no sooner has one set of cuts begun to heal, then she gives herself another - the renewing stigmata of her private sadness Calvary.It hardly needs to be said that subtlety is not really among this film’s attributes - but it is fierce, angry, engaged, and intensely, sensually alert to every detail of its own pleasure and pain.Die My Love screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsJennifer LawrenceRobert PattinsonLynne RamsayNick NoltereviewsShareReuse this content"

Here is Richard Linklater’s impeccably submissive, tastefully cinephile period drama about the making of Godard’s debut 1960 classic À Bout de Souffle, that starred Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo as the star-crossed lovers in Paris. Linklater’s homage has credits in French and is beautifully shot in monochrome, as opposed to the boring old colour of real life in which the events were actually happening; he even cutely fabricates cue marks in the corner of the screen, those things that once told projectionists when to changeover the reels. But Linklater smoothly avoids any disruptive jump-cuts.It’s a good natured, intelligent effort for which Godard himself, were he still alive, would undoubtedly have ripped Linklater a new one. (WhenMichel Hazanavicius made Redoubtable in 2017about Godard’s making of his 1967 film La Chinoise, the man himself called that “a stupid, stupid idea”; Hazanavicius wasn’t even making a film about Godard’s first and biggest hit.Yet Linklater is of course unconsciously creating a stylistic homage – not to Godard, however, but to his much more emollient, accessible and Hollywood-friendly collaborator Francois Truffaut. Truffaut wrote the basic story for Breathless and thereby gave Godard his commercial success; it was based on a sensational true-crime story about a tough guy who shoots a cop and gets an American girlfriend on the run, grabbing at love and romance while he can, existentially aware that a cop-killer’s days are numbered.The real-life characters of the Breathless story, from the most famous to the most obscure (this latter category being of course treated with rigorous superfan respect) are introduced with static portrait shots, gazing at the camera with their names flashed up on screen; even in the action itself, these people are often addressed by their full name with an awestruck sentence about their importance so we know where we are.Godard himself, a Cahiers Du Cinéma gunslinger-critic yearning to graduate to film-making, is played by newcomer Guillaume Marbeck, incessantly dropping epigrams and wisecracks and shruggingly dismissive pouts on the subject of cinema – and perhaps Godard was like this, at least some of the time. Linklater mischievously allows the audience to wonder if Godard will ever remove his sunglasses and get a “beautiful librarian” moment, or at least a moment to confess that you shouldn’t watch movies through dark glasses. Aubry Dillon plays Belmondo and Zoey Deutch is Seberg, forever breaking into fluent and Ohio-accented French. Adrien Rouyard is Truffaut, Matthieu Penchinat is the brilliant cinematographer Raoul Coutard whose news background in covering wars made him an inspired choice for Godard’s guerrilla film-making adventures, Benjamin Clery is Godard’s first assistant director Pierre Rissient and Bruno Dreyfürst is Godard’s long-suffering producer George “Beau Beau” Beauregard - whose disagreements with Godard over money lead to an undignified physical scuffle in aPariscafe.The shoot begins, extended by Godard’s haughtily capricious delays to accommodate authentic inspiration, as the actors amusingly say whatever they like to each other and the tyrannical director while the camera is turning, because everything is to be dubbed later in the studio. Continuity supervisor Suzon Faye (Pauline Belle) crossly tells Godard that his cavalier disregard for matching the eyelines in successive shots mean a problem in the edit; a hint of the imminent revolution in film grammar, perhaps, though Linklater’s Godard has the humility to say he didn’t invent jump-cuts.By the end, Linklater’s Godard is as opaque and essentially imperturbable as he was in the beginning, seething with competitive anguish at the success of Truffaut’s The 400 Blows in Cannes and struggling to get into parties and film sets; and again, none of this, arguably, is inaccurate. But it’s all very smooth: a slick Steadicam ride through a historic, tumultuous moment.Nouvelle Vague screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalRichard LinklaterDrama filmsComedy filmsBreathless (A Bout de Souffle)ParisreviewsShareReuse this content"

Woohoo!Rhik SamadderSat 17 May 2025 02.00 EDTShareIhave a theory that TV shows nowadays are all tonal variations on eitherThe White Lotus,Boiling Pointor possiblyYellowstone, but honestly I haven’t seen the latter. You might wish I had supporting evidence, but isn’t that what a theory is?Anyway, this week’s pick is definitely in the White Lotus mould. Sirens (Netflix, from Thursday 22 May) unfolds over Labor Day weekend in the Lloyd Neck peninsula of upstate New York, where a wealthy group of guests descend on a beachside estate for a charity gala. The raptor conservation organisation (think falcons, not velociraptors) is run by socialite Michaela Kell, a wellness-y guru who expects obedience from everyone around her. But preparations are interrupted by Devon, a chaotic falafel waitress who has come to save her sister Simone, Michaela’s assistant. Devon comes to believe Simone has been brainwashed, and that they’re mixed up in a murder, or several. It’s a long weekend.They’re serving cult, obviously, in addition to shrimp. Michaela – “Kiki” to her inner circle – is an insidious emotional vampire. She’s feared more than revered by the locals, and has the police on a leash. She concludes ceremonies and conversations with the weird, pseudo-spiritual mantra “Hey hey”, as if attempting to summon the spirit of the chicken from Moana. When Devon asks the exploited employees why they don’t complain, they clam up harder than the quahogs in the Long Island Sound.View image in fullscreenHas there been a brainwashing? … Milly Alcock as Simone with Julianne Moore as Michaela in Sirens.Photograph: NetflixCome for the set-up, stay for the execution.Milly Alcockplays Simone as a smothered scream. Her Barbie-perfect factotum is across everything from beach seating for bird funerals to misting Kiki’s underwear with lavender – and composing her boss’s sexts to her husband. Meanwhile, Meghann Fahy, whomwe’ve seen in– huh, The White Lotus – has acres of fun as Devon. “A transient person carrying hot garbage” is how a member of staff describes her when she turns up at the manicured estate, having spent the night in jail, in the middle of a day that sees her sleeping with two separate men on different boats. She’s the finest hot mess to hit our screens in an age.Then there’sJulianne Mooreas the titular siren. In the last few years, Moore has enjoyed sinister turns. There’s the Todd Haynes filmMay December, in which she weaponised childlike, cutesy-pie manipulations to control others. As Michaela, she devours relatively spare screen time to portray an enigmatic, hostile cult leader who seethes aggression beneath wellness bromides and a too-wide smile. Devon is drawn in to her spell while fully conscious of the danger. Her monstrousness is alluring, which is the point. “What would I do without you?” Michaela purrs disingenuously in one scene. “You’d hire a new assistant,” replies Simone, in a Freudian slip of honesty.The pedigree shines throughout. Sirens is based on a play by Molly Smith Metzler, and has an initial block of episodes directed by Nicole Kassel, who won Emmys for HBO’sWatchmen. For Michaela’s weed-toking, elusive husband Peter, Kassel reunites with functionally immortal film starKevin Bacon. The pair last worked together on Kassel’s superb 2004 debut The Woodsman. It’s nice to associate Bacon with something other than EE adverts isn’t it? That was rough for a while.View image in fullscreen‘A transient person carrying hot garbage’ … is how a member of staff describes her … Meghann Fahy as Devon in Sirens.Photograph: Macall Polay/NetflixWhere The White Lotus uses its glossy veneer to satirise our zeitgeist, Sirens digs at something deeper. Troubled female relationships, to be specific. There is the brittle intimacy of the boss-assistant relationship: an indentured labour demanding total emotional disclosure, an arrangement unimaginable between men. There are the sisters, vastly different, constantly at odds yet fiercely protective. More obliquely, and most affecting, the show investigates relationships of mothering warped by trauma.

It was 1995, we were both 20 years old, and we were drinking at our university bar in Leicester. We had formed a friendship over the previous three years, but I had never considered Gordon in a romantic light. He was a goth at the time, which I thought was very cool, and he had this fruity, posh voice – whereas I was a timid girl from south London with a terrible perm. I remember Gordon leaning in to give me this very innocent, tentative kiss, but it caught me off guard. I felt excited but also confused. For one thing, I’d only ever known Gordon to kiss his fellow goths.I avoided Gordon for weeks after that, which was difficult, considering we were on the same course. We bumped into each other almost every day in lectures but I made things awkward. Conversations between us didn’t flow in the same way. I’m an overthinker, whereas Gordon is much more relaxed. I think he would have been happy to keep kissing me in a casual sort of way and see where things led, but I was frightened of ruining our friendship. I was so shy at that time, and didn’t connect with people as easily as Gordon did. I had very deep feelings for him, but I wasn’t able to acknowledge them. Gordon was the closest person to me and I was terrified of losing him by having a fling.I really felt like Jarvis was mapping out my destiny. It was the push I neededOne morning about two months after the kiss I was lying in bed listening to the radio and Chris Evans’s show came on. I’ve always found him quite annoying, so I was about to switch channels, but then he said: “We’ve got a new song fromPulp.” Gordon was a huge Pulp fan so I lay back and listened. I remember it was Jarvis’s voice that really got me. He sings in such a beautiful way and it lets you hear the lyrics. The song was Something Changed, and it tells the story of a kind of sliding doors moment in the singer’s life. Jarvis sets the song hours before he meets the love of his life, and he imagines what life would have been like if he’d never bothered to go out that night. If he’d just gone home and stayed in bed instead. Listening to him sing about that, I had this moment of clarity. All my awkwardness and fear of rejection evaporated. I had this sudden, overwhelming certainty that Gordon was the one for me. I felt like this was the pivotal moment of my life, and that I didn’t want to stay in bed and miss it.There’s this line in the song where Jarvis asks: “Do you believe that there’s someone up above? / And does he have a timetable directing acts of love?” This sounds a bit daft, but lying in my bed at uni, I really felt like Jarvis was mapping out my destiny. It was the push I needed. I got dressed immediately after the song ended, and ran to university. I cornered Gordon after our lecture, looked him dead in the eyes and told him that I’d heard Pulp’s song and it had made me rethink everything between us.I think he was a little taken aback at first that I’d had such an abrupt change of heart after dodging him for months – but he’s such an open, loving person, he rolled with it. He was just extremely relieved that the massive wall I’d built between us had finally come down. The strange thing was that he’d heard Something Changed on the radio that morning too, but he hadn’t liked it. He said something dismissive like: “It’s not quite the same as Pulp’s usual stuff.” He definitely didn’t see the song in the way that I did. He wasn’t exactly on board with my grand theory that Jarvis Cocker had cosmically altered the course of our whole lives.We’ve been together for 30 years now, and I’m pleased to say Something Changed has grown on Gordon. We play it on our anniversaries, and it’s become Our Song. One of the very last lyrics is: “Where would I be now, where would I be now if we’d never met? / Would I be singing this song to someone else instead?” I often think about that line. I was so shy as a young woman, I really don’t think I would ever have had the courage to let down my wall and admit my feelings for Gordon if I hadn’t heard that song at that precise moment in my university bedroom. So maybe I would have just gone on with my life without Gordon, and heard the song a decade later, in the car alone, or with some other boyfriend. Today, Gordon and I could both be singing it with someone else instead – and I’m so happy we’re not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A teacher, campaigner and mountaineer, he has been exploring the relationship between landscape and people since his breakthrough book, Mountains of the Mind, in 2003. His latest work,Is a River Alive?,was more than four years in the making, and, he says, the most urgent book he has written.Q: Yourbookis poignant and inspiring, but one part that made me laugh is where you first tell your son the title and he replies, “Duh, of course it’s alive. That’s going to be a really short book.” So, I should first congratulate you on stringing it out for more than 350 pages!A: Ha! Well there were times I dreamed of writing the haiku version, let’s say. But much as I would long for the answer to the question of the title to be as simple as [my son] Will found it, of course it is a profoundly difficult one. That’s why the title is a question not a declaration: by means of travel, encounter and immersion, the book explores the tributaries and watershed of this vastly complex question of how we imagine rivers – and indeed how we imagine life itself. So I suppose you could say that answering the question of the title couldn’t have taken any less time than it did, and couldn’t have been written in any fewer pages than it was, much as Will would have encouraged me to be more precise.View image in fullscreenRobert Macfarlane.Photograph: Bryan AppleyardQ: The idea of a river being alive is quite heretical these days, isn’t it?A: I love that description: ‘heretical’. Yes! I’m already finding that I’m getting people online who are, on the one hand, saying: “You idiot, of course a river is alive. Why bother even with the question mark?” And then on the other, I’m getting the rationalists who are like: “You idiot, of course a river isn’t alive. It’s just H2O plus gravity. What kind of hippy nonsense are you spouting?”Q: As you point out in the book, even listening to a river was once punished by the lash. Separating people and nature needed violent enforcement …A: Absolutely. The history of the rise of rationalism required the extirpation of “idolatry”, as the New World conquistadors and colonists called it, a version of which was also carried out across the British landscape during the Reformation, when a purging fury was visited upon water in particular as a site of supposedly iconoclastic belief. I’m fascinated by the ways in which the drive to eliminate the dissenting autonomy of water – of running water, of rivers, of springs – has marched often in lockstep with power that seeks to eliminate all forms of spiritual relationships with land and water, replacing the sacred with the fiscal. We are seeing this accelerated now in America, where Doug Burgum, the secretary of state for the interior, at his Senate confirmation hearing, described America’s public lands as America’s “balance sheet”. The assetisation of everything is under way. Everywhere now we see a war continuing to be waged between “anima”, between life, and a power that seeks to mortify that life because it knows that the imaginative “deadening” of land and water is the best step towards maximum extraction.Is this river alive? Robert Macfarlane on the lives, deaths and rights of our riversRead moreQ: Of all the books you’ve written so far, you state that none has felt as urgent as this one. Why?A: The world’s ecological precarity, I suppose, is the plainest answer to that, and especially the precarity of the world’s rivers and freshwater bodies.Q: Although much of the subject matter is quite grim in terms of the despoliation of ecosystems, what comes across is courage, intelligence, love and a desire to do right by future generations and other species. How did it evolve?A: This was initially imagined as a book about “life”. That was ridiculous hubris, of course, but that was really the source: what are the stories we tell about what is alive and what is dead, and how does that compare to the stories that power tells about what is alive and what is dead? Rationalism and instrumentalism tell a presently dominant story about rivers as “inanimate brute matter”, to quote Isaac Newton; about rivers as nothing more than “service providers”. But the total dominance of that story is perilous. I guess that, as a writer, one’s job is to seek other, better, new-old stories about rivers and our relations with them.In English, we have no verb 'to river', but what could be more of a verb than a river?Q: You dive into the lives and deaths of riverson four continents. But it is also very much about human activism –the defenderswho are trying to prevent ecocide on the ground, and the Nature Rights advocates who are trying to change the law at a national or global level. What started you off on this?View image in fullscreenMacfarlane has brought a case in the Ecuador court system to recognise the moral authorship of the cloud forest in the song called Song of the Cedars.Photograph: Robert MacfarlaneA: I wanted to immerse myself in the sheer tumbling vigour of the youngrights-of-naturemovement, which is one of the running currents in the book. I would wake up every morning, and there would be a new email, a new story, a new contact, a new case about rights ofnature. It feels as if that movement is presently stepping forwards very consequentially in terms of re-imagining and re-storying the law in order to strike at some of the deeply anthropocentric foundations of almost all nation-state jurisdictions.Q: Despite the global reach, the different elements seem to be brought together by relationships?A: Absolutely. Other than that of the river, if there is a motif that weaves through the book, it’s that of the mycelium. It’s the mycelium that sets the night-forest alight in the first pages of the Ecuadorian section, and I hope it is the mycelium that is what might be called the visible “ethos” of the book. All that emerges in the book emerges as a function of cooperation, of collaboration, of working together. I wanted to try to find a literary form and a kind of polyphonic texture, in order to reflect the many voices and agencies involved in river-thought and river-guardianship.Q: The book calls for revolution. How did you reflect this in the style?A: The revolution it calls for is a revolution of the imagination. The book’s language is intended to speak to, and of, a changed relationship with rivers – an animated relationship. To give a simple example of this, I write throughout about riverswhoflow, not riversthatorwhichflow. Now that feels totally normal to me. I’d love that usage to spread. Of course, it is already like that in other languages. In French, for instance, it’sla rivière qui coule,le fleuve qui coule.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

At the level of form and pattern, I sought to give the whole book the shape of the water cycle. So we begin at the springs who rise near my home, and we end back at the springs. In between, the book travels up to the mountains and from there descends eventually to reach the sea at the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. By the final pages, language has entered a sort of liquid state. Language has been rivered, as well as me. I strongly felt at times that I was writingwiththe river, or even being written by it.View image in fullscreenIs A River Alive? by Robert MacFarlane.Photograph: Hamish Hamilton/PAQ: How does that co-authorship with a river work?A: It is glaringly obvious to me that all thought is intersubjective. This book could not have been written by sitting still. It could not have been written from the archive. A great deal of it was written in its first form either on rivers, by the banks of rivers, or within earshot of rivers; having spent days following rivers, being buried within rivers, spat out by rivers. I find it bizarre that copyright law rejects the notion of nature or a natural entity as possessing the capacity to be recognised as a “moral author” (to use the term of art from copyright law). As I think you know, [the Earth rights scholar] César [Rodríguez-Garavito], [the mycologist] Giuliana [Furci] and [the musician] Cosmo [Sheldrake] and I, as well as, of course, the Los Cedros cloud forest, have brought a case in the Ecuador court system to recognise the moral authorship of the cloud forest in the song that was written in the course of the book’s research [called Song of the Cedars]. If you listen to the song, you can hear the voices of the forest (the howler monkeys, the bats, the wind, the rivers, the trees). They’re performers of, as well as the co-thinkers of, that song.View image in fullscreenVedanthangal, Chennai.Photograph: Robert MacfarlaneQ: The book starts and finishes in the little chalk streams of Cambridge. Do you feel people here have the same passion to defend rivers as those you met in India, Ecuador and Quebec/Nitassinan?A: I’m lucky to live on the chalk of southern England. We have around 85% of the world’schalk streamshere in England. You could liken it to the Great Barrier Reef, perhaps; a super-rare, remarkable ecosystem. It has brought life to the landscape here, but now we have largely forgotten its marvellousness, its fragility and its rarity. Nevertheless, amazing things are happening in England in terms of what we might call the river guardianship movement: communities rising up to take water companies to court, hold government to account, train a small army of citizen scientists to monitor and test river health. This community response is born of the same impulses, it seems to me, which animate those communities I travelled with and spent time with in other countries. That is to say: born of a belief in water as life, and a belief that our fate flows with that of rivers, and always has.View image in fullscreenRiver Itchen, one of England’s rare chalk streams.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianQ: One of the people in your book, the Waanyi writer Alexis Wright, sayshumanity has never been in more urgent need of powerful storytellers to address the environmental crisis. But I’ve also heard friends say the time for stories is over, we now need action. How do you respond to that?A: Storytelling remains, to me, central and vital in its powers. I reject the notion that storytelling is a fundamentally passive posture. Rather, it can crucially catalyse the conversion of passion into action. It has ways of reaching both heart and mind that argument or polemic can’t. Of course, there are bad stories told well by bad people, as well as good ones told well by good people. In terms of powerful storytellers for the good, as it were, I might take the example of the Innu poet, storyteller and community leader, Rita Mestokosho, who is an important character in the final third of the book. Rita is a lifelong activist for the Innu language, Innu people and Innu land. She sees no distinction between her work as a writer and as an activist. During the years of river research, I saw new-old stories being told again and again around the world, thrillingly and with consequence.Q: What would you like readers to take away from this book?A: I want readers to imagine rivers as having lives, having deaths and even having rights – and to see what flows from that re-imagining in terms of law, culture and politics. And I would like them to take the full downriver journey of the book, from mountain to sea.Q: And where do you go next?A: This book has taken a long time, but among its surprises is that it continues to flow; the stories, rivers and people who run through its pages continue to run through my life very consequentially. I remain closely involved with the ongoing guardianship of Los Cedros in Ecuador, and the need to support and maintain the implementation of the protective ruling there. Oh – and we’ve just completed a big cleanup fundraiser and organisation to airlift out a whole bunch of heavy-duty junk we found high up in the watershed of the Mutehekau Shipu inCanada.

And don’t let them win.”He urged creatives to “keep telling the stories, keep expressing yourself and keep fighting for it”.The comments came shortly after the US president used his Truth Social platform tocall singer Bruce Springsteena “pushy, obnoxious JERK” for criticising his leadership, and claim that Taylor Swift’s popularity had decreased since he announced his “hatred” for her.Eddington review - Ari Aster’s tedious Covid western masks drama and mutes his starsRead more“Obviously, it’s very scary for an actor participating in a movie to sort of speak to issues like this,” Pascal said when asked whether he feared that the US could completely close down to all forms of migration. “I want people to be safe and to be protected, and I want very much to live on the right [side] of history.”“I’m an immigrant”, said Pascal, whose parents fled Pinochet-led Chile when he was nine months old. “We fled a dictatorship, and I was privileged enough to grow up in the US, after asylum in Denmark, and if it weren’t for that, I don’t know what would have happened to us. And so I stand by those needing protection, always.”Pascal plays a small-town mayor in New Mexico alongside Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone and Austin Butler in the new film by Aster, the acclaimed director of “elevated horror” films Midsommar and Hereditary.Asked whether he was concerned that the political message of films could be used against cast members when they tried to re-enter the US, Aster said: “The truth is, I’m scared of everything. All the time. So, yeah. The tongue is sort of in the cheek in that answer, but it’s also true.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ayear ago, I discovered a bit of a travel hack – that if accompanied by an adult (obviously) children under the age of 12 can explore Europe by train for absolutely zilch. Profoundly susceptible to any sort of bargain, even those that promise a net deficit in the long run, I determined to take advantage of Interrail’s generous offer, despite lacking dependents of the specified vintage.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sourcing someone under 12 was far easier than I’d imagined. When I lodged an enquiry about my 10-year-old niece, asking if Annabelle might be available for an Interrailing stint at Easter, my brother couldn’t sign her up fast enough. (Though he did insist on some caveats: in bed by 10pm, out of bed by 9am, and no watching sweary Gordon Ramsay shows).View image in fullscreenBut where would we go? Well, after several discussions with my prospective companion over FaceTime (during which she utilised upwards of 100 filters, including one that made her look like Donald Trump), six locations were settled on: Paris, Zurich, Venice, Innsbruck, Berlin and Amsterdam. Annabelle citedEmily in Parisand The Diary of Anne Frankas inspirations, while confessing to a long-term interest in Toblerone. If the itinerary had been up to me, it would have looked a lot different. I’d justfinished writing a book, you see, in which I travel to some of the least fashionable cities in Europe, but when I mentioned to Annabelle the likes of Essen and Minsk, she raised one of her eyebrows and held it there for 10 seconds (which is something she does when deeply unimpressed).View image in fullscreenTrying snails and exploring Paris.So, first up, Paris. After checking in at The Hoxton hotel on Rue du Sentier, we quickly got stuck into some snails. (I won’t quote Annabelle’s verdict verbatim, but she likened them to a larger version of something you might find up your nose). A picnic near the Eiffel Tower – during which Annabelle stewed over my explanation as to why there was no point in us joining the massive queue to be elevated skywards (“Are you sure British people aren’t allowed, Uncle Ben?”) – was followed by a rapid ascent up 500 steps to the base of Sacré-Coeur basilica, Annabelle’s alacrity owing to a white lie on my part (I’d said there was a doughnut shop at the top).Our journey to Zurich involved changing at Strasbourg. A seat reservation was required for the first leg at a cost of €10 each. (It’s worth mentioning that Interrail pass-holders have to cough up for seat reservations on certain European train services, and all sleeper berths.) An honest breakdown of what we did during the four-hour run down the eastern flank of France to Switzerland reads as follows: 10 minutes considering the passing landscape, 80 minutes of screen time and roughly 19 games of hangman, in which I was able to smuggle a new pair of words into Annabelle’s evolving vocabulary, namely “exasperation” and “glee”.View image in fullscreenAnnabelle and Ben in Venice, left, and Zurich.We spent an hour exploring Zurich’s efforts to become the most eco-friendly city possible (including a hydroelectric power station that got the one-eyebrow treatment from Annabelle), and another sitting by the lake near the fetching old town watching the swans and coots squabble over pretzel scraps. Then I gave Annabelle’s palate the night off chocolate and took her to a plant‑based restaurant calledDar, run by the renowned Spanish-Moroccan chef Zineb “Zizi” Hattab. We loved everything about the place, but the highlights were the Kentucky-fried mushrooms and the vegan ceviche.In Venice, I changed my approach to travelling with a miniature human. I stopped trying to have conversations every 10 paces about bridges and sea levels and the role of Garibaldi in the reunification of Italy, and instead handed Annabelle the reins, telling her to lead the way and get us lost. She succeeded with aplomb, getting us lost in just about every gift shop we saw (her appetite for tat is astonishing).Annabelle suffers from a condition known as selective fatigue, which tends to flare up on the way to museumsWe stayed at the Avani Rio Novo, a stylish establishment near the train station. This meant it scored points with Annabelle, whose legs suffer from a disabling condition known as selective fatigue, which tends to flare up on the way to museums and so on. After a dinner of sardines and gelato (don’t ask), she spent the evening trying to teach me ballet moves, whereas I spent the evening thinking the sooner she starts drinking alcohol the better.The next morning, before we departed for pastures new, I asked Annabelle for an alternative verb to “move on” or “proceed” and she suggested “wobble”, and so it was that we bade Venice farewell and wobbled north to Innsbruck, a charming city of about 130,000-odd citizens surrounded by mountains.Having dumped our bags atAdlers Hoteland wolfed down a schnitzel at a restaurant calledStiftskeller, we took a 20-minute cable car ride up to the peak of Hafelekarspitze, a mountain topping 2,334 metres (7,657ft). We paid our dues to the vista – a pistachio river, a motley crop of rooftops, a ring of Austrian Alps – before commencing a protracted snowball fight that Annabelle would later put forward as the highlight of her trip, a comment that had me wondering if I should have just taken her to the Snozone in Milton Keynes.View image in fullscreenIn Berlin, left, and at the top of Hafelekarspitze near Innsbruck.We travelled the next day to Berlin, reaching the German capital in time to catch the sunset from the 368-metre tall TV Tower in Alexanderplatz. As I attempted to explain the significance of the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie, Annabelle appeared to be taking on board the gravitas of these historical monuments, an impression that was punctured somewhat when she asked, at the end of my summary, “Can you do this with your tongue?”We proceeded by tram to theKPM Hotel, in a former porcelain factory in the west of the city, which Annabelle gave 10 out of 10, mainly because there was a beanbag in her room. The next morning, a guided bike tour along the Berlin Wall provided an energising lesson on ideological warfare, Helmut Schmidt, David Hasselhoff and the various ways an East German might get over an obstacle. The tour was elevated by the incorporation of curry wurst and cherry trees, and by the good nature of our guide, Phillip. When he asked if Annabelle liked the sound of life in the German Democratic Republic, she quickly and firmly said “sure”, which I later discovered is her go-to response when she hasn’t been listening.Annabelle was rather rude about Rembrandt. Sizing up his self-portrait, she suggested in no uncertain terms that he really shouldn’t have botheredThe next day, we reached Amsterdam Centraal without fuss, the journey taking less than six hours and requiring neither reservation nor connection. From the station, we enjoyed a pleasant walk to our hotel, the NH Collection Amsterdam Flower Market, whose staff couldn’t do enough for Annabelle, even hastily organising an Easter egg hunt when it became apparent that I’d completely forgotten what the resurrection of Christ means to people of a certain age.Over the next day and a bit, we wandered along the canals, tried some Dutch pancakes (poffertjes), and had a butcher’s at the Rembrandts in the Rijksmuseum. No prizes for guessing which of these experiences Annabelle enjoyed the most. In truth, Annabelle was actually rather rude about Rembrandt. Sizing up the great painter’s self-portrait of 1628, she suggested in no uncertain terms that he really shouldn’t have bothered.View image in fullscreenOn one of many trains, left, and in Amsterdam.Annabelle’s verdict on our visit to the Anne Frank House was somewhat more measured. After spending a sobering hour listening to Anne’s story as we navigated the building in which the Franks hid from the Nazis, she contributed the following to the visitors’ book: “I wish this museum didn’t exist to be honest, but I’m really glad we came.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In the city, he is used to them being hidden behind a veil of light pollution.“I don’t think we should pay to get that peace and solitude.”The 54-year-old is one of many campers troubled by aproposed change to the pricing structurefor sites in New South Wales national parks.The government wants to tackle “ghost bookings”, whereby people book limited sites in case they want to go camping, but then don’t turn up. However, campers are worried the reforms could change the “classless” nature of the great outdoors.Deserted beaches, wild rivers and seaside chill: four days walking in NSW’s largest coastal parkRead moreMichael Atkinson, who appeared on Alone Australia, said on social media last week: “We should be encouraging people to get outdoors not making it a middle-class and above activity.”The planned changes won’t see prices increase everywhere – some sites could even become cheaper. But the question is being asked: has the government got the balance right?Price changes ‘will definitely vary’The NSW government says the current pricing structure is “inconsistent and complex” and should be simplified.It aims to address three issues raised in consultations with 200,000 national park visitors: “ghost bookings”; a lack of staff at campgrounds; and the need for better maintenance of facilities.Currently, campsites have a flat fee for the site itself and then additional costs per adult and child. The proposed change would institute flat rates for low and high seasons, based on the services offered at the particular site. Prices would be pegged to CPI and people would receive a refund of up to 80% if they cancelled.The government says it hasn’t increased the cost of camping since 2017.Camping fees gtableGrahame Douglas, a member of the National Parks Association of NSW, agrees reform of the “complex” pricing structure is necessary, but he’s not convinced by Labor’s proposal.“I’m not persuaded the number of tiers is correct – there are some grey areas,” he says, arguing it’s confusing what tier some campsites fall into. “There has been misguided criticism because of this confusion.”Douglas says it’s not clear whether the change will make camping more expensive overall. “It will definitely vary,” he says.For example, Saltwater Creek campground – a beach-lovers haven on the far south coast – has barbecues and picnic tables. That suggests it could be considered a tier-three campsite.When there’s no cost, consumers do not put in the effort to finalising or forming their plansProf Nitika GargCurrently, Saltwater Creek campsites are $24 a night for two people with a tent and $12 extra for every additional adult and $6 more for every child. This means the cost for a family of four is currently $36 a night. It’s $49 for a family of six or $74 for six adults.Under the proposed changes, it would incur a flat rate of $36 a night in high season and $20 in low season.The change to a flat fee could hurt more if campers had been fudging their bookings by stating, for example, that only one adult would be at the site rather than a family of four.Laudams’ favourite campsite is a secluded spot on the edge of Abercrombie River national park. It has a pit toilet and would appear to fall into tier two under the proposed regime.It could, therefore, more than triple in price during high season – going from $6 a night to $22. It would be $13 in the low season.View image in fullscreenOne of Andre Laudams’ favourite campsites at Coorongooba campground near Capertee.Photograph: Andre LaudamsBents Basin campground in the Royal national park, which has hot showers, would cost a flat rate of $89 a night in peak season and $52 in low season.“If it’s an off season, the prices look quite reasonable in the context of existing charges,” Douglas says. “But when you look at the high season charges, the question is, is that going to be something that’s going to dissuade people, and is that the intent as well?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

For him, the obvious answer is to remove the booking system altogether and return to the days when people rocked up and hoped for the best.Some popular campsites have long had a booking system but it was applied more widely as camping became increasingly popular during the early years of the pandemic.Visitation to the state’s national parks and reserves increased 49% over the past decade, government data suggests.Alone contestant Atkinson wants bookings scrapped for campsites that didn’t have them before Covid. He’d like to see a boost in the number of available campsites “in line with the amount of extra visitation”. Not increased fees.Douglas says the National Parks Association is pushing for 50 new protected areas to be reserved under the National Parks and Wildlife Act.But he says the booking system is still necessary because of how popular camping has become. It also reassures people heading into remote areas that there will be a site available.Victoria made camping free over the past year as a cost-of-living measure. But as a result, ghost bookings have increased.Prof Nitika Garg, a University ofNew South Walesexpert in consumer behaviour, says that was a foreseeable consequence.“When there’s no cost, consumers do not put in the effort to finalising or forming their plans,” she says.View image in fullscreenLuca Marelli’s partner, Marta, and their children, Greta and Oscar, camping at Jervis Bay.Photograph: Luca MarelliLast year, Booderee national park near Jervis Bay in NSW introduced a flat fee structure.Luca Marelli, who travels from Sydney to camp there with his young family, says he has noticed a drop in ghost bookings since the change.It’s now slightly more expensive at about $80 a night for his family of four – but he says he doesn’t mind. “It’s that bit more expensive but still much cheaper than Airbnb.“[We camp] not only because of the money, but also because we love the experience. We love the area, we love the beaches there and we love the campsite itself.”Garg thinks the NSW reforms could reduce ghost bookings.“What they’re doing is trying to match demand to supply, so they’re probably saying that in the low season, where we can afford to have more ghost bookings, we will lower the rate or keep it similar,” she says.The government could also appeal to Australian values, the academic suggests.“One that doesn’t shame but encourages people to be considerate.

It’s easy, flavourful and, as a bonus, it’s crispy, too. In fact, it’s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they’re jammy, and ready to top the patty. You don’thaveto do this, but I’m here to tell you that it is worthwhile (especially if there’s a six-year-old already making the burgers).Crispy black bean burgersIf you like, prep the patties a day in advance and chill until needed.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4Prep10 minCook30 minServes4Olive oil2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced1 tsp salt400g tin black beans, not drained80g dried breadcrumbs1 tsp dried garlic granules1 tsp dried onion granules1 tbsp chipotle paste2 tsp dijon mustard1 tbsp tomato ketchupTo serve4 burger bunsVegan mayonnaiseIceberg lettuceFinely sliced tomatoPut three tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan set over a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes, until quite reduced and frazzled. Take off the heat.Meanwhile, spoon a couple of tablespoons of the liquid (aquafaba) from the tin of beans into a small bowl or mug and set aside. Drain and rinse the beans, tip into a large bowl and roughly mash; leave a few whole or in big chunks. Stir in the breadcrumbs, garlic granules, onion granules, chipotle paste, mustard, ketchup and a half-teaspoon of salt, then use your hands to mix until well combined; if need be, add some or all of the reserved aquafaba.Divide the bean mix evenly into four, roll each piece into a ball, then put them one by one between two sheets of baking paper and press out to roughly 10cm- to 12cm-wide patties (I tend to make mine a wee bit bigger than the burger buns).To cook the patties, put two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan, then fry two of the burgers for about six minutes in total, turning them once halfway, or when the base is crisp and golden. Remove and set aside, add another two tablespoons of oil, then repeat with the other two patties.To serve, split and toast the buns, spread a generous dollop of mayo over the cut side of the bases and top with a leaf or two of iceberg lettuce. Add a bean patty and a couple of thin slices of tomato, and finish with a quarter of the caramelised onions. On with the lids and eat immediately.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe new veganVegetablesFoodBeans, pulses and legumesBurgersBreadMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Traders are no longer wrapped up tightly to withstand the cold, and there is a spring in everyone’s step. At the fish stall, some dressed crab caught my eye, and while I love nothing more than crab on toast with thick aïoli or a nuttysalsa macha, there was a nip in the air on the night in question, so I was drawn to this rich, warming dish instead. The onions are a vehicle for the spices, adding sweetness and depth to both potato cake and crab. On the side, a gloriously refreshing, spicy salad makes the most of mango season.Warm potato cake with crab, onions and curry leavesA rich, beautifully spiced potato cake studded with peas and silky-sweet onions.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes44 tbsp vegetable oil40g butter700g white onions, peeled and finely slicedSea salt and black pepper1kg floury potatoes, peeled and quartered150g podded peas(fresh or frozen)2 large garlic cloves,peeled and minced30g thumb of ginger, peeled and minced2 tsp coriander seeds2 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp fenugreek2 tsp turmeric1 egg, beaten100g dressed crab– I like a mix of white and brown meat2 tsp black mustard seeds1 big handfulfresh curry leavesTo serveGreekyoghurtFresh coriander leaves1 lemon, cut into wedgesSet a heavy-bottomed frying pan on a medium heat, add half the oil and butter, then stir in the onions and a teaspoon of sea salt, and cook, stirring often, for 25 minutes, until the onions are soft and sweet; add a few tablespoons of water halfway, to stop them sticking to the pan.Meanwhile, simmer the potatoes in a large pan of salted boiling water for about 20 minutes, until tender, then drain, reserving the water. Put the reserved water back in the pan, bring back to a boil, drop in the peas and simmer for a few minutes until tender, then drain. Put the empty pan on a low heat, tip the drained potatoes back in, leave to steam dry for a few minutes, then mash thoroughly.Stir the garlic, ginger and all the spices bar the mustard seeds and curry leaves into the softened onions and cook for five minutes more. Put two-thirds of the onion mix in the potato pan (put the rest in a bowl), then add the drained peas and egg, and stir well.Put the remaining butter and a tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan and set it on a medium-high heat. Tip in the potato mixture, flatten evenly and cook on a medium heat for seven to eight minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for another seven to eight minutes. (Alternatively, make smaller potato patties by dividing the mixture into six, rolling into balls, then flattening in the pan before frying.) Once cooked, leave to cool slightly while you make the crab tarka.Put the remaining tablespoon of oil in a wok on a very high heat, stir-fry the reserved onion mixture with the crab, mustard seeds and curry leaves until sizzling hot, then season generously.Cut the potato cake into wedges, top with the crab tarka and spoonfuls of yoghurt, finish with a scattering of coriander and serve with lemon wedges on the side.Chopped mango salad with crispy chickpeasView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ chopped mango salad with crispy chickpeas.A beguiling salad that sparkles with fresh citrus, chilli heat and herbs to add accents to sweet mango and deliciously spiced chickpeas.Prep10 minCook25 minServes4250g cooked chickpeasOlive oil2 tsp mild curry powderSea salt and black pepper1 small red onion, peeled and finely dicedJuice of1 lemon½ cucumber2 ripe mangoes, peeled and pitted1 tsp amchoor(mango powder), or sumac1 tsp ground cumin1 red chilli, finely diced1 handful each fresh mintand coriander leaves, roughly choppedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ilike to think of myself as a bit of a connoisseur of tinned seafood, and of tinned sardines, in particular. Well, of course I do: I’m Spanish, after all, and I’ve been eating this stuff since I was two (which, let me tell you, is averylong time ago indeed!). So I jumped at the chance to do a blind tasting of British supermarket tinned sardines – although, with the odd exception, I now think I perhaps jumped just a little too soon.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For me, the first thing you notice when you open a tin of sardines is the look of the fish, and then its smell and texture. They should be headless but otherwise whole, not boned fillets or skinned, and the flesh should feel firm to the touch; the bones, likewise, should still have some structure and substance to them (if you can barely feel them, the fish is likely overcooked). What I found especially illuminating about this blind tasting, however, was that three of the 10 products were pretty much identical, in pretty much every way, from the texture and taste of the fish to the quality of the oil, which is why I found it more or less impossible to tell them apart, or to find any points of difference between them.As for the oil that’s used to preserve the sardines, I’m afraid it simplyhasto be olive oil – yes, I would say that (again, I am Spanish, after all), but sorry, that’s just a plain statement of fact and I will not be taking questions.The best tinned sardinesBestall-rounder/bargain:John West sardines in olive oilView image in fullscreen£1.10 for 120g at Asda (92p/100g)£1.10 for 120g at Morrisons (92p/100g)★★★★☆Pretty great, especially considering the price. The flavour is very good, as is the consistency and texture of the fish, while the quality of the oil is up there, too.

The flavour isn’t all that nice, either. In fact, it turns out they’re similar to theFish4 Ever offering below, with a pretty much identical taste and texture.
