Their desire to put themselves front and centre of world events. Their need to imagine that everything they do makes a difference. No greater self-love hath any person than this. If they were to have a therapist, I am sure they would be having a field day. The triumph of ego over ever-diminishing quantities of self-worth.So thecollapse of the Chinese spy trialhas been a godsend to almost every opposition MP. Now, you might have thought the key components of the case were two blokes called Christopher being accused of doing the espionage. Albeit fairly basic stuff like leaking diary engagements that weren’t exactly state secrets in the first place.But how wrong you would be. Because what elevates this case to a matter of national security is that the people allegedly spied on were two Tory MPs. Nothing could be of greater importance than this. Had the Chinese been trying to access our nuclear codes then this would have been an everyday matter of indifference. After all, we are almost certainly doing the same to the Chinese. Or if we aren’t, then we ought to be. But an attack on two parliamentarians is an attack on what it means to be British.All this explains why on Monday we were on to our third urgent question on the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to drop the charges inside a week. Ordinarily we would have had to make do with one at best, but this being about something as mission critical as MPs themselves, we can clearly never have enough.Don’t bet against a fourth on Wednesday if a newspaper comes up with yet another unimportant detail that no one outside Westminster is much bothered about. This one could run and run.It would be less self-indulgent if we were actually getting somewhere with this. As it is we are going round and round in circles, with the Tories desperate to pin the collapse of the trial on the government. First, by claiming that Keir Starmer had nobbled the director of public prosecutions into dropping the case. Then, when it became clear the prime minister had not been leaning on the DPP, the Tories did a reverse ferret and accused Starmer of influencing the case by failing to intervene. It’s not often you feel sorry for Keir these days, but in this instance he really can’t win.For Monday’s UQ, the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, had seized on a small detail in a Sunday Times article that suggested the home secretary had got wind of the fact that the trial was going to collapse and had wondered what she could do about it.For the Philpster, this was the smoking gun: the key to unlocking a major conspiracy at the heart of government. As ever, this was Chris at his most delusional. He only ever sees what he wants to see. At moments like this, you can’t help wondering if this bear with very little brain has too much time on his hands.In PhilpWorld, the home secretary should have been allowed to tamper with the evidence. If deputy national security adviser Matt Collins couldn’t come up with enough dirt on China, the home secretary should have just added some more. No matter that Collins went out of his way on several occasions to describe China as posing multiple threats. No matter that theLabourgovernment’s position on China – “it’s a threat, but hey, it’s the world’s second biggest economy” – was identical to that of previous Tory governments.Dan Jarvis, the security minister, is usually the most even-tempered and good natured of men. But even he was clearly narked at being dragged out to the Commons to answer the Philpster’s half-arsed questions. Time and again he had to labour the point that the government was as disappointed as everyone else at the decision to drop the case and the Tories would do well to show some humility. The spying had taken place on their watch and if they hadn’t taken so long to update the Official Secrets Act, then the case might have gone to trial. All this rather went over the Philpster’s head. Most things do.The rest of the session was largely taken up by the usual Tories also desperate to believe that this was a conspiracy rather than a cock-up by the DPP. Iain Duncan Smith wanted to know if he could callChinaa threat. Increasingly Desperate Dan suggested he could make his own mind up and call it what he liked.Others got hooked on Jarvis saying China posed multiple threats to security rather than a threat to national security. They seemed to think it was a gotcha moment. It really wasn’t. The SNP’s Graham Leadbitter went so far as to quote Dominic Cummings as a reliable source. Even though Dom hadn’t been there. It was only recently that Dom remembered he had forgotten to warn us about the Chinese five years ago.It all ended rather bad-temperedly. Jarvis clearly fed up at not being believed and the Tories believing what they wanted to believe. Much more fun for them that way. Not to say, self-indulgent. Still, the frontbenches did find something they could agree on during the next UQ on the decision by the West Midlands police and Birmingham city council toban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from next month’s match at Villa Park.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy – along with her shadow, Nigel Huddleston – were adamant that this was all about antisemitism. That the fans were being banned because they were Israeli and not because the club was world famous for having a hardcore of travelling fans who made Millwall fans c1980 look like angels. That it wasn’t the safety of local people that was the issue but the safety of the Maccabi Ultras. Really, they were all sweethearts. We should just learn to live with their lovable violence and racist chants.Cue more bad faith from some of those who had supported the ban. Ayoub Khan tried to claim his opposition had always been on the grounds of Maccabi hooliganism. When he had already supported Zarah Sultana’s suggestion that all Israeli teams should be banned from European competition.Labour’s Paula Barker was the one coherent voice. She suggested it was a bad idea to overrule operational safety decisions. That had happened prior to Hillsborough and 97 people had lost their lives unnecessarily. But no one was listening to her. Then, no one had been listening to anyone much all day.A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.

Our brains churn up images, and we sit back and watch. But it’s possible to take control. You can turn the monster chasing you into a mouse, or fly through the sky like a bird. All it takes is realizing you’re in a dream, mid-dream – otherwise known as lucid dreaming.Lots of people want to lucid dream. There areonlinecommunitiesdevoted to sharing tips and tricks, like the subredditr/LucidDreaming, which has about 98,000 weekly visitors. Recent discussion topics include “If flying is hard, try giving yourself a Green Lantern ring,” and “Has anyone gone to space in [a lucid dream]?”“Most people engage in lucid dreaming because it’s fun,” says Dr Martin Dresler, head of theSleep& Memory Lab at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior in the Netherlands. Dresler estimates that he has lucid dreams every couple of weeks. “Unfortunately not very long ones,” he says. “However, it’s typically long enough to start flying around.”Below, experts explain how to start lucid dreaming, and my attempts to put their tips in practice.Why do I keep waking up at 2am – and how do I get back to sleep?Read moreWhat is lucid dreaming?“Lucid dreaming is a phenomenon where we become aware that we are dreaming while we experience a dream,” says Dr Michael Varnum, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who recently co-authoreda paperabout lucid dreaming with his nine-year-old daughter, Clara, who told him she wanted to learn more about her own lucid dreams.Aware of the dream state but unconstrained by the physical limitations of the waking world, those in a lucid dream can fly, breathe underwater, perform superhuman feats of strength – or maybe just make out with their crush.Can anyone have lucid dreams?It’s unclear. “Only about half of the population reports ever having had a lucid dream,” says Dresler. It also appears to be easier for some than others. If people start training to have lucid dreams, some might be successful on the first night, while others struggle for months, he says. Some may never experience them.Some studies suggest it’s more likely in people with certain personality traits. “We found that people who are higher in openness, extraversion, and people who tend to have more nightmares tend to have more lucid dreams,” Clara Varnum wrote in an email.How do you train yourself to have lucid dreams?So far, no one has discovered a technique that reliably induces lucid dreaming at will, says Dresler. But certain practices can make it more likely to occur. Most of them boil down to thinking about your dreams more – way more.“Really get obsessed with your dreams,” says Dr Ken Paller, professor of psychology at Northwestern University. Developing your ability to remember dreams is particularly important, he says, because you could be having lucid dreams and not remembering. To improve your recall, Paller suggests keeping your eyes closed after you first wake up and spending some time trying to remember your last dream. Keeping a dream journal can also help: “Write down your dreams every day,” he says.Paller recommends cultivating the intention to lucid dream. While you’re awake, think: “The next time I have a dream, I’m going to figure out it’s a dream,” he says.How do you figure out a dream is a dream? Lucid dreamers report being tipped off by a variety of things. One r/LucidDreamingusersaid they realized they were dreaming because they had braces. “I thought to myself, ‘wait a second, I don’t have braces anymore, this must be a dream.’”Research has shown that trying to work alight switchorread a bookcan be difficult or impossible in a dream so unsuccessfully attempting one of these activities might clue you in, says Michael Varnum.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’For those interested in a more tangible technique, a combination of the Wake-Back-to-Bed (WBTB) and Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (Mild) techniques can be effective, says Dr Achilleas Pavlou, assistant professor of psychology and clinical communication skills at the University of Nicosia Medical School in Cyprus.To prompt WBTB, set your alarm for 1-2 hours before you usually get up. Stay awake for 10-20 minutes, and then go back to bed. Next, use Mild as you’re falling back asleep, says Pavlou: “Vividly replay a dream scene and rehearse becoming lucid inside it while repeating a clear intention such as, ‘Next time I’m dreaming, I’ll notice I’m dreaming.’” Ideally, you would use the dream you were having right before WBTB, but if you can’t remember that, use a dream from another night.While practice can help beginners improve, Pavlou suggests only practicing these techniques two to three times a week because it can be tiring. “The goal is lucidity without sacrificing sleep,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But research suggests it could help scientists develop a greater understanding of sleep and dreams.Paller was the lead author of a 2021paperfrom Northwestern University which found that individuals in the midst of a lucid dream could communicate with (awake) researchers. The dreamers were able to perceive questions asked to them by experimenters and provide simple answers by twitching their eyes or sniffing.Since then, scientists have been using this method to ask a dreamer questions about what they are experiencing in their dream, says Paller.This is promising because dream research had previously relied largely on retrospective reports: the dreamer’s waking memory of what they experience during their slumber. But memory is imperfect, especially when it comes to dreams, and these reports are “a lot weaker than if you get evidence of what’s happening at the time of the dream”, says Paller.I’ve had lucid dreams before and most of them were nightmares. So I’ve mostly tried to stop things from happening or to wake myselfClara VarnumSome preliminary studies also suggest lucid dreaming could be used to help individuals who struggle with recurring nightmares by allowing them to exercise greater control over the content of their dreams. One 2019studyconcluded that lucid dreaming “may be a feasible aid for treating patients with nightmares through minimizing their frequency, intensity, and psychological distress”. It added, however, that “the available literature is still scarce, and provides inconsistent results”.Clara Varnum says she has used lucid dreams to help with nightmares. “I’ve had lucid dreams before and most of them were nightmares. So I’ve mostly tried to stop things from happening or to wake myself up,” she says. “But sometimes, I’ve accidentally said, ‘I’m dreaming’ and made a good dream end.”Are there risks to lucid dreaming?Experts say lucid dreaming is safe. But those who know they struggle with sleep disorders or parasomnia might want to consult a sleep specialist before trying it, says Michael Varnum.Additionally, people “in a current psychotic episode, mania, or with severe dissociative symptoms should only experiment under clinical guidance, if at all”, says Pavlou.What happened when I tried to train myself to lucid dream?For two weeks, I set an intention every night before bed that I would lucid dream, like Paller recommended. I had several memorable dreams during that time. In one, I was trapped in the tower of a sinking castle while a fat, swimming raccoon tried to open the window and save me. In another, I worked on a submarine, and Academy Award-winning actress Cate Blanchett was killing and dismembering my colleagues. Neither of these preposterous situations made me suspect I was experiencing anything other than reality. But one thing did: I looked at my credit score on the computer and it was extremely low. “What the hell?” I thought. “My credit score is good!”Then, I realized I was in a dream. At that point, I got up from the computer and flew around for a while. Unfortunately, it wasn’t as exciting as I thought it would feel – I knew I was dreaming, after all.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe secrets of sleepSleepHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I bet you do too.”Throughout the book, Giuffre beguiles, apologises and cheerfully breaks the fourth wall in an effort to soften the distaste she assumes her story will trigger. Make no mistake: this is a book about power, corruption, industrial-scale sex abuse and the way in which institutions sided with the perpetrator over his victims. Epstein hanged himself in prison while awaiting trial in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator, is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, outcomes largely enabled by Giuffre’s testimony. But it is also a book about how a young woman becomes a hero. And yet here she is, having to charm us out of shrinking from her in horror.Of course, these assumptions of hers aren’t wrong. Giuffre, who was 41 when she died and whose deft, smart book is co-written with the journalist Amy Wallace, knows that to be a victim of sexual violence is to be at best pitied, at worst reviled. (Sample headline from the Daily News: “Jeffrey Epstein Accuser Was Not a Sex Slave, but a Money-Hungry Sex Kitten, Her Former Friends Say.”) I approached Nobody’s Girl with two questions. First, does it give any insight into the so-called Epstein list, the catalogue of prominent men to whom Giuffre and others were trafficked? The closest we get to a fresh allegation is Giuffre’s description of one of the scores of men Epstein forced her to have sex with as a “politician” and “former minister”, who choked and beat her almost unconscious, but who, she writes, is too powerful to name. (When she told Epstein how violent the man had been, he said coldly: “You’ll get that sometimes.”)The book breathes life into Giuffre’s legal status as a victim, showing us a girl like any we knowSecond, does the book make life harder for Ghislaine Maxwell, currently in a low security prison in Texas and sucking up to President Trump to have her sentence reduced? (Her latest appeal was rejected earlier this month.) On this score, Giuffre’s account must shunt the possibility of reprieve further out of reach. It was Maxwell – or “G Max” as she insisted the girls call her – who spotted Giuffre working as a 16-year-old locker-room assistant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, and brought her to Epstein’s house to be “interviewed” as a possible masseuse. Giuffre was forced to have sex with Epstein that day and both then and in subsequent assaults, Maxwell participated. “Maxwell began lashing out at me during our threesomes,” writes Giuffre. “If I complained, she hurt me more.”This brings me to a third question: given its punishing nature, why read this book? I’ve heard more than one person say they “don’t have the stomach” for it – not phrasing any victim needs to hear – but while the book is relentlessly, shockingly hard, it is also a clear-eyed and necessary account of how sex offenders operate. Giuffre’s greatest fear – that being raped and trafficked puts her beyond empathetic reach of most people – is not, in fact, what happens. Narrative does what deposition can’t by taking us into the room with her. The book breathes life into Giuffre’s legal status as a victim, showing us a girl like any we know, like us, and enlivening the reality of those who are trafficked while being “free” to walk away.Abused since the age of six, by the time she met Epstein, Giuffre writes: “I had been sexualized against my will and had survived by acquiescing. I was a pleaser, even when pleasing others cost me dearly. For 10 years, men had cloaked their abuse of me in a fake mantle of ‘love’. Epstein and Maxwell knew just how to tap into that same crooked vein.”Giuffre’s recollections ofPrince Andrew, meanwhile, a man with whom she was allegedly forced to have sex three times – once in the context of an orgy on Epstein’s island – present him in an even more buffoonish and grotesque light. “We disrobed and got in the tub, but we didn’t stay there long because the prince was eager to get to the bed … In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.” Prince Andrew denies Giuffre’s allegations that he had sex with her, that she had been trafficked to him by Epstein or that he had ever met her. But so much focus has been put on the prince that after reading this book, it wasn’t him I thought about most; it was the casual visitors to Epstein’s New York mansion, the illustrious men and occasional woman whom Giuffre says she encountered at dinners there.In respect of these people I’d like to ask: who the fuck did they think the 17-year-old at the table was? What did they think she was doing there? Only Melinda Gates, who met Epstein once and cited him as a factor in the breakdown of her marriage to Bill Gates, sensed what apparently none of these people could put their finger on. Giuffre quotes from a statement made by Gates after her meeting with Epstein: “I regretted it the second I walked in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified.” It was an insight that evidently escaped geniuses like the MIT professors Epstein continued toadviselong after he’d become a convicted sex offender.Giuffre was rightly proud of holding Epstein and Maxwell to account. And yet for any survivor of sexual violence, the cost of recovery – let alone of confronting her abusers in front of the world – can be impossibly steep. At the beginning of the book, Amy Wallace shares details of Giuffre’s fraught final months, including multiple health problems and alleged domestic violence at the hands of Robert Giuffre, her Australian husband. (Robert Giuffre’s lawyer has declined to comment on the allegations, citing ongoing court proceedings.) On 1 April, Giuffre wrote to Wallace: “It is my heartfelt wish that this work be published, regardless of my circumstances at the time.” Three weeks later, she was found dead on her remote Australian farm, leaving behind three children. In a lawsuit Giuffre brought against Epstein in 2009, her lawyers stated the injuries she suffered as a result of his abuse included “a loss of the capacity to enjoy life”, and were of a magnitude that made them “permanent in nature”. The same might be said for this important, courageous, tragically posthumous book.Nobody’s Girl: Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice by Virginia Roberts Giuffre is published by Doubleday.

The location, they suggest, would have been of secondary concern to the criminals.“You may ask why thieves who want to steal expensive jewellery are breaking into a world-famous museum rather than a Cartier store,” said Christopher A Marinello, a leading expert in the recovery of stolen works of art. “The answer is simple: it’s because these days a Cartier store is better protected.”View image in fullscreenThe jewels stolen from the Louvre. Top row from left: a necklace and pair of earrings from Napoleon’s wedding gift set to Marie-Louise; Empress Eugénie’s brooch; a sapphire and diamond tiara, necklace and earrings. Bottom row: Empress Eugénie’s decorative bow (left) and diadem (right).Composite: Louvre/AlamyA spate of violent jewellery shop thefts mean that many outlets have beefed up their security in recent years, with armed guards on their premises and wares no longer kept on display overnight.Museums, meanwhile, look more exposed, partly because of the in-built reason of being public-facing institutions in historic buildings, and partly the current economic climate in many western countries.“Since Covid, governments across the globe have cut back on law enforcement and the culture sector,” said Marinello. “If thieves can get into the Louvre, it shows how vulnerable our institutions have become. This is a horrible time to be a museum.”The theft of the objects – including necklaces made up of eight sapphires and 631 diamonds, the tiara of Empress Eugénie featuring nearly 2,000 diamonds and a hugely valuable crown once owned by Napoleon III’s wife that the thieves dropped by the roadside on their way out – has inevitably drawn comparisons with the 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa from the same museum, carried out by the Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.View image in fullscreenA mug shot and fingerprints of Vincenzo Peruggia.Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyBetter points of reference may be the2019 burglary of jewellery from Dresden’s Green Vault Museumworth over €113m, the theft of a£4.75m gold toilet from Blenheim Palacethe same year, the2017 heist of a large gold coin from Berlin’s Bode Museumor even a spate of thefts ofsports memorabilia from US mining museums.In each case, the crimes appeared mostly motivated by the material value of the objects that disappeared. “There’s a simple pattern here,” said Marinello. “Smash, grab, and melt it down as quickly as possible.”If the artefacts were to remain intact, experts say, the thieves would struggle to find a buyer. “There’s no way to sell something as immediately identifiable as the Louvre’s jewels on the licit market”, said Lynda Albertson of the Association for Research into Crimes against Art, an organisation that tracks trends in museums, including thefts and vandalism.“They would be immediately recognised, especially given the Ministry of Culture has released images of the pieces. Even a private collector or an auction house like Sotheby’s or Christie’s would want to see paperwork establishing proper ownership before touching such striking pieces.”1:06‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen from Louvre in rapid heist, says French minister – videoIn the past, museums were often reluctant to go public about the disappearance of well-known works of art and would stay silent out of embarrassment. These days, as art thefts are more widely publicised, the storage and sale of stolen art is risky business for any criminal.“If you steal a Picasso, it has to remain intact or it becomes worthless, and you have to conceive of a scheme to keep it in hiding, perhaps by passing it around difficult criminal actors,” said Marinello. “And you’re constantly exposed to the risk of an accomplice telling the police to cash in a ransom.”For similar reasons, the art detectiveArthur Brandsaid it was vanishingly unlikely that the theft had been ordered,as Dutch media havereported could be the case for golden Dacian treasuresstolen in January from the Drents Museumin the Netherlands. “Stolen to order is something from the Hollywood movies,” he said. “Nobody would touch this. It’s all around the world and in all the newspapers. If you buy this, if you get caught, you end up in prison. You cannot show it to your friends, you cannot leave it to your children.”Altering stolen works by melting down or re-cutting does reduce the value. When it comes to diamonds, it also comes with considerable risk because contemporary cutting techniques give stones a larger and lighter surface area, and antique-cut stones would either draw unwanted attention or barter the price down for a coverup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fitting similar security equipment in historic buildings is difficult and expensive.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesCrucially, however, melting down or re-cutting eliminates the evidence of the crime. “My guess is that the Louvre thieves will try to take the stolen goods to places with diamond expertise like Israel, India or even as close as Antwerp, and find someone to cut out the gems,” said Marinello.The heist at the Louvre has alreadyraised questions about security measuresat the museum, with a leaked state auditor report expected to be published next month criticising “considerable” and “persistent” delays in updating equipment and noting that security cameras were lacking in many rooms. But security experts say displaying precious items in historic buildings with a steady stream of visitors comes with risks that are impossible to eliminate completely.“Historic buildings are much harder to protect,” said Erin Thompson, a professor of art crime at City University of New York. “Many of them have nice big street-facing windows that makes it easy for thieves to get away, and there may be building protection statutes in place that mean you can’t fit them with proper bulletproof glass.”The most solid security systems for buildings should be conceptualised “like a fortress”, said Peter Stürmann of the German security company VZM, which advises museums and archives. “There should be several layers to repel attackers.”How the Louvre museum robbery happened in video, photographs and mapsRead moreModern buildings are fitted with state-of-the-art external CCTV cameras or in-built seismic detectors that raise alarm about a smashed window in real time, but old museums may be reluctant to uglify their exteriors. Laser scanners can be hard to fit to stuccoed ceilings. Motion and sound detectors may also have to be disabled during the day as hordes of visitors stomp through a museum.The timing of the Louvre raid, which took place between 9.30am and 9.40am local time, was typical of recent thefts, Stürmann said. “There’s a good reason why thefts tend to happen at either opening or closing times. It’s often when guards change their shifts and before the museum is full of visitors who effectively act as additional security staff.”Technological progress may have thrown up new gadgets that can raise the alarm more quickly and efficiently, but it has also given thieves new tools with which to circumvent security measures. In Paris, the robbers reached the museum’s first-floor window with a vehicle-mounted ladder and cut through a glass panewith a battery-powered disc cutter.Elaine Sciolino, the author of Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World’s Greatest Museum, said the conversation inFranceabout the 232-year-old building had mostly focused on crowd control in recent years, and less on security.The museum has an on-site brigade of about 50 permanent firefighters, orsapeurs-pompiers, but their mission is mainly to protect the collection from fires and flooding. “There is no rapid-response unit,” Sciolino said. “Ultimately, the security of the Louvre all comes down to political will and money, and currently France simply has no money.”Additional reporting by Senay BoztasExplore more on these topicsParisMuseumsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Nothing worked. So I gave in, tuned into some macabre podcasts and had a very surprising reactionRohan SathyamoorthyMon 20 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTShareFor years I had accepted that sleep, just like the Rubik’s cube and a receding hairline, was one of those things that I personally was not equipped to beat. No matter how much I tried to disarm my mind with an assortment of pills, elaborate mind games and expensive sleep teas, nothing seemed to work. In fact, many of these “solutions” only made my insomnia worse. On the rare occasion that I did catch myself drifting off, a bout of relief and excitement would quickly overtake me, leaving me wide awake and more exasperated than ever. The more pressure I put on myself, the more impossible sleep became.One night I was in bed trying to replicate a strategy used by the SAS to instantaneously fall asleep by relaxing my body, starting with my facial muscles, and breathing slowly and deeply, when I finally decided I’d had enough. Clearly, trying to sleep was just not something I was cut out for. I had read all the books, done all the research and, still, nothing ever improved. If my brain refused to accept any sort of attempt to shut it down, then why waste so many hours of my day even trying?The problem, of course, was what to do instead while lying in bed. I concluded that the perfect solution to the zombified state I was left in – not quite awake, not quite asleep – was a true crime podcast. I wanted an endless monologue for my brain to mindlessly absorb.Before this I’d never really understood the obsession with podcasts, mostly because they seemed like something you dabbled in while doing something incredibly mundane. But before I knew it I was learning everything there was to know about the rise in cults on college campuses in the 2010s.It was only the next morning that I realised I had become so engrossed in my American horror story that I had fallen asleep without even noticing. After trying everything, it seemed the one thing I had not done was not try at all, and somehow it had worked.Every night now I find a new grisly distraction, and every night I find myself drifting off. For too many of us, falling asleep has become like studying for an exam, getting a job or perfecting a talent, when really it is the polar opposite; the less effort you put into it and the less time you spend thinking about it, the quicker you end up nodding off.Most people dealing with insomnia try to conjure up the relaxed, calm and Zen-like state that allows a person to fall asleep. They certainly don’t think of chainsaw-wielding serial killers and stories of home break-ins gone horribly wrong. But macabre as it may be, true crime seems to do the job far better for me than counting sheep ever will. Rather than furiously focusing on slowing down, perhaps the really relaxing thing to do is to just stop caring so much.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsThe one change that workedPodcastingDigital mediaTrue crime (Podcasts)SleepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s what settlements are designed to avoid. But we were trying for the next best thing: a general acknowledgment of what I’d been through.”Giuffre agreed to a one-year gag clause so as not to “tarnish” the late queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations in 2022.View image in fullscreenVirginia Giuffre with a photograph of herself at roughly the age when she says she was abused.Photograph: Emily Michot/TNS/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockGiuffre died by suicide in April aged 41. Hermemoir, Nobody’s Girl,published on Tuesday, comes amid growing pressure for Andrew to be officially stripped of his titles.Before its publication, the prince announced he wouldno longer use his Duke of Yorkor Knight of the Order of the Garter titles, which are extant but inactive.As King Charles visited Manchester on Monday to show his support to the Jewish community and those affected by the terrorist attack at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on 2 October,pressure was growing on the royal family to go furtherby backing a move to formally strip Andrew of his dukedom through parliamentary legislation.Downing Street would not be drawn on the matter, with the prime minister’s official spokesperson saying the question of legislation was “a matter for the palace in the first instance” and ministers “support the judgment of the king” regarding Andrew’s titles.He added: “The prime minister’s thoughts are very much with the victims and survivors ofJeffrey Epsteinwho suffered and continue to suffer.”Meanwhile, the Metropolitan policewas “actively” looking into claimsAndrew passed Giuffre’s date of birth and social security number to his police protection officer in an attempt to dig up dirt for a smear campaign, after reports in the Mail on Sunday.A Buckingham Palace source said the new allegations were of “very serious and grave concern” and should be “examined in the appropriate way”.They said action was needed because of “what lies at the heart of this, the broader allegations and the issues highlighted”.The Mail on Sunday reported that Andrew had embarked on an effort to smear Giuffre in 2011. The prince’s alleged attempt, on which the officer is not said to have acted, came hours before the newspaper first published the photograph of Andrew with Giuffre.In her book, Giuffre repeats her allegations,published in an exclusive extract by the Guardian, that she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions, including when she was 17 and also during an orgy after being trafficked by the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew vehemently denies the allegations.Nobody’s Girl by Virginia Roberts Giuffre review – a devastating exposé of power, corruption and abuseRead moreGiuffre also claims her legal case against Andrew was strengthened by the royal’s own words in his disastrous 2019 Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis when he insisted he had no memory of meeting Giuffre, failed to apologise for his friendship with Epstein and failed to articulate any compassion for Epstein’s victims.The immediate fallout saw him forced to withdraw from public life “for the foreseeable future”.Giuffre wrote: “As devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel.“Its contents would not only help us build an ironclad case against the prince but also open the door to potentially subpoenaing his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.”The book reads: “Did he really take Beatrice out for pizza on March 10, 2001, as he claimed? If we deposed the princesses, his family members could potentially poke holes in his alibi.“Would his medical records really show that he had a temporary case of anhidrosis (a lack of perspiration), which typically isn’t a response to adrenaline? We weren’t quite ready to sue yet, but this interview gave us a lot more to work with than we’d had before.”Once she went ahead with her lawsuit, she said, the prince tried to hide at Balmoral. “Initially, the prince made it difficult for my lawyers to serve him with papers, fleeing to Queen Elizabeth’s Balmoral Castle in Scotland and hiding behind its well-guarded gates.”View image in fullscreenIn her memoir, Giuffre accuses Andrew of hiding from court action behind the walls of Balmoral Castle.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAA settlement was reached in 2022, thrashed out over “two days of mediation talks”. Giuffre read it through tears, she said.In it Andrew accepted she had suffered “both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks”. He also commended her and other survivors “in standing up for themselves and others” and said he’d “never intended to malign [her] character”.She wrote: “I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother’s Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been.”Giuffre said she gained “more out of” Andrew than money because she had “an acknowledgment that I and many other women had been victimised and a tacit pledge to never deny it again”.She said she looked forward to using the “Crown’s money to do some good” and said she began developing herSpeak Out, Act, Reclaim (Soar) foundationto combat human trafficking.In her final chapter, Giuffre said: “I don’t regret it, but the constant telling and retelling has been extremely painful and exhausting.“With this book, I seek to free myself from my past. From now on, anyone who wants to know about what happened can sit down with Nobody’s Girl and start reading.”Giuffre wrote in an email to her co-writer Amy Wallace, after a car accident shortly before she died, that it was her “heartfelt wish that this work be published, regardless of my circumstances at the time”, and that it was still to be released in the event of her death.“The content of this book is crucial, as it aims to shed light on the systemic failures that allow the trafficking of vulnerable individuals across borders,” she said in the email.Speaking to Channel 4 News on Monday night, Amanda Roberts, the sister-in-law of Giuffre, said the Met should “100%” reopen its investigation into Andrew.“What else does it have to take? I think the cost of proof is too high for these survivors and we’ve seen that over and over again. It doesn’t matter who is being implicated, there is no separate law for those in power,” she said.In response, the Met said that, on being made aware of the human trafficking allegation in 2001, it was “clear that any investigation would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK”. It was concluded the Met was not the “appropriate authority” to investigate and a full criminal investigation would not go ahead, a decision reviewed and confirmed in 2019.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Health officials said the documented findings included “clear signs of direct gunfire at point-blank range and bodies crushed beneath Israeli tank tracks”.Eyad Barhoum, the administrative director of Nasser medical complex, said the bodies carried “no names but just codes” and thatpart of the identification processhad started.Scramble to shore up ceasefire as Israel hits Gaza with deadly raidsRead moreWhile there is substantial evidence that many of the returned Palestinians had been executed, it is much harder to determine where the victims were killed. Sde Teiman is a storage facility for bodies taken from Gaza but it is also a prison camp that has become notorious for deaths in captivity. Human rights activists are demanding an investigation to find out whether any of the dead were killed there, and if so, how many.The body of Mahmoud Ismail Shabat, 34, from northern Gaza, bore marks of hanging around his neck, his legs crushed by tank tracks, which suggests he was killed or injured in Gaza and that his body was later taken to Sde Teiman. His brother Rami, who identified the body of his sibling by the scar from a previous head surgery, said: “What hurt us the most was that his hands were tied, and his body was covered with clear signs of torture.”“Where is the world?” said Shabat’s mother. “All our hostages returned tortured and broken.”View image in fullscreenSoldiers lock a gate from the inside at Sde Teiman detention facility.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersSome Palestinian doctors say the fact that many of the bodies were blindfolded and bound suggests they weretortured and then killedduring their detention at Sde Teiman – where, according to Israeli media reports and testimony from prison guard whistleblowers, Israel isholding nearly 1,500bodies of Palestinians from Gaza.A whistleblower who spoke to the Guardian and who witnessed the conditions of detention at Sde Teiman said: “I did witness a patient from Gaza being brought with a gunshot wound to the left chest. He was also blindfolded and handcuffed, naked as he arrived to the emergency department. Another patient, with a right-leg gunshot wound also arrived to my hospital in similar conditions.”Another whistleblower has previously described how patients, all from Gaza, were handcuffed to the beds. They had all been dressed in nappies and were blindfolded.He was told that some patients had come from hospitals in Gaza. “These were patients who had been captured by the Israeli army while being treated in Gaza hospitals and brought here. They had limbs and infected wounds. They were moaning in pain.”He claimed the military had no proof that detainees were all members of Hamas, with some inmates repeatedly asking why they were there.View image in fullscreenPalestinian prisoners in the Gaza Strip at the Sde Teiman detention facilityPhotograph: SuppliedIn one case, he said, he learned that a detainee’s hand had been amputated “because the wrists had become gangrenous due to handcuffing wounds”.Shadi Abu Seido, a Palestinian journalist from Gaza who works forPalestineToday, who was released after 20 months’ detention at Sde Teiman and in another Israeli prison, said he had been seized by Israeli forces at al-Shifa hospital on 18 March 2024.“They stripped me completely naked for 10 hours in the cold,” he said in a video interviewpublished on Instagramby the Turkish public broadcaster TRT. “I was then transferred to Sde Teiman and held there for 100 days, during which I remained handcuffed and blindfolded. Many died in detention, others lost their minds. Some had limbs amputated. They suffered sexual and physical abuse. They brought dogs that urinated on us. When I asked why I had been arrested, they answered: ‘We have killed all the journalists. They died once. But we brought you here and you will die hundreds of times.’”Naji Abbas, the director of the prisoners and detainees department at Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHR), said: “The signs of torture and abuse found on the bodies of Palestinians recently returned by Israel to Gaza are horrifying – yet, sadly, not surprising.“These findings corroborate what Physicians for Human Rights Israel has exposed over the past two years about conditions inside Israeli detention facilities – particularly at the Sde Teiman camp – where Palestinians have been subjected to systematic torture and killings by soldiers and prison guards.”PHR said: “The unprecedented number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli custody, together with verified evidence documented of deaths resulting from torture and medical neglect – and now the findings on the returned bodies – leave no doubt: an independent international investigation is urgently needed to hold those responsible in Israel accountable.”The Guardian submitted photographs of the bodies to an Israeli doctor who also witnessed the treatment of prisoners at the field hospital in Sde Teiman.On condition of anonymity, the physician said one of the pictures “shows the man had his hands tied likely with zip ties. There is a change in colour between the arms and the hands at the level of the zip ties, likely indicating ischemic changes due to excessive restraints.”He added: “This might be someone who was either injured and captured (thus died under Israeli custody) or someone who died due to injuries inflicted after his capture.”Dr Morris Tidball-Binz, a physician specialising in forensic science and a UN rapporteur, said: “A call should be made for independent and impartial forensic assistance to assist efforts to examine and identify the dead.”Contacted regarding the allegations of torture, the Israel Defense Forces said they had asked the Israel Prison Service to investigate. The IPS did not respond to a request for comment.As for the alleged abuses at Sde Teiman and the torture of prisoners, the IDF previously said it treated detainees “appropriately and carefully” and that “any allegation regarding misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, criminal investigations are opened by the military police.”Asked about the claim Palestinian bodies had come from Sde Teiman, the IDF said they “are not commenting on this matter”.At least 75 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023,according to the UN.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Lam was previously a special adviser to Boris Johnson and is often described asa rising star of the new intake.Lam told the Sunday Times she believed large numbers of people with legal status in the UK would need to have their right to stay revoked and should “go home”.She said: “There are also a large number of people in this country who came here legally, but in effect shouldn’t have been able to do so. It’s not the fault of the individuals who came here, they just shouldn’t have been able to do so.“They will also need to go home. What that will leave is a mostly but not entirely culturally coherent group of people.”In a letter to Badenoch, the Lib Dem leader,Ed Davey, called it “deeply concerning and unpatriotic. People who have come to the United Kingdom legally, played by the rules and made it their home do not need to ‘go home’. This is their home.”View image in fullscreenEd Davey said the remarks made by Katie Lam were ‘deeply concerning’.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PADavey said that Lam’s suggestion of removing thousands of people who were in the UK legally “shows just how far your party has moved away from the fundamental values of decency, tolerance and respect for the rule of law that the vast majority of people in our country hold dear”.TheLiberal Democratssaid the Conservatives should urgently clarify if Lam reflected the party’s position and whom the party believes “shouldn’t have been able” to come to the UK legally.A-level English, voluntary work, delayed citizenship: it’s Labour’s Orwellian Two Minutes Hate for immigrants  | Nesrine MalikRead more“What does ‘a mostly but not entirely culturally coherent group of people’ mean and how would this be set out in the Conservative party’s immigration rules?” the letter asks.The position is similar to Reform UK, which has said it wouldscrap indefinite leave to remain(ILR) and that migrants would need to reapply for five-year visas, which would only be granted to those with high earnings.Labour also intends to reform ILR, though it will only make it available to those who have been in the UK for 10 years and who can prove they have made a contribution to UK society, such as through volunteer work.Explore more on these topicsConservativesImmigration and asylumEd DaveyLiberal DemocratsKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

The commissioner has been clear he doesn’t believe officers should be policing toxic culture war debates, with current laws and rules on inciting violence online leaving them in an impossible position.“As a result, the Met will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents. We believe this will provide clearer direction for officers, reduce ambiguity and enable them to focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations.“These incidents will still be recorded and used as valuable pieces of intelligence to establish potential patterns of behaviour or criminality.“We will continue to investigate and arrest those who commit hate crimes – allowing us to comply with statutory guidance while focusing our resources on criminality and public protection.”Linehan was questioned on suspicion of a public order offence relating to his post after his arrest last month.It sparked a free-speech row which prompted the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to say at the time that the police should focus on the most serious issues.In one of the three tweets cited by police at the time of Linehan’s arrest as evidence of an alleged crime, he had written: “If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.”Another was a photograph of a trans-rights protest, with the comment “a photo you can smell”, and a follow-up post which read: “I hate them. Misogynists and homophobes. F*** em.”The Free Speech Union said it had instructed lawyers to sue the Met for wrongful arrest on Linehan’s behalf.Its general secretary, Toby Young, said: “I’m glad the police have dropped the case, but it should have been obvious there was no case to answer in the first place. Graham should never have been interviewed about his tweets, let alone arrested by five armed police officers and held in a cell for over 12 hours.“We’ve instructed a top flight team of lawyers to sue the Met for wrongful arrest, among other things. Graham deserves an apology and the police must be made to pay a price so they stop behaving like the Stasi.”Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeGraham LinehanPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Their average household debt is £9,963.This month, energy bills for a typical household rose to the equivalent of£1,755 a year for dual fuelwhile food inflation has begun to increase again. Figures forAugust showed food prices were up by 5.1% year-on-year, with sharp rises in the cost of butter, coffee, chocolate and beef. Official figures released in the summer showed thatrents are taking up an increasing part of tenants’ incomes.The charity is calling on the government to take action in the autumn budget to help those who are struggling. It wants to see targeted utility bill support, an increase in local housing allowance and the end of the two-child limit on benefits.Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said:“Four million people have simply run out of options and many others are on the cusp of crisis … This is the result of years of successive government inaction on living standards and policy decisions which have made life even harder for struggling households.”She added: “The Labour government came into office with big promises on living standards that it’s yet to deliver on.”Explore more on these topicsHousehold billsUK cost of living crisisEnergy billsEnglandWalesInflationConsumer affairsShareReuse this content"

That requires us to invest and prepare our forces to be ready to deploy,” Healey said in response to a question.“I’ve accelerated already millions of pounds in that preparation for any possible deployment in the event of peace. And I would expect the cost of that to be well over £100m,” the minister added.Though there is scepticism about whether Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the near-four-year full-scale war, the prospect ofa summit in Budapest between the Russian leader and the US presidentin the next few weeks has raised the possibility that an end to the fighting could emerge.The multinational force involves 30 countries who will be expected to contribute to a peacekeeping force if Russia and Ukraine can agree a ceasefire. It would initially be led by a French general, before the position and the headquarters rotated to the UK a year later.Its principal components will be a Nato-style air policing operation to secure the country’s airspace and a maritime security force to support an existing mine-clearing Black Sea naval force of Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria.But although Healey said that Starmer had committed to “UK boots on the ground”, land forces will be limited to logistics, armament and training specialists to help Ukraine’s army protect the country from future attack.The force would “secure the skies and seas, and train Ukrainian forces to defend their nation”, Healey said in a speech at the Mansion House.Earlier on Monday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he would be ready to join Putin and Trump at their summit in Hungary if he is invited.On Sunday, Trump said the best solution to end the war would beto “cut up” the Donetsk regionthat is the scene of the heaviest fighting on the frontlines. He also pressured Zelenskyy to give up some of his country’s territory for a deal.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryUkraineDefence policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Hurt by some of the internal briefing against her position as education secretary, she debated for more than a day whether to join the race at all. Being cast as the favoured candidate has not been comfortable.Nevertheless, the outcome is likely to have profound consequences. “The result obviously matters, and the centre know it,” aLaboursource said. “Why else would they have gone to bat so hard for their candidate?”It is hard to imagine that any newfound unity will follow the result. Powell’s supporters in particular feel deeply aggrieved by how their candidate has been portrayed as the reckless outcast.Over the weekend Powell was described as “the Momentum candidate” and Phillipson gave an interview saying she would cost the party the election.“People keep saying the gloves are off – there is only one candidate with the gloves off and it’s not Lucy,” one MP said. Another said: “It’s clear that when the leadership preach unity they only mean one thing – avoid any criticism or debate even when we’re making serious mistakes.”View image in fullscreenPhillipson, the education secretary, is No 10’s preferred choice.Photograph: Aaron Chown/PAThere will be no big event to mark the result on Saturday, just a camera in Labour HQ with the results and a short speech from the winner. Some of Powell’s backers are irritated by the low-key plan. There are fears that she may be in effect frozen out – and uncertainty over whether she would be able to do her own broadcast rounds or election organising. “They need to respect the mandate if she wins,” one ally said.Senior strategists had hoped five weeks ago to avoid a contest altogether, with a high threshold for MP nominations.Keir Starmermade appointments in the reshuffle for the party chair and the deputy prime minister, crowding out the role of deputy leader.But with a restive parliamentary party a fix looked unlikely even though some ministers and aides piled pressure on MPs to back Phillipson.After the first polls dropped, amid the turmoil over the departure of both Rayner andPeter Mandelson, Powell looked unassailable with a 17-point lead. But the race has a number of unknowns.Phillipson’s team have made a number of strong policy interventions including on child poverty. Low turnout is expected from an apathetic party membership. And Phillipson, who has close union relations, has gained the endorsements of three major trade unions that have a vote in the deputy leadership – and which have never been polled.She has more endorsements in London – with a higher membership – and will also be likely to command loyalty in the north-east, which also has high membership numbers. But even with all of those caveats, most Labour MPs believe Powell will win.The leadership race has pushed both to be more publicly radical. Powell has pushed for an end to factionalismand a louder assault on Nigel Farageand the politics of division, warning about the voters being lost on the party’s left flank. She also made an early call for the end of the two-child benefit limit – a tank on Phillipson’s lawn.Phillipson has made concrete policy commitments, which hold more weight as a cabinet minister, saying she will work to end to the two-child limit and will be the bulwark in government against the watering down of Labour’s workers’ rights package.“The stakes are, on the surface, incredibly low,” one MP said. “But it has the potential to have huge consequences if Lucy wins. But for a hell of a lot of my members, believe it or not, they aren’t even that engaged.”Another MP added: “Members are disengaged with everything frankly – including this – and it’s not good news for the party if that’s the case.”Inside No 10, there is disquiet among some strategists about Powell as deputy leader. Relations with Starmer’s team were particularly frosty over the welfare vote.Powell was a key figure in the cabinet underlining the possibility that the government could lose the vote – and the first to tip off No 10 about the possibility of a reasoned amendment to kill the bill.Some of Starmer’s team then suggested they believed she was in cahoots with some of the welfare rebels, which was fiercely denied. Trust was never regained – Powell was furious that her information led to her being cast as disloyal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said Powell had declined numerous media offers to make explicit criticism of government mistakes.Being the only candidate with the ability to influence cabinet decisions. Phillipson has made a number of firm commitments to members. She will sit on the future of work committee that oversees the workers’ rights legislation – promising she will veto any attempt to water down or slow the proposals.She said she would formally seek members’ and trade unionists’ views each quarter and report them directly back to the cabinet. And she has argued she has the credentials to fight Reform, in a north-east seat that looks at risk in the next election.View image in fullscreenThe prime minister’s allies believe that blocking a return to Westminster by Andy Burnham would be more difficult with Powell as his deputy.Photograph: House of Commons/PAThere is no love lost between the two candidates, especially as the race has gone on. Powell is irritated at being seen as the proxy candidate for the leadership ambitions of Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester.But there is a fear among Starmer allies that should Burnham seek to return to Westminster as an MP, blocking his candidacy would be harder with Powell as deputy leader, as she would sit on the national executive committee, which oversees selections.Tensions were high at the final hustings, hosted by the Fabian Society. Powell laid bare her own fears for her family over taking on such a high-profile role, especially after the targeting of Rayner – but hinted that supporters of Phillipson were fuelling that.“Do I want my family and myself to be put under the spotlight and face all that … we’ve got to think about how we’re behaving. Some of the things that have been said about me in this campaign by Bridget and her team are frankly appalling as well.”Phillipson doubled down, saying Powell would “risk the division that we will see that potentially puts us back on the path to opposition”.“The members hate disloyalty more than they love any politician,” an ally of Phillipson said. “We unapologetically prosecuted the argument that if you’re outside the cabinet, and you’re going out there saying: ‘We need to do X, Y, and Z’ – it will create negative headlines. It’s an entirely legitimate point to make in a campaign.”But another Labour source cautioned Downing Street against isolating Powell should she win. “What is needed after this contest is for the Labour family to come together as a broad church. Anyone who thinks the outcome should be to lock people out has not been listening to the broad desire for unity.”Her team are nervous that her victory is seen as a foregone conclusion. Some MPs are even more worried that it would be yet another destabilising moment should she win. “I am dreading it if Lucy wins, every time she opens her mouth it will be a divisive moment,” one MP said.Powell insists she is not there to cause disruption – but said a victory would be a “mandate for change” in how Labour operated and its messaging. “The country needs us to prove the model that progressive mainstream politics can actually make a difference. If I win, I’m going to get to work on that straight away.”Explore more on these topicsLabourLucy PowellBridget PhillipsonKeir StarmerLabour party deputy leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

He was one of seven people canonised at a Mass in St Peter’s Square held by Pope Leo on Sunday, in a ceremony put in motion by Pope Francis in one of his final acts.Many people travelled from Papua New Guinea to Rome, where tens of thousands of people attended the service on Sunday.

He stood up for religious values in the face of Japanese oppression and continued to hold services in secret.Around 1943, the destruction of the church saw him build a “bush church” outside the village to hold secret services; he kept records of baptisms and weddings there. ToRot and others continued their work until he was imprisoned and killed by lethal injection by the Japanese in 1945.Fr John Glynn, a highly respected Catholic priest in PNG from Jubilee Catholic secondary school, said the canonisation of ToRot was of “huge significance to the Christian people of Papua New Guinea”.“He lead his people in worship and encouraged them to be faithful to theirChristian beliefs and to live in hope,” said Glynn, who started his priesthood journey in the region where ToRot was from and has served in many villages in the area.View image in fullscreenPope Leo XIV canonised new saints at St Peter’s Square, in the Vatican on Sunday.Photograph: Massimo Percossi/EPAFr Lawrence Arockiaraj, the general secretary of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, hailed the “canonisation as a moment of national pride and spiritual significance.“Saint Peter TeRot’s life of faith, courage, and devotion to family serves as a model not only for Papua New Guinea, but for the world and the universal church” Fr Lawrence said.Josephine Thomfrom Madang said the canonisation marked a “proud moment for our family”.

Joe Swash asks none of themLucy ManganMon 20 Oct 2025 16.00 EDTShareIgrew up surrounded by children having children. My all-girls school was known locally as “the pram pushers” – the first person in my cohort to get pregnant was 13; in my sister’s it was an 11-year-old – and my mother worked as a family planning doctor in the 16th-poorest borough of the country. The girls she met, the stories she heard, were – like those of the pregnant girls at school – stories of deprivation, vulnerability, gullibility and predation by adult men or older teenage boys.All of which means that I grew up not giving much thought to the fathers of these children’s children (except it being pretty clear in my mind that the adults needed to be in prison). The young mothers were the focus, they and their imminent children the lives in most urgent need of intervention. The men could and did walk away, for many obvious reasons. The boys could too, and largely did. It has been that way since time immemorial. The one who doesn’t grow the baby can leave it much more easily. On this, physics and emotions are for once in perfect agreement.In Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads, we are invited to consider whether the boys are hard done by. Four young men are interviewed – if you can call this gush of affirmations and exclamations by the well-meaning Swash that – about their decision to stay and their lives since.Oran became a father at 16 and his daughter is now nearly three. His girlfriend, Casey, and his dad, Grant, refer to Oran’s “journey” – needing time to come to terms with all the ways his life would have to change (“I guess he was quite a selfish boy growing up, which most people are,” says Grant) – but by the time we meet him, he seems to be shouldering the duties of fatherhood admirably. “You have to take a step back and realise – I have another person to be responsible for.” He also seems to be reaping the benefits of parenthood, too. There is joy on his face when he engages with his child. If you can banish from your mind the thought that the three of them could have had all this and much more if they’d just waited 10 years, all is much as it should be and better than those around them might have dared hope.The same can be said of Wyatt and Casey, 17 when their now 18-month-old was born, though their current equilibrium feels more fragile. Wyatt is a gentle, articulate soul who, with his younger brother, has been raised by his grandmother, Jill, after a troubled childhood with two drug-addicted parents. He now stays at home with their son while Casey works long hours. He is clearly doing his best and his best is far from inconsiderable. I would like to know how involved Jill is during the week, but certainly the mix of fatigue, frustration and love that is the hallmark of every involved parent is etched in every line of Wyatt’s bearing. “I can’t have him going through what I went through,” he says of his son.The other two dads are slightly older (18 and 21 at the time of conception) and navigating slightly less dramatic challenges but with equal commitment. None of their stories, however, are particularly served by being undercut by Swash’s own, as he – presumably at the behest of a producer desperate to make him seem a good fit for this presenting role – outlines at length his own memories of becoming a father at 25 (which is not at all on a par with 16, or even 21) and how being without a dad of his own (he died when Swash was 11) affected his parental skills.There are too many issues squashed into one programme here, and none are given the consideration they deserve. Are Oran et al outliers who could become a majority if better support for young dads was available, or would this be like King Canute shouting at the waves? Should a society aim to support or eradicate unplanned pregnancies? Can it do both? Is ambition the best form of contraception, and which government should we elect if we want to give our young people the ability to form it? So many questions and no answers by the end of the shoddy hour here.Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryTV reviewTelevisionParents and parentingMenreviewsShareReuse this content"

My instructions had been perfectly clear: break into the Louvre, head for theDenon wingand deliver me the Leonardo da Vincis. Instead, what did they do? Brought me trinkets! Stand there, over the trap door. A bit more to the right.It would be nice to think an art collector supervillain somewhere was punishing the Louvre raiders for their moronic bad taste. Admittedly, security around the Mona Lisa has improved sinceit was last stolen in 1911, but the museum’s other Leonardos just hang on the wall like other paintings. And there is so much beauty, so many quiet galleries, scattered through this vast former palace: the thieves could have got out with a Chardin still life, a Rogier van der Weyden, an ancient Mesopotamian statuette.Louvre heist: hunt on for thieves after eight ‘priceless’ jewellery pieces stolenRead moreObviously I am glad they didn’t. My first reaction when I heard aboutthe heist on Sunday morningwas relief. This is such a treasury of art, but in a well-planned job the thieves used an extending ladder on a truck to enter the Galerie d’Apollon and grab a bunch of old royal knick-knacks. Despite breathless reports of the theft of “France’s priceless crown jewels”, this is scarcely like stealing the British crown jewels that symbolise our still-monarchical state. France hasn’t had royals in a long time so these are obscure relics.Among the stolen items are a necklace and earrings that belonged to Marie-Amelie, wife of the 19th-century monarch Louis-Philippe and technically the last queen of France. After his reign ended in the 1848 revolution they were exiled in Britain and she died in Surrey in 1866. Then power was seized by Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of the original Emperor Napoleon. The thieves have also taken a tiara and brooch belonging to his wife, Empress Eugénie, who died in Madrid in 1920, 50 years after her husband was deposed.Got all that? This is the kind of French constitutional history that gave me a headache as an A-level student. Even the stolen emerald necklace and earrings associated with the original, more exciting Napoleon belonged to his second wife, Marie Louise, not the renowned Josephine. I think the French culture minister must have had to suppress a snigger while claiming these items have “immeasurable heritage value”.View image in fullscreenNicked knack … Empress Eugenie’s tiara from the Louvre’s collection.Photograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyNo, this is not about history, let alone art. It is about sapphires, emeralds and diamonds, and the gold and silver in which they are set. It doesn’t take an art detective to figure out that thieves who executed a robbery that ignored all the Louvre’s cultural treasures for these brainless items are ruthlessly interested in the precious materials from which they are made. Is this part of a new kind of “art” heist that isn’t about art at all?The thieves who liftedMaurizio Cattelan’s golden toilet from Blenheim Palace in 2019were not interested in Cattelan’s art (and who is, really?) but the gold which they were able to sell within days. The loo literally melted away into the inexhaustible market for precious metals. It seems all too likely the Louvre’s crown jewels will be broken up and their precious elements untraceably sold as anonymous jewels and metals, unless the crooks are caught first.This is so much more practical than trying to sell a world famous artistic masterpiece. “Classic” art theft is irrational and doesn’t really work. When thieves took The Scream from the Munch Museum in Oslo they had no real idea what to do with it. The painting, as I was told by the Oslo police, was badly damaged by being kept in a wet van before its recovery. How could you really keep such an icon underground for long? The theft of Caravaggio’s Nativityby the Palermo mafiaalmost certainly resulted in this great work’s destruction into worthless fragments of canvas and pigment. But precious stones and metals carry on being precious.It’s possible the thieves are not immediately planning to break up everything. Some of the royal jewelstaken from the Green Vault in Dresden Castlein 2019 were recovered in Berlin in 2022. But the raid in Dresden – a city that houses artistic masterpieces such as Raphael’s Sistine Madonna and Giorgione’s Sleeping Venus – adds to the evidence that thieves are targeting precious gems and metals from museums rather than going to the bother of trying to profit from a famous painting.Perversely this may be good news for guardians of the world’s great art. The Louvre will be looking at its security, but perhaps the real security of art lies in its ever increasing fame, when even lesser known sculptures and paintings can be looked up online instantly.When Goya’s portrait of the Duke of Wellington wasstolen from the National Gallery in 1961, the James Bond production designer Ken Adam wittily put it on the wall in Dr No’s lair, the joke being that only a Spectre supervillain might commission such a crime. Thetrue story, involving a retired Newcastle bus driver and his son, turned out to have its own peculiar romance. But anything romantic or underdoggish about art heists is a thing of the past. The thuggish crime at the Louvre suggests any interest in art by the underworld has been replaced by cold calculating greed. Art is fragile, they reckon. Diamonds are forever.Explore more on these topicsArt theftMuseumsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Audiences have taken them to their heart – one couple saw the first play on a date, got married and had its title engraved on their ringsDavid EldridgeMon 20 Oct 2025 12.30 EDTShareIt’s October 2017 and I’m sitting at the National Theatre, notebook open and pen poised, waiting for the third preview of my playBeginningto begin. The first previews had flown and I felt relaxed, enjoying the preshow music and its house party vibes. But instead of the play’s two characters, Laura and Danny, awkwardly flirting in her north London flat, I found myself imagining a couple 10 years older, in a big house in Essex. A relationship at breaking point. Middle. Fuck, I thought, and pushed the thought away as the show started.Eight years on and the final play of my trilogy, End, is in rehearsal at theNational Theatre, with Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen playing a couple knocking 60. The three plays aren’t linked narratively as I wanted audiences to be able to experience them as individual works. Beginning tells the story of a couple on the edge of 40 who have just met and the 100 minutes it takes them to kiss. Middle is the story of a late fortysomething couple whose marriage hangs in the balance at 4am. In End, Alfie and Julie must decide how to live the end of their relationship. You don’t have to have seen Beginning or Middle to appreciate or enjoy End, but the collection of plays make a whole and explore my preoccupations from differing perspectives.The plays consider relationships and the different kinds of loneliness that exist in and out of them. They share worlds in north London and Essex; they’re all single-action plays that exist in real time. In all three there’s music and dancing, some food and drink and tidying up. The men all support West Ham United. There’s a sense of progression. Beginning begins at about 2am and by the time End ends it’s about 8.20am. The plays are set in late 2015 and the first half of 2016 in what feels like a more innocent time, when the London Olympics are a recent memory. In all three plays, six lives stand on the edge of massive change. So does the world.View image in fullscreenA relationship in crisis … Daniel Ryan and Claire Rushbrook in Middle at the National Theatre, 2022.Photograph: Johan PerssonInitially, after my moment of epiphany, I was reluctant to write Middle, although I couldn’t stop thinking about it. The problem was at that stage I didn’t have an idea for End, and I didn’t want to start writing a second play until I had an idea for the third. I knew Middle would look at a relationship in crisis, so I didn’t want to write a “divorce play” with End. I didn’t want to write a “deathbed” play either. After a while, I realised the way you live your end as a couple might be a choice. It might be something the characters don’t agree upon.In Beginning andMiddlethe characters live what I’d describe as regular lives, but I realised they didn’t have to in End. Like me, the characters could come from working-class Essex backgrounds but now live in north London. They could have professional lives as artists, a writer and a DJ. In the play, Alfie quips to his partner, Julie, “it’s been a long time since we’ve been ordinary people” and she replies, “where you come from never really leaves you”. After nearly two years of mulling, by August 2019 I knew I had two more plays in me.One of the chief pleasures of making these plays is in the way audiences seem to take them to their heart. I’ve lost count of how many punters asked me if Laura and Danny stay together and have a child after the end of Beginning. One couple who saw the play on their first date, got engaged and sent me a picture of their wedding rings engraved with Beginning. A few years later, one of them emailed me with the news they were getting divorced. It made me feel inconsolably sad. As if I were somehow personally responsible. Claire Rushbrook and Daniel Ryan who performed Middle often struggled to get beyond the stage door after a show for audience members sharing tales of relief that their marriages had survived – or ended.View image in fullscreenThe different kinds of loneliness in relationships … Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen star in End at the National Theatre.Photograph: Theo McInnes“Relatability” is a word often used in relation to the plays, but it’s not something I strive for consciously. I try to tell the truth about people, and I think about John Osborne’s notion, that he wanted to give audiences “lessons in feeling”. Early in 2023, I made a ManchesterBeginningfor the Royal Exchange theatre. Although I know the city well, I fretted initially about Crouch End in north London becoming West Didsbury and Manchester United becoming Danny’s team. But the audience connected with the universal feelings of insecurity and attraction we all experience when we meet someone we like, not a street name or a football team. I suppose this may explain too why the plays have travelled and found homes in places as varied as Reykjavík, Santiago and Shanghai.I wrote a first draft of Beginning in November 2015, and it’s been a decade now that I’ve been reflecting upon love and what it means to be with someone. People ask me if my views of relationships have changed over the last 10 years. I think they have. I suspect in my early 40s I was driven by ideas of romantic love, desire, and a notion “if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be”. But nothing in life is fated and the characters in these plays all make decisions to be brave, to risk their hearts and change the direction of their lives. And they have the wisdom to create the space that might allow them to feel differently. Fancying the pants off someone still matters. But to love is to decide to give love a chance too. At 52, I think I stand with my characters.We’ll have to see how End goes but I suppose it’s a truth, to borrow from Benjamin Franklin, that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except taxes and death. We live our whole lives with the knowledge that one day we will be gone and that those who love us most will lose us. When I was writing End, I came across the work of Crouch End poet Carole Satyamurti, who died in 2019. In her striking posthumously published memento mori, she reflects “… the trick is to resist anticipating / The time when November gales/ Will strip the trees of consolation, turn / Our gaze earthwards to where brown / Leaves inscribe mortality in every dusk; / But celebrate the reds, the blues, the blacks”. It’s how we live that matters. Right until the very end.End is at theNational Theatre, London, 13 November-17 January.Methuen Dramawill publish David Eldridge: Trilogy on 20 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreDavid EldridgeRelationshipsClive OwenRoyal ExchangefeaturesShareReuse this content"

After I moved to LA, a guy I knew came up with a way of putting a fuzzbox inside my Fender Telecaster, which created the distinctive sound on Spirit in the Sky.I’d come across a greeting card with a picture of some Native Americans praying to the “spirit in the sky”. The phrase stuck in my head. One night I was watching country music on TV and the singer Porter Wagoner sang a gospel song, which gave me the idea to write religious lyrics. Although I came from a semi-religious Jewish family, I wasn’t religious, but found myself writing Christian lyrics such as “When I die and they lay me to rest, I’m going to the place that’s the best” and “Gotta have a friend in Jesus”. It came together very quickly.I survived a car crash and now give thanks to the spirit every daySoon after that, I was playing the Troubadour club in LA when the Lovin’ Spoonful’s producer Erik Jacobsen walked in. He said he had a production deal with Warner Brothers and was interested in signing me. When we recorded Spirit in the Sky for my debut album, the finished mix sent shivers up my spine. Initially, Warner said a four-minute single containing lyrics about Jesus would never get played on pop radio, but eventually they relented. In 1969, it sold two million copies. But I couldn’t recreate the success.In 1986, I was working as a cook when Dr and the Medics took it back to No 1 in the UK. Then Gareth Gates’s 2003 version meant it was No 1 in three different decades. It’s been in countless movies, including Apollo 13, Oceans 11 and Guardians of the Galaxy. I’m 82. A few years ago, I was a passenger in a car crash and spent three weeks in a coma. I feel like I was granted another life. So now every day, I pray and give thanks to the spirit in the sky.Erik Jacobsen, producerI saw Norman at a hootenanny at the Troubadour singing one song, School for Sweet Talk, but he said: “I’ve got a million songs I’d love to play for ya.” It turned out he’d had a minor hit called The Eggplant That Ate Chicago with a group called Dr West’s Medicine Show and Junk Band and had a whole raft of crazy songs about goats, chickens or a Chinese guy who ate some acid. I said: “Let’s make some records that somebody might like.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Records/AlamyI put him together with Norman Mayell, the drummer from San Francisco psychedelic group Sopwith Camel, and Doug Killmer, a bassist, who’d played a lot of black music. The Spirit in the Sky riff originated in an old John Lee Hooker tune called Boogie Chillen’ and set the tone for where the song went, but the rhythm track sounded too loose. I got Norman to bring his acoustic guitar in and we recorded two performances – each slightly different – and made it stereo. Then we brought in gospel singers the Stovall Singers and their church-type clapping became a key part of the groove. A guitarist called Russell DaShiell played a hell of a solo. By now, the track was sounding immense, but when I heard Norman’s little vocal, my heart sank. It just wasn’t heavy enough, so once again I recorded two performances and combined the two together. I thought: “Thank God!” It sounded amazing.The single got a lot of play on KRLA, a hugely influential radio station, but it came out just before Christmas, when people buy records for others, not for themselves, so there were no sales. KRLA stopped playing it. Then, two weeks into January, 22,000 orders came in from record stores in LA. Everyone started playing it again – and it just took off.The funny thing is that when we went in to record it, my engineer was sick but we went ahead anyway with just a handful of little mics, no headphones and no sound baffling. Every sound was coming in on every mic, but it sounded great. For years people asked: “How in the world did you get that sound?” I said: “I just pointed the amps right at the drums. I had no idea what I was doing.”Norman Greenbaum’s 1969 debut, Spirit in the Sky, is available on vinyl on Craft Recordings, with a Dolby Atmos mix of the single on Apple Music.

Six-sevvuhnn!Is it a code?No, it’s six-seven!Is it a cool way to say someone is at sixes and sevens, ie in a state of disorder or confusion?It is definitely not that.Then what does it mean?It’s just something the young people of today are saying. Or shouting.You mean it’s fashionable to yell out two consecutive numbers?It’s more than fashionable – it’s a plague. Six-seven has become the bane of school teachers everywhere.Why?Because it’s maddening. Imagine telling your students to turn to page 67, only for all of them to shout “six-seven!” at you.No, I mean why are the children doing that?Even they don’t know why.It must come from somewhere.Yes, but I should preface any explanation by saying: it’s a long story and it doesn’t matter.I’ll be the judge of that.Fine. The phrase “six-seven”, in its modern sense, appears to originate with the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla’s 2024 track Doot Doot (6 7), in which it’s either a reference to police radio code, or 67th Street, or something else.I see.But it really went viral when the song was repeatedly used to soundtrack video clips of the NBA basketball star LaMelo Ball, who is, as it happens, 6ft 7in.OK, I think I get it.Trust me, you don’t. Somewhere along the line the phrase acquired an accompanying hand gesture: two upturned palms alternately rising and falling, like weighing scales.In that case, perhaps it’s a reference to something being nothing special, ie asix or aseven on a scale from one to 10?Nice try, but no. The phrase has become such a phenomenon in the US that it was the basis for last week’sSouth Parkepisode, in which it sparks a moral panic.And it’s now reached the classrooms of the UK?Apparently it has. Thus ends the story of six-seven.You were right. That was long, and it didn’t matter.Not in the least. It’s a bit of meme slang that refers only to itself, advertising nothing beyond the average 13-year-old’s capacity for being annoying and a corresponding willingness to flog a dead horse.What can be done about it?Some teachers have banned it, butothers have incorporated six-seven into their teaching.I suppose it will be over soon enough.Adults are talking about it, so it already is.Do say:“Open your textbooks to page 55, and then turn over 12 more pages.”Don’t say:“Skibidi!”Explore more on these topicsYoung peoplePass notesSouth ParkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s a level of power at which right and wrong no longer existZoe WilliamsPrince Andrew has finally decided to give up his titles – but we have known the shape of the allegations against him for years. Why was there a collective decision to look away?Mon 20 Oct 2025 12.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 14.57 EDTShareOn the eve of the publication of Virginia Giuffre’s bookNobody’s Girl, released six months after her death from despair, Buckingham Palace is apparently braced for fresh revelations. Many MPs are calling for a change in the law, to give King Charles or a parliamentary committee the power to remove royal titles, with Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, pleading with parliament to take seriously this opportunity to “address the wrongs of history and to ensure that the voices of victims and survivors are really heard and acted upon”. A source at the palace told the BBC they expected “more days of pain ahead”.Getting ahead of these “days of pain”, Prince Andrew – he continues to hold the title he was born with – announcedlast Fridaythat he was relinquishing his use of “Duke of York” and “KG”, knight of the garter. In a statement, he said that after discussions with the king he had decided to give up the titles “to put my duty to my family and country first”. He has consistently denied all of Giuffre’s allegations against him.If this sounds like a relatively minor instalment in what has now been years of disgrace, starting in 2011 with the Mail on Sunday’s first publication of a photo of Andrew with Giuffre, note that it was Andrew’s habit to sign even his most intimate correspondence “A, HRH the Duke of York, KG.” That was how he signed his email to Jeffrey Epstein, anyway, the one that was sent on 28 February 2011. It was the day after that famous photo was published, and 12 weeks after Andrew claims to have cut all contact with the sex trafficker. “It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it,”the email read– the Mail on Sunday verified his email address and Epstein’s – concluding, even more nauseatingly, “Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”Giuffre’s book is revealing more in the detail than in the allegations, many of which have been well-known since 2014, when she described Andrew’s involvement while giving evidence against Epstein. (The judge at that time threw out these accusations as “immaterial and impertinent” to the case. He was presumably on pretty solid legal ground, but you do have to wonder, how, if trafficking is a crime, it comes to be immaterial who the victim was traffickedto.)Nobody’s Girl describes Andrew correctly guessing Giuffre’s age, 17, when he first meets her in London, and recalls him observing that she was just a few years older than his daughters. Her account of the first time they have sex is painfully plausible, right down to his clipped “thank you” at the end. He seemed “entitled”, she wrote, “as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright”.What this book describes most powerfully is the absolute despair Giuffre suffered. That feels more important than her credibility on the matter of her relationship with Andrew, which hasn’t been in doubt for years. He has never accepted any “wrongdoing”, but who’s to say what he even believes to be wrong? Whether because he lacks probity on verifiable facts such as the timeline of his “cut ties” with Epstein or because his assertions sound so wild (who could forget that he’s unable to sweat?), he presents as fundamentally dishonest. Taking in the phenomenal forgetfulness of Sarah Ferguson, who can’t recall visiting Epstein in New York after he’d been convicted, biographer Andrew Lownie wrote “over four years [of research] I learned not to trust a single thing the couple said”.So the question on everyone’s minds is not, “What exactly happened between Andrew, Giuffre and unnumbered other girls wholooked under-18 and didn’t speak English?” – but rather, as theBBC puts it, “After all those scandals, why would he quit his titles now?” The answer is that, until now, there was a collective decision to look away. You could level that charge at the royal family – particularly if it’s true, as it is rumoured, that the late queen covered part of his £12m payout to settle Giuffre’s civil case – but you couldn’t level it only at them. The tenacity of Emily Maitlis aside, there was a general sense that these scandals would be forever rumour-only, that however believable, they just had to pass into lore as things that may or may not have happened. We all pay a price for Epstein and his buddies, that of having to accept the idea, collude with it, really, that there’s a level of power at which right and wrong no longer exist.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it’s easier for politicians to blame ‘outsiders’Mon 20 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 11.18 EDTShareEvery few weeks, another announcement. Immigrants must dothisto earn the right to stay in the UK. Others must dothatif they are to be allowed to work in the UK. The demands grow more punitive and absurd, like the whiteboard of a meeting where everyone agreed there were no bad ideas. Voluntary work! A decade to receive citizenship! Hear me out: English A-levels!These are all real policies and pledges. Migrant NHS doctors for example, labouring for long work daysbeyond what they are paidfor will now have toprove that they “contribute to society”to earn permanent settlement in the UK. The benchmark for that contribution is volunteer work (sorry,morevolunteer work) in the community. The five-year route to settlement is now being extended to 10, to make absolutely sure that in addition to being in work, paying taxes, making national insurance contributions and paying a hefty charge to use the NHS, you’re not taking the piss. The latest demand is that some migrants must be able to speak English to A-level standard because, according to home secretary Shabana Mahmood, “it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life”.I should pause here to explain the English requirements that are already in place, and who this concerns. The migrants this policy applies to are in the “skilled worker”, “high-potential individual” and “scale up” categories, which allow companies to recruit talented individuals for skilled roles. There is already a test which proves that these individuals can broadly get by – it’s called a job interview. Besides, the visas associated with these categories already require people to be able to speak English to GCSE level. Is it now important that applicants must be able to analyse the form of anextract from The Woman in Black? I’m not quite sure. I do not have an English A-level, likethe vast majority of peoplein the UK, who somehow have not crashed the economy for lack of that qualification.You see, A-level English capability is obviously not a serious or carefully considered benchmark, but an opportunity to say some strong stuff about “coming here and not speaking our language”. Like so many political interventions, this one is based on elision, on invoking a lumpen grunting blob of immigrants who can’t and won’t speak English, won’t “play their part” and must be constantly subject to new crackdowns to prove their worth and their assimilation.There is an entire industry surrounding the UK’s existing residency and citizenship requirements, fromtests about Boudiccaand Elizabethan poets to English-language tests where you must converse at a high level with an examiner, as well as other written and spoken exams that feed into UK embassies and visa processing centres across the world. But we have now entered the territory of unreality, where there are ever-more announcements whose sole purpose is to give a sense that a crisis is being handled.The supposedly unifying thread of all these new policies is “integration”: this mythical concept that has taken on the quality of a religious ideal. But let’s talk about all the ways integration happens, and whether, in fact, it is even something that is on offer for all, not just migrants. Integration is based on facilitating interaction and enmeshment in a society. It depends upon the children’scentrethat links parents to others in the community and pools advice and resources. It depends on the libraries that provide literature and history and local knowledge. It depends onyouth clubsandmidwife visitsandcommunity centresand public-sector workers who are not so burnt out at the end of a day working in under-resourced schools and hospitals that they have no bandwidth to volunteer their work in their communities.Yet all of these services have been hollowed out by years of austerity, pushing people back into their own small networks and atomised lives. How integrated do you feel on a regular basis? Do you have an extended society of neighbours and drop-in centres and free spaces that haven’t been sold off for development where you can spend time with other people? I doubt it. Britain really is that island of strangers, yet the sense of social alienation that is now a quintessentially contemporary British experience has been forged by economic and political decisions, not immigrants.View image in fullscreenMarchers at the Unite the Kingdom rally in London, September 2025.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty ImagesAt the same time, we have started building our own bubbles, exacerbating this sense of isolation. We don’t all consume the same media any more, and mobile phones and livestreaming have allowed for the creation of infinite personalised silos of existence. Modernity and austerity combine to fracture collective experience but, well, who would want to reckon with these histories? What political establishment has any interest in the hard work of tackling what can be done to address that fraying of the national fabric, when you can erect some ideal of an integrated society that does not exist, and lay its arbitrary expectations on immigrants who must now alone prop up the delusion that the problem isn’t in the place they are coming to, but in them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toOpinion UKFree daily newsletterSee things from another point of view with our daily selection of opinion pieces.

One that is increasingly brought to us in displays ofloyalty to the flag, and not much else.

Instead the event showcased liberal-democratic consensusMon 20 Oct 2025 12.54 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 14.36 EDTShareOver the past week or so, it seemed as if someRepublicanleaders were hoping that Saturday’sNo Kings demonstrations– the marches and rallies hosted by a coalition of liberal groups across the country and worldwide – would turn violent. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, called them“Hate America” rallies, a moniker that wasquicklypicked upbyotherRepublicans, and described the No Kings protests as a crucible of potential riots,representing“all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people”. “You’re gonna bring together the Marxists, the socialists, the antifa advocates, the anarchists, and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat party,”he said. Tom Emmer, a representative for Minnesota, described the rallies as a product of the “terrorist wing” of theDemocraticparty. And Roger Marshall, a senator from Kansas,fantasizedthat the protests would require action by the national guard. Others, such as the attorney general, Pam Bondi,musedabout who might be paying the protesters to show up – an idea that seemed to dismiss the notion that anyone might opposeDonald Trump’s agenda for principled, rather than cynical, reasons.At times they sounded almost wistful. Republicans, the president himself chief among them, have been fervently endeavoring to cast those who oppose their authoritarian consolidation of power as enemies – contemptible un-Americans who lack virtue, common values, or the protection of the law. In a world where it was once considered the height of inappropriate partisanship for Hillary Clinton toreferto a “basket of deplorables” among Trump voters or Barack Obama tomournthe conservatives who “cling to guns or religion”, it barely registered as news on Thursday when the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,toldFox News: “The Democrat party’s main constituency are made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.”How can blue states fight back against Trump? With fiscal disobedience | Eric ReinhartRead moreBut no matter how fervently and how deeply the Trump regime appears to hate the American people, theNo Kings proteststhat brought millions to the streets on Saturday suggests that the American people hate them even more. In the densely packed streets of cities from New York to Austin to Oakland to St Augustine, Florida, the massive protests took on a tone of jubilant contempt, with Trump and his various lackeys derided on signs and in effigies, with jokes that ranged from the high-minded to the vulgar. At a protest in San Francisco, I saw one man holding a sign that quoted Walt Whitman, walking near a woman making a vulgar reference to Trump’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. A number of people donnedinflatable character costumes– I saw a starfish, a teddy bear, two unicorns, a rooster and a pickle. They originated fromPortland’s protestsagainst Immigration and Customs Enforcement and national guard deployments as cheeky ways tomockthe Trump administration’sclaimsthat the city was “war-torn” and in need of armed invasion. If the anti-Trump resistance movements of his first administration were characterized by a kind of self-serious righteousness, those of the No Kings era have devolved into irreverence and humor. At times I was reminded of a peculiar feeling I have sometimes had, in the desperate hours after funerals or bad breakups, when I have been crying for so long that I find I’ve started laughing.The No Kings protests have been criticized for their capaciousness and indefinite agenda, and it is true that the demonstrations are the product of several large liberal groups and bring together people whose politics and inclinations would not ordinarily mix. At San Francisco’s protest, I saw the signature red rose of the democratic socialists, the Aztec eagle of the United Farm Workers, and a gold lamé sign held aloft by alargely unclothed manwho declared himself a libertarian – in addition to a motley mix of men wearing the powdered wigs and tricorn hats of the founding fathers, women with white feathered sleeves and hoods posing as bald eagles, and a staggering number of people who wrapped themselves in the American flag.The hodgepodge of symbolism might reflect the chaotic and disorganized nature of the anti-Trump coalition – which, containing as it does the majority of the US’s 340 million people, is rife with contradictions. This has long been a problem for the Democrats: the party fears that their tent is too big, their base is too far from swing voters, and the coalitions of Obama and Joe Biden are too fractured and fragile to ever be maintained. But Trump has perhaps created a new kind of glue that can hold together a different kind of political movement: something that vast swaths of the American people hate even more than they hate each other.Amid the density of references and imagery, No Kings might also indicate a new political posture being born: a left-liberal popular front that mixes principle with irreverence. The aspiration of No Kings, in a way, is to abolish itself – to rebuild, perhaps a little sturdier and more honest this time, the kind of constitutional system in which law and persuasion replace Trump’s model of violence and domination. To put it another way: the people at the No Kings rallies all agree that they want to restore the kinds of liberal-democratic conditions that will enable them to disagree with one another.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Prove them wrong | Judith LevineRead moreAt any rate, the violence that the Trump regime seemed to long for did not materialize. In San Francisco, an organizer speaking into a megaphone urged attenders to ignore any pro-Trump agitators they might encounter, and to not engage with any federal agents. “If you see uniformed feds outside a building,” he warned the crowd, “it’s bait.” Before the marches, some seemed frightened of what might happen – whether Trump-aligned federal forces might crack down with mass arrests, or whether pro-Trump militias might instigate a fight. But the demonstrations seem to have been remarkably peaceful, even cheerful, avoiding provocations and meeting virtually no violence from Trump-aligned forces. In New York, an estimated 100,000 marchers participated in No Kings events across the five boroughs, and an officialTwitter accountassociated with the New York police department reported that there had been no arrests of protesters.Trump appeareddisappointed. On Saturday evening, after the marches had largely disbanded and the millions who had turned out to oppose him went home, he took to Truth Social, his proprietary social media platform, topostan AI-generated video of himself. In the cartoon, Trump –wearing a crown– flies a fighter jet over the No Kings protests, and dumps feces on the protesting citizens. It was a peevish, petulant little display of contempt – the kind of behavior that you would punish in a child but which has become bog standard for the president of the United States. He evidently wanted Americans to know that he hates them.

But better information might just helpMon 20 Oct 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 14.22 EDTShareHow was your Menopause Awareness Day 2025? Did you slip out of your meno pyjamas, sip your meno tea with a slice of homemade flaxseed-added bread and a side order of meno chocolate? Did you rush off to the gym to lift weights then to a pilates class to keep you healthy for ever? Did you remember your MHT (menopause hormone therapy – the now widely accepted term forHRT) pill, patch, gel, pessary, suppository or cream, trusting your GP or private clinic to be prescribing for you and only you, grateful that finally medication has made a difference for you? Or did you think: “How the hell do I know what is right for me?”If you wondered who you can trust, you’re not alone. In anAustralian studypublished earlier this month, more than 500 women aged 45-64 noted “significant scepticism” about the motives of the pharmaceutical industry, along with genuine concern about who to trust and who was after their money at a vulnerable time of life. Now researchers warn that women are being exploited in a “menopause gold rush”.My own menopause was ghastly. If you think hot flushes are bad (they are), try 40 an hour in your 30s while having chemotherapy, then radiotherapy, then failing IVF, and all the while with none of your mates understanding what you’re going through. This was more than 20 years ago, when the menopause discussion was virtually nonexistent – and while we can all be glad things have changed in the past decade, the way menopause is now being sold should raise cause for concern for anyone approaching menopause.Because here’s the thing: menopause is a transition. Just as puberty, pregnancy, parenthood and coming to terms with infertility are transitions, so too is menopause. Yes, it takes time – even now, at 62, I still get hot flushes very occasionally, usually if I’ve eaten too much sugar or am dealing with something very emotional, but I know it will pass. I know what ishappening physiologically, and knowing what is going on internally makes all the difference. (I’m not convinced that menopause toast would, no matter how much flaxseed it contained.)Having been postmenopausal for so long, I became interested in how the focus, and the marketing, is on the transition itself. I’ve spent the past five years researching postmenopause, usually around the later 50s and 60s, when the tougher physical and emotional parts of the transition are largely over for many of us and we move into our vital third act. What emerged from my diverse group of interviewees was a growing awareness of how meno marketing preys on the ageist, misogynist andpronatalist culturein which most of us are raised.Our culture’s ageism tells us that old women are invisible, thatstaying attractive should be our priority and that we lose all value when we lose fertility. This triple whammy is especially painful – and lucrative for marketeers – because it plays to our internalised fears. After a lifetime of being trained to value the male gaze and to believe that being a “real” woman relies on our fertility – and that to maintain both of these things we must stay young and beautiful – well, of course it bites when we age. Unlike other signs of ageing, many elements of the menopause transition can’t be disguised by hair dye, makeup or a clever arrangement of clothes. A sweaty hot flush might be fine forHighland Mayan Guatemalanwomen, for whom menopause means a raise in social status and some of whom call hot flushes the rising of their animal spirit, but for many of us it can be very problematic. We hide our tampons in pretty flowery cases and wear pads to protect others from seeing leaky breast milk, but sweating in public can be both physically uncomfortable and – often more painfully given our societal preference for women to pretend we are men in the workplace – admits to the impossibility of fully controlling our bodies.This fear and concern then feeds into menopause infighting where, instead of MHT and non-MHT camps working together to support us through the transition, they’re pitted against each other as if only MHT will help, or only herbal supplements and weight lifting are the correct way to go. Which creates a real struggle for each of us to find our somewhere-in-between.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In some studies, women report fewernegative physical symptomsof menopause when they live in a society that values older women.Given the market’s passionate engagement with menopause, I’m particularly interested in what will happen when the companies trying to sell us things realise that most of us will be in postmenopause for about a third of our lives – or maybe the market will be too ageist, misogynist and pronatalist to come after our pennies then. We can but hope.And just so you know: while everyone in my research talked about physiological and emotional difficulties in the transition, once they were out the other side – even while dealing with workplace discrimination and the caring demands of their loved ones – all of them also described postmenopause as time of thriving and growing.

HardlyMon 20 Oct 2025 13.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 18.34 EDTShare“Iknow my job is to get bills down by £300,” said Ed Miliband, the energy security secretary, inhis BBC interviewat the weekend, acknowledging that the government is on the hook for its pre-election promise to reduce energy bills by 2030.The problem, though, is that the bill-cutting task also seems to be falling by default to Rachel Reeves, the chancellor. It is beginning to look as if the only sure way to make energy bills fall by £300 by 2030 is to shuffle a chunk of the expense into general taxation. Milibandhintedthe 5% VAT charge on bills could be removed in next month’s budget, which would cost the government £2.5bn.To put it mildly, Reeves is unlikely to be delighted by this prospect but she, like everyone else, will have heard the high-powered crew of retail energy bossesset out the arithmetic on bills in stark termsto a Commons select committee last week.Many of us have beenpointing out for agesthat clean energy is not a free lunch (certainly not by 2030), but the experts’ numbers were revealing in their precision. “If we continue on the path we are on, in all likelihood electricity prices are going to be 20% higher even if wholesale prices halve,” said Rachel Fletcher of Octopus Energy. “Non-commodity costs are adding about £300 [a year] of pressure,” she added, referring to everything from the costs of maintaining and upgrading the gas and electricity transmission networks to funding the rollout of renewable and nuclear generating capacity. Chris Norbury, the chief executive of E.On UK, and Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF UK’s energy business,said much the same.Far from being “speculation” – as Miliband’s department dismissed it – the bosses’ analysis flows from granular details. One can see, for example, the subsidies for wind and solar capacity under construction or likely to be commissioned; the multiyear charge for the Sizewell C nuclear power station; and the rates of return that the regulator Ofgem will allow the three big electricity transmission companies to earn as they build the £80bn new grid.Note that the criticisms are not coming from opponents of the ambition of switching to cleaner energy, or from net zero sceptics. All that is really being asked is an examination of tradeoffs, sequencing, who should pay and what options exist for doing things more cheaply. “There is no budgetary control of this,” Fletcher said. Rossi noted that electricity demand is 9% lower today than in 2019. Norbury said policymakers should look at the extent to which “incentives being offered to build infrastructure are necessary”.Miliband can argue, as he didin a speech last week, that his job is harder because of “the legacy of decades of underinvestment in energy in this country”. Absolutely true. The grid is old, as are most of the nuclear and gas-fired plants. Even if the UK were not decarbonising and electrifying, there would be a large catchup bill. New gas stations, the Tories’ preferred short-term option, aren’t free either.Equally, though, Miliband’s claim that the “sprint” to clean energy by 2030 will – of itself – cut £300 from household bills now seems fanciful. Sir Dieter Helm, a leading energy economist, put it bluntly ina recent Bloomberg podcast: “We have hit the reality wall. It isn’t going to be £300 cheaper – unless the gas price falls very sharply … The problem for the government, I think, is that half the government understands that and half the government doesn’t.”What should be done? Step one would be to recognise that the 2030 deadline for clean power, defined as 95% low-carbon generation, was always arbitrary and that trying to hit it almost certainly adds expense because speed is being prioritised over cost. Would the UK’s long-term decarbonisation and electrification strategy really be imperilled if, say, only 80% was achieved by 2032? Hardly.Once that mental hurdle is cleared, options open up. One of the energy suppliers’ complaints, in essence, is that grid capacity is being commissioned to arrive before it is needed (and customers will have to pay for it) and that smarter energy-using solutions may be more effective. They may have a point. So concentrate above all else on minimising “constraint” costs, the maddening payments to windfarms (usually in Scotland) to turn off when it’s too windy, plus incentives to other generators (usually gas-fired plants in the south of England) to fire up on the other side of a bottleneck. Such payments are still projected to hit £4bn by the end of decade, and threaten to become an electoral liability in 2029.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there is a reasonable expectation that interest rates will be lower in future (not impossible), why not wait for cheaper “strike” prices in future auction rounds? As things stand today, the government has said it will pay up to £113 a megawatt hour for offshore wind capacity in this year’s auction, AR7, far above the gas-dictated wholesale price of £83 MWh over the past 12 months.“We won’t buy at any price and if specific technologies aren’t competitive, we will look elsewhere,”Miliband also said last week about AR7. If he means it, he could show seriousness by ordering, say, only 4 gigawatts of offshore wind this year, rather than 8-plus the industry is expecting.In Reeves’s shoes, you’d be insisting on such cost-cutting thinking.

Basking in glory after his Gaza ceasefire, he was on Friday evening flying to Florida with his entourage of reporters. The drums of war were beating across Europe and Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had pleaded with him for Tomahawk missiles. What was his reply?Trump was clearly fed up. He had told Zelenskyy:go make a deal. He had said, “They should stop the war immediately. You go go by the battle line wherever it is … and both sides should go home. Go to their families, stop the killing and that should be it.” Matter closed. Tomahawks would merely mean escalation and more killing. Get a deal.Given that just last month, Trump had suggested Ukrainecould recover all its territoryoccupied by Russia, his capriciousness must be taken into account. Anything can mean nothing. But modern diplomacy is rarely about ideology or consistency. It is about egos and show. It means to seize each moment as it comes and see what happens.Trump clearly seized the right moment to get Benjamin Netanyahu to stop killing Palestinians. In doing so he opened a door to peace that was shut. Even those suffering Trump derangement syndrome had to approve. Motive is not the issue if the outcome is right.The handling ofUkraineby the west has lost its way in the dusty corridors of Nato, the EU and the UN. Their leaders have long retreated into wishing Zelenskyy well. They give him enough help to keep fighting but not winning. They feel good telling the world how awful Vladimir Putin is, and telling Zelenskyy to hang tough.The hawks will now reply that a ceasefire along the existing frontline will “solve” nothing. It will merely repeat the 2015 ceasefire and concede more territory to Russia. It would reward an outrage against international law and fail thousands of Ukrainians who havedied for their country, not to mention millions of westerners who have paid dearly in their energy bills. A shattered Ukraine is more honourable than a dishonourable peace. What was wrong anyway with a few Tomahawks raining down on Moscow?Both Gaza and Ukraine were territorial conflicts from which the west could theoretically have stayed aloof. History will judge whether the nature and the level of involvement has really served the cause of resolution or lasting peace. In the case of Ukraine, the US and Nato at least reacted with realism and caution. Joe Bidenlaid down firm limits on military assistanceto minimise the danger of escalation. Trump has wisely stuck to that line.View image in fullscreenTrump meets with Zelenskyy at the White House on 17 October 2025.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesNow he says he wants to bring the conflict to an end. We assume that in his conversation with Putin last week he agreed not to give Zelenskyy Tomahawks. We wait to see what Putin will agree in return, presumably so Trump can have another Gaza-style glory fest. If that is the price of an end to this war, it would be cheap. But Putin is not Netanyahu and Trump lacks leverage over him. He is taking a risk.The US’s record in sorting out the world’s woes has been dismal over the past three decades. Trump has long opposed overseas entanglements and protests they are not America’s job. He is reluctant to send troops into harm’s way and never claims for the US a divine mission to save the world for freedom. But if he wants another global cheer he will have to hold Putin’s feet to the fire. That this will be tough is not an argument against trying.The new realism dictates that in situations like these we do not stand on ceremony and spout abstract nouns. We deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. Trump now has to fashion a guarantee of security along Ukraine’s current frontline withRussiathat can satisfy both Putin and Zelenskyy. He has to do the same in Gaza to satisfy Israel and Palestine. Since he refuses to commit American troops to either venture, his powers of persuasion will have to be superhuman if his reputation is to be secured.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is right that allies have so far failed to deliver. He has operated through a ramshackle collection of courtiers eager to do his bidding and with nothing to lose. Their sole virtue so far has been to make progress.Trump’s clear intention is to bring two bitter wars to an end through personal charisma. He relies on his impact on other equally egotistic leaders standing in his way. Ukraine is at stalemate. Trump simply pleads for a stop to the fighting, a stop to the killing and a return of soldiers to their homes and families. We can call it vanity and egotism, but so what?

She was 38. The type of cancer, mesothelioma, is incurable; the best prognosis is a few years, though most people don’t get that long. “You always think of asbestos as a disease from decades ago – affecting men who worked in heavy industry – so to be diagnosed in my 30s is shocking,”she told the Northern Echoin 2022. “I want to see my children grow up but now I have to come to terms with the thought that this might not happen.” Sadly, Bone passed away in November last year, just three years after her diagnosis.For most people, the word “asbestos” will evoke previous eras: dusty Victorian and Edwardian factories; the shipyards of the interwar period; postwar building sites. Yet asbestos was not banned in the UK until 1999. According to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), it still kills around 5,000 people every year. Many anti-asbestos campaigners believe that this figure is a serious underestimate, and that the real total iscloser to 20,000. Mesothelioma has a long latency period: anything from 15 to 40 years. Helen Bone could have been exposed to asbestos at school, at the college where she studied to become a critical care practitioner, or at the two hospitals where she later worked.Bone is part of what’s known asthe third wave of asbestos deaths. The first wave was those who worked directly with asbestos in mines and factories. The second wave was those who worked with or near the material: shipyard and rail workers, builders and other tradespeople, engineers. The third wave comprises all those who have been exposed as asbestos-containing materials deteriorate or are disturbed, releasing millions of fibres into the air, unseen. If the first and second waves constitute a horrific occupational disaster, then the third wave is a vast environmental and infrastructural catastrophe.Around 6m tonnes of asbestos were imported into Britainbetween 1870 and 1999. It remained mostly hidden behind walls and ceilings, laid into cement roofs and pipes, and was woven through textiles. British companies used two especially harmful types: crocidolite and amosite, which were mined in South Africa. British companies,Cape plcand Turner & Newall chief among them, relied on British imperial domination and, later, apartheid, to keep mining costs low and profits high.Thanks to the efforts of anti-asbestos campaigners and trade unionists, the use of asbestos declined significantly in the 1980s and 90s, before it was finally banned in 1999. But the ban was not accompanied by a coordinated removal programme. The start of the new millennium should have been the moment for a reckoning with asbestos. Instead, the material receded from view, its prohibition giving the impression that it was a problem solved. A lot of asbestos has been removed over the past 25 years. There are several decent companies that observe the law and work safely. There are also plenty ofcowboy outfitsthat cut corners and put their workers and the public at risk.A lot of asbestos remains in place and is now far beyond its intended design life.The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012operate on the basis that risk is low if the material is undamaged and left undisturbed. This policy ofin situmanagement is bad in theory and worse in practice. A recent audit by the National Organisation of Asbestos Consultants and the Asbestos Testing and Consultancy Association found that “of 128,761 buildings … examined over a six-month period, 78% had asbestos,” and that “71% of the asbestos items recorded … were damaged”; 30% were in the highest risk category, requiring immediate removal.The regulations place much of the onus on the “duty holder” who is responsible for monitoring asbestos-containing materials and for supplying information to building users in an asbestos management plan. Yet in many cases, rather than living documents, these plans are left to gather dust in a drawer. The regulations do not differentiate by the type of building, even though studies have shown that the risk of developing mesothelioma and lung cancer increases dramatically for those who areexposed when they are young. Nor is there any differentiation by the type of asbestos, even though it is known that amosite and crocidolite are particularly dangerous.There are nations that have chosen to address this challenge. In 2016, the South Korean Ministry of Education ordered that asbestos be removed from all schools by 2027. The government has allocated 2.872 trillion won (£1.8bn) to the programme. The AustralianAsbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agencywas founded in 2013 and is coordinating a multi-phase national strategic plan to eliminate future cases of asbestos-related disease in the country.The HSE does appear to be moving in this direction, though it has yet to set out a clear timeframe. In June, the all-party parliamentary group on occupational safety and health publisheda reporton the legacy of Cape plc. As well as calling on Cape’s parent company, Altrad, to pay £10m towards research into asbestos-related cancer, the group reiterated the need for the government to commit to a national asbestos removal programme.The enduring presence of asbestos in schools, hospitals, housing and various other buildings presents not only a technical and logistical challenge, but also a challenge of political imagination. In the face of compounding social and ecological crises, the demand to remove and rebuild cannot simply be a call to replace what was there before, just without the asbestos. Rather, it implies a different kind of society with properly funded education and healthcare sectors, mass retrofitting programmes, and well-resourced local councils training and running their own asbestos removal teams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Britain’s asbestos disaster is to be addressed, then coalitions of campaigners, trade unionists and tenants’ rights groups will be vital. In the 1970s and 80s, similar coalitions took on a powerful industry and succeeded inreframing asbestos as an urgent risk to public health.

MPs must be able to question powerMon 20 Oct 2025 13.56 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 20.51 EDTShareThe tragic story of Virginia Giuffre raises the question of who governs when royal privilege and public outrage collide. As a vulnerableteenagershe was drawn into a world of sexual exploitation by the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Ms Giuffre alleged that Epstein trafficked her and that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17. He has denied all the claims. Despite previously insisting he had no memory of meeting her, the princereportedlypaid £12m to settle her civil case in 2022. The money was said to have come from his mother, the late queen – who, just six weeks later, wasphotographedwalking beside him at her husband’s memorial service.With a posthumousmemoir, Ms Giuffre has brought the issue back into the spotlight. In his calamitous 2019 Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew claimed that he cut all ties with Epstein after their December 2010 meeting in New York. But leakedemailsfrom just two months later told a different story; with Prince Andrew asking to keep in touch and writing that “we’ll play some more soon!!!!” The Metropolitan police is nowlooking into claims thatKing Charles’s brother asked his protection officers to look into Ms Giuffre. He has agreed not to use his royaltitles, notably Duke of York, but that is a voluntary renunciation, not a legal one. Across homes, pubs and radio phone-ins, people are debating whether he should be stripped of his titles. But in parliament the subject is taboo, barred by rules against “reflections” on the royals.Even if MPs could debate it, their hands seem tied. A royal dukedom is created byletters patentunder theroyalprerogativeand can only be revoked by another act of the crown or by parliament. Yet because the crown cannot act against itself, only MPs could strip a royal title – and even then, by convention, only with the “king’s consent”. That circle of deference leaves MPs powerless to curb royal privilege without royal permission. Lord Foulkes haschallengedthis democratic absurdity. Supported by the independent MPRachael Maskell, the SNP and Plaid Cymru, he has urged a review of the rule banning “royal” questions. Public roles and financing must not be beyond scrutiny.The current immunity is no ancient relic of the constitution. It is the result of deliberate political choices – the mostconsequentialof which was made in 2011 when David Cameron overhauled royal funding. In 1760, George III had surrendered the profits of the crown estate to parliament in exchange for a fixed allowance, establishing democratic control over the royals. Mr Cameron reversed that bargain. He handed back a share of those profits to the crown, free from the annual Commons vote that ensured accountability. What hecalleda “painful discussion” and “tabloid-led” debate became an automatic15% cut of crown estate profits. The result? The sovereign grant has more thantripledas scrutiny has vanished andno oneknows who pays Prince Andrew’s bills.Parliament has surrendered the oldest democratic check on royal power – control of the purse – and that must change. It should not have taken a young woman’s suffering to reveal how insulated our monarchy has become from the standards expected of the rest of society. Ms Giuffre’s story did not end with herdeath. It leaves the living with a duty: to ensure that privilege does not outweigh accountability.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No just agreement is possible on that basisMon 20 Oct 2025 13.55 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 20.51 EDTShareIt wasn’t quite the calamity of February, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy was publicly humiliated in the Oval Office by Donald Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance. But the Ukrainian president’s latestvisitto the White House on Friday was, by all accounts, a disquieting experience. Mr Trump’s publicmusingsbefore the meeting suggested that his stance had hardened towards Vladimir Putin, to the strategically significant extent of being willing to sell long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv. But by the time Mr Zelenskyy arrived in Washington, the US president had changed his mind, instead lecturing his guest on the need to make territorial concessions to Russia.So far, so familiar. Since being re-elected, Mr Trump has repeatedly resiled from following up tough talk on Russia with meaningful action. Fauxdeadlinesfor Mr Putin to make substantive steps towards peace have come and gone, treated with indifference by the Kremlin. Last week, the US secretary of war, Pete Hegseth,statedthat Washington was ready to “impose costs” if Russia continued the conflict. But a two-hour phone call at Mr Putin’s request was enough to defuse that threat, and for Mr Trump to once again position himself as a neutral arbitrator between two warring parties.The return of that insidious and amoral framing signifies a moment of diplomatic peril for Mr Zelenskyy. In language that is more suitable for describing a contested real-estate deal than an illegal invasion costing hundreds of thousands of lives, Mr TrumptoldFox News that Mr Putin was “going to take something … he’s won certain property”. Should a plannedmeetingin Budapest take place between the US and Russian presidents – to be hosted by Hungary’s Putin-friendly leader, Viktor Orbán – discussion of a potential carve-up will dominate the agenda, as it did in the failed Alaska head-to-head.That prospect should concentrate minds ahead of a EU leaders’ summit later this week in Brussels. In the wake of the signing of the Gaza peace agreement – in relation to which Mr Putin was careful to offer fulsome congratulations – Mr Trump has taken todescribinghimself as “the mediator president”. In grimly paradoxical fashion, there is every possibility that he will try to bully Mr Zelenskyy into an unacceptable deal that rewards Russia’s aggression, in order to burnish his supposed credentials as a supreme peacemaker.It is critical that Europe provides Ukraine with the resources and staying power which allow it to resist such pressure. Progress isreportedlybeing made on proposals backed by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, which would use frozen Russian assets to secure an interest-free £122bn loan to Kyiv. Such money, however it is sourced, will be fundamental to supporting Ukraine’s defence effort into next year. At a more symbolic level, there are alsosignsof a new determination to find ways to circumvent Mr Orbán’s opposition to advancing Ukraine’s bid for EU membership.As Mr Trump pursues his mercurial path, guided only by vanity, mercantilism and admiration for the exercise of brute force, EU leaders will need to be creative and determined in ensuring that Ukraine’s interests are adequately defended in the weeks and months to come. Mr Putin is playing the US president again, exploiting the absence of a moral compass in Washington. More than ever, a robust counterweight is required on the other side of the Atlantic.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In reality, it is far too little, far too late.The posthumous publication of Virginia Giuffre’s memoir, along with further revelations from the Jeffrey Epstein files, expose the full extent of Andrew’s actions. Despite his denials, he continued his relationship with Epstein after Epstein’s release from prison,writing: “It would seem we are in this together … keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”Virginia’s memoir describes in harrowing detail the trafficking and sexual abuse of vulnerable girls – children living in poverty, in care or homeless. If Andrew were a Pakistani-heritage taxi driver from Rotherham, public calls for criminal investigation and imprisonment would be overwhelming. But he is a royal, a prince.He has not been cut loose. King Charles allows his alleged-child-sexual-abuser brother to live in a 30-room mansion on the Windsor estate. The late queen reportedly helped her son pay millions to settle a claim with his victim while maintaining the fiction thathe had never met her. It is obvious the monarchy acted only to protect its reputation, power and wealth. Meanwhile, Virginia, like so many victims, took her own life.Truly cutting him loose would mean removing every financial privilege, donating millions to survivor organisations, and cooperating fully with UK and US authorities to ensure criminal investigations and accountability.Prof Harry FergusonEmeritus professor of social work, University of BirminghamThe MP Rachael Maskell asks for “a lot of clarity” over the £12m Prince Andrew paid to Virginia Giuffre. While many will doubtless be aware of Andrew’s protestations of innocence, of his inability to perspire, of his ignorance of the precise location of the bar in Tramp, and of his well-known dining arrangements at Pizza Express in Woking, I am sure just as many anticipate with interest his explanation of why he paid this vast sum to a woman he had never met for something he hadn’t done.Eddie DugganIpswich, SuffolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But much more recently than the witchcraft trials, six agricultural labourers fromTolpuddle, who came together in 1833 to form a society to fight for better wages, were prosecuted on the evidence of two informers who had witnessed the men swearing a solemn oath of mutual solidarity to the Friendly Association of Agricultural Labourers while standing blindfolded before a crude representation of a skeleton.The lurid imagery evoked by the account of the clandestine oath ceremony could hardly have failed to trigger thoughts of witchcraft and necromancy in the superstitious minds of a 19th-century Dorset jury and contribute to the guilty verdict and the men’s transportation to the penal settlements of Australia.

Together, they planned to tackle the housing crisis and the cost of living crisis, and to invest in the green economy. This merger didn’t happen because PvdA made a sudden left turn into radicalism. It didn’t happen because GroenLinks diluted its principles to improve its chances of forming a government. It happened because these two parties realised that the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis go hand in hand and cannot be left to the mercy of the centre-right VVD (Conservatives) or extreme-right PVV (Freedom party), which led the country through two years of utterchaos and infighting.If Labour wants to revive its chances of being in government after 2029, it better take notice. Rather than mimickingReform UKand the Conservatives on Brexit, on banning our rights to protest (I wonder how this Labour government would have responded to Orgreave), not to mention the quiet dissolution of green investments, Labour should retrieve its social-democrat principles.Labour has a choice. Either it reconnects with its ideology of solidarity and compassion, or it continues trying to be this bleak copy of Reform, proving Zack Polanski right when he said that Labour is on course to “hand this country on a plate” to Reform and that therefore the Greens are here to give a voice to those who believe that “politics can be honest, fair and hopeful again”. He said the Greens were not here to be disappointed with Labour, but to replace it and fill the ideological void this Labour party has created.DearKeir Starmer, your heart sits on the left.

But when he took the flag inthe US Grand Prixon Sunday it heralded the most remarkable resurgence as he waded with a gleeful swagger back into the title fight. Verstappen was down but he is far from out and could yet still pull off what would count as his greatest triumph.Going into the weekend in Austin, Verstappen was still treating the idea of him being a contender against the two lead protagonists, McLaren’s Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, with a certain indifferent levity.Red Bull fined £43,000 after team member tries to tamper with Lando Norris grid tapeRead more“It’s 50-50. You either win it, or you don’t. I don’t really think about it,” he said. He was then still 55 points behind Piastri. After his comprehensive, dominant win at the Circuit of the Americas the gap was down to 40 and Verstappen acknowledged he was definitely in the game.From 104 points down after the Dutch Grand Prix, in four meetings, three of which he has won, Verstappen has taken 64 points out of Piastri’s lead. On the evidence of those four races – Monza, Baku, Singapore and Austin – hisRed Bullcar is now the quickest in the field or at very least on a par with the previously dominant McLaren.He has won on every type of track, including crucially in Austin on a traditional circuit, indeed one with high tyre wear, of the type where McLaren has held the whip hand all season. On this showing the final five races, Mexico, Brazil, Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, will hold no fear for Verstappen.His belief is in part down to the impressive job Red Bull have done in turning round the car, which the Dutchman found all but undriveable with its lack of balance and unpredictable handling for more than half the season, into another all-round race winner. The upgraded floor and front wing they brought to these latter races, which was a gamble by Red Bull in maintaining development after McLaren had long since shifted their resources to the 2026 car, proved inspired. Verstappen is never more formidable than when he has the ride he feels beneath him and the RB21 is now far closer to being that car.Five meetings remain, including two sprint races, and on this form Verstappen knows he has what it takes to potentially win them all. Mathematically that might still not be enough. A one-two over Piastri in all the remaining races (including sprints) would still leave him three points short but it must be noted that Piastri has not finished higher than third since the Dutch Grand Prix. However there are more factors at play than mere numbers.View image in fullscreenMcLaren may need to make a choice between Oscar Piastri (left) and Lando Norris.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesMost importantly there is how McLaren deal with this looming threat. Their efforts to be fair to both drivers and let them race all season have been laudable – and understandable when they had a huge advantage. That has now gone, as has the lead it amassed. In the process Piastri and Norris have taken points off each other and McLaren have intervened on occasion to try to ensure a scrupulous equity to both drivers – a luxury they can perhaps ill-afford with Verstappen steaming up in their wake.The McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, said the team and his drivers needed to stay calm after Austin and that, by sticking to their plans and procedures, results would come. However he also acknowledged they would favour one driver when the situation demanded it.Intriguingly, then, the pressure is now all on McLaren. Verstappen, by contrast, has nothing to lose. There would be no shame in not winning after his season thus far, but he is Red Bull’s No 1 driver with all the experience of closing out at the sharp end of a tight championship fight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2007 their drivers Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso went blow for blow all season, while being stalked by Kimi Räikkönen in the Ferrari, where Stella was his performance engineer.Räikkönen went into the final race of the season in Brazil in third place on 100 points, with Hamilton on 107 and Alonso on 103. In a gripping finale Hamilton suffered with a gearbox problem, Räikkönen won, his third victory from the final four races, and with this late charge took the title by one point. It was only the second time a driver had come back from third in the championship at the season finale to take the title since Giuseppe Farina had done so in the inaugural F1 season in 1950.Next weekend the fight will resume at the Mexican Grand Prix, the scene of an equally compelling three-way title decider in 1964 when John Surtees, Graham Hill and Jim Clark all vied for the honours. Like Verstappen, Surtees had also endured a slow start to the season but made history when he emerged on top. There is every reason to believe Verstappen will be in the mix in Mexico – and for his fifth title come Abu Dhabi in December.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenRed BullMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Whenever Mourinho visits St James’ Park he takes time to stand by the statue of Sir Bobby Robson outside the Milburn Stand and spend a few minutes paying silent tribute to the memory of his mentor.In 1999 Robson wanted the Portuguese to join him at Newcastle as an assistant manager with a view to eventually taking the top job but Mourinho, who returns to north‑east England for aChampions Leagueengagement with Benfica on Tuesday night, declined.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreInstead, Robson’s former translator turned No 2 at Barcelona kicked off his own managerial adventure the following year with a brief spell atBenfica. Now, after a turbulent stint at Fenerbahce, the wheel has turned full circle and he is back in charge at the Estádio da Luz after succeeding the sacked Bruno Lage last month.The match on Tuesday night will be the 62‑year-old’s 13th competitive appearance on Tyneside as a manager but previous trips with Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham produced only three wins. How he would revel in registering a fourth victory at the expense of a club with which, thanks to Robson, Mourinho has always claimed to feel a strange affinity.“I’m a little Magpie,” he told interviewers in Portugal last month. “The club up there know how much love and respect I have for them. I learned that from Mr Robson.”View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho with Bobby Robson and Ronaldo after the 1997 European Cup Winners’ Cup final which Barcelona won 1-0 against PSG.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockNewcastle’s manager,Eddie Howe, was well aware that Mourinho, then unhappy in Istanbul, cultivated friendly relationships with the club’s Saudi Arabian ownership last season. He would take particular delight in beating Benfica.Outwardly, though, Howe had nothing but praise for the Portuguese on Monday agreeing that Mourinho was “one of the all-time managerial greats”.The Newcastle manager said: “I think you have to say that. Look, I’m not saying it just because we’re playing them tomorrow. I genuinely believe. The impact he made initially in this country at Chelsea was incredible really. He had an aura around him and his teams. Coaching wise, he had a big impact on me.”Quite apart from any personal edge, Newcastle could do with confirming the feeling that they really are much better than their Premier League position. Benfica, third in the Primeira Liga, should represent a useful litmus test, particularly as they appear to be improving under Mourinho and secured a creditable 0-0 draw at the table-topping Porto in their last league game. Now the visitors hope to secure a first Champions League point – or, ideally, points – of the campaign.Mourinho, a Champions League winner with Porto and Inter, maintains Benfica are benefiting from a new, mature version of the Special One. “People change for the better,” he said. “I’m more altruistic, less egocentric. I think less about myself and more about the good I can do for others, the happiness I can spread. I’m in a mature phase of my career.”Newcastle, meanwhile, are in a slightly transitional phase. If their new £70m Germany strikerNick Woltemade has hit the ground running, Howe’s wingers have malfunctioned at times, with Anthony Elanga a £55m summer singing from Nottingham Forest struggling to make the desired impact.“Anthony’s an outstanding player,” said Howe, who could be without Sandro Tonali in central midfield on Tuesday night after the Italy international missed Monday training with a virus. “I’ve no doubt about Anthony’s qualities long term. But he’s going through a settling in period. He’s having to make slight adjustments to his game. I think he’s got a lot more to give.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho at a Benfica training session on MondayPhotograph: Rui Minderico/EPA“But I think that, as a team, we’re close to becoming something more and getting better results. We’re frustrated but I don’t think we’re far away. We just have to stick to our beliefs. We’ve had some really strong performances; now we just need the results to prove it.

St James’ Park is a fantastic place to play football. People do not come here to watch the game, they come here to play it with them. It’s not just the stadium, it’s this club, the history, the passion and the fans.“With the economic power they have with the owners now, it’s a team that’s very close to even bigger things. It’s a very special club because of the culture in this region, it’s very different culturally to London and to Manchester. I love playing here. I said to my players: ‘It’s beautiful here and you will feel that atmosphere tomorrow evening.’”Not that he is underestimating Newcastle. “We’re coming up against a very, very strong, very physical team. Uninformed people are misled by their league position but they are a tremendous team. Newcastle are doing everything right.”So does part of the Special One hanker after managing them one day. Mourinho smiled – and demurred. “ I don’t think they need a coach now. I hope that they don’t need one in the next years, either. That would mean everything goes well for the club and for Eddie, which is what I wish.“On top of that, in this moment of my career, there wouldn’t be another club where I could be happier and more motivated than I am at Benfica. I wouldn’t change Benfica for any club.”Meanwhile Ross Wilson, Newcastle’s new sporting director, has presided over the dismissal of Becky Langley, the women’s team manager. Langley leaves with Newcastle sitting ninth in the second tier.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedJosé MourinhoEddie HoweBenficaChampions LeagueEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They could celebrate their decision not to subject themselves to an unspeakably abysmal performance from Nuno Espírito Santo’s muddled team. West Ham, who have started a league campaign with four successive defeats at home for the first time in their history, were shambolic. They created nothing, made bizarre substitutions, defended terribly and had accepted their fate long before Mathias Jensen, with Brentford’s 22nd shot of a horribly one-sided contest, made it 2-0 deep into added time.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreThe mood was one of muted resignation. Apathy has gripped West Ham. Can Nuno, who is yet to win since replacing Graham Potter last month, rouse them? The early evidence is unconvincing. This was as bad as anything under Potter. West Ham were painfully passive from start to finish, remain overly reliant on Jarrod Bowen and will undoubtedly go down unless there is a major improvement in their defending.Brentford, who are making encouraging strides under Keith Andrews, should have had a hatful. Igor Thiago opened the scoring and bullied Jean-Clair Todibo and Max Kilman during the first half. Mikkel Damsgaard, Yehor Yarmolyuk and Jordan Henderson controlled midfield. Andrews, though, thought back to his side throwing away leads at Fulham and Sunderland. “You want that second goal to make life comfortable,” he said. “We’ve been there on the road before. But I did feel pretty comfortable.”By the end West Ham were reduced to Lucas Paquetá hoofing aimless up-and-unders in the vague direction of Brentford’s area. They have wasted so much money. They finished with Callum Marshall, a raw 20-year-old who spent last season on loan at Huddersfield, filling in up front. Callum Wilson, signed on a free transfer last summer, watched from the bench for the third successive game. Nuno suggested there was no issue with the forward. He was more expansive on his worries about his side losing individual duels.“We are all concerned,” he said. “You can feel it from our fans. You can see they are concerned. Then concern becomes silence. Silence becomes anxiety. We have a problem.”View image in fullscreenIgor Thiago fires past Alphonse Areola in the West Ham goal.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesNuno, who admitted West Ham are a long way from developing an identity, considered whether the atmosphere is affecting his players. “We try to ignore it,” he said. “We try to make them comfortable, but we cannot hide ourselves. Mentally it’s one of the aspects that we have to solve.”The sight of row after row of empty seats was humiliating for West Ham’s owners. It was eerily quiet during the opening stages, although perhaps the fans were too busy trying to work out Nuno’s starting lineup to make any noise. Using Ollie Scarles and Kyle Walker-Peters as underlapping full- backs was a mistake. Paquetá as a false 9 in place of the injured Niclas Füllkrug backfired. There was also a rare start in midfield for Andy Irving, who made his home debut a mere 780 days after joining the club.“The idea was that we had to work together, be compact,” Nuno said. The reality, though, was that Brentford carved out chances at will. Every set piece caused problems. Dango Ouattara, a lively presence on the right, and Thiago were guilty of poor misses before Brentford finally went ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kilman, £40m badly spent, failed to deal with a lofted pass from Yarmolyuk. Kevin Schade nipped in and teed up Thiago, whose shot had enough power to squirm past Alphonse Areola.Brentford were denied a second just before half-time, Thiago offside when he beat Areola again. West Ham adjusted for the second half, Nuno switching to a back three, but the level remained low. Passes were overhit and the gaps at the back grew bigger. Schade headed against the bar when it seemed easier to score. Eventually two substitutes combined, Keane Lewis-Potter breaking down the right and setting up Jensen to score emphatically.View image in fullscreenMathias Jensen lashes in Brentford’s second goal at the death.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesNot once had West Ham looked likely to equalise. They finished with 10 men after Konstantinos Mavropanos, one of three defenders introduced at half-time, went down with a muscle problem. Nuno had made all his substitutions. There were boos when Guido Rodríguez, a defensive midfielder, replaced Tomas Soucek with 20 minutes left. Welcome to east London, Nuno.

Especially facing Manchester United, against whom he has scored a record 16 goals.Not on Sunday. Salah’s 85th-minute substitution for Jeremie Frimpong was accepted as a necessary last throw of the dice following another poor display from the Egypt international. The reaction to the switch was telling. Salah’s guaranteed place in Liverpool’s starting lineup is under threat for the first time since he joined more than eight years ago. The threat would be greater if Federico Chiesa or Frimpong, the only real alternatives on the right, made as much of an impact when starting as they do off the bench. There are no replacements of Salah’s level in the squad for the system that Slot operates. Any dip in form by the 33-year-old is therefore felt acutely. Whether it is helping Salah by selecting a more settled side around him, or rewarding Chiesa’s lively cameos with a starting role, Slot has a pressing issue to address on the usually phenomenal side of Liverpool’s forward line.‘It’s possible’: Jürgen Klopp says return to manage Liverpool could yet happenRead moreRealise risk can bring reward but also chaosSlot has an enviable array of attacking talent and is never afraid to deploy it. The approach is laudable, part of the attraction of watching his Liverpool team, and brooked no arguments when it resulted in late wins over Bournemouth, Newcastle, Burnley and Southampton this season. But, as the head coach conceded on Sunday, it can also create an imbalance and leavea struggling defencefurther exposed. Slot insisted the introductions of Hugo Ekitiké, Florian Wirtz and Curtis Jones in the 62nd minute and Chiesa’s in the 72nd were necessary with Liverpool looking to overturn a 1-0 deficit for the fourth game in succession. The champions’ brightest period followed. However, Slot also blamed Harry Maguire’s winner from Liverpool’s latest set-piece failing on having “seven or eight offensive-minded players” on the pitch. “It’s not an excuse but maybe the reason why the structure in defending set pieces against Palace and now is not as perfect as we usually are,” he said. Slot’s substitutions contributed to Liverpool’s title triumph last season but at a time when his team are adjusting to so many signings it may help to limit disruption from the bench. Liverpool’s positive approach will not and should not change but the calm control of last season has given way to some chaotic performances. “We are a team who do not try to keep the draw, especially at home,” said Virgil van Dijk after the United defeat.View image in fullscreenArne Slot blamed Harry Maguire’s winner from Liverpool’s latest set-piece failing on having ‘seven or eight offensive-minded players’ on the pitch.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesRecall RobertsonThere is no disguising the difficult start Milos Kerkez has made atLiverpool, however much Slot has tried to defend the Hungary international and his fellow new full-back Frimpong. The era of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson competing for a record number of Premier League assists and unlocking low blocks – it is not a new conundrum that Liverpool are facing – is over. Their replacements, though Conor Bradley is vying for that mantle with Frimpong at right-back, are not at the same level. Not yet, at least, with both taking time to settle. Ruben Amorim targeted Kerkez’s left flank at Anfield and was rewarded with Bryan Mbeumo’s goal after 62 seconds. More could have followed from that area in the first half. The clear disconnect between the £40m signing from Bournemouth and Van Dijk was encapsulated when both went for the same cross in the second half and Kerkez almost face-planted the ball into his own net. Playing Kerkez may well be the only way to build a rapport but it feels Robertson, yet to start a Premier League game this season, has been jettisoned prematurely. Last season was his first indifferent campaign in a Liverpool shirt and came after he had rushed back from a serious ankle injury. With defensive improvement essential to halting a damaging run of losses, the Scotland captain should be recalled.Devise a clear planSlot appears like the spoilt kid at Christmas in having more expensive new toys than he knows what do with. The reality of turning a summer transfer strategy that could cost up to £450m into a cohesive unit, and maximising the individual talent, is proving much more difficult than many anticipated. Slot’s triumphant debut season centred on building on and tweaking the foundations put in place by Jürgen Klopp. Chiesa was the only addition to the senior squad last summer and barely featured as Liverpool comfortably won the title with a consistency of style and team selection. Now, after a summer of upheaval, Slot is trying to accommodate Wirtz, bring Alexander Isak up to speed after a pre-season in effect spent on strike at Newcastle and introduce Ekitiké. The potential £79m signing from Eintracht Frankfurt can count himself unfortunate to have been on the bench on Sunday behind the £125m record recruit. Ekitiké made more of an impact than Isak when introduced although, as Slot pointed out on Friday, Liverpool made a serious investment in the Swede for what he will bring over the next six years, not over the first few weeks. Wirtz is the bigger issue among Liverpool’s expensive new arrivals. Whether it is his position in the side, and the knock-on effect for the midfield behind him, or the intensity of the Premier League, the Germany international is clearly yet to convince Slot. In three of Liverpool’s past four league games, every one an occasion against Everton, Chelsea and United, the potential £116m signing has started on the bench.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A fifth consecutive loss on Wednesday at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League would be almost unheard of. The last time that happened was in 1953. Slot claimed the amount of chances Liverpool created against United was a sign that confidence remained unaffected and as good an indicator as any that results will soon turn. But anxiety was unmistakable at Anfield on Sunday, in the performance of the players and the frustration of the crowd. It did not go unnoticed by Van Dijk. The Liverpool captain said: “The first half we didn’t do the right thing, we were too rushed. The feeling at Anfield was a bit like that, especially the first half. Second half we kept fighting and found an equaliser but in the end we had nothing. I think everyone maybe felt a bit like that [anxious]. You can understand it. Coming back after the international break after three losses on the bounce everyone wants to see a good performance, including ourselves.” There was little reassurance to be found in defeat by United. Slot cannot afford for anxiety to deepen in Germany.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotMohamed SalahanalysisShareReuse this content"

Athapaththu, calm amid the storm, finished with career-best figures of four for 42.The drama began with Rabeya Khan trapped leg-before off the first ball, followed by a run out next delivery. Then, Bangladesh’s hopes sank when their captain, Nigar Sultana, danced down the track only to find long-off lurking. When Marufa Akter was adjudged lbw next ball, Athapaththu had conjured the unthinkable, defending nine with a single run conceded in the over.“We handled the pressure well. We knew that if we took the game deep, teams could crumble,” Athapaththu said. “It wasn’t perfect, batting collapses and dropped catches hurt us, but luck smiled at us today.”For once, fortune favoured Sri Lanka, whose campaign had been marred by rain, missed chances and misfiring batters. Hasini Perera, who struck her maiden one-day international half-century, made 85 off 99 balls, peppered with 13 fours and a six. She was the backbone of Sri Lanka’s 202 all out as she reached the milestone of 1,000 runs in ODIs. A 74-run partnership with Nilakshika de Silva gave Sri Lanka a solid launch pad, before another collapse saw six wickets fall for 28 runs.Even so, the Sri Lankans held their nerve in the death overs to seal the win and climb to sixth in the standings. With four points, they are level with New Zealand and India, although will need results to go in their favour to grab the last semi-final spot. Australia, South Africa and England have already booked their places in the last four.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the same way that, even now, Leicester’s Premier League title success in 2015-16 is rarely mentioned without reference to the 5,000-1 on offer at the start of the season, it was a case of a starting price being worth a thousand words.Powerful Glory at 200-1 leads shocks to electrify Ascot on Champions DayRead moreThe 100-1 success of Cicero’s Gift in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes an hour later only added to the sense that we must all have been looking at the form book upside down. Two winners at a three-figure starting price on the same card? Preposterous. Unthinkable. And … perhaps even unprecedented?As it turns out, however – and if you also leave aside the fact that both races were Group Ones – you need only go back as far as Lingfield’s meeting on 19 November 2024 to turn up something similar. On an otherwise entirely forgettable all-weather card, Epsom Faithfull (100-1) and Ashford Hill (125-1) both came home in front. At a jumps meeting at the same track in November 2023, meanwhile, Theyseekhimthere (125-1) and Ask Her Out (150-1) were among the winners.In fact, the Champions Day card on Saturday was the fourth occasion since 4 January 2023 – when there were 125-1 and 100-1 winners at Newcastle – that there had been two winners at 100-1 or bigger on the same card in Britain. In the 15 years prior to that Newcastle meeting, however – a total of around 22,000 fixtures – it did not happen once.When dealing with extremely unusual events, it is essential to bear in mind Nassim Taleb’s warnings about how easy it is to be fooled by randomness, and the fact that even exceptionally unlikely and unrelated outcomes can still occur in clusters. Over a 20-year period when the British fixture list has been relatively stable at between 1,300 and 1,500 meetings per year, however, it is still hard to escape from the conclusion that winners at 100-1 or bigger are, albeit slightly, a more common occurrence now than was the case a decade ago.View image in fullscreenCicero’s Gift, ridden by Jason Watson, wins the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at 100-1.Photograph: Ian Headington/racingfotos.com/ShutterstockIn the five years between 2015 and 2019, for instance – that is, the five years before the Covid pandemic – runners with a starting price of 100-1 or bigger won an average of 5.5 races per year, with a mean strike rate of 0.164%. From 2020 to 2024, it was 20 races per year, and a strike rate of 0.242%. Everyone noticed the shock winner at Ascot on Saturday, but a jump in the number of 100-1+ upsets that actually dates back to 2020 has largely passed people by.These are still, of course, tiny numbers in the context of a racing schedule with around 10,000 races annually. The average punter, after all, operates at the other end of the market, and will be sufficiently bruised by unexpected results from one week to the next to take an extra eight or 10 complete “skinners” for the bookies on the chin.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday racing tipsShowPerth1.15 Centurion’s Sister 1.50 Keep Tabs On You 2.25 Nathan Wells 3.00 Tripoli Flyer 3.35 Heaven Smart 4.10 Kap Boy 4.40 Mountain Molly 5.15 Artic MannExeter1.40 Oakley 2.15 Guillaume 2.50 Ballintubber Boy 3.25 Voodoo Angel 4.00 Cinnodin 4.30 Hillsin 5.05 Maxios AureliusYarmouth2.00 Overbudget 2.35 Fractional 3.10 Pietro 3.45 Fletcher’s Flight (nb) 4.20 Likealot 4.55 Hinchinbrooke 5.30 State Of MadnessNewcastle4.50 Maxi King 5.25 Moonlight Warrior 6.00 Light The Night Up 6.30 Masterclass 7.00 Terrapin (nap) 7.30 Rambuso Creek 8.00 Bellagio Man 8.30 Carolus MagnusWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That does not mean that a slight uptick in shock results is not without some relevance, particularly in the retail (high-street betting shop) market where a surprising number of bets are still settled at starting price. What happened in 2020? Covid happened, of course, and that led to an important change to the system for compiling starting prices.Until the pandemic forced racing behind closed doors, the starting prices had always been compiled using a survey of the price about each runner on the on-course bookies’ boards shortly before the off. With no racegoers and no on-course bookies, the system switched to a survey of off-course prices instead.There were on-track bookies who warned at the time that this switch could lead to the starting prices of fancied runners – the ones that punters are backing – being “shaved”, with any increase in the overall profit margin in the book being obscured by bigger prices about outsiders. Horses that might have been 50-1 in 2019, in other words, are now going off at 100-1 or 150-1, while 6-5 favourites are returned at 11-10.Their prediction, it seems, has come to pass. Five years on from the switch to “industry” starting prices, the rolling five-year average return from backing favourites has jumped from -6.6% in 2019 to -8.8% in 2025. Being beaten by a 100-1 shot is one thing, but starting price punters are also paying a price on the day-to-day favourites.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 19-year-old celebrated his first Prem start withfive tries against Sale Sharkson Satur­day and the national head coach, Steve Borthwick, says he is already in contention for a senior England debut.It was impossible to miss Caluori’s aerial ability and eye for the try line at the weekend with the former Lions captain Sam Warburton ­describing the 6ft 5in player as “almost undefendable” and “an absolute diamond”. England have been aware of his potential for a while and it seems that some game time against Fiji a fortnight on Saturday is not impossible.England invite Noah Caluori to training after sparkling five-try Prem debutRead moreBorthwick certainly did not pour cold water on the idea aftercalling up Caluorito a three-day training camp in Bagshot. “I think he could certainly feature this autumn,” the England head coach said. “He has been on the radar for a considerable period of time. It was over a year ago that I started getting sent footage from [the RFU’s] Conor O’Shea, Mark Mapletoft and Jonathan Pendlebury. They were talking about him among a group of other players on the pathway.”It says everything about Caluori’s ability to soar above the herd that comparisons are being made with Israel Folau and Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, both remarkable athletes who gave Australia another aerial dimension. Borthwick has also been ­encouraged by the newcomer’s ­modest response to his sudden rugby fame. “A number of people have mentioned to me the interview he did after the game and how his humility and desire to learn came across,” Borthwick said. “You don’t hear that from too many 19‑year‑olds.”Among other things it might also be a sign that England are more open to embracing X-factor players rather than taking a more ­conservative approach to blooding talented­newcomers. “How brilliant is it that we’ve got exciting players like that around,” Borthwick said.“You’ve got young kids ­talking about them and wanting to be them. I think that’s absolutely wonder­ful. Henry ­Pollock is another ­example. There’s ­incredible talent in the team. Noah’s been showing that ­ability ­throughout his pathway experience. Like every player there are always bits to improve which I think is the really exciting part.”Conspicuous by his absence at Pennyhill Park, however, is Caluori’s clubmate Tom Willis who hasopted to turn his back on representing ­Englandat the 2027 Rugby World Cup in favour of rejoining Bordeaux in the French Top 14. In theory he remains available to England for the rest of this season but Borthwick has made clear he will now look elsewhere.“Tom told me his decision late last week,” Borthwick said. “My job is to then focus on who is going to be ­playing for England to win the World Cup in two years’ time. I think the situation is really clear and I’d be surprised if anyone thinks too differently to the way I am thinking. The time we have together is crucial.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means the RFU must continue shelling out a six‑figure sum for a player who will no longer be involved. Borthwick, ­however, has left the door ajar for Owen Farrell, who is not in England’s squad despite touring with the British & Irish Lions in the summer.“Owen and I have spoken regularly throughout his time back in England and when he was in France,” ­Borthwick said. “I enjoy chatting to him and he’s got a great rugby brain. I think he’s been very clear that he wants to get back into the rhythm of playing for his club and enjoy his rugby again after an injury‑disrupted year. We’re only a handful of games in to this season so I don’t think it’s a conversation for right now.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionSaracensnewsShareReuse this content"

So why did it happen?The former Tottenham manager made a rash Premier League return, and it will probably be his lastSign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereJonathan WilsonMon 20 Oct 2025 10.40 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 13.34 EDTShareThe weirdest aspect of Ange Postecoglou’s 40-day reign at Nottingham Forest was how inevitable it all felt. The only shock was that he was sacked on Saturday, within minutes of a3-0 home defeat to Chelsea, rather than a day or two later. But by then, it was obvious this ill-starred adventure had run its course; perhaps it was kinder to everybody to bring it to an end. Forest, certainly, had to act quickly if they are to make the most of their first European campaign in three decades.But why was such an obviously terrible appointment made in the first place? What was it that made theNottingham Forestowner, Evangelos Marinakis, ever think that Postecoglou was the right man to succeed Nuno Espírito Santo? They met in July at an event staged by the Greek league to celebrate Postecoglou winning the Europa League with Tottenham, but was it really just that? That they got on well over a glass of wine?Nottingham Forest close to appointing Sean Dyche as head coachRead moreForest exceeded all expectations last season by finishing seventh, but they did so by sitting deep and playing on the counter. It was simple and effective. It got the best out of the two central defenders, Murillo and Nikola Milenković; Morgan Gibbs-White reveled in the freedom given him by a deep-lying midfield platform; Chris Wood had the season of his life, benefiting from the service provided by the rapid wide forwards, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga.That is not Postecoglou football, though, which raises two obvious questions. Did Marinakis really not understand that? And did Postecoglou not understand that? Could an owner, even one as volatile as Marinakis, really have so little understanding of football that he didn’t realise how profoundly unsuited Postecoglou was? Perhaps the idea was that Postecoglou would oversee Forest’s transition to become a more overtly attacking side and Marinakis simply underestimated the gulf in philosophy between Postecoglou and his squad.The issue of why Postecoglou took the job is more baffling. He’s been a successful coach. He clearly understands the issues. At Tottenham, for all his bluster, he amended his style significantly in his final months, grinding out results in the Europa League. But still, being willing to compromise in extremis – and Spurs, as Postecoglou repeatedly pointed out, had an injury crisis – is not the same as undergoing some radical late-career conversion.Postecoglou’s style is about pressing; this is not a Forest squad that can press. His first game in charge was against Arsenal. Four days before that, any thought that Milenković could push out was removed as he was sent off playing for Serbia against England, clumsily tripping Harry Kane as the forward got away from him. In hindsight it appeared almost a cry for help. Postecoglou was typically bullish after starting with a 3-0 defeat. We’d see a team playing the way he wanted them to the following Wednesday, against Swansea in the League Cup. Fortune rarely rejects such hostages: Forest went 2-0 up and lost 3-2, Angeballin excelsis. After which the decline followed its predictable path.Postecoglou gets his payoff. And perhaps that will seem worth it for 40 days of work, such a brief stint that there was hardly time for pressure to build. But that probably ends his hopes of working in thePremier Leagueagain. His last 18 league games yielded just six points. Who would take a chance on somebody with that record?Although his Tottenham finished fourth-bottom of the league, that at least was offset by victory in the Europa League. Memories of his eight wins in his first 10 games plus that success made his record defensible. But his 40 days at Forest have tipped the balance. Postecoglou now exists essentially as a meme, a Baghdad Bob of the dugout, making absurd claims even as the situation deteriorated around him while passive-aggressively calling people “Mate”. Taking the Forest job has torched what remained of his reputation.So whydidhe take it? Was it ego? Did he think he could get this bunch of unsuitable players to play his way? Was it desperation? Did he, aged 60, think – surely wrongly – that this might be his last chance of landing a Premier League job? Or did he feel time drawing in, and think it was now or never? He spoke of how a relaxed and tanned manager was merely one who was out of work; perhaps he just missed the adrenaline. But given how obvious the mismatch was to everybody else, surely Postecoglou must have known what he was up against?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This has since fallen to just one-in-five. As a result, it said unemployment was now the single biggest reason for being Neet among men and women.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have also asked the private sector and high-net worth individuals to step in, saying better control of the disease would fuel economic growth and trade.View image in fullscreenJoy Phumaphi, of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, said: ‘All of us need to be part of the end story of malaria.’Photograph: Steffen Kugler/Target MalariaJoy Phumaphi, of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (Alma), which co-commissioned the research with Malaria No More UK, said: “African countries are stepping up to the plate, and we are appealing to the rest of the world to accompany us on this journey, because all of us need to be part of the end story of malaria.”The report estimated the impact of funding cuts to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria – which is seeking donations to cover costs from 2027 to 2029. The fund providesnearly 60% of all international financing for malariacontrols, such as mosquito nets and preventive drugs.If funding was 20% lower than in the last round, researchers said there would be an additional 33 million cases and 82,000 deaths, and $5.14bn (£3.83bn) in lost GDP by 2030, according to the report.However, funding cuts look likely. Germanypledged $1bnto the fund last week, a figure23% lowerthan its last promise. The UK government isreportedly looking at a figure 20% downon its previous commitment, although it says no final decision has been made.If a funding vacuum led to preventive malaria control collapsing entirely, the report estimates there would be 525 million more cases, 990,000 more deaths and $83bn in lost GDP. About 750,000 of those deaths would be of children under five, representing “the loss of a generation to malaria”, the report’s authors warned.Proposed UK cuts to global aid fund could lead to 300,000 preventable deaths, say charitiesRead moreConversely, they said that if the Global Fund received thefull $18bnit was asking for, there would be a $230bn boost to GDP, 865 million fewer cases and 1.86 million fewer deaths.Phumaphi said there had been “marked increases in [domestic] budget allocation not just to health, but specifically to malaria, particularly since the beginning of this year.But she added: “I think we need to appreciate the enormity of the challenge and exactly how much is required in funding in order for countries to be able to catch up.”African countries heavily burdened by servicing debt and the economic aftershocks of Covid-19 were facing not only infectious diseases but also a growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer, she said.It was worrying, Phumaphi said, that donor countries were considering pledging less than in the last round, “but we are grateful that countries like Germany have pledged substantial amounts – a billion is quite a substantial amount.”View image in fullscreenRising biological resistance to insecticides and anti-malarial drugs is one of the challenges faced by the fight to eradicate the disease.Photograph: Desire Danga Essigue/ReutersThe former Botswana health minister said she was hopeful that wealthy individuals, the private sector and foundations would step up “because when we talk about productivity, jobs [and the] economic potential that Africa tends to lose, we are talking about potential investments and markets for the private sector”.One of those individuals, the Nigerian businessman Aliko Dangote, encouraged others to join him in filling the funding gap: “Malaria is not just a health crisis; it is an $83bn brake on Africa’s growth and enterprise. Business cannot thrive in sick communities.”Malaria’s impact on GDP was measured using factors including disrupted schooling, employee absences, and the impact on tourism and agriculture.The Gates Foundation, which supports the Global Fund, is a philanthropic organisation that also contributes funding to support the editorially independent global development section of the GuardianExplore more on these topicsGlobal healthMalariaInfectious diseasesAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A third person, Luke Watson, 36, allegedly drove the two to the monument.The three defendants each deny charges of damaging an ancient protected monument and causing a public nuisance.Simon Jones, prosecuting, said: “Stonehenge is arguably the best recognised and architecturally sophisticated prehistoric stone circle in the world, built around 5,000 years ago.“The site is visited by members of the public from all over the world, providing both an educational and spiritual experience.”He said jurors would hear that people were left shocked, upset and angry at what happened. “It was targeted to provide maximum impact,” he said.Jones told the jury that Naidu and Lynch crossed the boundary ropes and trespassed into the area around the monument before launching the attack.“They were armed with fire extinguishers containing an orange powder consisting of cornflour and talc stained with a highly fluorescent synthetic orange dye,” he said. “That substance was sprayed over stones by both those defendants.”Jones claimed Watson had driven his co-accused to Stonehenge that morning and had also “encouraged them in these acts”.The prosecutor said the custodians of the circle had been concerned that if the stones had become wet after the substance was sprayed on them, it could have become caked on the monument. It cost £620 to clean the stones.A member of the public who witnessed the incident, Savinder Chanhan, said in a statement read to the court: “I was shocked by the actions of these people and what they did.”A visitor assistant at the historic site, Bethany Hocking, told the court Stonehenge was a “spiritual place” for her.The body-worn footage of a police officer at the scene showed Naidu and Lynch sitting in front of the stones after allegedly carrying out the attack. They did not speak but Naidu handed the officer a piece of paper reading: “Fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty now!”Naidu, of Birmingham, told police the powder would have “blown away in the wind” and was “totally safe and utterly harmless”, the court heard.Lynch, of Turvey, Bedfordshire, informed officers she was protesting about the burning of fossil fuels. Watson, of Manuden, Essex, made no comment.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

And you can expect to see the PM driving forward that agenda at the summit next month. The UK is a global leader on climate action and tackling climate change will remain an urgent UK and global priority.”The government has been divided over how loudly to champion its green agenda given concerns about rising energy bills and increasingly unified opposition from the Conservatives and Reform UK to net zero targets.Starmer attended last year’s Cop in Azerbaijan, and in 2023 hecriticised Rishi Sunakfrom opposition when the then prime minister initially said he would not travel to Dubai.Since Labour came to power it has taken a number of green decisions, including reversing a de facto ban on onshore wind and setting up a new investment organisation to put money into clean energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Polanski warned that it would be a “huge abdication of responsibility” if the prime minister did not travel to Brazil.Starmer’s parliamentary colleagues were also urging him to attend the summit. Polly Billington, the MP for East Thanet, told the Guardian last month: “I know the difference that leaders make when they attend. It focuses the minds of the negotiators on getting the best possible deal – and that is required, when we see the fragility of the consensus on acting on climate change.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerGreen politicsCop30Global climate talksClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The joint Dutch-German venture, which received the green light from regional authorities last month, seeks to extract 13bn cubic metres of gas from just outside a protected area at the marine border between the two countries.Campaigners have criticised the project because it will mean drill for gas more than four years after the InternationalEnergyAgency warned that new oil and gas development was incompatible with its roadmap to stop the planet heating by 1.5C (2.7F). It has also frustrated residents of Borkum, the island closest to the platform, which is striving to end its own reliance on the fuel for heating by 2030.“It’s been seen as a punch in the face,” said Jürgen Akkermann, the island’s independent mayor, who is working on the geothermal energy plans. “You’re taking care of it, you’re engaged – and then you get a gas platform shoved in front of your nose.”Europe’s largest economy raced to find new gas providers after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ramping up piped supplies from Norway and building liquefied natural gas terminals at speed to import LNG from the US and elsewhere.More quietly, it has also sought to drill for more at home. This summer, a court cleared the way for an important but contested cable for the project in Borkum, Lower Saxony, while drilling began at a separate test site in Bavaria. A third gas extraction project in Brandenburg has been delayed after state officials viewed the plans as being too vague to approve.Activists say the dash for gas has sped up since a coalition of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union and centre-left Social Democratic party took office in April. The new economy minister, Katherina Reiche – a former lobbyist for utility companies who until May was the CEO of Westenergie, a subsidiary of E.ON – is pushing to build 20 gigawatts of gas-fired power plants by 2030, while calling for a “reality check” on Germany’s renewable energy plans.View image in fullscreenThe economy minister, Katherina Reiche, stands by Germany’s commitment to climate neutrality by 2045, her ministry said.Photograph: dts News Agency Germany/ShutterstockCarla Reemtsma, a climate activist with Fridays for Future, said there had been “some wriggle room” under the last government’s Green party-led economy ministry but that the new coalition was “pushing for gas everywhere”. The field near Borkum was relatively small, she added, but would pave the way for more projects with a “catastrophic” impact on the planet.“We’re just normalising the destruction of the climate,” she said.Germany’s political enthusiasm to ditch fossil fuels has slumped as high energy prices have helped drive a surge in support for the far right, which has aggressivelyattacked green policyand sold the rollback of climate rules as a solution to the country’s economic strife.By Borkum’s beach huts, where Reemtsma and other activists spelled out the words “STOP GAS” with big red letters in the sand this summer, residents say they are more worried by the threat that industrialisation poses. The quiet island – which attracted nationwide outrage last year for a festival tradition that involved costumed men beating women with cow horns – is economically reliant on its nature’s appeal to tourists.The Wadden Sea isthe largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flatsin the world, and Unesco has recognised it for wildlife-rich transition zones that include tidal channels, sandy shoals, seagrass meadows and mussel beds.“We’ve been confronted with the ‘not in my back yard’ argument – that everyone wants gas but nobody wants to be affected by it,” said Akkermann. “But I always say: this isn’t just any back yard.”Gas extraction is set to take place outside the protected marine area but the proposals require laying a cable through a rocky reef to connect the platform with an offshore windfarm, which has prompted legal challenges from green groups. In August, the Lüneburg upper administrative court overturned a ruling by a lower court that had paused part of the approval, clearing the way to lay the cable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The German energy ministry, however, has suggested scaling back the expansion of renewables.Photograph: Daniel Reinhardt/EPAOne-Dyas, the company behind the project, said it had taken steps to address local concerns by electrifying the platform and making it low and compact, so that it would be as visible from shore as container ships passing on the horizon. It added that its gas would be cleaner than LNG imports and said that stopping local production should be the last step on the path to carbon neutrality after phasing out coal and imported gas.“The existing infrastructure in the North Sea also makes it a logical place to continue investing in new developments, as long as there is demand for natural gas,” a spokesperson said. “The inconvenient truth is that there are not yet enough renewable energy sources to meet the growing demand for energy.”The German energy ministry, however, has suggested scaling back the expansion of renewables after presenting a controversial report into its energy policy that assumes electricity demand will grow slower than previously thought. The proposals, which green groups argue jeopardise climate targets, include cutting subsidies and building “only as much as we actually need and is economically efficient”.The ministry said the security of supply and affordability were just as important as climate protection, but that Reiche stands by the coalition agreement, which commits Germany to climate neutrality by 2045.“At the same time, achieving the climate targets is an ambitious and daunting task that must be tackled,” a ministry spokesperson said. “The federal government is committed to achieving these targets with the political measures at its disposal, while preserving Germany as an industrial location.”Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsGermanyGasEnergyClimate crisisGreen politicsEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They found that gardens contained an area three times bigger than all of the UK’s national nature reserves combined.The report found 42% of domestic garden space is paved over (55% of front garden space and 36% of back garden space). Paving over large sections of garden reduces space for nature as well asexacerbating flooding as water has nowhere to go.It also found there were 18m square metres of artificial grass across all cultivated green space. Seven and a half million square metres of this is in domestic gardens.Gardens support more than 50m trees and thousands of species, the RHS said. They host approximately half of the UK’s butterfly, amphibian and reptile species, and more than 40% of bird and mammal species. They also store an estimated 158m tonnes of carbon.There is an inequality in the amount of garden space available to people in regions across the UK, the report found. For example, 41% of London was categorised as garden compared with just 19% in Leeds, 25% in Edinburgh and 27% in Cardiff. It found that more than a quarter of community gardens, which provide green space for people who do not have private gardens of their own, are surviving on budgets of less than £500 a year, and less than 3% of community garden groups own their own land.Don’t even think about decking! How to create a nature-friendly low-maintenance gardenRead moreThe RHS is asking homeowners to stop paving over their gardens and instead use robust planting and permeable paving to help mitigate flood risk and promote the cooling potential of gardens as well as support biodiversity. The charity is also calling on the government to guarantee “space to grow” in all housing and urban planning, so every household has access to a garden.Clare Matterson, the director general of the RHS, said: “That there isn’t equality in access to growing space in the UK reinforces the need to shore up garden provision in the 1.5m new homes promised by government this parliament. It also demonstrates the need to ringfence space and increase support and funding for the community growing spaces that should be considered an infrastructural basic.”Prof Alistair Griffiths, the director of science and collections at the RHS, said: “When people talk about the biodiversity crisis or nature loss they [generally] think about loss of wild plants or wildlife, they rarely think how cultivated plants and trees are also at risk and make a significant positive impact to our lives and our damaged planet. There are over 50m trees growing in UK gardens forming a vital infrastructure that cools cities, stores carbon and supports wildlife.“We urgently need people of all ages to appreciate the UK’s gardens and garden plants not only for their beauty, but also how we can use them to help mend our fragile planet for future generations.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentFloodingGardensWildlifePlantsTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

There were 4,315 suicides across the whole period.A total of 440 young people killed themselves in 2021-22, up 47% from the 300 such deaths in 2011-22. The number of suicides per 100,000 children and young people was up 54% over the same period.Suicide rates were higher around the summer exam period and slightly lower at the start of the academic year, the ONS found.Gemma Byrne, the policy and influencing manager at the charity Mind, said the figures were devastating and showed that the country was “sliding backwards, not moving forwards, on young people’s mental health”.She said: “The causes of suicide are complex and differ from person to person, but we know that over half a million people under 18 are on mental health waiting lists, with one in four of them waiting for more than two years for meaningful care. Too many young people can’t get help in the community when they need it.“Until the government grasps the scale of the nation’s mental health crisis, more children and young people will be let down by the systems supposed to care for them. We must see investment in timely support for young people, through a national network of early support hubs and a commitment to tackling mental health waiting lists, so they can get help before it’s too late.”Bereaved families call for inquiry into UK failure to act on pro-suicide forumRead moreThe ONS found “small significant differences” between the suicide rates for males and females across the school year.Suicide rates among females were highest in early May, at 0.53 for every 100,000 people, compared with 0.29 per 100,000 in early July.The figures for males ranged from a peak of 1.26 in early July to a low of 0.85 in late November.Last year suicide rates across all ages in England and Wales reached thehighest level since 1999and charities called on the government to invest in suicide prevention measures.The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

If they are going to charge the maximum, it is right that they deliver the world-class education students expect.“These reforms will ensure value for money, higher standards across our universities and colleges and a renewed focus on the skills our economy needs.”Tuition fees in England went up for the first time in eight years in September, taking annual payments for each student up to a record £9,535.However, the independent regulator for higher education in England, the Office forStudents(OfS), forecast that 43% of institutions would be in deficit without further intervention to shore up their finances.Maintenance loans will also automatically increase each year to help students struggling with the cost of living, with the biggest cash increases going to those from the lowest income households.In a warning to vice-chancellors, Phillipson said: “We will not allow institutions who don’t take quality seriously to make their students pay more.” Universities that underperform could face financial and regulatory consequences.The government also announced plans to tighten controls on franchising arrangements – in which a university contracts another organisation to teach all or part of a course on its behalf – to protect public money and clamp down on abuse of the system by recruitment agents.The chief executive of Universities UK, Vivienne Stern, welcomed the fee increases. “Today’s white paper offers a much-needed reset for our university system. It makes clear that universities are a huge national asset, rightly admired around the world. We need them to be in great shape if we want national renewal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the proposals, V-levels would replace the 900 current vocational and technical qualifications, including BTecs.The aim is to simplify the post-16 qualifications landscape, but there were concerns about the loss of BTecs, which many students and colleges value.Peter Urwin, the director of the centre for employment research and a professor of applied economics at the University of Westminster, said: “The government rightly suggests that the further education sector is central to social mobility. However, further disruption is the last thing that is needed, and this initiative will do nothing to tackle the high number of young people not in education, employment or training (Neet).”The white paper also outlines planned changes to the GCSE maths and English resit policy, which requires students who do not achieve a grade 4 pass in both to keep retaking them while in post-16 schooling.Most continue to fall short of the required grade, so the government is planning to introduce a new “stepping stone” qualification targeted at students with lower attainment to better prepare them to resit these GCSEs.Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesTuition feesHigher educationFurther educationEnglandStudentsA-levelsShareReuse this content"

Two other councillors had been suspended while a third joined Ukip.The “chaos” on the Reform group was now having a direct impact on Kent constituents in need, warned Antony Hook, the leader of the Liberal Democrat group on the council.He said a council committee that would have been involved in school transport issues and which was due to take place on Wednesday has been cancelled as a result of the suspensions.“This potentially means a child or children delayed in getting school transport granted,” he said.“We learned in the leaked video that they have no respect for each other, let alone respect for the public. Now they are turning on each other.”Labour and Tory MPs also seized on the affair to heap criticism on Reform and warn that it was an insight into what Farage’s party would look like in power.Sojan Joseph, the Labour MP for the Kent constituency of Ashford, described the affair as an “absolute shambles”, criticising other recent Reform initiatives in the county, including its attempt to roll out a local version of the cost-cutting “department of government efficiency” (Doge) launched by Elon Musk in the US, and concerns the party will have to raise council tax to balance its budget.“They’ve not even made it until Christmas – Doge didn’t work. Council tax is rising, and now they’re having to suspend multiple councillors,” he said.Louie French, the Tory MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, said on X: “Reform promised Kent residents the world in May. Six months later they are in complete chaos, with residents facing the prospect of even higher bills. A serious warning to the rest of the UK of what Reform in power looks like.”The footage of the meeting, which took place in late August, showed Reform councillors complaining about “backbiting” and being ignored by Kemkaran, who told them they would be “screwed” and that Reform could forget about winning the general election if they did not balance Kent’s budget.A source said on Monday morning that the councillors had been removed “with no firm evidence” and that it was “panic stations” at the Reform grouping on Kent, which Kemkaran had described as a “showcase” for the party’s intentions of winning power in a general election.They added that a vote of no confidence in Kemkaran was being readied for early November, either from the opposition or from withinReform UK.Kemkaran told her fellow councillors in an email at the weekend that she launched a hunt for the “cowards” who had leaked the recorded meeting.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They have been studying CCTV footage and examining items left by the intruders at the scene, including gloves, a walkie-talkie and a motorcycle helmet.View image in fullscreenA tiara worn by the Empress Eugénie was targeted by thieves during the heist.Photograph: Louvre Museum/ReutersThe gang of four thieves, who were unarmed butthreatened guards with angle grinders, according to a prosecutor, accessed the Louvre via an outside window in broad daylight. It was Sunday morning and the museum had recently opened to visitors.The robbers used a truck with an extendable ladder like those used by furniture movers in order to gain access to the Apollo gallery, the gilded room that houses the royal collection and crown jewels. They used their cutting equipment to get in and open the display cases, taking jewels from two cases in the ornate gallery that is one of the most visited rooms in the museum.Some were dressed in hi-vis jackets like builders. Officials said the thieves were inside the Apollo gallery for only four minutes and the whole robbery was over in seven minutes.Apollo gallery planLouvre theft aerial viewThe masked thieves stole eight objects including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to the 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense. Also stolen were an emerald necklace and earrings from a matching set from Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife. Among the other objects were a reliquary brooch and the diadem and large corsage-bow broach of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie – a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.Louvre museum robbery: how the thieves broke in, what they stole and what happens nextRead moreOne object, the emerald-set imperial crown of Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum after it was dropped by the robbers, French authorities said.Darmanin said questions could be asked about why the museum’s windows were not secured.Speaking on CNews, the culture minister, Rachida Dati, said the thieves attempted to set fire to the furniture hoist but failed, leaving evidence behind as they fled.“We did find motorcycles and they have a licence plate,” Dati said. “I also want to pay tribute to the security officers who prevented the furniture hoist from being set on fire. One of the criminals tried to set it on fire but they forced him to flee. This allowed us to recover evidence at the scene.”Dati said museum staff followed security procedures. The alarms sounded when cases were opened and Louvre agents entered the room but the intruders had already fled.Dati stressed that adecade-long Louvre renovation projectlaunched earlier this year includes security improvements. The €700m plan is intended to modernise infrastructure, ease crowding and give the museum’s most famous painting, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, a dedicated gallery by 2031.Dati was asked by M6 television if she felt responsibility as culture minister for the fact that robbers had been able to target the Louvre. She pointed instead at her predecessors, saying there had been “40 years of abandon” on issues of security of works in the Louvre.View image in fullscreenSome of the jewels from the Apollo wing of the Louvre.Composite: Louvre.frThe far right called the theft “a humiliation” for France. “How far will the disintegration of the state go?” said the National Rally party leader, Jordan Bardella, on social media, calling the heist “an unbearable humiliation for our country”.The president, Emmanuel Macron, said on social media that everything was being done to catch the perpetrators and recover the stolen treasures. Darmanin vowed the robbers would be caught.The museum remained closed on Monday.Trade unions said that in general not enough investment was being made in staffing and security at French cultural venues.“The collections aren’t safe, the visitors aren’t safe and the staff aren’t either,” Yvan Navarroa co-secretary general of the culture branch of the leftwing CGT union, told France Info. He said cuts over recent years meant there was a lack of security staffing for French culture and heritage.Explore more on these topicsFranceParisMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Explanations have often focused on pregnancy-related hormonal changes, but researchpublished Tuesday in Naturehas found breastfeeding provides long-lasting immune protection.Prof Sherene Loi, a clinician scientist at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, said the most sophisticated level of the immune system, called the adaptive immune system, involves T-cells which react against particular viruses or bacteria – and also against cancer. This response is“one of our very modern therapeutic weapons against cancer”.Loi, the senior author of the new study, said her team had noticed some breast cancers had large amounts of these specialised immune cells, while others had very few.Women who miss first breast cancer screening at ‘40% higher risk’ of dying from the diseaseRead morePatients who had more cells had better outcomes, particularly for one of the most aggressive types: triple-negative breast cancer. These immune cells were also found in healthy breast tissue.The study sought to investigate why these T-cells were already there, whether they were related to pregnancy and breastfeeding, and if they protected against breast cancer formation and growth.The researchers studied noncancerous breast tissue of more than 260 women from diverse populations who had breast reductions or surgery to reduce their risk of breast cancer.They found those who had children had more of these specialised cells, called CD8⁺ T-cells. These cells remained in the breasts for more than 30 years after pregnancy.Using mice models, the researchers then implanted cancerous cells into the equivalent of their breast tissue, and found they grew less in the mice that had had pups and breastfed, than in virgin mice.When they depleted the T-cells from the mice with pups, they lost the protection. This suggested the T-cells were directly responsible for the effect, Loi said.The researchers then investigated whether women who breastfed lived longer with triple-negative breast cancer. They looked at studies involving more than1,000 breast cancer patients diagnosed after having children, and had a record of their breastfeeding history.They found that women who had breastfed did better from their triple-negative breast cancer than those who had not. Their tumours also had more immune cells, suggesting there was ongoing immune activation and regulation from the body against their breast cancer.“The key take-home messages [are] that pregnancy and breastfeeding will leave behind long-lived protective immune cells in the breast and the body, and these cells help to reduce risk and improve defence against breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, but potentially other cancers as well as disease,” Loi said.Loi said the study provided an explanation why breastfeeding is protective, so that it can be used in the future to try to recreate this effect in women who don’t have children or are unable to breastfeed.Understanding the biological mechanism could help develop vaccines and new strategies to mimic this protection, she said.She emphasised even if women do breastfeed, it’s not a 100% guarantee that they won’t get breast cancer. “The effects are really quite small for every individual, but population wide the effects are large.”Associate Prof Wendy Ingman from the University of Adelaide’s Medical School said the longer the duration of breastfeeding, the greater the benefits. She said,for every year of breastfeeding, there is a 4% lifetime reductionin the mother’s breast cancer risk.“This study shows that having babies and breastfeeding causes long-lasting changes in immune cells that could help protect the breast from cancer,” she said. “I’m hopeful that this type of research will lead to new approaches to reduce women’s breast cancer risk.”Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerMedical researchHealthWomen's healthBreastfeedingPregnancynewsShareReuse this content"

Getting back the ability to read is a major improvement in their quality of life, lifts their mood and helps to restore their confidence and independence.”The trial found 84% of participants were once again able to read letters, numbers and words after being fitted with the implant, called the Prima device.Eye specialists hailed the results as “remarkable” and said the device could help people with the “dry” form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of sight loss in the over-50s.Moorfields said: “The revolutionary new implant is the first ever device to enable people to read letters, numbers and words through an eye that had lost its sight.”The 38 patients all had geographic atrophy with dry AMD, which over time progressively deprives someone of their sight and for which there is no treatment. Most people with the condition lose some of their central vision and in some cases it progresses to full sight loss as the cells in the macula die and the central macula melts away.All had lost their central vision and had only limited peripheral vision before they had the device implanted in an operation lasting less then two hours. Five were treated at Moorfields and the others at hospitals in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands.Sheila Irvine from Wiltshire, one of those who had the chip implanted at Moorfields, said: “Before receiving the implant it was like having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted. I was an avid bookworm and I wanted that back. There was no pain during the operation but you’re still aware of what’s happening.“It’s made a big difference. It’s a new way of looking through your eyes and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter. It’s not simple, learning to read again, but the more hours I put in, the more I pick up.”The Prima device, a super-thin microchip that is just 2mm by 2mm in size, is inserted under the centre of the eye’s retina in a procedure known as a vitrectomy.To help them to see and write, patients were given augmented reality glasses containing a video camera connected to a small computer, which they attached to their waistband. It included a zoom feature to make text bigger and easier to read.Patients can use the glasses to focus and scan the object in the projected image that they want to read. The glasses project the scenes as an infra-red beam across the chip, which activates the device. Artificial intelligence in the waistband computer processes the information and converts it into an electrical signal, which passes through the cells in the retina and optical nerve into the brain.Muqit stressed that patients had to undergo training and intensive rehabilitation of their eye in order to realise the benefits of the technology.“It’s not like you’re popping a chip in the eye and then you can see again. You need to learn to use this type of vision,” he said.The results of the trial are reported in theNew England Journal of Medicine.Explore more on these topicsMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Brands buys remainder of operation in BritainBusiness live – latest updatesJasper JollyMon 20 Oct 2025 12.11 EDTFirst published on Mon 20 Oct 2025 10.27 EDTSharePizza Hut is to shut 68 of its restaurants, putting as many as 1,200 jobs at risk, after the company behind its UK venues fell into administration.DC London Pie, which owned the UK Pizza Hut franchise, appointed administrators from FTI on Monday. Eleven delivery-only sites will also close.The US hospitality company Yum! Brands, which owns the global Pizza Hut brand as well as KFC and Taco Bell, said it had bought the remainder of the UK restaurant operation in a pre-pack administration deal. The deal will save 64 Pizza Hut sites in the UK and secure the future of 1,277 workers, the company said. Those sites will be owned directly by Yum.The closures come only nine months after the purchase of the UK Pizza Hut franchise by Directional Capital, a US private equity firm that already operated Pizza Hut restaurants in Sweden and Denmark. Directional claims to manage more than $5bn (£3.7bn) in assets, with a focus on mid-market companies that need to raise cash.Pizza Hut opened its first UK restaurant in London’s Islington in 1973. Staff numbers at the company rose to more than 14,000 in 1999 and it counted nearly 700 locations by 2006. However, it has struggled in recent years as casual dining chains have faced stiffcompetition to attract hard-pressed consumerssuffering the effects of inflation on their disposable incomes.Pizza Hut survived the Covid pandemic lockdowns – albeit whileclosing 29 branches– only to be hit by higher costs such as rising energy bills as well as increased taxes such as the national insurance hike introduced by the Labour government in the 2024 budget.Last year Pizza Hut faced criticism for a promotion that offered customers“free spins” at online casinoswith their takeaway. It has also faced scrutiny for a previous“cheeseburger pizza”that contained 2,880 calories, more than the recommended daily intake for an adult man.HM Revenue and Customs filed a winding-up petition against DC London Pie on 11 September – a move generally made by the tax authority when a company has been unable to pay its tax bill because of financial difficulties.Directional bought the business from Pizza Hut UK’s previous management, led by the chief executive, Jens Hofma, and the investor Pricoa (now known as PGIM Private Capital), who had acquired it for a reported £100m in 2018. It was previously owned by Rutland Partners, yet another private equity firm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sales at the European operations have dropped, weighing on stronger trading in the US.The SlimFast brand has come under mounting pressure from therapid growth of weight-loss drug blockbusterssuch as Wegovy and Mounjaro, made by the pharmaceutical companies Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly respectively.SlimFast was launched in Florida in 1977 by S Daniel Abraham, who died in June at the age of 100. Sales took off in the late 1980s when diet culture became popular, and the former LA Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda appeared in SlimFast television adverts.The brand was sold in 2000 to Unilever for £1.4bn and changed hands again later. Unileversold it in 2014to the US private equity firm Kainos Capital, aftersales began to fall sharply from 2003 when the Atkins diet craze hit the US, its biggest market. Kainos offloaded SlimFast to Glanbia for $350m (£261m) four years later.The Manchester-based consumer goods company Supreme, which bought the Typhoo tea brand out of administration last year and also makes batteries and vaping products, said the acquisition would fit well into its drinks and wellness division.It said the deal would help to expand its presence in the weight management market – a market that is projected to reach £1.5bn by 2027.Sandy Chadha, its chief executive, said: “We are excited to have acquired such an iconic brand in SlimFast, which we believe is highly complementary to our existing drinks and wellness category.“Under our ownership and track record for product innovation, we believe the commercial opportunities to both enhance and broaden SlimFast’s market presence makes it an ideal addition to our business.”Glanbia put the business up for sale in February. Its chief financial officer, Mark Garvey, said at the time: “We’ve decided to move on because we believe there is a significant change in how weight management is being managed by our consumers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even Michael Connelly, the author of the bestselling Lincoln Lawyer series, feared he might fall behind when writing about AI.Connelly’s eighth novel in the series, to be released on Tuesday, centres on a lawsuit against an AI company whose chatbot told a 16-year-old boy that it was OK for him to kill his ex-girlfriend for being unfaithful.But as he was writing, he witnessed the technology altering the way the world worked so rapidly that he feared his plot might become out of date.“You don’t have to lick your finger and hold it up to the wind to know that AI is a massive change that’s coming to science, culture, medicine, everything,” he said. “It’s going to affect all parts of our lives.“But it’s kind of the wild west; there’s no government oversight. AI is moving so fast that I even thought my book might be archaic by the time it got published.”The Lincoln Lawyer novels are a series of Los Angeles-based thrillers in which the defence attorney Mickey Haller works out of his Lincoln car. They have been adapted into a 2011 film starring Matthew McConaughey, as well as a Netflix series.View image in fullscreenMatthew McConaughey in The Lincoln Lawyer.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex ShutterstockNot for the first time in the series, The Proving Ground took some inspiration from real-world events.Connelly said: “One was this case in Orlando, wherea teenager committed suicide, allegedly at the urging of a chatbot. Before that there was a case in England, where a person with some mental health issueswas encouraged [by a chatbot] to jump the wall at Windsor Palacewith a bow and arrow to try to find the Queen.”On the themes of the novel, he added: “Is free speech a human right or mechanical right? In the Orlando case, the judge said he wouldn’t grant a machine human rights. But it’s an interesting question. Is AI going to reach a point that it shares the rights that human beings have?”Connelly, 69, is one of the world’s leading crime writers, his books having topped bestseller charts and sold more than 89m copies. He is also known for the Harry Bosch series, which has been made into a TV show by Amazon. (In Connelly’s fictional universe, Haller and Bosch are half-brothers.)The writer has his own battles with AI. He is part of a collective of authors, including Jonathan Franzen, Jodi Picoult and John Grisham,suing OpenAI for copyright infringement.“The Author’s Guild came to me and said: ‘Do you know that all your books were fed into the giant maw of OpenAI’s training of its chatbot?’” Connelly said. “I didn’t. If we let that go by, it will put every publisher out of business. Authors will have no protections on their creative work. The purpose of the lawsuit is to have proper rules put in place for all levels of use.”He cited chess championGarry Kasparov’s loss to IBM’s Deep Blue in 1997as “one of the benchmarks that led us” to this moment. When asked if authors could go the way of grandmasters, he said: “It could happen, but I don’t think it’d be an improved world.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

He said he felt moved to do something after he learned that Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird, which had been influential to him, was temporarily removed from classrooms in Palm Beach County.“I had to read that book to be what I am today. I would have never written a Lincoln Lawyer without it,” he said. He was also struck when Stephen Chbosky’s coming of age novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower, “which meant a lot to my daughter”, received a ban.He and his wife, Linda McCaleb, help fund PEN America’sMiami office countering book bans. “It’s run by a lawyer who then tries to step in, usually by filing injunctions against school boards,” he said. “I don’t believe anyone has any right to tell some other kid they can’t read something, to usurp another parent’s oversight of their children.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ThrillersPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

In her 1978 portrait of Toni Morrison, the author gazes directly into the camera with a striking expression that holds the viewer’s eyes fixed on hers.A shadow fills the space between Morrison and the world, compelling the audience to reckon with her presence. The cigarette held effortlessly in Morrison’s hand is a gesture to her power and influence as a literary giant. The image captures the essence of Simpson’sphotography, seamlessly revealing the nature of her subjects while commanding their presence in the world.View image in fullscreenCoreen Simpson’s Self-portrait.Photograph: Coreen SimpsonWhen working at the Studio Museum in Harlem as an assistant curator, Simpson set up an unofficial photography studio in her office and assigned herself the task of photographing artists, such as Morrison, who came to visit the museum.“I made up this whole thing, ‘I’m Coreen Simpson, and I would like to do an official portrait of you,’” she says. “Toni Morrison was smoking a cigarette when she came in, and so she said, ‘Oh, let me put the cigarette out.’ And I told her, ‘But it looks so glamorous with the cigarette. This is you. Allow me to take the picture.’”At 83 years old, Simpson remains excited about photography, and in a newly released photo book from Aperture’s Vision & Justice project, titledCoreen Simpson: A Monograph,viewers can experience the joy of her imagery. Her black-and-white portraits reveal the quiet and luminous spirit of her subjects, while her compelling experimental portraits challenge the audience to confront their perception of women’s bodies by covering their faces with masks. “I’ve never gotten bored [with photography], but I used to get bored very easily with things,” she says. “It’s fascinating to me that it has just enriched my life completely.”Simpson became a photographer after noticing that she could make better images than the ones used to illustrate her stories as a freelance lifestyle writer. She took the chance to start creating the images she wanted to see. In 1976, she contacted her friend Walter Johnson, a street photographer who worked at a photo lab in Manhattan, with whom she had been acquainted from her modeling days, and asked if he could teach her how to use a camera. He showed her how to use it, and as soon as she got a hold of it, she became unstoppable.She argues that great images are the key to having a successful published story. “You have to feel good about yourself, and good about the article that you’re presenting to the public,” she says. “So what makes it good? It’s the visuals. The visuals make it good.”View image in fullscreenCooking Is My Game (Lady Chef), Velma James, Hotel Roosevelt, New York, 1977.Photograph: Coreen SimpsonView image in fullscreenJamien, 1982.Photograph: Coreen SimpsonView image in fullscreenWilliam and Sam, Roxy Club, 1985.Photograph: Coreen SimpsonShe attributes her success as a photographer to her childhood growing up in foster care, during which she developed a survival instinct that is now essential to her image-making process. “I like photography ‘cause it’s like you have to survive. You have to get the photograph, damn it. That’s what the editor wants, and it’s so exciting,” she says.Her instincts have led her to create a unique and innovative career not only in photography but also as a successful entrepreneur of her jewelry company. Simpson got her start in the jewelry industry by accident. Her friend Richard, who worked for the chief curator of Vogue, invited her to join him as he went to the West Village inNew YorkCity to sell his old clothes. She brought some of her old jewelry, and after a few Saturdays putting out a blanket with their items, they sold everything. The joy she gained from the experience made her want to sell more.Her friend suggested that they take a jewelry-making class to create more pieces they could sell. After taking a few lessons to improve her skills, she saw an improvement. As the designs improved, she increased the price, but people downtown were unwilling to pay the amount she was asking. After a customer suggested, she began selling her jewelry in front of Bendel’s on 57th St.View image in fullscreenGail Pilgrim Wearing a Black Cameo Collection Crown, 1990s.Photograph: Coreen SimpsonView image in fullscreenAlva with Clock, 1991/2021.Photograph: Coreen SimpsonView image in fullscreenMan with Curl, 1990s.Photograph: Coreen SimpsonIn 1989, after Simpson trained for a few years at the New School and refining her skills, one of her editors, Audreen Ballard, asked her to create a Black Cameo. It led to her business blooming, and the success of her jewelry line, the Black Cameo, has allowed her to use the money from her business to supplement her income when she is not taking photos.“When I’m making jewelry with my hands. I’m always thinking, what am I doing with photography?” Simpson says. “When I’m doing the photography, I’m thinking about the jewelry, so it works. It’s very interesting how my mind works.”Her portraits capture the heart and soul of the people she photographs, from those on the streets of Harlem to iconic figures such as James Baldwin, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol, as well as the nightlife at clubs in New York City.Her compassion for her subjects has taken her and her camera, which she describes as a passport, to one-of-a-kind experiences. On the eve of Muhammad Ali’s fight against Ken Norton at Yankee Stadium in 1976, she stood outside the stadium wanting to photograph the event attenders. Although she did not have a ticket to the fight herself, a man approached her while she was working, asking if she would like to meet Ali. She responded excitedly: “Of course!” He replied: “Come with me, and I will introduce you to him.”View image in fullscreenMuhammad Ali at the Cotton Club, Harlem, 1979.Photograph: Coreen SimpsonFlashing her NBC work badge, where she worked as a union contractor and not a photographer, Ali invited her to be the only photographer to walk behind him as he entered the ring. “Can you imagine?” she declares. When the fight ended, Ali invited her to attend the after-party events with him. “It’s just being in the right place at the right time,” she says. “I tell young photographers today, don’t wait for a magazine to give you an assignment.”She later called the Black Sports magazine to pitch them a story with her images of Ali. The publication of her images in the magazine would mark the first time her photos were in a national publication.As a single mother taking care of two young children, she has persisted in creating opportunities for herself by following her passions and never taking no for an answer. “When I read a lot of James Baldwin’s work, he said, ‘Go with the blood beats,’ and that means do what excites you,” she says. “Whatever it is, just go [do] what excites you.”Coreen Simpson: A Monograph isout now"

Now the cinema, which is a charity, has a bustling roster of volunteers to help keep it running. They have eight paid staff and 60-70 volunteers whose ages range from 14 to 80.View image in fullscreenThe Plaza is this month offering an ‘autism and disability screening’ of Night of the ZoopocalyseOne of these is Lola, 19, who says: “There were loads of people around my age who started at the Plaza and had their lives transformed.”She explains how, for some, it built confidence and offered a focus: “I grew up local to the cinema but always felt a bit distant from the community. By volunteering there, I learned about the area from other volunteers and it really made me feel connected.“Everything at the Plaza is about the community and doing community events and keeping the costs really low, so it’s accessible for people.”Community cinema tickets can often be cheaper than those at mainstream venues. Tickets at theKing’s Lynn Community Cinema Club, a not-for-profit organisation, are about £2.50 a film if you take out a season membership of £20. This gives you free access to all the films, about eight a season, and there are two seasons a year. Day membership means you can watch a film by paying £6 on the door.View image in fullscreenMembers of the King’s Lynn Community Cinema Club committee.Photograph: Ivor RowlandMeanwhile, theQueer Boots film clubin Lancaster, which has been going for just over a year and describes itself as “a collaborative community film group dedicated to showing and discussing films highlighting the queer experience”, offers a pay-what-you-can option so people do not miss out.This month, UK community cinema celebrates the 100th anniversary ofthe launch of the first UK film society on 25 October 1925. The brainchild of cultural visionaries including the film-makers Ivor Montagu and Anthony Asquith, the artist Augustus John and the economistJohn Maynard Keynes, it held its inaugural screening in Regent Street, central London, showcasing Paul Leni’s 1924 German silent anthology film, Waxworks, among other movies.“Community cinemas offer affordable, local, safe spaces for people to see films together, as an audience,” says Jaq Chell, the chief executive ofCinema for All,the national charity for the support and development of community cinema. “They make an important impact on the film industry, on film education, on access to arts and culture and on people’s lives.”There are more than 1,600 community screens across the UK, and aFestival of Community Cinema, which runs until December, is celebrating this anniversary.View image in fullscreenThe Queer Boots film club in Lancaster offers a pay-what-you-can optionGiles Conlon, 48, of Banbridge in County Down, Northern Ireland, is not surprised by the growing interest in this cinema movement. He has worked in the film exhibition industry for more than 25 years, starting his career in multiplexes and working in independent mainstream cinemas.Since 2024, he has been employed as a coordinator at theNewcastle community cinemaand last year foundedBanbridgecommunitycinema– a small-scale pop-up with monthly screenings at a restaurant.“I think this is now where the heart and love of cinema really is,” Conlon says. “The multiplexes and the big chains do what they do – but I think, for the people working in it and for people going, the best experience today is with community cinemas.”This is something that chimes with those involved with community cinemas who responded to an online callout. Many spoke of how it brought people together, creating opportunities for new friendships.It also exposed them to films they may not have chosen to see but were glad they did. The King’s Lynn Community Cinema Club, for example, has screened films from nine countries, including Iran’sMy Favourite Cake.People also credited community cinemas with making films accessible. Lots of groups flagged up the post-film discussion as an important element of a successful screening. Others spoke of the fun they had at themed dress-up nights. The Queer Boots Film Club, for example, had a Rocky Horror dress-up with a screening.Another popular film wasBeautiful Thing. “Attendees really loved the authenticity of that working-class coming-of-age experience,” says Sam Gibbons, who set up the club.Meanwhile, theHarrogate Film Society, which has an emphasis on World Cinema, screened the animationMavka: The Forest Songfor Ukrainian families in the area.According to Cinema for All, 31% of community screens operate in rural areas, compared with only 3% of commercial venues.View image in fullscreenA 35-seat beachside cinema in the Highlands.Photograph: Ruth ClarkIn the town of Cromarty in the Highlands, which has a population of 700, a small team worked to secure funding to build the 35-seatCromartycommunitycinema.Tanya Karlebach, trustee of theCromarty and Resolis Film Society,which is a charity, says the cinema has become a treasured part of the community.After a screening of the dramaSound of Metal, she recalls how she looked at the volunteers and audience and realised “how much it matters to have third spaces for people to connect in”.Many of the community cinemas also, on occasion, raise money for charities from their screenings, while others offer training.View image in fullscreenRamsgate community cinema runs a youth film club.Photograph: Joanne PostlewaiteTake theRamsgate community cinema, for example. As well as showing films, includingSisters with Transistors, a documentary about electronic music’s unsung heroines, it hosts clubs, including a youth film-maker’s club, which is free for young local people and offers access to professional film-maker mentors.As for Lola, she is away at university but has her volunteer shift at the Plaza booked for when she returns home. “The Plaza is built on all this work that people have done completely for free,” she says. “It’s maintained by people who are doing it for fun, completely for free. It’s like a monument to kindness and community.”TheFestival of Community Cinemais running until December.

It’s adapted by Jackman fromIsabel Greenberg’s 2016 graphic novel of the same title, and inspired generally by Scheherazade and the One Thousand and One Nights – and also I think by Julie Dash, Peter Greenaway and maybe the theatricality ofAgnès Varda’s One Hundred and One Nights. Emma Corrin and Maika Monroe star, with Nicholas Galitzine and Amir El-Masry in support; Charli xcx makes an appearance, and there’s also a tiny intriguing cameo for critic Sophie Monks Kaufman. It adds up to a likable movie, a little fey but unexpectedly subtle – although the meta-level of storytelling sometimes has for me the disconcerting effect of halting and dissipating the all-important narrative energy.We are in a fairytale medieval world created by the god Birdman (Richard E Grant). Or rather, a world envisioned originally as a gender-coeval utopia by his daughter Kiddo (Safia Oakley-Green), but then spoiled by Birdman in a fit of sexist pique. In this place, women are not allowed to read or write but they are allowed to tell stories, and it is this skill that distinguishes the maidservant Hero (Corrin), who waits upon the shy, melancholy noblewoman Cherry (Monroe), and has become her intimate best friend.Cherry’s boorish husband Jerome (El-Masry) has failed to get her pregnant and is nettled by a claim from his womanising friend Manfred (Galitzine) that he could seduce Cherry if he felt like it. So Jerome challenges him to do it as a bet in the next hundred days while he goes away “on business”. It becomes Hero’s task to distract Manfred with superb stories, so gripping that they will bewitch, bother and bewilder him away from his urges. But are Jerome’s motives more complex than they appear?Galitzine’s Manfred is a smug and tiresome figure who patronisingly calls Hero “a woman of many talents”, although this is not precisely how the non-binary Corrin portrays the character. He does, however, achieve something almost like a beauty-and-the-beast sympathy as he pursues Cherry – but it is Hero who has the stronger claim on Cherry’s innocent heart, not merely with storytelling but with erotic role play, as she demonstrates what Cherry could expect from a truly amorous suitor. Gender, sexuality, status and power are all in flux here, a playful effect that is however withdrawn when we arrive at the sacrificial seriousness. It is a sweet tale which floats self-consciously out of the screen.100 Nights of Hero screened at theLondon film festival.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025Comedy filmsRomance filmsFilm adaptationsComics and graphic novelsCharli xcxRichard E GrantreviewsShareReuse this content"

All the tricks of the trade are here, and director Stuart Ortiz plays things more or less straight. In fact it’s a mockumentary: not a parody but instead a horror movie that happens to be told using the format of a true crime documentary.The story, about a masked killer called Mr Shiny (if you think this name strains credibility, don’t forget there are real serial killers nicknamed the Happy Face Killer, the Dating Game Killer and the Doodler), is functional enough. There are lurid details of the killings, and police officers talking about how the crimes were beyond belief; there are taunting notes from the murderer; passages where the trail goes cold; moments when the police nearly catch Mr Shiny, only for him to slip through their fingers.It’s a reminder of how comfortingly familiar these tropes have become, and because this is fiction, the moral questions triggered by actual true crime films are at a slight remove; there’s no need to ask whether the victims’ families are being properly respected here.The only area in which Strange Harvest is a little disappointing is in its practical effects – the prosthetics and gore work. Everything else looks exactly as it should, but the footage and photographs of the bodies lack the same precise verisimilitude. This wouldn’t matter in a straightforward goofy horror movie, but here it leaps out as clunky and fake.Indeed, if you didn’t know that you were watching fiction, it would be your first real clue. The rest of the re-creation is highly convincing – not least in the casting. Everyone here looks and acts exactly like the character type they are playing. There are no implausibly prettified police officers, or serial killers out of Vanity Fair’s Rising Stars page.Ignore the film’s marketing, which seems intent on positioning it as a run-of-the-mill masked maniac movie; this is a fascinating and neatly realised horror riff on the 2020s’ most popular genre.Strange Harvest is on digital platforms from 27 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

If your fiance has a female BFF – especially if she has the megawatt smile and mile-long legs ofJulia Robertsat her ravishing best – prepare for drama. Even if you’re Cameron Diaz. Which is the precise scenario we’re confronted with at the start of my favourite chaotic caper, which made just under $300m at the global box office when it debuted in 1997, and also stole my heart as a melodramatic 11-year-old.‘Cosy and comforting’: why The Fellowship of the Ring is my feelgood movieRead moreWe were truly spoiled for romcoms in the 90s – believe me, I watched them all – but My Best Friend’s Wedding is something special. To watch this PJ Hogan classic (he also directed Muriel’s Wedding) is to sink into a warm bath of nostalgia, complete with brick-sized mobile phones, indoor smoking and croony Burt Bacharach classics. It has everything: a car chase, an all-cast singalong lunch complete with dancing lobster claws and even an intimate mishap with an ice sculpture of Michelangelo’s David. But it also has the chutzpah to turn the romcom formula on its head, and give us an ending we don’t necessarily expect.Roberts plays Julianne, a no-nonsense New York food critic who has a pact with her college best friend Michael (a Disney-handsome, if dull, Dermot Mulroney) that if they reach the ripe old age of 28 unmarried, they’ll marry each other. Except now Michael is marrying peppy 20-year-old Kimmy (Diaz), which prompts Julianne to realise she’s actually desperately in love with him herself. “It’s amazing, the clarity that comes with psychotic jealousy,” Julianne’s editor George (Rupert Everett) drily remarks. Cue increasingly manic ploys to sabotage the wedding.Roberts is a bride-to-be’s worst nightmare. As a preteen in rural Surrey, I didn’t know anyone like these characters, but now I recognise Julianne instantly as one of those women who has no female friends, and for good reason. Impeccable in peak 90s tailoring and Pretty Woman-era auburn curls, she arrives in Chicago for the wedding and, within minutes, is making references to the “one hot month” she and Michael spent together at college. The impenetrable in-jokes are constant – poor Kimmy – and Julianne is such a knockout in her lavender satin bridesmaid gown (Kimmy’s former maid of honour “shattered her pelvis line-dancing over spring break”) that you’d be tempted to call off the entire thing there and then.But what I love, and have always loved about this film, is that it refuses to turn Kimmy into the villain in order to justify Julianne’s actions. Sure, she’s shrieky and drives like a psychopath, but she’s also sweet. In fact, none of the characters are entirely good or bad, they’re just nuanced – like real people (just very good-looking real people). It’s impossible not to root for Julianne, who’s the perfect, chaotic anti-hero. OK, so she’s chaotic in a sort of screwbally, Julia Roberts way that feels almost aspirational, but still, her inability to deal with things in a rational way feels very human. She’s too frightened and broken and proud to tell Michael how she feels, so there’s nothing for her to do but make bad decisions and chain-smoke through it, like a normal person. It’s refreshing!If I learned any lesson from the romcoms of my youth, it was that if you love somebody, you pursue them at all costs. But My Best Friend’s Wedding points out that, actually, that’s not always a great idea. And ultimately, Julianne puts herself out there, and gets shunned. It’s a big departure from romcom code, and while the film feels conventional in a lot of ways, I’ve always appreciated the honesty of its message that, actually, love isn’t always enough.It’s not all drama, though. In fact, while this film has a lot of heart, it’s also frequently absurd, and that’s what stops it being saccharine and makes it so rewatchable. A favourite moment of mine is when a serious conversation between Julianne and Michael is soundtracked by some wedding guestssinging a three-part harmony of Annie’s Songin helium-induced chipmunk voices behind them. Meanwhile, Everett is exceptional as the charming and highly camp George, andthe kitschy lip synch to Wishin’ and Hopin’at the start of the film is utter perfection – I watch it on YouTube sometimes when I need cheering up.My Best Friend’s Wedding originally hada different ending, in which Julianne meets a new love interest at the wedding reception, rather than dancing her cares away with George, but apparently it had to be scrapped as test audiences reacted so negatively. And thank goodness: the film’s ultimate feelgood factor surely comes from its flawless ending, and the message that friendship is the most important relationship of all. I was single for much of my 20s, and watching the film then, it felt so satisfying to see Julianne having the time of her life just hours after having been rejected by a guy, rather than moping around. Now that’s a happy ending.My Best Friend’s Wedding is available to rent digitally in the US and UK and on Stan in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsJulia RobertsMy feelgood movieCameron DiazRomance filmsComedy filmsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The score’s intricate textures were almost miraculously lucid. Muted trumpets seemed to have escaped from a big band, a piano splashed around anarchically amid the strings and moreish rhythmic grooves emerged only to be abruptly halted. At one point an elephantine tuba blared into one of these sudden stoppages before a whole new cluster of ideas emerged, bright and delightfully bonkers, as Adès leapt around gamely on the podium.View image in fullscreenThomas Adès with composer Alex Paxton, whose World Builder, Creature had its UK premiere.Photograph: Mark AllanPoul Ruders’ Paganini Variations for Guitar and Orchestra (Guitar Concerto No 2) involves a similar knowingness –Paganini’s famous themeoccasionally surfaces through Ruders’ altogether spikier musical language – but less obvious humour. Sean Shibe made light work of the virtuosic solo passages but shone above all in sparser textures, where his tender, vibrato-laden melodic lines had space to breathe. Elsewhere the guitar was periodically swallowed by the orchestra despite amplification.Both Paxton and Ruders were in the audience and stayed put for the second half, at which point this concert’s masterclass in programming truly took off. InSibelius’s Symphony No 3, horns cut through string agitations like beams of light, pizzicato were mellow and timpani strokes elemental, the orchestral coordination absolute throughout. The finale surged euphorically towards its closing C major triads. Those came to seem all the more luminous when followed by Adès’s own Aquifer, which rolls and rumbles, thunders and subsides in waves of constant, polychrome orchestral motion. In this flamboyantly high-definition performance, it was an exhilarating send-off.Explore more on these topicsLondon Symphony OrchestraClassical musicThomas AdèsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1964, aged seven, he was taken by his mother to see “a kid named Bob Dylan” play a local college gym. By the age of 14, living in San Diego, he was writing record reviews for a local underground magazine whose main aim was to bring down Richard Nixon. Shortly after that, he started interviewing the bands of the day as they came through California – first Humble Pie forCreem, and then the Eagles, the Allman Brothers Band and Led Zeppelin for Rolling Stone.Crowe previously fictionalised his story in the 2000 filmAlmost Famous, which he wrote and directed. His lyrical and compulsively readable memoir The Uncool is bookended by the opening of a musical version, which coincides with the death of Crowe’s mother Alice whose aphorisms, including “Put some goodness in the world before it blows up”, are scattered throughout the book. Alice insisted that Crowe skip two school grades, driving his precocity; she was also dead against rock’n’roll on account of its unbridled hedonism. When Crowe asks her what Elvis did on The Ed Sullivan Show that was so subversive he had to be filmed from the waist up, she “clinically” replies: “He had an erection”.Nevertheless, unbridled hedonism is exactly what the book depicts, through the starry-eyed gaze of youth: unlike, say, Joan Didion in Slouching Towards Bethlehem, Crowe didn’t study the counterculture’s casualties too closely. His is a world of aftershow parties filled with characters like Freddie Sessler, a drug dealer who is rumoured to have made his fortune manufacturing pencils; late-night dressing-room jam sessions (Crowe has his guitar gently removed from his hands by a roadie called Red Dog when he attempts to join in with the Allman Brothers); eager, undamaged groupies (he knows a crew called the Flying Garter Girls whose leader Pennie Lane’s credo is “only blowjobs, and that’s it”); and, as the early 70s wear on, omnipresent cocaine use, though Crowe doesn’t partake. “I couldn’t shake the image of my teacher-mother popping up,” he says. “You’re killing brain cells!”The Uncool captures an extraordinarily creative period in which rock music was stretching out in all directionsThe few music journalists making a viable living today would be agog at the access he enjoyed. When I interviewed the Rolling Stones for the Guardian nine years ago, I got about 15 minutes with each of them in a succession of Boston hotel rooms. (Fortunately, they were very good value.) Compare that with the 18 months Crowe spent with David Bowie in LA for a Rolling Stone cover story that ran in February 1976. He shadowed Bowie at parties with Ronnie Wood and in the studio with Iggy Pop; he hung out with him day and night in houses he was renting, meaning that he was there to record the heartstopping moment when Bowie suddenly jumped to his feet mid-interview because he thought he’d seen a body fall from the sky. The cocaine-and-occult-addled Thin White Duke pulled down the blinds, on which he had drawn a pentagram, lit and quickly blew out a black candle, then told Crowe: “Don’t let me scare the pants off you. It’s only protective. I’ve been getting a little trouble from … theneighbours.”The Uncool captures an extraordinarily inventive period in which rock music was stretching out in all directions, whether towards country music thanks to artists like Gram Parsons, or the conceptual in albums by the likes of Yes and the Who. Crowe was part of a burgeoning music press that, as well as recommending new bands to its readers, or conveying what rock groups had to say for themselves, would interpret, celebrate and contextualise the huge creative strides some of these musicians were making.The work of writers like Crowe’s hero, Lester Bangs of Creem, amplified this sense of sonic excitement and exploration. While musicians may not have enjoyed being on the receiving end of his most brutally scathing criticism, Bangs pushed them to do better. One can almost hear him revolving in his grave at today’s Rolling Stone, which this month gave a five-star rave review to one of Taylor Swift’s worst ever albums. Although given that Jann Wenner, the founder of Rolling Stone, fired Bangs because he was insufficiently deferential to Canned Heat, he might not have been that surprised. Wenner, Bangs tells Crowe, is “a self-serving, ass-kissing heap of guano.”Crowe is honest about the way writers, including himself, could be seduced by this proximity to stardom – something Bangs vociferously warned him against. He was never the build ’em up, knock ’em down type and undoubtedly got closer to some rock stars than was healthy for journalistic objectivity. In 1978, he managed to coax Joni Mitchell into an interview – she was long a “Rolling Stone disbeliever” thanks to a 1971 stunt in which the magazine “published a chart of her boyfriends and dubbed her Old Lady of the Year”. When she asked to see his piece before it was published, Crowe agreed, and took in her “corrections” as well. Mitchell rewarded him by signing some artwork for her then-current album Mingus with the words “Thanks for the collaboration”. As Crowe says, “Famous for her honesty, she had outed me as a collaborator. What was criminal among journalists was a badge of honour for me.”View image in fullscreenCameron Crowe in September 2025.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianWhile his journalistic ethics may have wilted in the megawatt glow of his favourite rock stars, Crowe’s writing style flourished. In The Uncool, he succinctly evokes both eccentric characters and the era they represented. Of fellow journalist and future Doors biographer Danny Sugerman, Crowe writes: “His hands forever on his hips, he looked like he was always posing for an album cover that didn’t exist.” Gram Parsons is encapsulated thus: “The more he woke up, the more he had the air of a well-educated, stony young prince. He spoke about country artists the way a planetary scientist discusses the cosmos.” Crowe’s taste in music doesn’t inspire quite as much confidence – my faith was fatally shaken by his belief that the musically terrible Ryan Adams is “part of the same DNA chain” as Parsons. Crowe admits that one of the reasons he got a foot in the door at Rolling Stone was because he loved Jethro Tull, Deep Purple and the Eagles whereas the magazine’s staff “were the Van Morrison-Bob Dylan crowd.” Sun-dappled, hairy-chested rock is his thing.Punk enters the book like someone switching the lights on at the end of a party. On the same day the Sex Pistols make the cover of Rolling Stone, Crowe’s friends, members of the southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, are killed in a plane crash. It’s the end of an era. When his name doesn’t appear on the cover of Rolling Stone for his Joni Mitchell story, Crowe knows he is out of favour. “I’m 21,” he tells his parents. “I’m washed up.” He manages to transfer his talents to Hollywood, his career up and running once he writes the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which harks back to his schooldays.It’s another ode to lost youth. Crowe knows how potent an elegiac mood can be, or as he calls it, “the happy/sad”. It’s a gorgeous melancholia he detects in some of his favourite songs, from Silence Is Golden by the Tremeloes to Love Don’t Love Nobody by the Spinners, a Philly soul masterpiece over which he bonds with Bowie. But the source of this ache lies closer to home. Crowe writes that his sister Cathy took her own life aged 19, after suffering from a mental illness that was stigmatised and barely understood in the California of the mid-60s. Crowe, then just 10, couldn’t understand why his beloved big sister hadn’t left him a message of some kind, until he remembered the two Beach Boys singles she had ordered, which arrived at the house after her death: “My California Girl sister was telling me not to worry, baby.”Crowe shows that music can sometimes be a key, not only to the deepest aspects of one’s own self, but to the otherwise incomprehensible inner lives of others. On top of that, it offers solace, joy and camaraderie for a lifetime. Remembering that Dylan concert in 1964, Crowe writes: “The chilly gymnasium had become a gathering of a tribe. It was that rare feeling that we were all exactly where we belonged.”The Uncool by Cameron Crowe is published by HarperCollins (£22). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

A terror on set as well as on screen, he was offered a part in Indiana Jones but told Steven Spielberg the Raiders of the Lost Ark script was a “pile of shit”.Benjamin Myers’s new novel plunges us into Kinski’s fevered mind during one of his last performances, a recorded solo stage show in West Berlin in 1971, where he delivered a ferocious monologue as Jesus, “the freest and most modern of men, who preferred to be massacred than rot alive with all the others”. Showcased in a documentary released in 2008 by Peter Geyer, the act descended into chaos, Kinski arguing with hecklers before ending his monologue in a near-empty auditorium.The book melds Kinski’s on-the-record words with imagined second-person recollection about, among other things, his capture by allied forces as a German conscript, a spell in a psychiatric clinic, and his innumerable sexual conquests. Words scatter randomly across the page in a riot of salty vituperation: Kinski denounces “beatnik Christian youth … so easily offended” and fantasises about shoving the letters of his name “down the gagging gullet of history”.Cut half a century later to West Yorkshire during lockdown, where an unnamed writer decides to write a book “about the dead German actor Klaus Kinski”. The project looks unsaleable from the off, not least because Kinski’s eldest daughter, Pola, accused him of sexually abusing her. There’s also the fact that “the writer” – let’s call him Benjamin Myers – owes his publisher a “long, era-spanning historical novel concerning an English saint”, and has already spent the advance (this is a reference to 2023’s Goldsmiths prize-winningCuddy). Yet the “dark and forceful energy” of Kinski’s Jesus keeps drawing him back to online footage. By the time Myers clocks that the actor was 45 in 1971 – the age Myers is in 2021 – “a psychic door of communication [is] opened by the key of coincidence”, and it would basically be rude not to write the book.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Unlike Harvey, Myers lays bare his workings: biscuit breaks, dog walks, the books he skimmed for research, the ones he didn’t even open, to say nothing of his battle with anxiety and professional self-sabotage, of which the decision to write a book in the voice of an alleged child abuser is one example (“any fully functioning, well-rounded individual would simply not be considering Klaus Kinski at length during such a tumultuous time”).Yet when the writer pictures the type of novel likely to go down better – “a story about a young woman and her horse, perhaps” – the hesitation risks looking disingenuous; all the more so, once he lays into a younger generation of readers “more boring than their parents”, preferring their artists well behaved and “relatable”. Later, Myers wonders if Kinski’s self-scripted Jesus monologue wasn’t itself a little boring – an insight with potential to torpedo the entire project – but the implications of this thought are swiftly neutralised by instead dissing modern celebrity authors for not staying in their lane.In other words, this fitfully engaging narrative experiment isn’t really about Kinski or even Myers so much as the 21st-century cultural marketplace. As lapel-grabbing rants give way to downbeat musings, the book exerts a strange charm, ushering us behind the scenes of its own making. “I live freely,” Kinski boasts, unlike people “stuck in … dismal jobs”. Amid the keynote disaffection, you ultimately sense contentment, even joy, that he’s not the only one able to say so.Jesus Christ Kinski by Benjamin Myers is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).

This stop-motion adventure wants you to hold someone’s handBex April MayMon 20 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 05.02 EDTShareStop-motion adventure Out of Words was one of the most striking reveals at this year’s Summer Game Fest. While most games are built from code, Out of Words is made from clay, fabric, and glue: a love story literally crafted by hand that even caught the attention of Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima (“The biggest praise we could imagine,” game director Johan Oettinger says.)Oettinger dreamed of making a stop-motion video game since he was 12, when he first played 90s point-and-click claymation game The Neverhood. After years working across films, commercials and installation art, Out of Words became the project to merge these two lifelong passions.View image in fullscreenA handcrafted world … Out of Words.Photograph: Epic GamesThe process of bringing clay to life is as unusual as the game itself. The 40-strong studio in Aarhus, Denmark developed a pipeline of custom scanners and photogrammetry to bring handcrafted assets intoUnreal Engine, paired with stop-motion cutscenes that see animators move puppets 12 to 24 frames per second. “Something magical happens when real materials are formed to represent a character … [it] gives a sincerity that makes the character more real than any other form of storytelling,” Oettinger says.This means that the studio is as likely to be immersed in glue, wood and clay as it is in programming. “Yes – and we’re just as likely to be singing the best Disney songs than to be in the most focused silence,” game developer Mariano Pugliese says. “The same enthusiasm is shared between the puppet maker turning wood and iron into a character and the CG artist adjusting the sets in the game.”The story of Out of Words centres on Kurt and Karla, two young characters on the brink of first love. “I want to tell a story that meditates on the split second where you are looking for the right words to say to the one you are falling in love with, and this is of course almost impossible, especially if you are an early teen,” says Oettinger. “The split second becomes a whole inner journey of light and darkness … in our story this journey is shared between the two characters, the split second becomes their inner world of finding the right words and hopefully coming out on the other side of the game holding hands.”View image in fullscreenA cast made of clay … Out of Words.Photograph: Epic GamesOut of Words is a co-operative adventure controlled by two players, either in person or online, with the journey the game’s leads go on mirroring the players’ evolving relationship.“The co-operative play element is at the very core of the game design,” says design lead Jeff Sparks. “Players experience all the highs and lows together, guiding Kurt and Karla through a world full of unexpected challenges.” Trust is a key theme, while the co-op action has been designed to reflect the evolving bond between the characters.Even its strangest puzzles are built on emotion. One features a giant clay face, Sparks explains: “When Kurt and Karla walk on to his mouth, it twists and shifts around, almost like they’re tickling his lips … at its core it’s just an elaborate door, but with all the creativity and mechanics layered on to it, it comes alive in a way I’ve never seen before.”In the end, Out of Words isn’t aboutbosses, but the adventure of human personal connection. “You must treasure the immense adventure it is to express your love to someone for the first time,” Oettinger says. “The dream is that you experience this and it forges a deep connection between the two of you playing.”The ambitions are lofty: “We basically want you to remember this experience for the rest of your life.” And what could be more fitting for a game made by hand, than to be all about what happens when you finally reach out and take one?Out of Words is set for release on PC,PlayStation 5and Xbox in 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsIndie gamesPuzzle gamesAdventure gamesPCPlayStation 5XboxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a show based on recent history that’s simultaneously uncomfortable with its status as, in the wry words of one character, “heritage”. In telling the story of the pioneering 1980s Sheffield garage run by three female mechanics, Gwenda’s Garage celebrates these women while refusing to turn them into calcified historical figures.As the performers tell the audience, this is a half-remembered, incomplete version of the actual Gwenda’s Garage, with fictional characters in place of the real mechanics. The musical is as much about the female protagonists’ activism against the backdrop of Tory rule and the introduction of Section 28 as it is about the garage itself, with rousing songs such as We Had a Scam and Welcome to Sheffield creating an infectious atmosphere of collective feminist and queer protest.View image in fullscreenComplex relationship … Nancy Brabin Platt and Sia Kiwa in Gwenda's Garage at  Sheffield Playhouse.Photograph: Chris SaundersThe beating heart of the show is the relationship between co-workers Bev (Nancy Brabin Platt) and Terry (Sia Kiwa). While Bev wants to settle down and become a mother, Terry is – as she sings – a “family of one”, resistant to monogamy and uncompromising in her activism. Their experiences underline what’s at stake here, as Bev is threatened with the removal of her foster kids and Terry struggles with the doubled oppression of being Black and gay in an overwhelmingly white women’s movement. Both must grapple with when to stay quiet, when to compromise and when to speak out.Next to this complexity, other characters are lightly sketched. While performed with real warmth by Eva Scott, kind and capable garage boss Carol remains slightly under-explored; likewise charming but clueless trainee mechanic Dipstick (Lucy Mackay). The addition of curious outsider Feona (Georgina Coram) allows for exposition and some crowd-pleasing gags at the expense of Southerners, but her journey from customer to ally to fully fledged member of the sisterhood feels rushed and thin.Jelena Budimir’s buoyant production is rough around the edges in a way that suits the scrappy spirit of the garage. No straightforward history play, Gwenda’s Garage is an unruly and joyful story of making change, with its eyes as much on the present as the past.At Sheffield Playhouse until 25 October.

The Flash exhumed Michael Keaton’s Batman, but left him drifting through the end-of-days haze of a dying cinematic universe. Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine returned for one last hurrah inDeadpool & Wolverine, even though we already had his last hurrah in Logan. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness brought back Patrick Stewart’s Professor X for the umpteenth time, then promptly shredded him into psychic confetti.And then there was Spider-Man: No Way Home, a movie that mainly seemed to exist to remind us that the original Sony Spidey films were really rather good in places. Has there ever been a better cinematic Spider-Man villain than Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin? Did any of the Marvel films give us an antagonist with the same startling blend of pathos and menace as that delivered by Alfred Molina’s Doc Oc? And what about Tobey Maguire andAndrew Garfield, the two wall-crawlers we never thought we’d see again, who somehow turned a fan-service cameo into an elegy for the superhero genre itself?So buzzy was that crowd-pleasing film that it seemed as if the pair were destined to return, if not in continuing adventures within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then surely in episodes that followed on from their own brutally curtailed timelines in the Sam Raimi and Marc Webb films. But it’s now been the best part of four years since Maguire and Garfield became viral saints of multiverse sentimentality – digital messiahs for a genre already gasping for air beneath the weight of its own nostalgic excess.In the intervening period the duo have been treated like ghosts at the banquet, condemned to drift around the edges of Sony’s cinematic multiverse.Madame Web, Morbius and Kraven the Hunter were designed to make audiences forget about Spider-Man and embrace the brilliance of his supporting cast. They all failed.View image in fullscreenReady to come onboard? Tobey Maguire and  Kirsten Dunst in Spider-Man, 2002.Photograph: Moviestore/REX ShutterstockYet rumours have been swirling that Sony’sSpider-ManUniverse is dead in the water. The studio will play some part in the forthcoming Spider-Man: Brand New Day, but the Tom Holland films – technically joint productions – have always felt spiritually closer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Which leaves Sony out in the cold, condemned to release the occasional animated masterpiece about Miles Morales, while remaining absent from the live-action arena on the big screen.Which is where Maguire and Garfield really ought to come in. Sony may have until recently been far too deep into tales of clairvoyant web-weavers and tragically misunderstood bat scientists to admit audiences only care about Spider-Man. But surely in the absence of any viable alternative options, this stuff is at least worth a look?Maguire told Marvel.com in 2023that “it would be a ‘yes’” if he were ever asked to reprise the role, adding: “Because why wouldn’t I want to do that?” His co-star in the 00s films, Kirsten Dunst, waxed lyrical earlier this monthabout her fondnessfor the idea of returning as Mary Jane Watson, perhaps in a new episode that would see her as mother to Peter Parker’s children. This week, Garfield told fans hankering for The Amazing Spider-Man 3 that he doesn’t believe a new episode is ever going to be a thing,but added: “Sweet of you to want it to happen.”The sense is that if someone actually bothered to come up with a passable script, they would all come onboard. The reality is that the superhero movie landscape – and in particular, Sony’s increasingly small corner of it – has rarely looked more desperate for a hit, even as DC finally shows signs of life. Marvel’s once unshakeable formula now feels close to exhausted. Deadpool & Wolverine, which triumphed at the box office this summer, succeeded largely because it weaponised nostalgia with a wink and a body count.In that context, bringing back Maguire or Garfield wouldn’t just be another exercise in fan service, it might be the last trick the genre has left that anyone would actually cheer for. Yes, it would be shamelessly nostalgic, a web spun entirely from deja vu and dimensional crossovers, but Sony has learned the hard way that giving audiences what they never asked for – and would really rather have never witnessed – is not a smart move.The irony is that new Spider-Man films starring old Spider-Men may now be Sony’s best hope of wringing something worthwhile from the last strand of Spidey IP it still controls. Because even if the result ended up another multiversal tangle of familiar faces and recycled heartstrings, there remains a hankering for this kind of deluxe, limited-edition nostalgia loop – not least because we keep being told we can’t have it.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesSpider-ManTobey MaguireAndrew GarfieldSony PicturescommentShareReuse this content"

Our writer goes searching for signs of lifeMichael HannMon 20 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 13.09 EDTShareNo one can really say when rock’n’roll was invented. You could say March 1951, with the release of Rocket 88 by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats. Or maybe July 1954, whenElvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black stopped messing around between takes at Sun Studios and started hammering through That’s All Right, which became the future King’s first single.But the year rock’n’roll reallybecamerock’n’roll was 70 years ago, in 1955: the year Little Richard burst on to the world with Tutti Frutti; the year of the first riot at an Elvis show; the year of Blue Suede Shoes and Maybellene; the year of Bo Diddley singing his own praises. In the US, Rock Around the Clock by Bill Haley & His Comets was the biggest record that year. In the UK, its presence on the soundtrack of the teensploitation movie The Blackboard Jungle reportedly sent teddy boys into rampages of cinema-smashing.It’s just the same 20 bands doing the same 20 songs every week. They’re not bothered about innovationIn fact, 1955 was at the centre of such a huge pop-cultural moment that if you are over 40, you almost certainly grew up with rock’n’roll as a constant background in your life. In the 1970s, groups such as Stray Cats, Showaddywaddy, Matchbox and Darts were Top of the Pops regulars. Shakin’ Stevens was the biggest-selling singles artist of the 80s, and many other rock’n’roll revivalists had hits. Punks covered old rock’n’roll songs – and punk’s rock’n’roll mutation, psychobilly, was one of the biggest youth cults of the early 1980s. Even after that, contemporary hits such as George Michael’s Faith or Girls Aloud’s Love Machine made reference without descending into revivalism. KT Tunstall’s Black Horse and the Cherry Tree used the Bo Diddley “shave and a haircut, two bits” rhythm.But today, the genre is in danger of disappearing. “There’s nobody, apart from the offspring of existing rock’n’rollers, to take the place of the people who are dying off,” says John Hopkins, who edited UK Rock’n’Roll magazine until he was forced to close it earlier this year. He cites Rockers Reunion, in January, the first big rock’n’roll all-dayer of the year. “My reviewer made the point that everybody seems to be on sticks and Zimmers.”View image in fullscreenHuge pop-cultural moment … Bill Haley and Elvis Presley in 1955.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesIt’s not as though pre-Beatles pop has disappeared. Lana Del Rey has built a career on it.Laufey’s neo-bossa-nova and jazz-pop balladsare huge. Stephen Sanchez’s global hit Until I Found You might as well have been a lost recording from 1958. In the UK, George Ezra and Jake Bugg have borrowed from it, occasionally straying close to rockabilly, asEzra did on Cassy O’. And vintage soul, of course, pops up everywhere. But rock’n’roll, in the sense a teenager 70 years ago would have understood it? Not so much; certainly not in the UK. When you hear the words rock’n’roll these days, they tend to mean presenting as rough and ready, summoning not greased quiffs, but theme bars with tattooed bartenders and Guns N’ Roses on the jukebox.The only place the old rock’n’roll values still flourish, Hopkins says, is in what is referred to as the “fluffy” scene – in effect, cosplaying 1955. “But it’s just the same 20 bands doing the same 20 songs every week, and they’re not bothered about innovation. That’s a nice social event, but it’s not music.”How can this have happened to one of the most energetic, boundary-pushing styles of music in history? Observers say that, as the spotlight has gradually moved away, the rock’n’roll scene has hardened, and arguably cut itself off. “There are some strong rules in rock’n’roll and rockabilly about what you can and can’t do,” says Rupert Orton, guitarist with the Jim Jones Revue, who played an ultra-high-energy, punked-up variant on rock’n’roll in the 00s. “But in a very slow way, it metamorphoses.”View image in fullscreenOvertones of Elvis … Elliot James Reay.Photograph: Lorne Thomson/RedfernsOrton remains active behind the scenes – he books the annual Red Rooster festival, which gives due prominence to rock’n’roll – and makes the point that rock’n’roll, like so many enduring subcultures, has long been an overwhelmingly working-class pursuit. As a writer and editor, I know that means traditional media will have less interest in it. Also, the hardcore rock’n’roll scene seems to reject outside interest – I contacted the organisers of several rock’n’roll weekenders for this piece, and none replied. “They are very insular,” Hopkins agrees. “When I started on the magazine, I went down to an event and I felt like an alien. It was very difficult to get to know people.”To give an idea of how marginalised rock’n’roll in the UK now is, consider one of its brightest young sparks. Dylan Kirk, from Kent, is 25, and his band Dylan Kirk & the Killers are hotshots on the rock’n’roll circuit, playing weekenders and clubs. He plays between 30 and 40 shows a year. When we speak, he is looking for a new job to replace the one he has at a Wetherspoons. This is not a world where the big break is just around the corner.Kirk, inevitably, was introduced to rock’n’roll by his parents, then taught himself to play it on the piano. He even started playing because of them. “My dad was in the car one day and he said, ‘I’ve been in this pub that has a piano. We’re going to go down there now and you’re going to play it.’ I was too shy to sing, but that was the first time I played in front of anybody – just a little boogie-woogie.”And who are his audience? Are there any kids present? “The people I’m performing to now were part of the rock’n’roll revival of the 70s and 80s. But there are young people, too, down to teenagers. I think most of the youngsters do treat it as a lifestyle – it’s not about the music, it’s about the fashion.”View image in fullscreenCosta del song … the annual Rockin’ Race Jamboree in Torremolinos.Photograph: Jorge Guerrero/AFP/Getty ImagesNevertheless, there remains the unanswered question: even if there aren’t lots of young musicians playing rock’n’roll, why has it disappeared so thoroughly from pop’s recipe book? “That’s a question I ask myself,” Kirk says. “I do find it strange that I don’t hear it.”Perhaps rock’n’roll’s greatest problem, though, is that everyone thinks they know it, and that they can define it in one word: Elvis. Yes, people tend to know a few other songs – by Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis or Chuck Berry – but Elvis seems to be all they need. Witness the success ofBaz Luhrmann’s hyperstylised biopic, and the way the entrails of his life continue to be picked over. There’s no other musical genre quite so associated with a single figure, one who has been dead for 48 years, and who is still – by an extremely long way – the most commercially successful rock’n’roll performer of the present day.If the ageing of the fans is an issue for rock’n’roll, so too is the ageing of the music industry. For decades, record companies and recording studios were populated by people who had grown up with rock’n’roll, either as a formative experience or as a background noise. Now the producers who might have suggested a Bo Diddley backbeat or a twangy rockabilly guitar have retired, and the major label A&R people are more likely to be reliant on algorithms and data than personal taste.Outside the UK, rock’n’roll is still a big subculture. Orton highlights the annual Rockin’ Race Jamboree in Torremolinos, Spain, which attracts up to 30,000 people for five days of rock’n’roll, roots music and related activities (Kirk will be at next year’s). “It’s really quite incredible,” Orton says. “There were kids there who couldn’t have been older than late teens. They looked as if they’d just walked out of The Wild One.”View image in fullscreenThe US might yet save rock’n’roll … JD McPherson performs in Nashville last month.Photograph: Erika Goldring/Getty Images for Americana Music AssociationSweden, famously, has its raggare culture, venerating the 50s – there’s even the “rockabilly town” of Enviken, famed for its devotion to the past. Ask Spotify and it’ll serve you up a genuinely exciting playlist of Swedish rock’n’roll. But even there, apparently, it’s really only the kids of the revivalists who are continuing the traditions.Still, as well as having birthed it, the US might yet save rock’n’roll. JD McPherson, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, came through playing rock’n’roll, before widening his range to other older forms of US music. McPherson noticed his audience getting younger, especially since he released a Christmas album a few years back. And when he DJs, he notices the old rock’n’roll numbers he began playing at the end of the evening to clear the crowds have started filling the dancefloor. He believes rock’n’roll can return.‘I tried to be nice. Sometimes I would explode’: John Fogerty on Creedence, contracts and controlRead more“It has to be someone very good, who can utilise the rhythms and motifs of the music, but make it feel like right now.” And why might that happen? “It’s definitely happening with country music – with neo-traditional country,” he says, referring to artists such as Zach Top who are once again stripping country back to drums, bass, guitar, fiddle and pedal steel. And of course, lots of the country superstars – ones who are filling arenas in the UK now, such as Chris Stapleton – have strong seams of rock’n’roll in their music.McPherson says he’s “a little long in the tooth” to get to arena level himself. “But I do think at some point something will happen. It has to be something real and it has to be somebody who really loves it. And maybe it won’t be called rock’n’roll at all. But when it happens, it will happen accidentally.”Perhaps it could even come from the UK. Take the Bury-born, Elvis-indebted Elliot James Reay who, at 23, is earning millions of streams for his throwback tunes: he looks and dresses the part. The six songs he has released so far, once again, lean heavily towards pre-Beatles pop, rather than to true rock’n’roll – more Richard Hawley than Little Richard – but all it would take would be that one song, the one that’s more Hound Dog than Love Me Tender, and we’ll be there. After all, as Chuck Berry noted, rock’n’roll’s not hard: it’s got a backbeat, you can’t lose it, any old time you choose it.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockRockabillyElvis PresleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We meet the founder of the schemeOliver BascianoMon 20 Oct 2025 06.20 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 06.22 EDTShareOn a railing, not far fromTate Modern, is a lockbox. Enter a code and inside is a membership card to the museum, enabling free access to its temporary exhibitions. You get your ticket, you return the card.The Artist Membership Project, much to the ire of the city’s arts institutions, has been operating for three months with more than 600 members, mostly artists and recent graduates. Curator Ben Broome, who describes the guerrilla initiative as “part mutual aid project, part artwork”, estimates that those signed up have saved thousands of pounds in museum entry fees.“I work in the art world, I can generally beg, borrow, and steal a pass, or I know someone who works at the museum,” Broome says. “But I did a studio visit with an artist who had recently graduated and is still finding her footing in the industry and I asked if she had seenthe Ed Atkins show at Tate Britain. She replied that she’d have loved to have gone but it cost £18 and simply couldn’t afford that.”A 2024 study found that the median annual salary of artists in the UK was just £12,500 a year, a 40% decrease since 2010.Broome went away from the studio visit with a plan forming. He would email a dozen friends who run commercial art galleries and ask them to donate £100. He would then invest the money in membership cards to nine institutions, including the Tates Modern and Britain, the Courtauld Gallery, the National Gallery andNational Portrait Gallery. These would be hidden in lockboxes, the location and code to which are provided over a WhatsApp group.“It’s a little bit clandestine, it’s a little bit punk. There’s a sprinkling of low-level anarchy to the project,” Broome says. “That’s why people have responded so well to it, because it does feel somewhat divisive or uncouth. And I think we need a bit of that.”View image in fullscreenProvocation … another Artist Membership Project card is shared.Photograph: Jay IzzardBroome adds: “I understand why these institutions have to charge for these shows, they cost thousands to stage. I just think that the act of charging artists is alienating the very audience that makes these institutions great in the first place.”The curator cites the example of MoMA in New York, which offers a heavily subsidised artists’ membership scheme. Artists simply have to show some evidence of their practice at the museum’s information desk, be it a website or their social media.There seems an appetite for a similar concessionary rate in the UK, as within days the WhatsApp group had blown up and the cards were being used several times a day. A spokesperson for Tate said: “Unlike many museums abroad, the UK’s national museums are free to all, including to artists … This is only possible because of the support of our members and the income generated by our exhibitions.”Representatives of the Royal Academy and the V&A also noted that temporary shows were a major source of income. The terms and conditions of all the membership programmes involuntarily included in Broome’s scheme expressly forbid the sharing of cards. All the institutions pointed out they operate free entry days, occasional pay-what-you-can events and reduced prices for under-25s or those on benefits.Broome says he understands the financial constraints on museums and that they do what they can. “Being the director of a major museum in London is no easy task, but I think we can separate the dire situation of the public-sector art world and the fact that artists can’t afford to see exhibitions. They are intertwined, both of these things are rooted in governmental failures. That being said, the audience who are using the membership scheme, they’re just not coming to your institution anyway. So it’s better to get those people through the door.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gilane Tawadros, director of theWhitechapel Galleryin London told the Guardian: “I wasn’t personally aware of this scheme, but many of our staff are also practising artists, so I would imagine they are. I fully understand the need for artists to share resources as ticket prices for exhibitions are often prohibitively expensive and being able to go and see work is vital. I think it would be great for arts institutions to consider as many ways as possible to support and nurture our artist communities.”Earlier this month theBarbicancancelled Broome’s membership card, citing “suspicious activity”. He crowdfunded for a replacement under a new name which was promptly also cancelled. Now however a spokesperson says the gallery will reach out to him to “explore options”.“The idea behind this project was not to create an infrastructure from which people could access free exhibitions indefinitely,” the curator says. “It was always destined to fail in that. Some of the cards have got so soggy from being out in the elements that they’re practically unusable, one of the lockboxes has seized up. It was designed to show the precarity of artists and that there is a need for an alternative model – which I think it has done.”Explore more on these topicsArtArts fundingMuseumsTate BritainTate ModernBarbicanNational GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mendonça calls Bolsonaro’s conviction a sign that justice has prevailed.“And I do hope he goes to jail,” he adds, rejecting rightwing calls for Bolsonaro’s sins to be forgiven and forgottenthrough a pardon. “[We came] very close to … the collapse of society. [There can be] no amnesty. It’s all very clear, I think,” says the film-maker, citing “overwhelmingly shocking” evidence of Bolsonaro’s guilt.View image in fullscreenThe Secret Agent is set during Brazil’s military dictatorship in the 1970s.Photograph: handoutRemembering is at the heart of Mendonça’s new film, The Secret Agent, agripping political thrillerset in 1977, the 13th year of Brazil’s brutal two-decade military dictatorship and also the year Bolsonaro graduated from the Agulhas Negras military academy, a South American West Point, before starting his improbable march towards the presidency.The film, which earned Mendonça the best director award at this year’s Cannes film festival and has beencalled a masterpiece, tells the story of Armando, a good-natured academic who is forced into hiding after clashing with a reptilian regime official who orders his murder.The professor, played by the Civil War star Wagner Moura, finds shelter in a safe house for dissidents and social outcasts in Recife, the north-eastern city where Mendonça grew up.Mendonça, 56, set out to make a period thriller rather than a classic dictatorship movie about “young guerrilla fighters robbing a bank to fund actions against the dictatorship”.But when friends watched the electrifying movie, reactions suggested he had made a film infused with recent history, which “was actually about the last few years living in Brazil” under Bolsonaro, a paratrooper before he became a politician, who openly pined for a return to military rule.View image in fullscreenArmando, third from left, is played by Wagner Moura in the film.Photograph: CinemascopioWhen Bolsonaro took office in 2019 and began packing his administration with military men and reviving the violent, illiberal rhetoric of the 1964-85 dictatorship, it felt like “an exercise in fetishism with a long-lost Brazil” from half a century earlier, Mendonça says.Bolsonaro’spersecution of the artsharked back to the military period when cherished cultural figures fled overseas. Bolsonaro’s closure of the culture ministry – now reversed by Lula – “was one of the biggest attacks against the country I’ve ever seen,” Mendonça says.“It’s proof he doesn’t understand the country at all – and it felt so, so aggressive. That was something I just found awful – such an act of violence,” says the film-maker, who spent part of his adolescence at school in Essex in the early 80s, travelling into London to watch films in Leicester Square. (The Secret Agent features two hat tips to the anglophile director’s fondness for the UK: a cameo from the British consul to Rio, Anjoum Noorani, and a reference to the University of Leeds.)Bolsonaro’s days in power now appear over, with the disgraced 70-year-old expected to start serving his sentence next month – the same time as The Secret Agent goes on general release in Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unlike Argentina and Chile, Brazil has largely allowed military officials toescape punishmentfor the bloodshed they caused.Brazil’s Bolsonaro was convicted but the military appetite for a coup lingersRead more“It seems to be the way the Brazilian psyche operates,” Mendonça says, remembering the 1979 amnesty law that let human rights violators off the hook for dictatorship-era crimes.“Maybe it made sense at the time. But looking back now … I don’t think it was a good idea … It’s almost like the default behaviour [in Brazil] is amnesty: ‘Serial killer kills 87’. ‘Oh, he had a mother … He has two kids. Let’s go easy on him!’.”In The Secret Agent’s final scene, a researcher from the present hands a memory stick to the runaway academic’s son containing devastating details of his father’s plight. “You can see panic in the son’s face,” Mendonça says. “You know, [it’s like]: ‘Get this thing out of here because I can’t deal with this. I’ve been taught not to deal with this.’”The Secret Agentwill be screenedat next month’s Leeds film festival and released in the UK in February 2026.Explore more on these topicsFilmBrazilJair BolsonaroLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how life changes when we become wholeWhen I was younger, I valued my body only for what it could do for me. A quick jog was enough to make me see where I’d been going wrongMoya SarnerMon 20 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareIhave just got back from a run. I am shocked to write those words. I think it might have been a decade since my last. But I recently discovered that I have slightly high cholesterol, and I’ve been advised to do sweaty exercise regularly.This is the first time in my life that my motivation to exercise has been my physical health. In my youth, I ran because I wanted to be thinner. I’ve also run to cure my anxiety (and written about it– I was just running away from the anxiety, not addressing it). At other times, I ran because I wanted to get better at running. This was what it meant to me then to build a better life.Running for a different reason now got me thinking about the ways I’ve related to my body over my lifetime and how this is changing as I transition from being a young person to being a middle-aged person. I don’t think I’ve respected my body, not deep down. I’ve valued it only for its functions and the purposes it served me: trying to attract others; avoiding feelings; running a faster (or, rather, a slightly less slow) 5km. Until today, I’ve not understood that my body is me, it is my life, rather than something that produces results.The unconscious uses the body to express some pain or rage or whatever emotion the mind cannot tolerateA lot has been written over the centuries about the split (or not) between body and mind – which, you will be relieved to know, I’m not going to precis here. What I’ve found most compelling is Freud’s understanding that mind and body are developmentally integrated right from the start, because physical development demands psychological development and vice versa. The infant’s bodily experiences – such as the physical sensation of hunger – propel the mind to develop the capacity to recognise hunger as a feeling that can be sated by a feed; and the emotional comfort and satisfaction repeatedly brought by feed after feed nourishes the child’s mind just as the milk nourishes them physically. So too psychological experiences – such as the desire to stand up and reach for something, and the determination to try again and again – are why and how muscles grow stronger. From our earliest moments, our body and mind are intertwined in mutual development as integrated as a double helix.But I have noticed, in treatment with my psychoanalyst, that my mind and body can be in a different kind of relationship – one less integrated and more exploitative. My mind can use my body to store and express things that my mind deems unwanted or unacceptable. In my sessions we’ve become aware of how there are particular emotional states that I fear I cannot bear; instead of feeling these in my mind, I unconsciously push them into my body, where they get stuck as physical symptoms.I used to get this with indigestion – which had nothing to do with what I’d eaten, but was a kind of physical reflux of the more acidic feelings I couldn’t digest in my mind. This was not a conscious choice, but when it was brought into my consciousness by my analyst, and my fear and vulnerability and anger and panic could be felt and put into words instead of transformed into physical sensation, it resolved. I rarely suffer from indigestion now.The worst time I had this terrible acid reflux, I didn’t sleep for several nights in a row. I felt I was losing my mind. I went to the GP, who organised all sorts of scans and tests, but there was nothing physically wrong. It was another doctor who told me that the cause might be psychological. My analyst did not disagree. I was shocked, but I also knew it to be true.You can’t just press ‘undo’ on your life. To move forward, you must first feel your grief and rageRead moreWhen a patient is suffering a physical symptom, they can be offended at the suggestion that it may have a psychological cause. They can experience this as being disrespected, hearing that their illness isn’t real or they’re making it up. And of course that does happen – people can have their pain dismissed or misdiagnosed. But in some cases it could be that the physical symptoms are real – no question – and the cause is psychological, the unconscious using the body to express some pain or rage or whatever emotion the mind cannot tolerate. At times, we might assume our experience only has value, can only be real, when it is expressed in physical form. We continually disrespect our minds as individuals, as a society and as a culture; why else would we tolerate the appalling killing-off of psychodynamic psychotherapy on the NHS?My experiences have taught me that a better life cannot be built when we are stuck unawares in ways of relating, within ourselves and with others, that are rooted in disrespect, exploitation and transaction. These dynamics are often easier to identify “out there” in wider society. It’s perhaps less comfortable to think about how they got out there, and to recognise these shapes within ourselves and within our closest relationships, in the economy of our minds.But it’s worth persevering. When I put my running shoes back on after such a long decade, heading out not to get a better body, or to get rid of a feeling, or to beat a 5km time, it felt quite different. Straightforward, less pressurised, more hopeful. I felt grounded in my awareness of my age and in wanting to look after this one precious life of mine. And when I got back and felt the ache in my muscles and the sweat on my face, I thought, I’d better write a column about this before I miss my chance – because it may well be another decade before I do that again.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Growing up in Wales in the 90s, I rejected almost all of it. Being Asian felt like a marker of otherness, and when your teenage mission is fitting in, a celebration of being Indian wasn’t all that appealing. So I joined in half-heartedly, but longed for the escape hatch of a sweaty metal gig with my friends where identity didn’t feel quite so loaded.It’s only now, as an adult, that I’ve reclaimed Diwali. I still light candles, phone family, and do the ritual house clean, but I’ve also developed my own hybrid: a Diwali meets Halloween brunch with friends (Indian food with gruesome-looking cupcakes on the same table is a questionable vibe, but somehow it works).The overlap isn’t as odd as it sounds: both festivals are obsessed with light triumphing over dark. Diwali looks ahead to prosperity; Halloween, via its pagan ancestor Samhain, is a reminder that the harvest is over and winter is about to ruin everyone’s mood.Beyond sweetsTraditionally, Diwali gifting involves sweets – glorious, jewel-bright boxes of ladoos, barfi, jalebi. But these days, it has shifted to the personal; things you’ll actually use, wear, or remember. Putting togethera Diwali gift guidefor the Filter was a joy, because it meant spotlighting south Asian brands that don’t get enough love.TakeRanavat, a beauty line that fuses Ayurvedic rituals with modern formulations. TheRoyal Trio bestsellers kitis an elegant way into the range, and I’ve used it since its launch. Then there’sApsley & Heron’s name necklaces, which means you can wear your name in scripts from Hindi and Punjabi to my own language, Tamil. It’s a small thing, but quietly radical: finally seeing your name rendered as it should be.Increasingly I’ve seen more and more brands offer Diwali-themed gifts, a nice idea, but one that raises the question: when does celebration tip into commercialism? The answer usually lies in intent. The best versions give back: donating to south Asian charities, spotlighting south Asian creatives, or, at the very least, producing something that feels rooted in the culture rather than a cynical cash-grab.For me, Diwali will always be about positivity and connection.

The difference between shop-bought and homemade gnocchi is vast, especially the vac-packed, long-life kind, which are dense and can be heavy. Freshly made gnocchi, with fluffy baked potatoes, however, are light as air, pillowy and silky. If that sounds intimidating, let me reassure you that this recipe is really forgiving, and much easier than making fresh sheet pasta. I love them served simply, as here, with a slightly nutty sage butter andlotsof parmesan. The simple sauce lets those gnocchi sing.Parmesan and sage jacket potato gnocchiPrep10 minCook30 min+Serves42 leftover cooked baked potatoes, or 2 baking potatoes (about 550g)2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing1 large eggSea salt andblack pepper100g flour, plus extra for dustingNutmeg40g unsalted butter, cut into cubes2big sprigs fresh sage, leaves picked1 garlic clove, smashed in its skin30g parmesan, finely grated½ lemonIf you’re baking the potatoes, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, put in a small tray and rub all over with a little olive oil. Bake for about an hour to an hour and 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender all the way through. (If you’re using leftover cooked jacket potatoes, put them in a bowl and pop in the microwave to reheat.) When the potatoes are still warm but cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and press the flesh through a potato ricer and into a medium bowl (or mash by hand). You will need 275g mashed potato.Make a well in the middle, crack in the egg, season well and beat with a fork. Sift in 90g of the flour and finely grate in a few scratchings of nutmeg, then knead, adding the extra flour if the mix feels sticky. You want a smooth dough, but don’t overwork it.Turn out the gnocchi mix on to a lightly floured surface, divide in two and roll into long sausages. Cut the dough into 2½-3cm-long pieces, then arrange on a floured tray. Press a fork into the tops to give the gnocchi lines and extra surface area, if you wish.To cook the gnocchi, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Put the butter, olive oil, sage and smashed garlic in a large frying pan on a medium heat, and fry until the butter starts to turn lightly golden and nutty and the leaves go crisp. Take off the heat.Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface – that’s when you know they are ready. Using a spider or slotted spoon, lift the cooked gnocchi into the butter pan, along with a little of their cooking water, and toss with half the grated parmesan and a squeeze of lemon until they’re all coated in the glossy, buttery sauce (add more of the cooking water as needed).Serve topped with the extra grated parmesan and more black pepper.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyPotatoesVegetablesItalian food and drinkCheeseHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Food assistant: Lucy Ellwood.Indian food and drinkKaran Gokani’s sweet treats for Diwali – recipesThese ladoos are sweet, nutty morsels of dough perfect for sharing, while a quick Indian take on a bread pudding should be an instant hitKaran GokaniMon 20 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareDiwali is often called the festival of lights, a celebration of good over evil. It’s the most widely marked festival in India and feels a bit like Christmas does in the west. It’s synonymous with fireworks, bright colours, endless parties and tables creaking under the sheer weight of food and desserts. NoDiwaliis complete without boxes of sweets (mithai) and dried fruit exchanged between friends and family. In the UK, we keep those traditions alive, dressing up, visiting temples, reading Indian mythology to the kids and, most importantly, gathering with friends from every background and religion. For me, Diwali is about togetherness and sharing food that feels special, but doesn’t keep you in the kitchen for hours. The bread pudding is my take on the indulgentshahi tukda, while the ladoos are perfect to gift or to enjoy with a cup of chai after the feast.Easy ladoos (pictured top)Ladoosare one of the most iconic Indian sweets, right up there withgulab jamunsandjalebis. Picture an Indianhalwai’s shop overflowing with sweets of every shape, colour and size, all expertly crafted and generously laden with ghee. Ladoos often take centre stage, making them a popular choice of gift during auspicious occasions or for offering to Hindu deities at temples. This version is one of the simplest, requiring just a handful of ingredients, and can be prepared in minutes.Prep10 minCook50 min plus coolingMakes15-20110g ghee250g gram flour¼ tsp ground green cardamom1 pinch saffron(optional)50g mixed almonds and pistachios, toasted and roughly chopped180-200g granulated sugar, to tasteMelt the ghee in a nonstick pan on a medium heat. Turn down the heat, add the gram flour and cook, stirring constantly to combine it with the melted ghee and to make sure it doesn’t catch and burn. Keep cooking and stirring for 30-35 minutes. To begin with, the mix will resemble wet sand, but as you continue cooking and stirring, it will turn to a peanut butter consistency and smell wonderfully nutty. Don’t try to rush things, or leave the mix unattended, because it can burn very easily, and the slow roast is essential to the characteristic, nutty flavour of the ladoos.Take the pan off the heat, stir in the cardamom and saffron, if using, then leave to cool until just warm to the touch.Add the nuts and sugar to the cooled ladoo mixture, mix thoroughly, then tear off small chunks and roll between your palms into 15-20 x 4cm balls. Put these on a plate spaced slightly apart and leave to cool to room temperature.You can now serve the ladoos immediately, or store them in an airtight container and keep at room temperature for up to a week.Indian bread puddingView image in fullscreenKaran Gokani’s Indian bread pudding.Photograph: Kim Lightbody/The Guardian. Food styling: Tamara Vos. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food assistant: Lucy Ellwood.This takes inspiration from Hyderabad’sshahi tukda, a dish that’s typically made by frying bread in ghee, then soaking it in a thick, richrabdi, which is created by simmering full-fat milk for hours until it reduces to a fraction of its original volume. My version is a healthier, easier and quicker alternative that requires a lot less tending to and lets the oven do all the heavy lifting.Prep10 minCook1 hr+Serves4-612 slicesstale white bread, crusts removed100g ghee, or melted butter1 litre whole milk1 x 397g tincondensed milk150g sugar, or to taste1 pinch saffron, soaked in 2 tbsp milk¼ tsp ground cardamom, or the seeds from 2 pods, crushed¼ tsp ground nutmeg(optional)40g almonds, roughly chopped40g raisinsCut the bread into triangles, spread all but a teaspoon of the ghee over both sides of each piece, then arrange the triangles as they fall in a greased, roughly 20cm x 30cm, rectangular baking dish.In a large bowl, whisk the milk, condensed milk and sugar until the sugar dissolves, then stir in the saffron and its soaking milk, the cardamom and nutmeg, if using. Pour the milk mixture evenly over the bread in the dish, so it all gets soaked, then leave to steep for 10-15 minutes. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.Bake the pudding for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.Meanwhile, melt the remaining ghee in a small pan on a medium heat, then fry the almonds until golden. Turn off the heat, add the raisins and leave them to cook in the residual heat, stirring constantly, for a minute. Sprinkle the nut and raisin mix over the pudding and serve warm or chilled, just as it is or with a scoop of vanilla ice-creamThese recipes are edited extracts from Indian 101: Real Indian Recipes Made Simple, by Karan Gokani, published by Bluebird at £28.

The hotel manager called me at 10pm to ask if I still needed it. I confirmed I was arriving within the hour.When I reached reception, I was informed that my room was overbooked. Five other prepaid guests, including four young women, were told the same.I was rebooked into a Travelodge at a service station 21 miles away. I was forced to take a cab and arrived at the remote location at 2am to find the place deserted and the hotel locked. It took a long time for the hotel’s entry phone to be answered and for me to be let in.The next morning, I had to rebook my train home from Swindon instead of Oxford. Travelodge’s response was that overbooking is rare, which from online chat forums is clearly not the case.I had to spend time sending receipts to recover my £63 cab and train costs, and was refunded the £118 cost of the room, but I have been offered no compensationfor the distress.MAG,LondonYou had chosen the Oxford hotel because it was handy for an evening event you were attending.Not only did you suffer the anxiety of being a lone woman in a remote location on a bypass miles from where you wanted to be, you also lost three hours of your night because of Travelodge’s behaviour.It is nonsensical that the manager did not inform you of the overbooking when he called you an hour before you tried to check in.Travelodge told me its terms and conditions warn guests that they may occasionally have to be moved to a different hotel, but it said its policy is not to relocate lone women.So why were you forced out?The reason mysteriously changed when I questioned the company. Now Travelodge claims that a “maintenance issue”, rather than overbooking, rendered your room uninhabitable. Why were you not told this when the manager called and when you arrived at reception? Travelodge ignored that question.It did, however, belatedly recognise the distress you had suffered, and offered you a voucher for a one-night stay – so you get to chance another of its establishments.JFfrom Leeds had a near-identical experience when he tried to check into the Travelodge he had booked in Cardiff city centre. He says he, and five other guests, were told that a number of rooms had been “trashed” by previous guests and they would have to wait to be relocated.“We felt we were being lied to and believe the rooms had been overbooked,” he writes. “Housekeeping would have been aware that morning that the rooms were not fit for use.”Like MAG, he was eventually sent to another Travelodge – at an M4 service station 12 miles away in Pontyclun. Unlike MAG, he was not given a refund.Again, the excuse changed when I questioned Travelodge. This time, it claimed that a “maintenance issue”, caused by a water leak, had taken out three rooms. It apologised for any misunderstanding of the word “trashed” and for not letting JF know earlier. It has now, belatedly, apologised and given him a full refund and a voucher.MAG and JF were luckier than they knew. The Travelodge customerTAof London spent the small hours on a Brighton street, along with the rest of the hotel guests, because staff were unable to turn off a fire alarm. He had checked into his £227 room at midnight after a family funeral.Four hours later, guests were evacuated when the fire alarm sounded. “Most were still in pyjamas or underwear,” he wrote. “After half an hour, the manager told us it was a false alarm but that no one could work out how to turn it off, so we’d have to wait outside for a technician to come.“After a further hour, some guests sat on the beach with towels. Others sheltered in reception, though the alarm was so piercingly loud that one teenager began to be sick.”After two and a half hours, TA retrieved his bags and got a dawn train home. He had had less than four hours in his bed. His request for a refund for the ruined night elicited a £60 “token of apology”.After his further complaints, Travelodge stumped up the additional £11.99 he had paid for the breakfast he never had, and declared its magnanimity “a fair resolution”.TA escalated his complaint and was eventually awarded another £49, which still left him out of pocket for those four hours of accommodation.He was eventually refunded and given that predictable voucher against a future stay when I intervened.“At Travelodge, the safety and wellbeing of our customers is always our number one priority,” Travelodge says, refusing to say whether other affected guests would be repaid.Explore more on these topicsMoneyConsumer championsConsumer affairsConsumer rightsHotelsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

New people and new places are what keep me aliveGetting older hasn’t dimmed my love of travel. In my 70s, it’s still all about my next trip, be it a cruise, Goa … or a naturist resort in CreteElaine KingettMon 20 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareImay be 76, but slowing down, or retirement, couldn’t be further from my mind. True, I don’t have a hefty pension or a partner to while away the rest of my days with, but my love of travelling is as passionate as it has always been.I love scaring myself stupid trying new experiences, and if a friend or daughter is unavailable I’ll go alone. Solo travel is far better than sitting at home looking back instead of forward.So, when I was offered the chance to try a naturist holiday in southern Crete in July, rather than, “OMG, naked in front of strangers!”, my first thought was, “No hold luggage!” The idea of baring all at a resort full of people I didn’t know seemed exciting rather than terrifying.View image in fullscreenElaine on the beach in Saint Kitts in the CaribbeanI hitched a lift toVritomartis naturist resortfrom my accommodation in the village nearby. It was only when I bumped into a smiling, naked, rather portly male guest in flip-flops and a baseball hat outside reception that I realised exactly what I had signed up for. I was the only woman on her own among 180 couples. It felt surprisingly liberating, and I left feeling proud of every part of my ageing body for the first time in years.Travel has always been in my blood. As a child, growing up in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with a garden overlooking the A30, I was enchanted by the huge, thundering Scania lorries with beds curtained off in the back, and dreamed of life as a long-distance driver. An escape to Cornwall on a boyfriend’s Vespa at 17 lit a flame inside me that burns to this day. After my husband died 25 years ago, and a relationship breakup years later, I still kept my passion for travel – and I refuse to let it diminish as I get older.An escape to Cornwall on a boyfriend’s Vespa at 17 lit a flame inside me that burns to this dayAt a friend’s invitation, when I was 62 I went on my first trip to India, zooming around Delhi in a tuk-tuk. Then it was on to Nepal to stay in a monastery in Kathmandu and Pokhara to watch the sun rise over Annapurna.In 2020, at 70, tired of London after 10 years – and with no partner, pet or grandchild at that time, and in the midst of Covid – I needed a new challenge. So I sold my flat and moved to Seville. For three years I lived alone in a rented, furnished flat, learning to live like a local and navigate a city I had fallen in love with.View image in fullscreenThe writer at the Red Fort in Delhi on her first trip to India, aged 62During that time I devoured Spain: I went on a yoga holiday in Galicia, a detox vegan retreat in Formentera, discovered Málaga was more arts and museums than gold chains and bare chests, and wept at the beauty of the paintings of Sorolla at his house in Madrid. I took regular day trips by train to Cádiz to laze on a lounger at a beach bar, eat fried fish for lunch and drink small beers at €1.50 a pop.Now I’m back in the UK, in Brighton, but I worry more about standing still, of missed opportunities and of not evolving – and the travel bug remains strong.One thing I have noticed, looking back through my diaries and notebooks, is how packing lists have changed as I’ve got older. Holidays with my husband and three kids by car to the West Country in our seven-seater Volvo listed travel cot, beach toys, beach tent and indispensable kitchen paraphernalia. For fashion sales trips to Paris I drew stick figures on Post-it notes of successful outfits (successful in those days meaning pulling-power). Trekking in the Jebel Sahro in Morocco was head torch, Shewee – and did I really only use Factor 15? These days it’s five different heart drugs, Pepto-Bismol, big earrings, Bluetooth headphones, hearing aid batteries and compression socks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Holiday Camp in the 1950s.Photograph: Courtesy Elaine KingettI never take my age into consideration when planning a trip. In fact, if anything the awareness of my mortality has only served to heighten my desire to get out and push myself further out of my comfort zone (though with a history of a heart attack and breast cancer, travel insurance at my age is costly).It’s only in the way that others respond that I realise they see an old lady. When a guy of 50-plus offers to help me put my case into the overhead locker, “because my own mum used to struggle”. When I stand on the aircraft steps waiting for the bus to take me to the terminal and the cabin staff ask if I requested assistance. I fancied a horse riding holiday with my 40-year-old son, but the company I approached reminded me that, yes, I could have a very nasty fall indeed “at my age”. So many friends say I’m so brave to continue to travel, to try new experiences, but meeting new people in new places is what keeps me alive, what keeps my brain engaged far better than crosswords or Wordle.Many women I know feel awkward eating alone in the evening. A notebook and pen help me settle far easier than scrolling on a phoneI’ve had wonderful solo holidays recently, too, doing stuff I’ve never done before. In December, I went on my first cruise. The packing list for this luxury extravaganza in the Caribbean was also a first, including advice on dressing for supper: “ladies should wear cocktail or dinner attire”. Neither of which I owned, both of which I borrowed. Being one of the few solo female travellers on board, I got the usual comments when sitting down to eat: “Just for one?”, “Are you waiting for someone?”, “Will someone be joining you?”. And, yes, I would have perhaps relaxed more and had more fun if I’d been with my daughter or a friend. Perhaps I would have stayed up later and gone to the bars or clubs and even danced and I would have had more than one glass of whatever, because I don’t think a tipsy woman on her own is a good look at any age.View image in fullscreenHiking in Andalucía, southern Spain, where Elaine moved at 70One thing I never feel as an older female traveller, though, is invisible or anonymous. A friend said recently that it’s a relief not to be approached by guys, not to be chatted-up any more. Admittedly, I no longer get on a plane or train hoping I will be seated next to a future partner – I just hope they don’t snore or smell weird – but the idea of a romantic encounter is not completely edited out of my future plans either.My travel considerations as an older woman have many similarities with women of any age. Many women I know feel more awkward eating alone in a restaurant or bar in the evening than at lunchtime. I find a notebook and pen help me settle far easier than constantly scrolling on a phone.Having lived in big cities means I am rarely frightened walking around after dark and it has taught me survival rules, such as putting my phone away in the street. Google apps make travel much easier as well these days. Translate is a godsend when you’re at Crete airport at midnight and trying to explain to the taxi driver that you want to go right across the island, please. And Google Maps was a tremendous help when I was navigating a transfer in mainland Greece from Volos bus station in Pelion to Thessaloniki airport – and feeling very much like a solo Race Across the World contestant.So, the clock is ticking and the grey autumn skies have arrived in Brighton – where shall I go next? This winter maybe I should spend a month at thatBone and Body Clinic in Goathat a friend suggested may sort out the osteoarthritis in my knees and hips? Or what about Taiwan? Never been to south-east Asia, heard it’s delicious. But one thing you will never get me doing is wild swimming in cold water: I’ll leave that to folk far braver than me.Elaine Kingett is a writer and journalist who runswriting retreats in SpainExplore more on these topicsTravelling soloAdventure travelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He discusses the harsh realities of modern working life in China, and far beyondMon 20 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 05.04 EDTShareHu Anyan is not a fan of online shopping, but, as he discovered during the months he spent as a courier in Beijing, plenty of people are. Not long into the job, he was assigned to delivering parcels to a large construction site. He didn’t have to deliver that many – 10 to 20, most days – but getting them to their rightful owners wasn’t always easy. There was a crane driver who was often in the air when Hu arrived. He would ask him to come again the next day, only to be found in the sky again.“In the end,” Hu writes in his memoir, I Deliver Parcels in Beijing – which is being published in English for the first time this month – “it would take several trips” to deliver this man his parcel. “But this didn’t dampen his passion for online shopping.” As a courier, Hu had to work to an exacting schedule, making a delivery every four minutes so as not to run at a loss. Couriers were paid 1.6 yuan, the equivalent of 17p, for every parcel they delivered, but the task was much more involved than that of couriers in the UK. He sometimes had to wait while people tried things on and then repackaged rejected items on the spot. Plus, he had to pay compensation for every parcel that went missing.No matter what job I did, I didn’t achieve anything and I couldn’t do it for long. Then I kept covering up the painHe soon worked out that “if a minute was worth 0.5 yuan, then the cost of urination was 1 yuan”. Eating lunch, he calculated, needed 20 minutes, which would cost 10 yuan. “Basically, I skipped a lot of lunches,” he recalls in his memoir. “I also hardly drank any water in the mornings to reduce the frequency of restroom breaks.” Over a video call from his apartment in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in south-westChina, Hu elaborates: “No matter what job I did, I didn’t achieve anything and I couldn’t do it for long. Then I kept covering up the pain, which made me worry about my own self-worth.”The memoir, which was first published in China in April 2023 and quickly became a national bestseller, charts Hu’s stint as a courier from March 2018 until November 2019, but it also lifts the lid on the overwork and financial precarity that underpinned the innumerable other jobs he has done throughout his adult life. Still only 47, he has had 19 jobs across 20 years, all over the country – though the tally is higher still if you count the even more informal gigs he did in between.View image in fullscreenIn Guangdong, Hu unpacked and packed parcels from seven in the evening until seven in the morning.Photograph: Comezora/Getty ImagesHu has sold bicycles in Shanghai, working China’s common 996 shift pattern – from nine in the morning to nine at night, six days a week – though the shop often closed later (monthly salary: 3,000 yuan; £313). He has worked the night shift in a logistics factory in Guangdong, in southern China, unpacking and packing parcels from seven in the evening until seven in the morning, with a half-hour break for dinner. Baking in the heat, he would drink three litres of water each shift – but he sweated so much that he never once needed to pee (top performers were paid 5,000 yuan a month; £522). He has been an apprentice at a bakery and at a comic book publisher. He has run a women’s clothing store at a mall in the southern city of Nanning, and a deli in a remote, rural town in Yunnan. He has been a gas station attendant, a graphic designer and an ice lolly wholesaler. He has worked at companies making 3D architectural renderings, rear-view car cameras and business cards. He has been in “property management” at a mall in Dali City, also in Yunnan province – “which is”, he says, “another way of saying I was a security guard”.The ordinary details of these jobs – their gruelling demands, the petty bureaucracy, the brief moments of humanity amid the overwhelming pressure – are narrated in unadorned, sincere prose, which is perhaps why the book earned such praise upon publication in China. Its unsparing depiction of the realities of life in the gig economy sparked debate about contemporary work culture.The interest in his book came in different waves and forms, Hu says. First, there were readers interested in the lives of workers who they saw everywhere but who were rarely given a voice: night shift staff, storekeepers and couriers. But then, as word of mouth spread, people beyond these silenced workers began to see their own doubts and confusion about the working world reflected in Hu’s writing.Has his book led to calls to improve working conditions for gig workers? That’s a complex issue beyond the power of an ordinary reader in China, Hu says, and a matter for the government and industry. But he does say that, after reading the book: “Many readers say they will be more tolerant, patient and understanding towards couriers. They will no longer be so demanding or strict.”To read his memoir is to get a sense of the vast transformation that has taken place in China in the past century. Born in 1979, Hu grew up in Guangzhou, a major city in south China. His parents’ formative years were during Maoist China: his mother was sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution, and his father joined the People’s Liberation army at 16. They would later work, as was customary then, in the same workplaces their whole lives. The itinerant life of their son, and millions of others like him – hopping from one insecure gig to another – was incomprehensible to them.View image in fullscreenA bus driver in Guangzhou.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesGrowing up, Hu “had no idea” what he would do later on. He studied home appliance repair at his vocational secondary school, and later got a degree in advertising design at night school. Last time he checked, only one person out of about 40 in his secondary school cohort wound up working in appliance repair. The others got whatever they could through personal connections after graduation in 1999: “Some people sold seafood; some drove long-distance buses.”“In China, it is very common for people to take 20 to 30 jobs within 20 years,” he says, referring in particular to those who do the kind of work “that has no room for advancement, no professional skills required”. In this precarious life, it’s easy to quit, and easy to find something new. In Hu’s own experience, most of his jobs came to an end when he got burnt out, frustrated or bored – the riches that were promised didn’t materialise and the grind became too much.He enjoyed his apprenticeship at the bakery and assisting at the bike shop the most: “You learn new things and master new knowledge. You feel you are gaining growth and progress.” In comparison, as a courier: “You deliver a package on your first day of work, and you deliver a package on your last day of work. You might learn to deliver things a little bit quicker in between, but there is not much difference.” He remembers growing “irritable, grumpy, resentful” as he began to see the customers “as more selfish, unreasonable and greedy than they really were”.I Deliver Parcels in Beijing is, among other things, a story about social class: about the unacknowledged and often exploited low-paid labour force that has powered the economic boom in China – and, given globalisation, the world. Hu often worked alongside the country’s nearly 300 million-strong group of internal migrant workers, people who move from the countryside to the cities in search of better opportunities. They often face extreme insecurity and discrimination, with limited access to public benefits.View image in fullscreenShanghai, where Hu had a gig selling bicycles.Photograph: Hans Neleman/Getty ImagesA sense of scarcity and insecurity festered in many of his workplaces: when a pregnant woman joined his team at the packing factory, his colleague deemed it a “tragedy”. Once, competition between his women’s clothing store and another in the same mall ramped up so much that Hu smuggled a kitchen knife into work for protection. At a wholesale market where he did business at that time, “a business owner made a bomb and threw it at his competitor’s stall, blowing them up”.This extreme environment makes some sense when you consider the state of the nation at the turn of the century. By the late 90s, when Hu joined the working world, he recalls that liberal economic reforms suddenly made it possible for new swathes of society to make money. A frenzy of competition fed into a culture of doing what you could – legally and illegally – to get rich; while government regulation struggled to keep up. “There was a saying in the 1990s: ‘The timid will die of not making enough [money]; the bold will die of making too much.’” At the time, Hu says: “Nine out of 10 people you met only cared about making money.”Young people feel their confusions, worries and doubts can be comforted by my bookIt was also at this time that Hu, then 30 and increasingly discouraged by his experiences at work, started writing. He began reading western literature, taking inspiration from JD Salinger, Raymond Carver and James Joyce, as well as posting on an online literary forum. Hu would usually write in the breaks between jobs, as work often left him too exhausted to do anything else. It was well over a decade, however, before he had a breakthrough: in 2020, a blogpost he wrote about life as a courier went viral, attracting the attention of the literary world. What made him keep going? “I didn’t feel that I needed to achieve something in writing,” he says – it was simply something that enriched his life.Today, after the success of his book, Hu is a full-time writer, and has followed up his bestseller with two more autobiographical books. He’s quick to clarify that his earnings aren’t particularly large, and that he lives, as he always has, a frugal life. He and his wife – also a writer; they met on the literary forum – spend their days going to the library, or the shopping mall, where they write with the benefit of free wifi and air conditioning, before going home to cook dinner.Though he and his wife don’t interact much with others – “We rarely socialise; we’re both very introverted” – they know the world around them has changed drastically from the boom years of the 00s. The economy has stagnated: China’s urban youth unemployment rate is nearing 20%, and there is a popular“lying flat”youth movement rejecting 996-style workaholism. Hu sees younger generations seeking more purpose in life beyond work or money, and his book has attracted graduates overwhelmed by the world of work. “They feel their confusions, worries and doubts can be comforted by my book,” he says. “They can’t get answers [from me], because I don’t have the answers, but they see that someone else also has these confusions and doubts, and they can find some warmth, encouragement and comfort from it.”996 work culture is sad and inhumane. Whatever’s wrong with 888 – or even 000? | Emma BeddingtonRead moreIt strikes me that English language readers could read Hu’s book as an isolated account of a worldover there, a story of an unfree and unjust life in a distant land. But that would do a disservice to his expansive and inclusive reflections on human dignity and freedom, at a time when work dominates life in general, and when many of the socioeconomic forces – the pressure, the inequality, and the way that global capitalism has a way of making a human feel like a thing – that shape his life also shape ours.I tell him it’s relatively rare to hear an ordinary Chinese person’s voice at length in the west. China has an entirely different internet ecosystem, and censorship is rife, but although his memoir paints a fairly brutal portrait of work culture in China, government publications have praised the book for its depiction of the “self-control of ordinary people amid the hardships of labour”, lauding it as part of a broader wave of national “grassroots literature”. Hu hopes its translation will “promote two-way communication, so foreign readers can understand me and my environment. Then, in turn, I can introduce the situation of foreign readers to my domestic ones.”It’s fitting that, in the spirit of cross-cultural exchange, his book ends with a reflection on Virginia Woolf and the Anglo-Irish poet Laetitia Pilkington, who lived an at times impoverished life. Hu notes that after Woolf had read Pilkington’s memoir, she had written: “All had been bitterness and struggle, except that she had loved Shakespeare, known Swift, and kept through all the shifts and shades of an adventurous career a gay spirit.”“The first time I read this portrait of her, I was moved to tears,” Hu writes. “Love amid despair – this is the light that illuminates life.”Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu.I Deliver Parcels in Beijing is published by Allen Lane on 28 October (£20).To support the Guardian buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.Delivery charges may apply.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They have also asked the private sector and high-net worth individuals to step in, saying better control of the disease would fuel economic growth and trade.View image in fullscreenJoy Phumaphi, of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, said: ‘All of us need to be part of the end story of malaria.’Photograph: Steffen Kugler/Target MalariaJoy Phumaphi, of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (Alma), which co-commissioned the research with Malaria No More UK, said: “African countries are stepping up to the plate, and we are appealing to the rest of the world to accompany us on this journey, because all of us need to be part of the end story of malaria.”The report estimated the impact of funding cuts to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria – which is seeking donations to cover costs from 2027 to 2029. The fund providesnearly 60% of all international financing for malariacontrols, such as mosquito nets and preventive drugs.If funding was 20% lower than in the last round, researchers said there would be an additional 33 million cases and 82,000 deaths, and $5.14bn (£3.83bn) in lost GDP by 2030, according to the report.However, funding cuts look likely. Germanypledged $1bnto the fund last week, a figure23% lowerthan its last promise. The UK government isreportedly looking at a figure 20% downon its previous commitment, although it says no final decision has been made.If a funding vacuum led to preventive malaria control collapsing entirely, the report estimates there would be 525 million more cases, 990,000 more deaths and $83bn in lost GDP. About 750,000 of those deaths would be of children under five, representing “the loss of a generation to malaria”, the report’s authors warned.Proposed UK cuts to global aid fund could lead to 300,000 preventable deaths, say charitiesRead moreConversely, they said that if the Global Fund received thefull $18bnit was asking for, there would be a $230bn boost to GDP, 865 million fewer cases and 1.86 million fewer deaths.Phumaphi said there had been “marked increases in [domestic] budget allocation not just to health, but specifically to malaria, particularly since the beginning of this year.But she added: “I think we need to appreciate the enormity of the challenge and exactly how much is required in funding in order for countries to be able to catch up.”African countries heavily burdened by servicing debt and the economic aftershocks of Covid-19 were facing not only infectious diseases but also a growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer, she said.It was worrying, Phumaphi said, that donor countries were considering pledging less than in the last round, “but we are grateful that countries like Germany have pledged substantial amounts – a billion is quite a substantial amount.”View image in fullscreenRising biological resistance to insecticides and anti-malarial drugs is one of the challenges faced by the fight to eradicate the disease.Photograph: Desire Danga Essigue/ReutersThe former Botswana health minister said she was hopeful that wealthy individuals, the private sector and foundations would step up “because when we talk about productivity, jobs [and the] economic potential that Africa tends to lose, we are talking about potential investments and markets for the private sector”.One of those individuals, the Nigerian businessman Aliko Dangote, encouraged others to join him in filling the funding gap: “Malaria is not just a health crisis; it is an $83bn brake on Africa’s growth and enterprise. Business cannot thrive in sick communities.”Malaria’s impact on GDP was measured using factors including disrupted schooling, employee absences, and the impact on tourism and agriculture.The Gates Foundation, which supports the Global Fund, is a philanthropic organisation that also contributes funding to support the editorially independent global development section of the GuardianExplore more on these topicsGlobal healthMalariaInfectious diseasesAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Gbagbo, Ivory Coast’s first lady from 2000 to 2011 when she was married to the former president Laurent Gbagbo, was once known to her supporters as “the Hillary Clinton of the tropics”. Others gave her the nickname “the iron lady” due to her tough reputation.“The right solution is not to march or boycott,” she said. “The right solution is to vote.”View image in fullscreenA vendor walks past campaign posters of Ahoua Don Mello and Simone Gbagbo of the Movement of Capable Generations party in Abidjan.Photograph: Luc Gnago/ReutersFor older citizens, there is a sense of deja vu: Ouattara, 83, is almost the same age as his mentor Félix Houphouët-Boigny – the country’s first president – was when an uprising in 1990 led to the country’s first multiparty elections.In July, he confirmed what people everywhere from roadside maquis (open-air restaurants) to diplomatic dinners had suspected: he was standing for yet another term. In 2020 he reached the same decision, initially declining to run for a third term but changing his mind when his party’s designated candidate died during the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that a 2016 constitutional amendment had reset the clock. The main opposition boycotted the vote and Ouattara won a controversial victory.More controversy beckons when the country goes to the polls on Saturday.Two leading opposition figures have been sidelined. Laurent Gbagbo, now 80, is entangled in a past legal conviction linked to the 2010-11 post-electoral conflict. The former Credit Suisse banker Tidjane Thiam, 63, was disqualified after a court ruled he was a French national when he registered to contest, in contravention of Ivorian laws.Ouattara will face an array of lesser-heralded contenders including Simone Gbagbo and three former ministers.There are rumours about his health and claims that some of the elite – used to the trappings of power – are encouraging him to stay on. Nevertheless some supporters have called on him to step down to make way for a new generation.In June, the front-page headline in the weekly Le Sursaut carried a plea from a self-described“allassaniste”:“Dear Papa Ouattara, don’t be a candidate.”The communication minister, Amadou Coulibaly, brushed off any criticism. “The president is exercising his legal right under the constitution,” he told the Guardian. “He meets all criteria. Citizens are free to vote for or against him. That is democracy.”Disinformation and disenfranchisementOfficials claim the nationwide infrastructure drive, including a rural electrification programme, has transformed many parts of the country and raised the standard of living.“This government is committed to fighting poverty,” said Coulibaly. “In 2011, the poverty rate was 55%. In 2024, it dropped to 37%. Our goal for 2030 is to halve that again to around 18%.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

France, te former colonial ruler, has become public enemy No 1 in the region, and Ouattara, like his Nigerian counterpart, Bola Tinubu, is seen as a Parisian puppet and adversary of the newly formed Alliance of Sahel States.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators face police during clashes in Abidjan earlier this month.Photograph: Luc Gnago/ReutersThat perception has been fuelled by adeluge of disinformation, including fake rumours of a coup d’etat earlier this year, that analysts say fits a pattern.“Most of the campaigns, most of the fake news we’ve observed, come mainly from Burkina Faso,” said Vanessa Manessong, a data analyst at Code4Africa and the African Digital Democracy Observatory. She said the accounts were often pro-Russia and anti-France, and sought to discredit France and sabotage its relations with Ivory Coast.Ouattara’s popularity dipped more after the treatment of Thiam, who leads a party founded by his great-uncle, Houphouët-Boigny. Thiam’s disqualification is seen as continuing the exclusionary identity politics that has plagued Ivory Coast for decades and was amajor factor in the civil warsof 2002 to 2007 and 2010-11.A tense situationAhead of the election, things are tense: more than 44,000 security personnel have been deployed nationwide. Diplomats and some expatriates are sending their families abroad briefly.In October last year, the influential Student Federation of Ivory Coast, which has allegedly been involved in organised crime since it was established during the 1990 uprisings,was bannedafter two student murders and caches of weapons were found. There are fears that the group’s many factions could intervene to support their preferred candidates.Ouattara’s rivals have called for daily protests, hoping for an audit of the electoral register and reinstatement of their leaders.View image in fullscreenRiot police chase protesters as they break up an opposition protest in Abidjan earlier this month.Photograph: Luc Gnago/ReutersCoulibaly dismissed concerns of possible voter apathy if the disbarred candidates were not reinserted. “It’s everywhere in the world that people are losing interest in elections … so I don’t want people to stigmatise our continent,” he said. “There’s a global kind of democratic fatigue.”On a recent trip across one of Abidjan’s new bridges, Kouakou, a taxi driver who asked for his last name not to be used, said he was glad his compatriots were taking to the streets, but that he had resigned himself to another Ouattara victory.“It’s like an episode of 24,” said Kouakou. “You know Jack Bauer will win but you don’t know what happens before then.”Explore more on these topicsIvory CoastAlassane OuattaraAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Petro and his administration said the mid-September strike was a “direct threat to national sovereignty” and that thevictim wasa “lifelong fisherman” and a “humble human being”.In response, Trump, who has claimed such attacks are designed to stop drug-smuggling to the US, called Petro an “illegal drug dealer” and vowed to end aid payments toColombia, one of the largest recipients of US counter-narcotics assistance. He also ordered Petro to “close up” drug cultivation sites, saying if not “the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely”. Speaking onboard Air Force One, Trump added that he would announce new tariffs on Colombian goods.Trump calls Colombia president ‘illegal drug dealer’ as US says it hit another shipRead moreIn response, Colombia recalled its ambassador to the US for talks in Bogotá on Monday, while its interior minister, Armando Benedetti, said the remarks were a “threat of invasion or military action against Colombia”. Petro said that Colombia’s five-decade conflictstemmed from “cocaine consumption in the United States”and claimed American contributions had been “meagre and null in recent years”.Analysts have warned the feud marks one of the most serious breakdowns of relations between the longtime allies, and casts doubt over the future of security and counter-narcotics cooperation between the two countries. The row comes at a critical time for Colombiawhich is facing its worst security crisis in a decade.Yet Colombia has not backed down, with the foreign ministry saying Trump’s statements “contain a direct threat to national sovereignty by proposing an illegal intervention in Colombian territory”.Relations soured at the start of Trump’s second term. Days after Trump’s inaugurationColombia initially refusedto accept military flights carrying deportees, prompting the US president to threaten tariffs and sanctions. Months later, Washington revoked Petro’s visa after he urged US soldiers to disobey Trump at a pro-Palestine rally in New York, telling them “disobey the orders of Trump. Obey the orders of humanity.”In September, the US then declared that Colombia was “failing” to meet its international drug control obligations, decertifying it for the first time in nearly 30 years.Colombia is the world’s leading producer of cocaine, and its cultivation of the coca bush, the base product of cocaine, reached anall-time high last year, according to the UN. Bogotá argues that the militarized “war on drugs” has failed, and said its own policies have led to record levels of seizures.Despite the decertification rebuke, the White House said in September that it would continue funding and security assistance to Colombia, calling the partnership “vital to the national interests of the United States”. That appears to have changed this weekend, with Washington now threatening to slash aid.It was not immediately clear what the cuts might entail, with the US administration having already reduced some funding earlier this year.According to the Washington Office on Latin America (Wola), a research organisation, Colombia had been due to receive more than $400m in aid at the start of the year, but earlier cuts left it with abouta quarter of that.US figuressuggest that Colombia received an estimated $230m in the US budget year that ended 30 September – down from more than $700m in recent years.Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for the Andes region at International Crisis Group, said that the impact of further aid cuts would be “gigantic” – and not merely financial.“It is an institutional relationship where security forces are operating, on a day-to-day basis, in tandem, in coordination, and constantly sharing information and undertaking operations in a way that is benefiting both countries,” she said.Dickinson warned that the rupture comes at a perilous moment, with Colombia facing the “worst security crisis it’s seen in probably a decade”, amid a growing threat from armed and criminal groups.Gimena Sánchez-Garzoli, Wola’s Andes director, said tensions had entered “dangerous territory”, warning that “as Colombia is the most important ally to the US on counternarcotics, it is counterproductive to aggressively attack this ally and to cut further funding.”Petro, Colombia’s first leftist president, has for weeks criticised the US strikes on boats in theCaribbean, which legal experts have also deemed unlawful.Naval ships, fighter jets and drones have been deployed for what the US has described as an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. There have been seven US strikes in the region since early September, and at least 32 people have been killed.Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, claimed that one strike last week targeted a boat linked to the National Liberation Army (ELN), a Colombian rebel group, though he provided no evidence. Petrocondemned the bombing, saying the boat belonged to a “humble family”.Survivors were reported from another strike last week, with two men – one Colombian and one Ecuadorian – who US officials were to be repatriated. Trump said US intelligence had confirmed the vessel was “loaded up with mostly fentanyl and other illegal narcotics”. Analysts noted that while Colombia produces cocaine, fentanyl trafficking is largely centred in Mexico.On Sunday evening,Petro wrotethat the US “war on drugs” was merely a “policy to control” Latin America and its resources, arguing that attacks on Venezuela were intended to “secure its oil cheaply”.On Monday he added that “Colombia actually provides the money and the deaths in the struggle, while the US provides the consumption” and blamed US and European consumption for 300,000 murders in Colombia and 1m deaths in Latin America.He then posteda videowhich purported to show the Colombian army seizing nearly half a ton of cocaine at sea north of La Guajira, adding pointedly: “Zero deaths in the operation.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasForeign policyCaribbeanUS militaryUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

That is because Bolivia uses two counts: a quicker one, based on photos of each ballot sent to a data-processing centre, and the slower definitive one, in which every vote is publicly counted and scrutinised at polling stations before entering the system.How towering dominance of Bolivia’s socialist party came tumbling downRead moreThe court has up to seven days to release the official results.“Let’s keep building a future, a new path after 20 years that have left us out of the economy … and geopolitics. We must create jobs,” Paz Pereira told supporters at a hotel in La Paz, just over two hours after the results were announced.He added: “Ideology doesn’t put food on the table. What does is the right to work, strong institutions, legal security, respect for private property, and having certainty about your future – and that’s what we want to work for.”Bolivia’s next president also mentioned his US counterpart, Donald Trump, saying he hoped “to build a close relationship with one of the most important governments in the world, to be part of the solutions from 8 November [the inauguration date] onwards, and to ensure that Bolivia does not lack hydrocarbons.”A senator for the department of Tarija, Paz Pereira is the son of former president Jaime Paz Zamora, who governed from 1989 to 1993.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Bolivia’s presidential candidate Rodrigo Parereira celebrate after learning the resultsPhotograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite being an experienced politician – having served as a city councillor, mayor and congressman – he sought to present himself as an outsider and was thebig surprise of the first round, winning after starting his campaign near the bottom of the opinion polls.Election day passed without incident, according to the electoral court and international observers, including those from the European Union.The defeated candidate, Quiroga – who served as president for 12 months between 2001 and 2002, and was making his fourth attempt to return to power – began his speech at a hotel in La Paz, where his team had gathered, by saying he had called Paz Pereira to congratulate him – prompting cries of “No!” from the crowd.“Please, I understand the pain we’re feeling. Believe me, if we had systemic evidence [of electoral fraud], we would put it on the table,” said Quiroga, who stated that he would monitor the final vote count but added that he “respected the work” of the electoral court in the first round and “will respect it” in the run-off.In addition to being Bolivia’s first presidential runoff, Sunday’s election marked the first time since 2005 that no candidate from the Mas party – which first came to power with Evo Morales and later with the current president, Luis Arce – was on the ballot for a presidential election.Deeply unpopular, Arce chose not to run and instead put forward his interior minister, Eduardo del Castillo, who won just over 3% of the vote in the first round – the minimum needed for the party to avoid losing its legal status.The collapse of the once-dominant party is attributed to the bitter feud between Morales and his former political protege Arce and to the country’sdeep economic crisis– its worst in four decades – marked by soaring inflation and shortages of both dollars and fuel.Shortly after the polls closed, an image was posted on the vice-minister of communication’s official Facebook page reading: “The Masistas [Mas members] are finally leaving! After 20 years of ruining the country.” The post was deleted a few hours later, and it is still unclear who uploaded it.The party that once held two-thirds of Congress will, in the next legislature, have only two congressmen and no senators.The composition of Congress is already seen as one of the main challenges for Paz Pereira as president.Despite his party, the Partido Demócrata Cristiano (PDC), winning the largest number of seats, with 49 deputies and 16 senators, it will not have a majority to ensure the passage of laws and reforms.View image in fullscreenPeople hug after the preliminary results of Bolivia’s presidential runoff election are announced.Photograph: Claudia Morales/ReutersPaz Pereira spent recent years travelling across Bolivia – by his own count, visiting about 220 of the country’s 327 municipalities – and won particularly in regions that, until recently, were Mas’ strongholds.In a country where economists estimate that 80% of the workforce is made up of self-employed and informal workers, Paz Pereira campaigned on a platform of “popular capitalism”, promising low-interest loans for small entrepreneurs.He also promised to cancel citizens’ debts to the state to boost the economy and said that “there will be no more smuggling because everything will be legal” in Bolivia, pledging to lower import tariffs on goods such as technology and vehicles.But many analysts believe a decisive factor in Paz Pereira’s success was the popularity of his running mate, former police captain Edman Lara Montaño, 39.Known as Capt Lara, he rose to fame for exposing alleged corruption cases within the police force in videos that went viral on TikTok – which ultimately led to his expulsion from the force.Running for the first time on a banner of “anti-corruption”, Capt Lara as times appeared like an independent candidate, and has already said he would have no problem turning against the next president if he saw wrongdoing, saying “I’m the guarantee – if Rodrigo Paz doesn’t deliver, I’ll confront him.”After the results were announced, Lara said: “We must rebuild the country’s economy; we must guarantee the supply of diesel and petrol. People are suffering; we need to stabilise the prices of basic goods and put an end to corruption.”In addition to the deep economic crisis, another “legacy” of Arce that Paz Pereira will have to deal with is thearrest warrantagainst Morales, who for the past year has been in central Bolivia, where hundreds of coca farmers are preventing his arrest for allegedly fathering a child with a 15-year-old while he was president.During the campaign, Paz Pereira said that if elected, the law would be applied to Evo Morales “as to any other citizen.”Explore more on these topicsBoliviaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianVolunteers defy their government and public opinion in China to risk their lives for an adversary of Beijing’s main geopolitical partnerByAmy HawkinsMon 20 Oct 2025 10.50 EDTFirst published on Mon 20 Oct 2025 08.50 EDTShareIn a war that has been characterised by merciless attacks on civilians, one of the worst took place on 8 July 2024. Russian missile strikeskilled at least 43 peoplein cities across Ukraine in one of the deadliest days of the war last year. One of the most shocking blows was to theOkhmatdyt children’s hospital in central Kyiv, which reduced the country’s largest paediatric clinic to rubble.Tim, 43, was delivering aid on the outskirts of Kyiv when he heard a missile fly overhead. A short while later, he saw the news on his phone that the children’s hospital had been hit. Along with a British friend, the Chinese national, who asked to be referred to by just his English name, rushed to the scene to help with the recovery efforts. “Seeing the severed limbs, some of them belonging to children, I started crying,” the father-of-two said, tears in his eyes at the memory. “I thought about the kind of anger that Chinese people have. Once it’s ignited … It’s intense. I decided to join the army.”More than a year later, Tim is in his barracks in southernUkraine, engineering drones for the military’s ground force. He is one of a small number of Chinese people who have defied their government and mainstream public opinion to risk their lives to fight against an invasion by Beijing’s most important geopolitical partner, Russia.Tim arrived in Ukraine in July 2023. He had been watching with concern fromChinafor months, occasionally donating money to online fundraisers for relief efforts. But he wanted to do more. “At that time, I was unemployed in China. I just wanted to go to Ukraine as a volunteer – to see a country suffering through hardship and deliver the donations that many of my close friends had given me to help the people who needed them.” So he applied for a business visa through an agent in China and embarked on the long journey west.View image in fullscreenTim, photographed in Kyiv in October.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianLike many Chinese volunteers, Tim is motivated by a combination ofsympathy for the Ukrainian cause and increasing despair at the direction of his own country. Before he arrived in Ukraine, the only country he had visited outside China was Japan. But he’d considered emigrating for over a decade.“Fifteen years ago, you could see problems, speak freely about them, and there would be people willing to discuss them,” Tim said of China. But those days are gone, he feels. He learned about the war in Ukraine by using a virtual private network (VPN) connection to watch videos on YouTube, which is blocked in China. “I don’t read news from Chinese websites at all … because the news there is all fake,” he said.He went back and forth between Ukraine and China for a year, each time taking long and indirect routes that involved several stopovers, and gradually came to the conclusion that Ukraine had a “bright future”. Despite being at war, people were friendly to him as a foreigner. He started making plans for his wife and children to join him, and then the missile attack on the children’s hospital spurred him to enlist in the army.View image in fullscreenRescuers, medical workers and volunteers search the ruins of the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital for survivors after the Russian missile attack.Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/APForeigners can serve in in regular Ukrainian army units or one of two dedicated international legions. Kostyantyn Milevsky, a Ukrainian military official,saidin August that there were about 8,000 foreigners in the land forces, and perhaps double that figure across the military as a whole. The Ukrainian army does not release detailed breakdowns of the nationalities of international recruits but many come from South America drawn by salaries that can exceed $3,000 (£2,244) a month for the most dangerous missions. The basic income is closer to $500 a month. Chinese volunteers in Ukraine estimate that there are at most a few dozen people from mainland China serving in the army.The Chinese public’s views onRussiaare complex. Some nationalists have never forgiven tsarist Russia for annexing large swathes of territory from the Qing dynasty in the late 19th century, but the war in Ukraine has been accompanied in China by an aggressive propaganda push from state media, which blames the US for the crisis.Beijing officially claims to be neutral in the conflict and has called for peace. But the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has stood by his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, throughout the war, and western analysts believe it would be very difficult for Moscow to continue fighting without China’s economic support. Bilateral trade between the two countries has surged to record levels since the 2022 invasion. China is not thought to be providing direct military aid, but exports of components used to make weapons,such as fibre optic cables, have increased sharply. Components are also shipped to Ukraine, but at much lower levels.View image in fullscreenXi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, greet veterans at a military parade in Beijing in September to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war.Photograph: KCNA/ReutersResearch by Tao Wang of Manchester Metropolitan University found 80% of Chinese people surveyed held pro-Russia views in the first year of the war, and that “government-controlled media succeeded in swaying public opinion in favour of Russia” as it progressed.But there is a “sizeable portion of the Chinese population sympathetic to Ukraine that has been largely overlooked,” Wang said. People are often afraid to express such views explicitly because it is “viewed as unconventional”.It is not just ideology that draws people such as Tim, an unemployed car mechanic when he left China in 2023, to the frontline. China is in the grip of an unemployment crisis which has spurred dissatisfaction with the government.Another Chinese volunteer, Fan, whose first name the Guardian has withheld to protect his identity, also moved to Ukraine to escape what seemed like a hopeless future back home.View image in fullscreenTim, photographed in Kyiv in October.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianUntil he left China earlier this year, the 39-year-old’s life in China was just about “lying flat”, he said, using a Chinese expression for passive unemployment. The pandemic had destroyed his business ventures and he had fallen into debt to the tune of 3m yuan (£314,000).Browsing on western social media one day, he read about Chinese people fighting in Ukraine. He learned about Peng Chenliang, a Chinese volunteer from Yunnan province who served in the foreign legion and was killed in November 2024 during a combat operation on the eastern front.“I was basically doing nothing back home … I felt I couldn’t go on living such an unremarkable life,” Fan said. He wanted to “do something that felt more meaningful”.Chinese social media isawash with videosselling the benefits of becoming a mercenary for Russia. After two Chinese nationals were captured fighting for Moscow in eastern Donetsk in April, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said more than 150 others were doing so. There is no indication that China, which denies providing military aid to Russia, endorses these mercenaries, but it allows the videos to spread on the country’s tightly controlled internet.Finding information about how to fight for Ukraine is much harder, so Fan asked ChatGPT. Eventually he found his way to a recruitment office in Lviv, leaving his wife and daughter behind in China. With no military experience but a hobby of playing with drones, he was assigned as a drone operator on the frontline in eastern Ukraine, but the language barrier led to him being pulled back from the combat zone. Now he spends his days guarding a warehouse. “It can be a bit lonely,” he said. But he passes the time by practising his Ukrainian on his phone.Fan is not an overtly political person. But still he felt the tightening noose of China’s crackdown on civil society, especially since the pandemic. As well as struggling economically, he said he had seen many of his favourite bloggers persecuted or detained under charges such as “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” – a catch-all term used to target anyone who displeases the authorities. “Many ordinary people, just by expressing views in live streams or on their personal platforms that don’t align with mainstream opinion in China, ended up being treated unfairly,” he said.View image in fullscreenTim, photographed in Kyiv in October.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“I am nearly 40, and I have not voted once in my life … the government never listens to the voices of ordinary people. I don’t want my kid to grow up in such an environment.”Fan has not yet figured out how to bring the rest of his family to Ukraine, but returning to China could be dangerous. Chinese law does not specifically forbid citizens from joining foreign armies, unless it is a threat to Chinese national security, but many fear retribution. Another Chinese soldier in Ukraine, who asked to be referred to by his call sign, Brunko, said China’s national security police had questioned his family about him.Tim sees his time in Ukraine as being in service of many goals. Asked why he would risk his life for another country, he said his main aim was to make a new life for himself and his family inEurope. “Secondly, I want to show the world that there are many Chinese people like me. I want the world not to give up on China,” he said. “Don’t always associate China with negative things. In fact, there are many good people in China and many positive ideas.”Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsUkraineChinaRussiaAsia PacificEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Yoshimura has described as “absolute requirements” his party’s demands to make Osaka – where Ishin has its base – a secondary capital in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency in Tokyo, and to reform social security.Ishin has also called for the 10% consumption (sales) tax to be suspended for food, and for a ban on corporate and organisational donations to political parties – a demand opposed by many in the LDP, the Kyodo news agency said, adding that the latter had agreed to “strive to realise” the demands.Despite the coalition breakthrough, Takaichi, a hardline conservative who opposes same-sex marriages and reigning female empresses, will inherit a minority government dependent on opposition groups to pass legislation, including a vote over a new supplementary budget.She has called for higher spending and tax cuts to help consumers through rising inflation – policies that could quickly lead to friction with Ishin, which supports small government and lower spending.Like her mentor,Shinzo Abe, Takaichi wants to revise Japan’s “pacifist” postwar constitution to formally recognise the role of its military, known as the self-defence forces. She is a regular visitor toYasukuni, a controversial war shrine in Tokyo that some of Japan’s neighbours view as a symbol of its wartime aggression.She has also called for stricter rules onimmigration– an issue that hasrisen up the political agendain Japan amid record levels of migration and inbound tourism.Wires contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificDonald TrumpShinzo AbenewsShareReuse this content"

Fengshen made landfall from the western Pacific Ocean near the municipality of Gubat on the southern tip of the island of Luzon, and while it remains on the weaker side in terms of sustained winds, the intense rainfall and a storm surge have caused significant damage across the region.Anticipated waves of 2 metres (6ft) led the Philippines weather bureau, Pagasa, to issue a risk warning of moderate coastal flooding for the region. Twenty-seven thousand people were evacuated from the Albay province because of these warnings and moved to a safer area further inland. Despite the precautionary measures, five people died when a tree fell on to a house near Pitogo on Sunday morning.While the Philippines is no stranger to tropical storms, and systems stronger than Fengshen regularly affect the country, Fengshen follows a series of strong earthquakes that struck near the coast of the Cebu and Mindanao islands in the last few weeks, killing 87 people.View image in fullscreenRescuers work at the site of a house damaged by a fallen tree in Quezon province, Philippines.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockThe storm will continue to track over the Philippines, bringing heavy rainfall and flooding before emerging into the South China Sea. The Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) forecast Fengshen to strengthen slightly, and reach sustained winds of 70mph, as it takes a turn to the south-west, heading towardsVietnam. The 2025 typhoon season has already included storms affecting Vietnam with Typhoons Kajiki and Bualoi striking the country in August and September respectively.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Typically occurring between October and December, the north-east, or “retreating” monsoon, is a reversal of the wind direction across south-east Asia. This change of wind direction brings cool air down from China across the Bay of Bengal, triggering heavy rainfall and thunderstorms that move into eastern India. The India meteorological department has warned of further heavy rainfall this week as the season kicks in. Up to 100-150mm of rainfall is possible along India’s east coast over this week, bringing the risk of further flooding. There is also the potential for a tropical depression to form over the Bay of Bengal and track towards India, as the North Indian cyclone season gains momentum.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesWeather trackerVietnamIndiaExtreme weatherAsia PacificSouth and central AsiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It expanded by 1.1% in the third quarter compared with the second, the same as the revised growth rate for that quarter.‘Signs of recovery’ claims Amazon Web Services after internet outage hits many websites and apps – business liveRead more“September activity data showedcontinued weakness in domestic demand, partly due to poor business and household confidence,” noted Kelvin Lam, the senior China+ economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Investment growth slowed, with property investment diving 13.9% year on year in September, after falling 12.9% in August.Consumer demand was still muted, with real growth in retail sales slowing sharply to 3.5%, from 4.1% previously.Industrial production was a bright spot, rising by 6.5% in September, better than expected.Despite the simmering trade war with Washington, trade also beat analysts’ forecasts, accounting for just over a quarter of the headline growth, broadly unchanged from the second quarter – the onset of the Trump “reciprocal” tariff saga.China’s exports to the US fell by 27% year on year last month but shipments to the EU, south-east Asia and Africa grew by 14%, 15.6% and 56.4% respectively as the country diversified away from the American market.Beijing could use this to its advantage in talks between its vice-premier He Lifeng and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in Malaysia this week, and a potentialmeetingbetween the countries’ presidents, Trump and Xi Jinping, in South Korea at a later date.Chinese “export orders have risen quite strongly, which bodes well for future production growth,” Lam said. “The export sector has been performing better than we previously expected despite higher import tariffs.”The headline economic growth figure matched analysts’ expectations, and kept the economy on track for China’s 5% growth target this year.

Not only was there no disaster or real embarrassment in the unpredictable Trump White House, but almost every single opposition claim that the government had bungled the US relationship was found to be simply hot air.‘I don’t like you either’: diplomats hold their breath as Trump chides Rudd over previous commentsRead moreTrump will be mad Australia hasn’t spent more on defence? The president waved it away – “You can only do so much.”Concern over recognising Palestine or action on climate change? Ignored.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAukus, painted by some critics as imperilled by an ongoing Pentagon review, was not only thoroughly praised by Trump but endorsed to move faster.0:50'Ready to go': Trump and Albanese sign multibillion-dollar critical minerals agreement  – videoAmajor critical minerals agreement will see billions of US investmentpumped into Australia, the deal signed by the two leaders in signature Trump black texta.Much will be made ofTrump telling Australian ambassador Kevin Rudd (perhaps jokingly or theatrically) “I don’t like you”, even if the president later drew a line under the non-scandal by saying “all is forgiven”.The best criticism that opposition leader Sussan Ley could muster after the meeting was that Albanese hadn’t gotten US tariffs dropped further (Trump noted Australia had one of the “lightest” arrangements in the world) and that Rudd was ineffective as ambassador because the president didn’t recognise his face.Even if you accept the latter as true, it clearly hasn’t hurt Australia’s standing in Washington. The unpredictable and explosive Trump was at his effusive best, praising Albanese as a “great prime minister” and Australia as “an amazing ally … there’s never been any games.”0:43'I don't like you either': Trump chides Australian ambassador Kevin Rudd at White House – videoFrom the Pacific islands to the president’s front porch, it has been a whiplash of a White House visit for a prime minister who was, until a few days ago, relaxing on a tropical beach.Like an office worker looking to maximise their annual leave downtime, Albanese booked his holiday right up to the last minute before returning to the grind, finishing up in the Pacific on Sunday morning before meeting his official jet to fly directly to Washington.Albanese has taken fire from the Coalition opposition since before Trump’s inauguration nine months ago: for not setting up a meeting sooner, that every day without a meeting saw Trump drift further from Australia, and that a lack of face time endangered our biggest partnership.It seems someone forgot to tell Trump. The president repeatedly praised the “great” Albanese, feted him with a lunch alongside key US powerbrokers in the stately cabinet room and resisted numerous opportunities of softball questions to take a swing at Australia’s actions.Albanese was kind back to Trump, acknowledging the “great honour” of a White House visit and the “extraordinary achievement” of the Middle East ceasefire (even as the dealteeters amid violenceand hostage returns). But there was no slavish praise of Trump like some other world leaders, no gaudy gift or Nobel prize nomination.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked for clarification, Trump dismissed it as “minor details”.Despite Trump’s major endorsement of the nuclear submarine deal, questions still remain over Aukus – and the mysterious “ambiguities” in the arrangement that Trump’s navy boss wants to update.Albanese at the White House: Trump endorses Aukus, signs $8.5bn rare earths deal and calls PM ‘great leader’Read moreIn a deal costing the Australian taxpayer upwards of $360bn, including at least $2bn to be poured directly into American shipyards, we deserved more clarity on this. It remains unclear what updates Trump wants to make to the deal signed by predecessor Joe Biden, whom he sledged numerous times as “incompetent”. The Australian government isn’t saying anything either.Labor Against War, the internal group of grassroots members vehemently opposed to the Aukus pact, voiced “deep concern” over what it called Albanese’s intention of “selling off the family silver” in the critical minerals deal. While the US will inject billions into Australian mining projects, government factsheets say those deposits could yield resources worth many factors more than Trump’s government is contributing – with America to get prime access through offtake agreements, and convincing Australia to agree to block some sales to other countries on “national security” grounds.“This is a shameful capitulation,” said former Labor senator Doug Cameron.“Selling off Australian strategic assets is a catastrophic loss of future wealth and is [a] reckless tribute to a fickle and unreliable president for a deal that fundamentally suits the White House.”Cameron foreshadowed a campaign calling on Labor branches to speak out against the deal, claiming Aukus was being used “to justify giving away the minerals that should underpin Australia’s renewable and manufacturing future”.Albanese, referencing his government’s signature Future Made In Australia plan – of which critical minerals processing is a central pillar – told Trump it was “a bit similar to putting America First”.But he probably won’t be putting that on his election campaign ads either.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseDonald TrumpUS foreign policyLabor partyTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

And I probably never will,” US PresidentDonald Trumptold Australian ambassador Kevin Rudd at the White House cabinet room table.It was the testiest and most uncomfortable remark at a typically freewheeling and chaotic presidential press conference.But it was quickly followed by laughter across the packed room: the guffaws coming as if a pressure valve had been released in Australian government and diplomatic circles.Albanese at the White House: Trump endorses Aukus, signs $8.5bn rare earths deal and calls PM ‘great leader’Read moreA half-hour later, followinga remarkably drama-free and warm meeting between Trump and the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, Rudd was heard to apologise to the president, leaning over the table to say sorry to the man he called a “village idiot” four years ago.Trump, according to Australian sources in the room, told Rudd “all is forgiven” after the media filed out.In a gilded room adorned with portraits of presidents past, under gleaming chandeliers and flanked by golden crown moulding, the silver-tongued president didn’t seem too fussed about controversial comments from the snowy-haired Australian ambassador.For a year, conservative critics had catastrophised that Trump had put Australia in the diplomatic cooler because he’d been boiling with rage aboutcritical comments made by Ruddin 2021.But face to face with the former prime minister inside the White House cabinet room, Trump appeared to not recognise Rudd, or even remember the comments – let alone allow it to sour the extraordinarily positive attitude he took with Albanese, showering praise on the Australian leader.View image in fullscreenThe US president, Donald Trump, and the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, speak to reporters ahead of a bilateral meeting in the cabinet room of the White House on Monday.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesIn a press conference Trump spoke approvingly of a sharp haircut on an Australian reporter before calling another journalist a “nasty guy”, signed a major critical minerals deal with Albanese in his signature thick black texta pen, and careened from criticising “incompetent” predecessor Joe Biden to threatening Hamas with “eradication” to praising the “flawless” American strike on Iranian nuclear bases.The brief interaction over Rudd – that left Albanese laughing – was sparked by an Australian reporter asking the president about Rudd’s previous remarks.“Did an ambassador say something?” Trump replied.“I don’t know anything about him. If he said bad, maybe he’d like to apologise. Don’t tell me.”Turning to Albanese, Trump in a half-joking tone asked: “Where is he? Is he still working for you?”Albanese looked up, extending his finger across the table, just off to the right of Trump: “He’s right there.”Cue faces turning towards Rudd, heretofore silent, almost unnoticed with his back towards the large media scrum packed inside the ornate room.In November 2024, upon Rudd’s confirmation as Albanese’s pick for US ambassador,video emerged of the former PM in a 2021 interview describing Trump as “a village idiot”and “not a leading intellectual force”. It later emerged Rudd deleted old social media posts criticising Trump, and a senior adviser to Trump reposted Rudd’s congratulatory statement to Trump on social media with a gif of an hourglass.If Trump had been stewing on Rudd’s previous criticisms, his attitude didn’t betray that displeasure. Trump, famously, is not one to keep quiet when he feels insulted. But he appeared to not even notice Rudd – distinctive in his snowy hair and trim beard – sitting barely 2 metres away.“You said bad?” Trump asked.Rudd, piping up, began to say: “Before I took this position, Mr President … ” before being cut across by Trump.“I don’t like you either, and I probably never will,” he said, to loud laughter in the room, before immediately moving to another question.It’s unclear if Trump genuinely didn’t recognise or remember Rudd, or feigned ignorance out of theatricality. But Albanese himself was among those chuckling.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd (front), listens to Trump during a meeting with Albanese in the cabinet room at the White House in Washington DC.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPTrump often holds grudges, inventing and repeating juvenile nicknames for those he feels have wronged him. But he also has a record of putting aside past slights: case in point, Trump’s former presidential rival Marco Rubio. At one stage dismissed as “little Marco” and a “nasty guy”, Rubio today sat at Trump’s left hand during the meeting, as the US secretary of state.If that was the toughest moment of Albanese’s long-awaited face-to-face meeting with Trump, the Australian delegation will breathe a sigh of relief. Trump strongly backed Aukus, seemed to wave away concerns from his own war secretary Pete Hegseth that Australia should vastly boost its defence spending, and signed an agreement on critical minerals said to be worth billions.As the reporters filed out of the press conference, Rudd could be seen leaning towards Trump; cameras didn’t catch it, but one member of the media recounted that the ambassador offered an apology.It was hard to pick the tone of Trump’s assessment of Rudd, but it appeared flippant, humourous and not particularly poisonous. It could have been far worse.Albanese – and Rudd – would have been glad to get out without any more drama than that.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsKevin RuddAnthony AlbaneseDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

But the president also downplayed any prospect of cutting tariffs on Australian goods.Desperately seeking submariners: why keeping nuclear-powered boats afloat will be Australia’s biggest Aukus challengeRead more“We do actually have a lot of submarines. We have the best submarines in the world, and we’re building a few more currently under construction, and now we’re starting we have it all set with Anthony [Albanese],” Trump said.“We’ve worked on this long and hard, and we’re starting that process right now. I think it’s really moving along very rapidly, very well … we have them moving very quickly.”In a wide-ranging 35-minute press conference at the White House before his first formal meeting between the pair, Trump assured the future ofAukusand said America had no better friend than Australia, but told ambassador Kevin Rudd “I don’t like you” after his former comments about the president were brought up.Rudd later apologised to Trump.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn comments nearly entirely positive about Australia and his relationship with the prime minister, Trump did not repeat previous demands for Albanese’s government to raise defence spending, and Albanese suggested Trump visit Australia for the President’s Cup golf tournament to be held in Melbourne in 2028.Albanese met Trump for a long-awaited first bilateral sit-down on Monday morning local time (early hours of Tuesday morning AEDT) in the cabinet room of the White House. Nine months after Trump’s inauguration, and following several phone conversations between the pair, Albanese sat between the president and vice-president, JD Vance, at the cabinet room table in a meeting which also included war secretary Pete Hegseth, secretary of state Marco Rubio, Rudd, and Australian ministers Tim Ayres and Madeleine King.Trump hosted Albanese for a working lunch after their meeting.Australia had sought an explicit endorsement of the Aukus pact and the $368bn plan for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines from the US, as well as relief from Trump’s trade tariffs. The signing of the critical minerals deal, by which Australia and the United States will each offer at least USD$1bn to projects in both countries, was seen as a major strategic win by Australia; Trump and Albanese signed the agreement in Trump’s cabinet room.‘I don’t like you either’: diplomats hold their breath as Trump chides Rudd over previous commentsRead moreA framework agreement circulated by the Australian government said it would see the two countries work together on “coordinated investment to accelerate development of diversified, liquid, fair markets for critical minerals and rare earths”. The agreement says they will work together on mining and processing, including mobilising government and private sector support through guarantees, loans, or equity and offtake arrangements. The agreement will set price mechanisms including price floors, and also includes a commitment to boosting mechanisms to “review and deter” asset sales “on national security grounds”.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese and Donald Trump after signing a $8.5bn rare earth minerals agreement at the White House.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPAlbanese called the deal “a really significant day” to take the Australia-US relationship “to the next level”.“This is $8.5bn pipeline that we have ready to go. We’re just getting started,” Albanese said.Trump added: “in about a year from now, we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earths, that you won’t know what to do with them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Arafura Nolans in the Northern Territory – projected to produce 5% of global rare earths – will also get US$100m from the Australian government in equity investment.Arafura is backed by Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting, and has already receivedhundreds of millions in government commitments.Trump asked John Phelan, secretary of the navy, to speak about Aukus at the beginning of the meeting. Phelan called Australia “a very important ally of ours in the Indo-Pacific” and appeared to allude to the Henderson naval base in Fremantle, calling it “very important to our ability to project power with our allies.”“I think what we’re really trying to do take this framework and improve it for all three parties, clarify some of the ambiguity that was in the prior agreement. So it should be a win-win for everybody,” he said.Phelan provided no further detail. Asked for clarification later by Guardian Australia, Trump claimed they would be “minor details” and there “shouldn’t be any more clarifications … we’re just full steam ahead building.”Asked about comments from his administration – including Hegseth – calling for a major boost to Australian defence spending, Trump instead praised Australia’s record in building “magnificent holding pads for the submarines”.“I’d always like more, but they [Australia] have to do what they have to do. You can only do so much. I think they’ve been great,” he said.“They’re building tremendous docking because they have a lot of ships and a lot of things happening. And I think their military has been very strong.”Asked if Australia would get relief from trade tariffs, however, Trump indicated that would not be up for review, noting: “Australia pays among the lowest tariffs.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseDonald TrumpAukusUS foreign policyCritical mineralsnewsShareReuse this content"

Explanations have often focused on pregnancy-related hormonal changes, but researchpublished Tuesday in Naturehas found breastfeeding provides long-lasting immune protection.Prof Sherene Loi, a clinician scientist at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, said the most sophisticated level of the immune system, called the adaptive immune system, involves T-cells which react against particular viruses or bacteria – and also against cancer. This response is“one of our very modern therapeutic weapons against cancer”.Loi, the senior author of the new study, said her team had noticed some breast cancers had large amounts of these specialised immune cells, while others had very few.Women who miss first breast cancer screening at ‘40% higher risk’ of dying from the diseaseRead morePatients who had more cells had better outcomes, particularly for one of the most aggressive types: triple-negative breast cancer. These immune cells were also found in healthy breast tissue.The study sought to investigate why these T-cells were already there, whether they were related to pregnancy and breastfeeding, and if they protected against breast cancer formation and growth.The researchers studied noncancerous breast tissue of more than 260 women from diverse populations who had breast reductions or surgery to reduce their risk of breast cancer.They found those who had children had more of these specialised cells, called CD8⁺ T-cells. These cells remained in the breasts for more than 30 years after pregnancy.Using mice models, the researchers then implanted cancerous cells into the equivalent of their breast tissue, and found they grew less in the mice that had had pups and breastfed, than in virgin mice.When they depleted the T-cells from the mice with pups, they lost the protection. This suggested the T-cells were directly responsible for the effect, Loi said.The researchers then investigated whether women who breastfed lived longer with triple-negative breast cancer. They looked at studies involving more than1,000 breast cancer patients diagnosed after having children, and had a record of their breastfeeding history.They found that women who had breastfed did better from their triple-negative breast cancer than those who had not. Their tumours also had more immune cells, suggesting there was ongoing immune activation and regulation from the body against their breast cancer.“The key take-home messages [are] that pregnancy and breastfeeding will leave behind long-lived protective immune cells in the breast and the body, and these cells help to reduce risk and improve defence against breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, but potentially other cancers as well as disease,” Loi said.Loi said the study provided an explanation why breastfeeding is protective, so that it can be used in the future to try to recreate this effect in women who don’t have children or are unable to breastfeed.Understanding the biological mechanism could help develop vaccines and new strategies to mimic this protection, she said.She emphasised even if women do breastfeed, it’s not a 100% guarantee that they won’t get breast cancer. “The effects are really quite small for every individual, but population wide the effects are large.”Associate Prof Wendy Ingman from the University of Adelaide’s Medical School said the longer the duration of breastfeeding, the greater the benefits. She said,for every year of breastfeeding, there is a 4% lifetime reductionin the mother’s breast cancer risk.“This study shows that having babies and breastfeeding causes long-lasting changes in immune cells that could help protect the breast from cancer,” she said. “I’m hopeful that this type of research will lead to new approaches to reduce women’s breast cancer risk.”Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerMedical researchHealthWomen's healthBreastfeedingPregnancynewsShareReuse this content"

That requires us to invest and prepare our forces to be ready to deploy,” Healey said in response to a question.“I’ve accelerated already millions of pounds in that preparation for any possible deployment in the event of peace. And I would expect the cost of that to be well over £100m,” the minister added.Though there is scepticism about whether Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the near-four-year full-scale war, the prospect ofa summit in Budapest between the Russian leader and the US presidentin the next few weeks has raised the possibility that an end to the fighting could emerge.The multinational force involves 30 countries who will be expected to contribute to a peacekeeping force if Russia and Ukraine can agree a ceasefire. It would initially be led by a French general, before the position and the headquarters rotated to the UK a year later.Its principal components will be a Nato-style air policing operation to secure the country’s airspace and a maritime security force to support an existing mine-clearing Black Sea naval force of Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria.But although Healey said that Starmer had committed to “UK boots on the ground”, land forces will be limited to logistics, armament and training specialists to help Ukraine’s army protect the country from future attack.The force would “secure the skies and seas, and train Ukrainian forces to defend their nation”, Healey said in a speech at the Mansion House.Earlier on Monday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he would be ready to join Putin and Trump at their summit in Hungary if he is invited.On Sunday, Trump said the best solution to end the war would beto “cut up” the Donetsk regionthat is the scene of the heaviest fighting on the frontlines. He also pressured Zelenskyy to give up some of his country’s territory for a deal.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryUkraineDefence policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Reports over the weekend said Trump privately urged Zelenskyy to accept Russia’s terms for ending the war during a fractious White House meeting, warning that Putin had said he would “destroy” Ukraine if it did not agree.MapThe announcement of the London meeting came as the EU’s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, warned that while she believed Trump was “sincere” in his desire for peace, “nothing can come out of these meetings if Ukraine or Europe is not part of it”. She said putting pressure on Ukraine was “not the right approach” to end Russia’s war.“On Ukraine, the fundamentals have not changed,” Kallas said pointedly. “Ukraine has been ready for an unconditional ceasefire since February but Russia has no genuine interest in peace. We all support President Trump’s efforts to end the war but Putin will only negotiate seriously if he thinks he is losing.”Among the tools under discussion by the EU to put pressure on Moscow is a new €140bn (£122bn, $163bn) loan for Ukraine, which would be funded by frozen Russian central bank assets, with Kallas saying on Monday there was broad support among member countries.The European Commission has put forward the plan for the “reparation loan” to keep financing Kyiv and has been seeking to win over Belgium, a major doubter, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held.EU leaders are set to discuss the loan at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and officials hope they will give a green light for a more detailed legal proposal to be drawn up. “The reparation loan can send a very powerful message to Moscow that it can’t outlast us,” Kallas said.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, reiterated in comments to reporters after a summit of southern EU leaders in Slovenia that Europeans and Ukrainians must be at the table in talks to end the war.“From the moment they discuss the fate of Ukraine, the Ukrainians should be at the table. From the moment they discuss what impacts the security of Europeans, the Europeans should be at the table,” he said. Zelenskyy has said he would be ready to join Putin and Trump in Budapest but no invitation has so far been forthcoming.0:46Trump says Ukraine's Donbas region should be 'cut the way it is' to end war with Russia – videoAccordingto the Financial Times, the meeting last week between Trump and Zelenskyy descended at times into a “shouting match”, with the US president “cursing all the time”. Further reporting on the meeting in theWashington Post on Mondaydescribed Trump as unmoved by Zelenskyy’s arguments.“It was pretty much like: ‘No, look guys, you can’t possibly win back any territory,’” an unnamed source told the paper. “‘There is nothing we can do to save you. You should try to give diplomacy another chance.’”After the Trump meeting, Zelenskyy called for delivery of an additional 25 US Patriot anti-missile batteries amid Russia’srapidly escalating air war. Speaking in Kyiv on Monday, he said Russia’s frozen assets in the west should be used to buy them.Ukraine already has some Patriot missile interceptors but they are not enough to protect most of its major cities or energy infrastructure, which has once again come under heavy Russian attack as winter approaches.Zelenskyy’s two phone calls with Trump and the scheduling of a face-to-face meeting last week had raised hopes in Kyiv and among its allies that Washington could be on the verge of supplyinglong-range Tomahawk cruise missilesto Ukraine that could allow it to hit targets deep inside Russian territory, including military bases, logistics hubs, airfields and command centres.However, it became clear that the US president had once again performed an abrupt U-turn after conversation with Putin.‘The key to success is in the sky’: the Ukrainian defenders struggling to stem Russia’s air assaultRead moreZelenskyy on Monday characterised the meeting with Trump as “positive” but confirmed that Putin was sticking to the Kremlin’s demand for Ukraine to give up all of the Donbas. “In my opinion, he [Trump] does not want an escalation with the Russians until he meets with them,” Zelenskyy said of the US president’s decision not to approve the supply of Tomahawk missiles.Russia’s state news reported that the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, were planning to speak soon to lay the groundwork for the Budapest meeting.Aides close to Zelenskyy said: “Putin doesn’t want to talk about anything with Ukraine and Zelenskyy, except for big concessions … But Putin has to somehow move in such a way as to keep Trump’s mood away from tough moves; that’s his goal. And he’s succeeding.”Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in BrusselsExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They have been studying CCTV footage and examining items left by the intruders at the scene, including gloves, a walkie-talkie and a motorcycle helmet.View image in fullscreenA tiara worn by the Empress Eugénie was targeted by thieves during the heist.Photograph: Louvre Museum/ReutersThe gang of four thieves, who were unarmed butthreatened guards with angle grinders, according to a prosecutor, accessed the Louvre via an outside window in broad daylight. It was Sunday morning and the museum had recently opened to visitors.The robbers used a truck with an extendable ladder like those used by furniture movers in order to gain access to the Apollo gallery, the gilded room that houses the royal collection and crown jewels. They used their cutting equipment to get in and open the display cases, taking jewels from two cases in the ornate gallery that is one of the most visited rooms in the museum.Some were dressed in hi-vis jackets like builders. Officials said the thieves were inside the Apollo gallery for only four minutes and the whole robbery was over in seven minutes.Apollo gallery planLouvre theft aerial viewThe masked thieves stole eight objects including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to the 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense. Also stolen were an emerald necklace and earrings from a matching set from Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife. Among the other objects were a reliquary brooch and the diadem and large corsage-bow broach of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie – a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.Louvre museum robbery: how the thieves broke in, what they stole and what happens nextRead moreOne object, the emerald-set imperial crown of Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum after it was dropped by the robbers, French authorities said.Darmanin said questions could be asked about why the museum’s windows were not secured.Speaking on CNews, the culture minister, Rachida Dati, said the thieves attempted to set fire to the furniture hoist but failed, leaving evidence behind as they fled.“We did find motorcycles and they have a licence plate,” Dati said. “I also want to pay tribute to the security officers who prevented the furniture hoist from being set on fire. One of the criminals tried to set it on fire but they forced him to flee. This allowed us to recover evidence at the scene.”Dati said museum staff followed security procedures. The alarms sounded when cases were opened and Louvre agents entered the room but the intruders had already fled.Dati stressed that adecade-long Louvre renovation projectlaunched earlier this year includes security improvements. The €700m plan is intended to modernise infrastructure, ease crowding and give the museum’s most famous painting, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, a dedicated gallery by 2031.Dati was asked by M6 television if she felt responsibility as culture minister for the fact that robbers had been able to target the Louvre. She pointed instead at her predecessors, saying there had been “40 years of abandon” on issues of security of works in the Louvre.View image in fullscreenSome of the jewels from the Apollo wing of the Louvre.Composite: Louvre.frThe far right called the theft “a humiliation” for France. “How far will the disintegration of the state go?” said the National Rally party leader, Jordan Bardella, on social media, calling the heist “an unbearable humiliation for our country”.The president, Emmanuel Macron, said on social media that everything was being done to catch the perpetrators and recover the stolen treasures. Darmanin vowed the robbers would be caught.The museum remained closed on Monday.Trade unions said that in general not enough investment was being made in staffing and security at French cultural venues.“The collections aren’t safe, the visitors aren’t safe and the staff aren’t either,” Yvan Navarroa co-secretary general of the culture branch of the leftwing CGT union, told France Info. He said cuts over recent years meant there was a lack of security staffing for French culture and heritage.Explore more on these topicsFranceParisMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The US vice-president, JD Vance, was expected to arrive in Israel on Tuesday to further discuss the implementation of the ceasefire.The 10-day ceasefire in Gaza was rocked on Sunday after an attack by Hamas militants that killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israel to launch a wave of airstrikes across the Strip, resulting in the deaths of 44 Palestinians. Hamas denied being involved in the attack.0:55Footage shows aftermath of Israeli airstrikes in central and southern Gaza – videoThe Israeli government initially said it would cut off all humanitarian aid to Gaza after the attack, but walked back its statement on Sunday night after consultations with the US.Israel’s crossings with Gaza remained open for humanitarian aid on Monday, though the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza remained closed.The US has sought to downplay the seriousness of Sunday’s attacks, with Vance saying there will be “hills and valleys” in the ceasefire process and suggesting Hamas leadership may not have been involved with the gun battle.“When we talk about Hamas, you’re talking about 40 different cells. It’s disjointed. Some of those cells will probably honour the ceasefire. Many of those cells, as we saw some evidence of today, will not,” Vance told reporters on Sunday.As US officials flew to Israel, a Palestinian delegation headed to Cairo for talks on how to implement the second stage of the US-drafted ceasefire plan.Khalil al-Hayya, the exiled head of Hamas, would discuss ways to form a technocratic body to run Gaza without the participation of the militant group, a Palestinian official told Reuters.The formation of the technocratic body to oversee Gaza, as well as the demand that Hamas lay down its arms, are likely to be the two main sticking points of further talks to translate the current Gaza ceasefire into a permanent peace.Under the20-point plan presented by Trump, Gaza is to be overseen by an international technocratic body made up of various world powers under the leadership of Trump himself and the former UK prime minister Tony Blair. Hamas is also to disarm.The militant group has objected to both parts of the peace plan, insisting that the administration that will oversee Gaza should be Palestinian-led. Hamas officials have also rejected calls for it to disarm.Trump, who has continued to push for the ceasefire in Gaza to succeed, has said that he received promises from Hamas that it would disarm, but that there was no definitive timeline when that would happen.The ‘enormous conflict of interest’ at centre of Jared Kushner’s Gaza ceasefire dealRead more“It’s not a hard timeline, but it’s a line in my own mind. At a certain point, if they don’t do what they’re supposed to do, then we’ll have to do it for them,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired on Sunday.Despite the ceasefire in Gaza, Israeli forces have continued to shoot Palestinians and bomb the Strip. Israeli artillery targeted Deir al-Balah in Gaza and at least two Palestinians were shot to death in Gaza City on Monday.The Palestinian news agency said that Israel has violated the ceasefire 80 times and killed at least 80 Palestinians since the deal went into effect 10 days ago.Israel has said that it has fired at individuals who have approached its troops and accused Hamas of attempting to test the limits of the ceasefire.Israeli troops remain in control of a little over 50% of the Gaza Strip and are in the process of physically marking the boundaries of the “red zones” where Palestinians cannot enter.Palestinians have said they are confused about where exactly the red zones are located and at least 11 Palestinians were killed on Friday after driving past a boundary line in Gaza City.“The whole area is in ruins. We saw the maps, but we can’t tell where those lines are,” Samir, a 50-year-old Palestinian living in the city’s Tuffah district, told Reuters.View image in fullscreenThe bombardment of Gaza City has left many of its buildings and apartment blocks completely destroyed.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesHumanitarian agencies have said that aid remains scarce across the territory. The ceasefire was meant to be accompanied by a surge in aid, but Israeli restrictions on what enters the Strip have remained in place.Sam Rose, the director of the UN Palestinian refugees agency Unrwa in Gaza, said that aid is still “way below what is needed”.At least 600 trucks need to enter the Strip each day to begin addressing Gaza’s humanitarian crisis, but aid entry has consistently been below those levels over the past 10 days.“It’s not just the type of items but also the organisations that are permitted to bring those supplies in,” Rose told BBC News. “International NGOs – including many British NGOs – are not currently permitted to bring those supplies in.”Israel has refused to open the Rafah crossing as it accuses Hamas of not upholding its end of the ceasefire deal by not returning the remains of Israeli hostages in a timely manner.Hamas has said that it needs specialised equipment to recover the bodies of hostages – 16 of which remain in Gaza – as many of them are buried underneath collapsed buildings.Hamas delivered the remains of another hostage at on Monday evening. The group has said that despite the violations of the ceasefire over the weekend, it is still committed to the deal.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineUnited NationsJD VanceDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

One image shows a rope fastened around a man’s neck.View image in fullscreenA hospital employee checks the remains of a Palestinians released by Israel under a Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange deal, inside a refrigerated truck in front of the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis in Gaza.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesDoctors in Khan Younis saidofficial examinations and field observations“clearly indicate that Israel carried out acts of murder, summary executions and systematic torture against many of the Palestinians”. Health officials said the documented findings included “clear signs of direct gunfire at point-blank range and bodies crushed beneath Israeli tank tracks”.Eyad Barhoum, the administrative director of Nasser medical complex, said the bodies carried “no names but just codes” and thatpart of the identification processhad started.Scramble to shore up ceasefire as Israel hits Gaza with deadly raidsRead moreWhile there is substantial evidence that many of the returned Palestinians had been executed, it is much harder to determine where the victims were killed. Sde Teiman is a storage facility for bodies taken from Gaza but it is also a prison camp that has become notorious for deaths in captivity. Human rights activists are demanding an investigation to find out whether any of the dead were killed there, and if so, how many.The body of Mahmoud Ismail Shabat, 34, from northern Gaza, bore marks of hanging around his neck, his legs crushed by tank tracks, which suggests he was killed or injured in Gaza and that his body was later taken to Sde Teiman. His brother Rami, who identified the body of his sibling by the scar from a previous head surgery, said: “What hurt us the most was that his hands were tied, and his body was covered with clear signs of torture.”“Where is the world?” said Shabat’s mother. “All our hostages returned tortured and broken.”View image in fullscreenSoldiers lock a gate from the inside at Sde Teiman detention facility.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersSome Palestinian doctors say the fact that many of the bodies were blindfolded and bound suggests they weretortured and then killedduring their detention at Sde Teiman – where, according to Israeli media reports and testimony from prison guard whistleblowers, Israel isholding nearly 1,500bodies of Palestinians from Gaza.A whistleblower who spoke to the Guardian and who witnessed the conditions of detention at Sde Teiman said: “I did witness a patient from Gaza being brought with a gunshot wound to the left chest. He was also blindfolded and handcuffed, naked as he arrived to the emergency department. Another patient, with a right-leg gunshot wound also arrived to my hospital in similar conditions.”Another whistleblower has previously described how patients, all from Gaza, were handcuffed to the beds. They had all been dressed in nappies and were blindfolded.He was told that some patients had come from hospitals in Gaza. “These were patients who had been captured by the Israeli army while being treated in Gaza hospitals and brought here. They had limbs and infected wounds. They were moaning in pain.”He claimed the military had no proof that detainees were all members of Hamas, with some inmates repeatedly asking why they were there.View image in fullscreenPalestinian prisoners in the Gaza Strip at the Sde Teiman detention facilityPhotograph: SuppliedIn one case, he said, he learned that a detainee’s hand had been amputated “because the wrists had become gangrenous due to handcuffing wounds”.Shadi Abu Seido, a Palestinian journalist from Gaza who works forPalestineToday, who was released after 20 months’ detention at Sde Teiman and in another Israeli prison, said he had been seized by Israeli forces at al-Shifa hospital on 18 March 2024.“They stripped me completely naked for 10 hours in the cold,” he said in a video interviewpublished on Instagramby the Turkish public broadcaster TRT. “I was then transferred to Sde Teiman and held there for 100 days, during which I remained handcuffed and blindfolded. Many died in detention, others lost their minds. Some had limbs amputated. They suffered sexual and physical abuse. They brought dogs that urinated on us. When I asked why I had been arrested, they answered: ‘We have killed all the journalists. They died once. But we brought you here and you will die hundreds of times.’”Naji Abbas, the director of the prisoners and detainees department at Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHR), said: “The signs of torture and abuse found on the bodies of Palestinians recently returned by Israel to Gaza are horrifying – yet, sadly, not surprising.“These findings corroborate what Physicians for Human Rights Israel has exposed over the past two years about conditions inside Israeli detention facilities – particularly at the Sde Teiman camp – where Palestinians have been subjected to systematic torture and killings by soldiers and prison guards.”PHR said: “The unprecedented number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli custody, together with verified evidence documented of deaths resulting from torture and medical neglect – and now the findings on the returned bodies – leave no doubt: an independent international investigation is urgently needed to hold those responsible in Israel accountable.”The Guardian submitted photographs of the bodies to an Israeli doctor who also witnessed the treatment of prisoners at the field hospital in Sde Teiman.On condition of anonymity, the physician said one of the pictures “shows the man had his hands tied likely with zip ties. There is a change in colour between the arms and the hands at the level of the zip ties, likely indicating ischemic changes due to excessive restraints.”He added: “This might be someone who was either injured and captured (thus died under Israeli custody) or someone who died due to injuries inflicted after his capture.”Dr Morris Tidball-Binz, a physician specialising in forensic science and a UN rapporteur, said: “A call should be made for independent and impartial forensic assistance to assist efforts to examine and identify the dead.”Contacted regarding the allegations of torture, the Israel Defense Forces said they had asked the Israel Prison Service to investigate. The IPS did not respond to a request for comment.As for the alleged abuses at Sde Teiman and the torture of prisoners, the IDF previously said it treated detainees “appropriately and carefully” and that “any allegation regarding misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, criminal investigations are opened by the military police.”Asked about the claim Palestinian bodies had come from Sde Teiman, the IDF said they “are not commenting on this matter”.At least 75 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023,according to the UN.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

That’s what settlements are designed to avoid. But we were trying for the next best thing: a general acknowledgment of what I’d been through.”Giuffre agreed to a one-year gag clause so as not to “tarnish” the late queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations in 2022.View image in fullscreenVirginia Giuffre with a photograph of herself at roughly the age when she says she was abused.Photograph: Emily Michot/TNS/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockGiuffre died by suicide in April aged 41. Hermemoir, Nobody’s Girl,published on Tuesday, comes amid growing pressure for Andrew to be officially stripped of his titles.Before its publication, the prince announced he wouldno longer use his Duke of Yorkor Knight of the Order of the Garter titles, which are extant but inactive.As King Charles visited Manchester on Monday to show his support to the Jewish community and those affected by the terrorist attack at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on 2 October,pressure was growing on the royal family to go furtherby backing a move to formally strip Andrew of his dukedom through parliamentary legislation.Downing Street would not be drawn on the matter, with the prime minister’s official spokesperson saying the question of legislation was “a matter for the palace in the first instance” and ministers “support the judgment of the king” regarding Andrew’s titles.He added: “The prime minister’s thoughts are very much with the victims and survivors ofJeffrey Epsteinwho suffered and continue to suffer.”Meanwhile, the Metropolitan policewas “actively” looking into claimsAndrew passed Giuffre’s date of birth and social security number to his police protection officer in an attempt to dig up dirt for a smear campaign, after reports in the Mail on Sunday.A Buckingham Palace source said the new allegations were of “very serious and grave concern” and should be “examined in the appropriate way”.They said action was needed because of “what lies at the heart of this, the broader allegations and the issues highlighted”.The Mail on Sunday reported that Andrew had embarked on an effort to smear Giuffre in 2011. The prince’s alleged attempt, on which the officer is not said to have acted, came hours before the newspaper first published the photograph of Andrew with Giuffre.In her book, Giuffre repeats her allegations,published in an exclusive extract by the Guardian, that she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions, including when she was 17 and also during an orgy after being trafficked by the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew vehemently denies the allegations.Nobody’s Girl by Virginia Roberts Giuffre review – a devastating exposé of power, corruption and abuseRead moreGiuffre also claims her legal case against Andrew was strengthened by the royal’s own words in his disastrous 2019 Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis when he insisted he had no memory of meeting Giuffre, failed to apologise for his friendship with Epstein and failed to articulate any compassion for Epstein’s victims.The immediate fallout saw him forced to withdraw from public life “for the foreseeable future”.Giuffre wrote: “As devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel.“Its contents would not only help us build an ironclad case against the prince but also open the door to potentially subpoenaing his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.”The book reads: “Did he really take Beatrice out for pizza on March 10, 2001, as he claimed? If we deposed the princesses, his family members could potentially poke holes in his alibi.“Would his medical records really show that he had a temporary case of anhidrosis (a lack of perspiration), which typically isn’t a response to adrenaline? We weren’t quite ready to sue yet, but this interview gave us a lot more to work with than we’d had before.”Once she went ahead with her lawsuit, she said, the prince tried to hide at Balmoral. “Initially, the prince made it difficult for my lawyers to serve him with papers, fleeing to Queen Elizabeth’s Balmoral Castle in Scotland and hiding behind its well-guarded gates.”View image in fullscreenIn her memoir, Giuffre accuses Andrew of hiding from court action behind the walls of Balmoral Castle.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAA settlement was reached in 2022, thrashed out over “two days of mediation talks”. Giuffre read it through tears, she said.In it Andrew accepted she had suffered “both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks”. He also commended her and other survivors “in standing up for themselves and others” and said he’d “never intended to malign [her] character”.She wrote: “I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother’s Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been.”Giuffre said she gained “more out of” Andrew than money because she had “an acknowledgment that I and many other women had been victimised and a tacit pledge to never deny it again”.She said she looked forward to using the “Crown’s money to do some good” and said she began developing herSpeak Out, Act, Reclaim (Soar) foundationto combat human trafficking.In her final chapter, Giuffre said: “I don’t regret it, but the constant telling and retelling has been extremely painful and exhausting.“With this book, I seek to free myself from my past. From now on, anyone who wants to know about what happened can sit down with Nobody’s Girl and start reading.”Giuffre wrote in an email to her co-writer Amy Wallace, after a car accident shortly before she died, that it was her “heartfelt wish that this work be published, regardless of my circumstances at the time”, and that it was still to be released in the event of her death.“The content of this book is crucial, as it aims to shed light on the systemic failures that allow the trafficking of vulnerable individuals across borders,” she said in the email.Speaking to Channel 4 News on Monday night, Amanda Roberts, the sister-in-law of Giuffre, said the Met should “100%” reopen its investigation into Andrew.“What else does it have to take? I think the cost of proof is too high for these survivors and we’ve seen that over and over again. It doesn’t matter who is being implicated, there is no separate law for those in power,” she said.In response, the Met said that, on being made aware of the human trafficking allegation in 2001, it was “clear that any investigation would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK”. It was concluded the Met was not the “appropriate authority” to investigate and a full criminal investigation would not go ahead, a decision reviewed and confirmed in 2019.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

This has since fallen to just one-in-five. As a result, it said unemployment was now the single biggest reason for being Neet among men and women.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They found that gardens contained an area three times bigger than all of the UK’s national nature reserves combined.The report found 42% of domestic garden space is paved over (55% of front garden space and 36% of back garden space). Paving over large sections of garden reduces space for nature as well asexacerbating flooding as water has nowhere to go.It also found there were 18m square metres of artificial grass across all cultivated green space. Seven and a half million square metres of this is in domestic gardens.Gardens support more than 50m trees and thousands of species, the RHS said. They host approximately half of the UK’s butterfly, amphibian and reptile species, and more than 40% of bird and mammal species. They also store an estimated 158m tonnes of carbon.There is an inequality in the amount of garden space available to people in regions across the UK, the report found. For example, 41% of London was categorised as garden compared with just 19% in Leeds, 25% in Edinburgh and 27% in Cardiff. It found that more than a quarter of community gardens, which provide green space for people who do not have private gardens of their own, are surviving on budgets of less than £500 a year, and less than 3% of community garden groups own their own land.Don’t even think about decking! How to create a nature-friendly low-maintenance gardenRead moreThe RHS is asking homeowners to stop paving over their gardens and instead use robust planting and permeable paving to help mitigate flood risk and promote the cooling potential of gardens as well as support biodiversity. The charity is also calling on the government to guarantee “space to grow” in all housing and urban planning, so every household has access to a garden.Clare Matterson, the director general of the RHS, said: “That there isn’t equality in access to growing space in the UK reinforces the need to shore up garden provision in the 1.5m new homes promised by government this parliament. It also demonstrates the need to ringfence space and increase support and funding for the community growing spaces that should be considered an infrastructural basic.”Prof Alistair Griffiths, the director of science and collections at the RHS, said: “When people talk about the biodiversity crisis or nature loss they [generally] think about loss of wild plants or wildlife, they rarely think how cultivated plants and trees are also at risk and make a significant positive impact to our lives and our damaged planet. There are over 50m trees growing in UK gardens forming a vital infrastructure that cools cities, stores carbon and supports wildlife.“We urgently need people of all ages to appreciate the UK’s gardens and garden plants not only for their beauty, but also how we can use them to help mend our fragile planet for future generations.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentFloodingGardensWildlifePlantsTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is scheduled to be sentenced in November for the second conviction.District judge Barry Lawrence sentenced Rossi to no less than five years and up to life at the Utah state correctional facility to begin immediately. He noted that Utah has “indeterminate sentencing”, meaning the sentence is given in a range of years rather than a fixed number, and the state’s board of pardons and parole determines the actual release date.Jurors found Rossi guilty of rape in August after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand.Rossi left a “trail of fear, pain and destruction” behind him, the victim in the case told the court shortly before Rossi was sentenced. The Associated Press does not typically identify rape victims.“This is not a plea for vengeance. This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal,” she said.Rossi “uses rape to control women” and posed a risk to community safety, argued deputy Salt Lake county district attorney Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case.Rossi did not testify on his own behalf at his trial. Given a chance to speak before being sentenced Monday, Rossi maintained his innocence.“I am not guilty of this. These women are lying,” Rossi said softly, with a raspy voice.It took more than a decade from the time of the rapes to his convictions. Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit tied to the other case. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on 29 February 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.He was arrested inScotlandthe following year while receiving treatment for Covid-19 after hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos – including the crest of Brown University inked on his shoulder, although he never attended – from an Interpol notice.He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.In his first Utah trial, Rossi’s public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas. Even so, the jury convicted Rossi of the rape charge for which he was sentenced on Monday.The victim had been living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury in 2008 when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within a couple weeks.She testified that Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, to lend him $1,000 so he wouldn’t be evicted, and to take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.She went to police years later after hearing Rossi was accused of raping another woman in Utah around the same time.The victim in that case went to police soon after Rossi attacked her at his apartment in Orem. The woman had gone there to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.Rossi was convicted in that case in September and sentencing is set for 4 November.Rossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before he appeared to fake his death and flee the country. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he also faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRhode IslandUtahUS crimeRape and sexual assaultLaw (US)ScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Biden’s May diagnosis labeled him as having an aggressive, high-risk form of cancer.Biden, 82, has undergone radiation therapy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Radiation Oncology clinic, across the state line from the president’s home in Delaware.An Instagram story from Biden’s daughter, Ashley Biden, showed the former president ringing a silver bell alongside a doctor at the clinic.“Rung the bell! Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses, and staff at Penn Medicine. We are so grateful!” Ashley wrote alongside the video of her father.In cancer treatment, ringing the bell symbolizes progress in a patient’s program and the end of a phase of treatment. Other photos from Ashley include Biden posing with his wife, former first lady Jill Biden, and two of their grandchildren.“Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment. Grateful,” Ashley wrote on one of the images.Radiation therapy has not been Biden’s only recent medical procedure. The former presidenthad surgery to remove skin cancer lesions in September. His spokesperson, Kelly Scully, said he underwent Mohs surgery, a procedure used to cut away skin until no evidence of cancer remains.Prostate cancer isone of the most common types of cancer, with an estimated one in eight men receiving a diagnosis during their lifetime. The form Biden has is aggressive and hadspread to his bones, which makes treatment more difficult than if it were a localised cancer.Concerns about Biden’s mental and physical health were front and center on the 2024 campaign trail, ultimatelyforcing the former president to drop outjust three months ahead of the November election.In the coming days, Biden is slated to receive a lifetime achievement award in Boston at the Edward M Kennedy Institute on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsJoe BidenDemocratsPennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

But Democrats have refused to support the measure without provisions addressing healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at the end of the year.Johnson, in a Monday morning press conference flanked by other Republican congressional leaders including Andy Harris, the House freedom caucus chair, said the reason for the shutdown was to appease Democratic voters, particularly putting blame on the No Kings rallies.“It is exactly why Chuck Schumer is pandering, in this whole charade. We’ve explained from the very beginning, the shutdown is about one thing and one thing alone: Chuck Schumer’s political survival,” Johnson said.The stuffed vote also came after a prominent Republican lawmaker, representativeMarjorie Taylor Greene, on Monday morning criticized Johnson’s strategy, calling on the House to return to session immediately.“The House should be in session working,” Greenewrote on X. “We should be finishing appropriations. Our committees should be working. We should be passing bills that make President Trump’s executive orders permanent. I have no respect for the decision to refuse to work.”The criticism from Greene, who is aligned with the right flank of her party, is a noticeable crack in support for Johnson’s hardline approach from the GOP over an extended congressional recess. Since 19 September, when members last cast votes, the chamber has not been conducting legislative business, although members have staged press conferences.The shutdown, which began on 1 October, has become the longest full government shutdown in US history, and the third-longest when including partial shutdowns. If it extends past Tuesday, it will surpass the 21-day shutdown of 1995-96 to claim second place. Only the 35-day partial shutdown during Donald Trump’s first term, from December 2018 to January 2019, has lasted longer.The shutdown’s impact grew more severe on Monday as the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administrationbegan furloughingapproximately 1,400 federal employees responsible for maintaining and modernizing the US nuclear weapons arsenal. Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, is scheduled to address the furloughs at a press conference in Las Vegas later on Monday, a spokesperson told the Guardian.Kevin Hassett, the White House economic adviser, speculated on Monday, citing “friends in the Senate”, that the impasse might soon break.“I think the [Senate minority leader Chuck] Schumer shutdown is likely to end some time this week,” Hassett said in a CNBC interview. He reasoned that some Democrats had been reluctant to reopen the government ahead of last Saturday’sNo Kings protestsagainst Trump, which drew millions of demonstrators nationwide to rebuke corruption and authoritarianism.This article was amended on 20 October 2025. A previous version said the No Kings protests drew tens of thousands of demonstrators. The actual number was in the millions.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US federal government shutdownsHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsUS CongressMarjorie Taylor GreeneRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

By Monday evening, Amazonsaidall of its cloud services had “returned to normal operations”.In the UK, Lloyds bank was affected, as well as its subsidiaries Halifax and Bank of Scotland, while there were also problems accessing the HM Revenue and Customs website on Monday morning. Also in the UK, Ring users complained on social media that their doorbells were not working.In the UK alone, reports of problems on individual apps ran into the tens of thousands for each platform. Other affected platforms around the world included Wordle, Coinbase, Duolingo, Slack, Pokémon Go, Epic Games, PlayStation Network and Peloton.By 10.30am UK time, Amazon was reporting that the problem, which first emerged at about 8am, was being resolved as AWS was “seeing significant signs of recovery”.However, after reporting further positive progress by late morning in the UK, Amazon still appeared to be struggling to overcome the glitch this afternoon as it acknowledged it was still experiencing elevated errors.“We can confirm significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services … We are investigating,” AWS said in an update at about 7am Pacific time and 3pm UK time.To aid the recovery, AWS said it was putting in place limits on the number of requests that could be made on its platform.Experts said the outage underlined the dangers of the internet’s reliance on a small number of tech companies, with Amazon, Microsoft and Google playing a key role in the cloud market.Dr Corinne Cath-Speth, the head of digital at human rights organisation Article 19, said: “We urgently need diversification in cloud computing. The infrastructure underpinning democratic discourse, independent journalism and secure communications cannot be dependent on a handful of companies.”Cori Crider, the executive director of the Future of TechnologyInstitute, a thinktank that supports a sovereign technology framework for Europe, said: “The UK can’t keep leaving its critical infrastructure at the mercy of US tech giants. With Amazon Web Services down, we’ve seen the lights go out across the modern economy – from banking to communications.”Madeline Carr, professor of global politics and cybersecurity at University College London, said it was “hard to disagree” with warnings about the over-reliance of the global internet on a small number of companies.“The counter-argument is that it’s these large hyper-scaling companies that have the financial resources to provide a secure, global and resilient service. But most people outside those companies would argue that is a risky position for the world to be in.”Last year, airports, healthcare services and businesses worldwide were hit by the “largest outage in history”, caused by a botched software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike thathit Microsoft’s Windows operating system.Amazon reported that the problem on Monday originated in the east coast of the US at Amazon Web Services, a unit that provides vital web infrastructure for a host of companies, which rent out space on Amazon servers. AWS is the world’s largest cloud computing platform.Shortly after midnight (PDT) in the US (8am BST) on Monday, Amazon confirmed “increased error rates and latencies” for AWS services in a region on the east coast of the US. The ripple effect hit services around the world, with Downdetector reporting problems with the same sites in multiple continents.Cisco’s Thousand Eyes, a service thattracks internet outages, also reported a surge in problems on Monday morning, with many of them located in Virginia, the location of Amazon’s US-East-1 region, where AWS said the problems began and where AWS has a number of datacentres.Experts said the outage appeared to be an IT issue rather than a cyber-attack. AWS’s online health dashboard referred to DynamoDB, its database system where AWS customers store their data. Amazon appeared to rule out foul play, saying the root cause was an internal subsystem responsible for monitoring its load balancers, which prevent traffic from overloading its servers.“The incident appears to have been caused by some accident within AWS, rather than being the result of any malicious intent,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London.The UK government has said it is in contact with Amazon over the outage.A spokesperson said:“We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.”The House of Commons’ treasury committee in the UK has written to the economic secretary to the Treasury, Lucy Rigby, to ask why the government had not yet designated Amazon a “critical third party” to the UK’s financial services sector – which would expose the tech firm to financial regulatory oversight.The committee chair, Meg Hillier, pointed out that Amazon had recently told the committee that financial services customers were using AWS to support their “resilience” and that AWS offered “multiple layers of protection”.Explore more on these topicsInternetAmazonSnapchatBankingEconomicsComputingSoftwarenewsShareReuse this content"

It expanded by 1.1% in the third quarter compared with the second, the same as the revised growth rate for that quarter.‘Signs of recovery’ claims Amazon Web Services after internet outage hits many websites and apps – business liveRead more“September activity data showedcontinued weakness in domestic demand, partly due to poor business and household confidence,” noted Kelvin Lam, the senior China+ economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Investment growth slowed, with property investment diving 13.9% year on year in September, after falling 12.9% in August.Consumer demand was still muted, with real growth in retail sales slowing sharply to 3.5%, from 4.1% previously.Industrial production was a bright spot, rising by 6.5% in September, better than expected.Despite the simmering trade war with Washington, trade also beat analysts’ forecasts, accounting for just over a quarter of the headline growth, broadly unchanged from the second quarter – the onset of the Trump “reciprocal” tariff saga.China’s exports to the US fell by 27% year on year last month but shipments to the EU, south-east Asia and Africa grew by 14%, 15.6% and 56.4% respectively as the country diversified away from the American market.Beijing could use this to its advantage in talks between its vice-premier He Lifeng and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in Malaysia this week, and a potentialmeetingbetween the countries’ presidents, Trump and Xi Jinping, in South Korea at a later date.Chinese “export orders have risen quite strongly, which bodes well for future production growth,” Lam said. “The export sector has been performing better than we previously expected despite higher import tariffs.”The headline economic growth figure matched analysts’ expectations, and kept the economy on track for China’s 5% growth target this year. However, questions remain over whether there will befurther stimulus measuresfrom Beijing and local authorities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The market weakened again, with further policy measures needed, analysts said. New home prices extended their declines in September, while the volume of residential property transactions fell by 12.5%.China’s four-day “fourth plenum” meeting – where Communist party leaders gathered to hammer out the country’s next five-year plan – began on Monday.The official Xinhua news agency said that, in a speech at the meeting, Xi “expounded on the party leadership’s draft proposals” for the plan, which will cover 2026-2030.

They could celebrate their decision not to subject themselves to an unspeakably abysmal performance from Nuno Espírito Santo’s muddled team. West Ham, who have started a league campaign with four successive defeats at home for the first time in their history, were shambolic. They created nothing, made bizarre substitutions, defended terribly and had accepted their fate long before Mathias Jensen, with Brentford’s 22nd shot of a horribly one-sided contest, made it 2-0 deep into added time.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreThe mood was one of muted resignation. Apathy has gripped West Ham. Can Nuno, who is yet to win since replacing Graham Potter last month, rouse them? The early evidence is unconvincing. This was as bad as anything under Potter. West Ham were painfully passive from start to finish, remain overly reliant on Jarrod Bowen and will undoubtedly go down unless there is a major improvement in their defending.Brentford, who are making encouraging strides under Keith Andrews, should have had a hatful. Igor Thiago opened the scoring and bullied Jean-Clair Todibo and Max Kilman during the first half. Mikkel Damsgaard, Yehor Yarmolyuk and Jordan Henderson controlled midfield. Andrews, though, thought back to his side throwing away leads at Fulham and Sunderland. “You want that second goal to make life comfortable,” he said. “We’ve been there on the road before. But I did feel pretty comfortable.”By the end West Ham were reduced to Lucas Paquetá hoofing aimless up-and-unders in the vague direction of Brentford’s area. They have wasted so much money. They finished with Callum Marshall, a raw 20-year-old who spent last season on loan at Huddersfield, filling in up front. Callum Wilson, signed on a free transfer last summer, watched from the bench for the third successive game. Nuno suggested there was no issue with the forward. He was more expansive on his worries about his side losing individual duels.“We are all concerned,” he said. “You can feel it from our fans. You can see they are concerned. Then concern becomes silence. Silence becomes anxiety. We have a problem.”View image in fullscreenIgor Thiago fires past Alphonse Areola in the West Ham goal.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesNuno, who admitted West Ham are a long way from developing an identity, considered whether the atmosphere is affecting his players. “We try to ignore it,” he said. “We try to make them comfortable, but we cannot hide ourselves. Mentally it’s one of the aspects that we have to solve.”The sight of row after row of empty seats was humiliating for West Ham’s owners. It was eerily quiet during the opening stages, although perhaps the fans were too busy trying to work out Nuno’s starting lineup to make any noise. Using Ollie Scarles and Kyle Walker-Peters as underlapping full- backs was a mistake. Paquetá as a false 9 in place of the injured Niclas Füllkrug backfired. There was also a rare start in midfield for Andy Irving, who made his home debut a mere 780 days after joining the club.“The idea was that we had to work together, be compact,” Nuno said. The reality, though, was that Brentford carved out chances at will. Every set piece caused problems. Dango Ouattara, a lively presence on the right, and Thiago were guilty of poor misses before Brentford finally went ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kilman, £40m badly spent, failed to deal with a lofted pass from Yarmolyuk. Kevin Schade nipped in and teed up Thiago, whose shot had enough power to squirm past Alphonse Areola.Brentford were denied a second just before half-time, Thiago offside when he beat Areola again. West Ham adjusted for the second half, Nuno switching to a back three, but the level remained low. Passes were overhit and the gaps at the back grew bigger. Schade headed against the bar when it seemed easier to score. Eventually two substitutes combined, Keane Lewis-Potter breaking down the right and setting up Jensen to score emphatically.View image in fullscreenMathias Jensen lashes in Brentford’s second goal at the death.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesNot once had West Ham looked likely to equalise. They finished with 10 men after Konstantinos Mavropanos, one of three defenders introduced at half-time, went down with a muscle problem. Nuno had made all his substitutions.

Given that the Jaguars’ defensehas been spicy at timesunder first-year coordinator Anthony Campanile, the thought was that perhaps Jacksonville could come out with a win that would send them to 5-2 on the season.That was … not how things transpired. The Rams won going away, 35-7, and Los Angeles quarterback Matthew Stafford completed 21 of 33 passes for 182 yards, five touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 117.7. Staffordbecame the eighth quarterback in pro football historyto throw five or more passing touchdowns with fewer than 200 yards; the last to do it was Jameis Winston for the New Orleans Saints against the Green Bay Packers on 12 September 2021.While Jacksonville’s offense had a very tough go against the Rams’ defense, the Rams’ offense was just about unstoppable under head coach Sean McVay. In previous years, Los Angeles’ primary offensive shot-caller has preferred 11 personnel (one running back, one tight end, three receivers) more than any other personnel grouping. Per Pro Football Focus, the Rams ranked first in 11 personnel rate in the 2017, 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023 seasons (and 2017 was McVay’s first season with the team).But with Nacua out, McVay went completely against his own tendencies with a ton of 13 personnel packages: one running back, three tight ends, and one receiver. The Rams hadn’t run a single passing play all season with 13 personnel, and had just eight running plays with it. McVay started to introduce it in week six against the Baltimore Ravens after Nacua was injured with 10:02 left in the first quarter, and all eight 13 personnel plays against Baltimore were running plays.The@RamsNFL's first 13 personnel play of the season was this three-yard Kyren Williams touchdown.This happened about a quarter after Puka Nacua's injury.pic.twitter.com/k4YqU3rRtT— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar)October 19, 2025Against the Jaguars, and knowing full well that he wouldn’t have Nacua – whohas become a top-five receiver in the NFL– McVay leaned heavily into the 13 personnel archetype. By the end of the game, they’d run 24 plays out of 13 personnel. To put that in perspective, the Pittsburgh Steelers led the NFL with 49 plays out of 13 personneltotalfrom weeks one through six.Three of Stafford’s touchdown passes came out of 13 personnel, includingone to Davante Adams, who replaced Nacua as Stafford’s favorite target. Adams caught five passes on eight targets for 35 yards and three touchdowns.Since we’re delving into history, Adamsis the 11th player everto finish a game with three or more rushing touchdowns and 35 or fewer receiving yards. Tight end Shane Zylstra did it for the Detroit Lions on 24 December 2022 (26 yards and three touchdowns), and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs did it (and then some) against the Las Vegas Raiders on 10 October 2022 with 25 receiving yards andfourtouchdowns.The 5-2 Rams now have a bye, and their next game is against the New Orleans Saints on 2 November. They expect Nacua back for that one, and with McVay dialing it up as he is, this is an offense nobody wants to deal with.Even the offensive linemenwere celebrating!MVP of the weekView image in fullscreenPatriots quarterback Drake Maye waves to fans following Sunday’s win at the Titans.Photograph: George Walker IV/APDrake Maye, QB, New England Patriots.Speaking of offenses nobody wants to deal with, how about the suddenly resurgent New England Patriots, who marched to 5-2 on the season following their 31-13 thrashing of the Tennessee Titans. This game was personal for New England head coach Mike Vrabel, whowas fired as the Titans’ head coachon 9 January 2024 following a second straight losing season, but a 54-45 overall record.Vrabel would need Maye, the second-year star from North Carolina, to make that revenge happen, and Maye was all about it. He completed 21 of 23 passes for 222 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 135.9. In this game, Maye broke Tom Brady’s franchise record for completion percentage in a single game with a 91.3% rate, bestingthe GOAT’s 88.5% against the Jaguarson 27 December 2009.Maye wasn’t just throwing underneath stuff, either. He completed seven of nine passes of 10 or more air yards for 149 yards and both of his passing touchdowns, and even the announcers (including former New England cornerback Jason McCourty) weren’t fully ready for Maye to do what he did.Next time I have NE I’ll be sure to tell Josh and Drake I hate them for this lolhttps://t.co/puP8Gq8P2P— Jason McCourty (@JasonMcCourty)October 19, 2025Last week, my esteemed colleague Oliver Connollywent deep on how Mayehas become a Pro Bowl-level quarterback (as I did separatelyin an article and video). After this game, any argument to the contrary would be rather silly.The Vrabel hire has been a triumph for the Patriots, a lost organization in the last days of Bill Belichick in 2023 and under former head coach Jerod Mayo in 2024.As for the Titans, who fired head coach Brian Callahan last week? Not so much.Concidence? 👀pic.twitter.com/ZBFxPIeRIR— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS)October 19, 2025Video of the weekYou may or may not enjoy Patrick Mahomes’ State Farm commercials, but it appears as if Mahomes’ acting chops are starting to pay off on the field. At the start of the second quarter in Kansas City’s 31-0 beatdown of the Las Vegas Raiders, Mahomes appeared to be trying to draw the Raiders offside, yelling pre-snap that “This fucking never fucking works, man!”Then, Mahomes handed the ball to running back Kareem Hunt, who gained three yards on fourth-and-1, extending the drive.This may be the sharpest thing I’ve ever seen. Andy Reid is a genius.Mahomes tries to draw Raiders offsides then proceeds to say “this never works” then snaps the ball and they get the 1st Down 😂pic.twitter.com/KsrWmUUafl— Chase Daniel (@ChaseDaniel)October 19, 2025Not exactly Sir Laurence Olivier, but it’ll do.Stat of the week30.That’s the number of first downs the Chiefs had in that Raiders game … and it’s also the number of plays the Raiders were allowed to run. It’s the fewest plays anyNFLteam has run since the Browns ran just 28 in a 43-0 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 12 September 1999, in the franchise’s return to Cleveland with the “New Browns”.Pete Carroll’s Raiders had no expansion excuses. They gained 85 total yards, and were 0-for-7 in third down conversions. That’s a great way to get off the field before having to run too many of those cumbersome plays.Elsewhere around the leagueThe wildest game of the day took place in Denver, where the Broncos spotted their guests, the visiting New York Giants, a 19-0 lead before going to work in the fourth quarter. The Broncos scored 33 points in the final 15 minutes, becoming the first team in pro football history to score that many points after being shut out in the first three quarters of a game.One sequence seemed to put the nail in the coffin for the Broncos, but Sean Payton’s team managed to overcome it. With 1:08 remaining, the Giants had fourth-and-19 from their own 26-yard line, but rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart hit receiver Wan’Dale Robinson for exactly 19 yards. Not that Dart needed to, as Broncos defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers was flagged on asuspect roughing the passer call.View image in fullscreenBo Nix of the Denver Broncos celebrates after his team’s 33-32 victory over the New York Giants.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesTwo plays later, Dart threw deep downfield to receiver Beaux Collins, and Broncos cornerback Riley Moss was flagged for aneven more suspect pass interference call.That put the ball on the Giants’ two-yard line, and Payton added another yard to that with an unsportsmanlike conduct call for earholing referee Brad Allen (whose legacy is …not exactly great). Dart ran the ball in for a go-ahead touchdown, but kicker Jude McAtamney missed his second extra point of the game, which meant that the Broncos could still win with a field goal.Whichthey did as time expired. And there was your 33-32 final.The Indianapolis Colts came into Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Chargersranked first in Offensive DVOA(FTN’s opponent-adjusted efficiency metrics), and their 38-24 win, which took them to an NFL-best 6-1 record (pending what happens with the 5-1 Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night) did nothing to darken the team’s prospects. Daniel Jones, the former New York Giants first-round bust, continued his amazing career recovery with 23 completions in 34 attempts for two touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating of 113.4. But the real star of the game was running back Jonathan Taylor, who totaled 94 yards and three rushing touchdowns on 16 carries.It’s the third time this season that Taylorhas scored three rushing touchdownsin a game – he did so in week three against the Titans, and in week five wagainst the Raiders. At this rate, Taylor has a decent shot to be the first running back to win an NFL Most Valuable Player award since Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings did it at the end of the 2012 season.Not only did the Browns roll over the Miami Dolphins by a 31-6 score for their second win of the season; they also did so with a remarkable rookie class. The Browns became the first team this decade to have rookies lead them in passing yards (quarterback Dillon Gabriel), rushing yards (running back Quinshon Judkins), receiving yards (tight end Harold Fannin Jr), and tackles (linebacker Carson Schwesinger) in any game.The Browns are still trying to return to relevance, but with a rookie class like this, and an extra first-round pick in 2026 due to the trade that allowed the Jacksonville Jaguars to move up and select Travis Hunter, the future actually looks somewhat bright for a franchise that has spent most of this millennium on the wrong side of everything.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsLos Angeles RamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when he took the flag inthe US Grand Prixon Sunday it heralded the most remarkable resurgence as he waded with a gleeful swagger back into the title fight. Verstappen was down but he is far from out and could yet still pull off what would count as his greatest triumph.Going into the weekend in Austin, Verstappen was still treating the idea of him being a contender against the two lead protagonists, McLaren’s Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, with a certain indifferent levity.Red Bull fined £43,000 after team member tries to tamper with Lando Norris grid tapeRead more“It’s 50-50. You either win it, or you don’t. I don’t really think about it,” he said. He was then still 55 points behind Piastri. After his comprehensive, dominant win at the Circuit of the Americas the gap was down to 40 and Verstappen acknowledged he was definitely in the game.From 104 points down after the Dutch Grand Prix, in four meetings, three of which he has won, Verstappen has taken 64 points out of Piastri’s lead. On the evidence of those four races – Monza, Baku, Singapore and Austin – hisRed Bullcar is now the quickest in the field or at very least on a par with the previously dominant McLaren.He has won on every type of track, including crucially in Austin on a traditional circuit, indeed one with high tyre wear, of the type where McLaren has held the whip hand all season. On this showing the final five races, Mexico, Brazil, Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, will hold no fear for Verstappen.His belief is in part down to the impressive job Red Bull have done in turning round the car, which the Dutchman found all but undriveable with its lack of balance and unpredictable handling for more than half the season, into another all-round race winner. The upgraded floor and front wing they brought to these latter races, which was a gamble by Red Bull in maintaining development after McLaren had long since shifted their resources to the 2026 car, proved inspired. Verstappen is never more formidable than when he has the ride he feels beneath him and the RB21 is now far closer to being that car.Five meetings remain, including two sprint races, and on this form Verstappen knows he has what it takes to potentially win them all. Mathematically that might still not be enough. A one-two over Piastri in all the remaining races (including sprints) would still leave him three points short but it must be noted that Piastri has not finished higher than third since the Dutch Grand Prix. However there are more factors at play than mere numbers.View image in fullscreenMcLaren may need to make a choice between Oscar Piastri (left) and Lando Norris.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesMost importantly there is how McLaren deal with this looming threat. Their efforts to be fair to both drivers and let them race all season have been laudable – and understandable when they had a huge advantage. That has now gone, as has the lead it amassed. In the process Piastri and Norris have taken points off each other and McLaren have intervened on occasion to try to ensure a scrupulous equity to both drivers – a luxury they can perhaps ill-afford with Verstappen steaming up in their wake.The McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, said the team and his drivers needed to stay calm after Austin and that, by sticking to their plans and procedures, results would come. However he also acknowledged they would favour one driver when the situation demanded it.Intriguingly, then, the pressure is now all on McLaren. Verstappen, by contrast, has nothing to lose. There would be no shame in not winning after his season thus far, but he is Red Bull’s No 1 driver with all the experience of closing out at the sharp end of a tight championship fight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2007 their drivers Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso went blow for blow all season, while being stalked by Kimi Räikkönen in the Ferrari, where Stella was his performance engineer.Räikkönen went into the final race of the season in Brazil in third place on 100 points, with Hamilton on 107 and Alonso on 103. In a gripping finale Hamilton suffered with a gearbox problem, Räikkönen won, his third victory from the final four races, and with this late charge took the title by one point. It was only the second time a driver had come back from third in the championship at the season finale to take the title since Giuseppe Farina had done so in the inaugural F1 season in 1950.Next weekend the fight will resume at the Mexican Grand Prix, the scene of an equally compelling three-way title decider in 1964 when John Surtees, Graham Hill and Jim Clark all vied for the honours. Like Verstappen, Surtees had also endured a slow start to the season but made history when he emerged on top. There is every reason to believe Verstappen will be in the mix in Mexico – and for his fifth title come Abu Dhabi in December.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenRed BullMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

The ancient Japanese sport has roots tracing back more than 1,500 years, but this was only the second time that a major event had been hosted abroad. It was a remarkable spectacle inside and outside the sacreddohyoring.Big in LondonView image in fullscreenA sumo wrestler, wearing the traditional topknot hairstyle called theoicho, pictured outside the Royal Albert Hall.Before the start of the five-day Grand Sumo Tournament, the wrestlers, known asrikishi, visited several London landmarks dressed in their silk kimonos. They also posed for official portraits with their hair tied in traditional topknots and showcased their remarkable appetites. Each sumo – some of whom weigh upwards of 180kg – consumes up to 10,000 calories per day, including almost 2kg of rice.View image in fullscreenAonishiki, who fled from war-torn Ukraine to be a sumo wrestler in Japan, walks down Kensington High Street with fans as he goes for lunch near his hotel.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: arikishitries to hail a cab near his hotel at Kensington Gardens.

It is a five-metre wide platform and its construction combines centuries-old tradition with precise engineering. It requires 11 tonnes of soil, plus sand and cement. The surface is pounded with wooden mallets, creating its characteristic texture. Straw bales, known astawara, mark the boundary of the ring. These bales are hammered into shape using old Asahi beer bottles. Above the ring is a canopy, known as theyakata, which is modelled after the roof of a Shinto shrine.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: Workers construct theyakata.

Salt is also thrown by the wrestlers to cleanse and purify the arena, creating a glittering effect under the spotlights.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: thegyoji(referees for the tournament) pour sake into the blessing hole.

The loser is the first wrestler to touch the ground with any part of his body other than his feet, or the first to be thrown outside the ring’s perimeter. Spectators sitting on ringside cushions were forewarned by the event’s organisers that they did so entirely at their own risk. The venue even took out additional insurance to cover the possibility of arikishilanding on and injuring someone ringside.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: Hoshoryu (left) and Kirishima try to intimidate each other as they face up just before starting their bout, which Hoshoryu won.

Arne Slot, a manager lauded for smart substitutions last season, took a gamble in the 62nd minute, making three changes that aggressively shiftedLiverpoolinto a 4-2-4, leaving Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz dangerously exposed in midfield. The gamble initially appeared worthwhile: after rattling a post twice, Cody Gakpo finally delivered a 78th-minute equaliser to breathe some life into the deflated Anfield crowd. But Ruben Amorim remained calm and trusted his vision. Liverpool were undone just six minutes later after Bruno Fernandes’s fantastic cross found Harry Maguire inexplicably alone at the far post, the lack of defensive bodies evident as he thumped in the winner. Slot was hoping for a high-risk, high-reward outcome but ultimately, United’s grit in the second half paid off. Amorim has his critics – droves of them – but his tactics, including starting Maguire, were vindicated to earn United’s first win at Anfield since 2016. Two league wins on the bounce is a first for Amorim at United. Are the wheels shifting? “It’s an embarrassing stat to have had,” said Maguire. “We have to start putting a bit more consistency together. We have set a benchmark.”Yara El-ShabouryMatch report:Liverpool 1-2 Manchester United2Spurs struggle to paper over cracksTottenham began the day aiming to go second, yet ended it pondering all-too familiar failings. Despite dominating for long periods, Thomas Frank’s side created few clearcut chances, reflecting their continued problems at home, where they have won three of their last 18 league games, and taken only four points this season. Mohammed Kudus and Wilson Odobert are threatening from wide areas, but Xavi Simons has not settled and Mathys Tel looks raw, which suggests scoring goals will continue to be difficult, particularly against deep-lying defences. Were it not for an impressive haul of 10 points out of a possible 12 away from home the boos that greeted the final whistle would have been far louder.Matt HughesMatch report:Tottenham 1-2 Aston Villa3Gunners sharpen focus at FulhamForArsenalthis was another day like all the others: the Kind Of Game You Just Have to Win To Be Champions. Maybe one day Arsenal will play a Game You Don’t Have To Win, or a Game You Would Just Quite Like To Win. But not yet. There will be questions of course. One: is it boring to win like winning is everything when winning is everything (answer: no). And two, is there a case of Bukayo Saka dependence here? Saka was both brilliant against Fulham and also the only sharp creative element as Victor Gyökeres battered away and Eberechi Eze had a quiet day. It is hard to see too much wrong in channelling your main threat through a very good, very reliable academy-reared player. Could be worse, eh? Plus Kai Havertz will be back next month and may play ahead of Gyökeres in the Super Vital Games You Really Really Have To Win. Behind all this the key stat is still one goal conceded from open play all season. This is how you win a league. And it’s deceptively hard to do.Barney RonayMatch report:Fulham 0-1 Arsenal4Maresca swats away disciplinary problemsAnge Postecoglou’s misery was Chelsea’s satisfaction. Victory atNottingham Forestwas Chelsea’s third in a row before hosting Ajax in the Champions League on Wednesday. The frustrating thing for Enzo Maresca was he had to watch from the directors’ box, a few rows below Evangelos Marinakis, who departed the arena at 2-0; Maresca served a touchline ban after being sent off against Liverpool and Malo Gusto’s red card late on against Forest, after picking up a second yellow, raised further questions of ill-discipline. Chelsea have received five red cards in six matches, including Maresca’s. The Italian argued there is context behind the sendings-off, in this case stating Gusto was desperate to keep a clean sheet, though in reality the versatile defender needlessly fouled Neco Williams midway inside the Forest half, with the hosts trailing 3-0 and going nowhere fast. “It is something we can do better, but I’m not concerned,” Maresca said. “But, for sure, we can avoid it.”Ben FisherMatch report:Nottingham Forest 0-3 ChelseaView image in fullscreenUnlike Evangelos Marinakis, Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea manager, watched the entirety of their match at the City Ground from the stands.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images5Minteh shows what might have beenAs Anthony Elanga struggled for Newcastle, a player who got away, Yankuba Minteh, showed what Eddie Howe missed out on. After struggling to meet profitability and sustainability rules, Newcastle had to cash out Minteh to Brighton for £30m and Elliot Anderson to Nottingham Forest for £35m in the summer of 2024, a continued source of regret. Anderson has become an England regular and, even if Lewis Miley showed off his talents as a half-time sub, Newcastle’s midfield department is bare beyond Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Bruno Guimarães. Minteh is ideal for Fabian Hürzeler’s high-pressing, quick transition game, his speed a surrogate for the absence of the injured Kaoru Mitoma. He would suit Newcastle too. Dan Burn had a torrid afternoon against his old club; Minteh ran rings round the team he never played a match for. Coincidentally, his time on Newcastle’s books included him impressing on loan at Arne Slot’s Feyenoord.John BrewinMatch report:Brighton 2-1 Newcastle6Guardiola runs rule over Rodri deputiesPep Guardiola said Rodri’s hamstring injury will continue to rule him out for Manchester City’s next two games – at least. “I don’t think so for Villarreal or Aston Villa,” the manager said of the midfielder’s availability. “It’s not [for] long, but it’s muscular and you have to be careful. We’ve tried so many times. We’ve tried to not take a risk, but we have not been able to [prevent more setbacks]. So we will see.” As potential deputies, Guardiola has the returning Mateo Kovacic, whose 86th-minute substitute appearance was a first for City this term after an achilles problem. “Kovacic has a special quality with the ball to keep it, but we cannot forget he came after surgery and a three- or four-month injury.” Nico O’Reilly may also be unavailable for the Champions League trip to Villarreal. “A knock I think,” said Guardiola. “We’ll see.”Jamie Jacksonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Signed from Bournemouth’s sister club Lorient for about £12m and sent back on loan to finish as top scorer in Ligue 2 last season, the son of a prolific striker with the same first name, who helped the French side win the 2002 Coupe de France, already has three Premier League goals and scored twice for France Under-21s last week. “He’s a goalscorer because he smells the chances,” said the Bournemouth manager, Andoni Iraola. “He’s someone who is very aware of the second balls, where the balls can finish. He’s a good finisher. But obviously, he still has a lot of things to improve. The physicality, the rhythm, a lot of things that he has to learn.”Ed AaronsMatch report:Crystal Palace 3-3 Bournemouth8Mbeumo starting to make his markIt had barely been a minute at Anfield before the controversy began. Bryan Mbeumo struck quickly for the visitors but, in the frantic buildup, Virgil van Dijk had elbowed his own teammate Alexis Mac Allister in the head while challenging Mbeumo for a header. Liverpool were furious as United celebrated in front of the Kop, arguing Michael Oliver should have stopped play under concussion protocol, though Van Dijk admitted post-match: “There was still plenty of football left to be played.” The opener cemented a purposefully aggressive start fromManchester United– a rarity from them at Anfield in recent years – and Mbeumo provided the high-intensity pressing and work ethic the club have desperately lacked. For a club heavily criticised for their recent transfer decisions, the 26-year-old is starting to look like an astute bit of business.YE-SView image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo laps up the acclaim from the travelling fans, and Amad Diallo, after opening the scoring at Anfield.Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters9Pereira faces crucial test as woes resumeWill Wolves secure their first league win of the season at home to Burnley or at Fulham? If not, Vítor Pereira could really be in trouble. In losing 2-0 to a once again impressive, upwardly mobileSunderland, it was telling that Wolves did not test Régis Le Bris’s goalkeeper, Robin Roefs, until the 70th minute. Pereira admits that Jørgen Strand Larsen is struggling. The Norway striker is without a league goal this season but, in mitigation, a player disappointed not to join Newcastle in August is carrying an achilles injury and barely able to train between games. Pereira, meanwhile, remains convinced his defensively fragile team will come good. “If in one minute of my work I feel that my players are not with me, that is the end, but I didn’t feel it,” the Wolves head coach said. “I feel they are frustrated but this is a moment when I need to help them.”Louise TaylorMatch report:Sunderland 2-0 Wolves10Burnley reap rewards of Florentino moveIt was a very busy summer at Burnley as they invested heavily in the hope of building a squad capable of staying in thePremier League. In effect, someone was signed for every position; the final arrival was Florentino Luís on deadline from Benfica. The Portuguese midfielder was a shining light in the club’s academy and it was thought he would follow in the footsteps of Bernardo Silva and Rúben Dias by making a big-money move but Florentino’s career had stalled somewhat. Loan moves to Monaco and Getafe did not work out, so he returned to Benfica, needing to prove himself once more, doing so domestically and in the Champions League. At 26, Burnley saw the right attributes; he is energetic, comfortable in possession and rarely panics even in tight situations. His contributions have been impressive and he looks to be a smart acquisition.Will UnwinMatch report:Burnley 2-0 LeedsPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal812192Man City811163AFC Bournemouth83154Liverpool83155Chelsea87146Tottenham Hotspur87147Sunderland83148Crystal Palace84139Man Utd8-11310Brighton811211Aston Villa801212Everton801113Newcastle80914Fulham8-4815Leeds8-6816Brentford7-3717Burnley8-6718Nottm Forest8-10519West Ham7-10420Wolverhampton8-112Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballLiverpoolManchester UnitedTottenham HotspurAston VillaFulhamArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The former Everton manager is poised to replace Ange Postecoglou, who wassacked after 40 daysin charge.Evangelos Marinakiswanted to reunite with Marco Silva, with whom he had worked at Olympiakos, but Silva’s reluctance to leave Fulham during the season and his £13m release clause made the move difficult. The former Manchester City head coach Roberto Mancini was also under consideration and Forest spoke to him but Dyche became the focus.Ange Postecoglou’s reputation has taken a hit that only time and the right move can restoreRead moreDyche has been out of work since beingsacked in January by Everton, where he was in charge for two years. His availability and the absence of compensation make the completion of a deal smoother. Forest are keen for Dyche to be in the dugout for the visit of Porto in the Europa League on Thursday.The 54-year-old was a youth player at Forest but never made a first‑team appearance for the club. He has lived in the area for a long period and is a regular visitor to matches. The Forest legends Ian Woan and Steve Stone have been key members of Dyche’s backroom staff at Burnley and Everton, and it would be popular if they returned.There is an acceptance at Forest that they are in a relegation battle. They sit 18th with five points from eight games afterlosing 3-0 against Chelseaon Saturday in Postecoglou’s final game. Dyche has a reputation for getting teams out of trouble and will need to rebuild the defence that worked so well under Nuno Espírito Santo, who was sacked in September.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestSean DychenewsShareReuse this content"

A statement from his family provided to FOX read: “It is with great sadness to inform you all that Doug Martin passed away Saturday morning. Cause of death is currently unconfirmed. Please respect our privacy at this time.”According to the East Bay Times, Martindied while in Oakland police custodyearly Saturday morning. The newspaper, citing multiple sources close to the investigation, reported that police were responding to a reported home break-in just after 4.15am in East Oakland when a “brief struggle” occurred before Martin became unresponsive after being taken into custody.The Times said the incident began when officers were called to a home on the 11000 block of Ettrick Street, in a neighborhood near theOaklandZoo. Police “simultaneously” received notice that the suspected burglar was having “a medical emergency,” according to a statement by the Oakland police department cited by the Times.A “brief struggle” ensued when officers contacted the suspected burglar, police said. The person then became unresponsive after being taken into custody, according to the department. After receiving medical aid from paramedics on scene, the person was taken to a hospital, where they later died, the Times reported.The Alameda county coroner’s office has yet to release the name of the person who died. Officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave, following department policy. As is customary after in-custody deaths, the matter is being investigated by the Oakland police department’s homicide unit, internal affairs bureau, the civilian-led Oakland police commission, the Community Police Review Agency and the Alameda county district attorney’s office, according to the Times.TheTampa Bay Buccaneers, with whom Martin played for the majority of his career, issued a statement Sunday afternoon:“We are deeply saddened to learn of the sudden and unexpected passing of Doug Martin. From his record-setting rookie season in 2012 to his multiple Pro Bowl selections during his six seasons as a Buccaneer, Doug made a lasting impact on our franchise.”After being selected No 31 overall in the first round of the 2012 NFL draft, Martin made an immediate impact for the Buccaneers as a rookie, making the Pro Bowl and NFL All-Rookie Team after a 1,454-yard, 11-touchdown season.Injuries hampered Martin throughout the rest of his career, mostly spent in Tampa Bay, though he added a second Pro Bowl appearance and 1,400-yard season in 2015, when he was a first-team All-Pro.Despite the injuries, Martin managed to exceed 400 yards rushing every campaign of his career. That level of consistency allowed him to place fourth on Tampa Bay’s all-time rushing yards chart with 4,633 yards over six seasons. He’s also third all-time in Buccaneers rushing touchdowns, with 26.He finished his seven-year career with one season playing for the Oakland Raiders in 2018.Martin was also one of the all-time greats for Boise State, rushing for 3,431 yards from 2007 through 2011, placing him eighth on the school’s all-time rushing list.

Whenever Mourinho visits St James’ Park he takes time to stand by the statue of Sir Bobby Robson outside the Milburn Stand and spend a few minutes paying silent tribute to the memory of his mentor.In 1999 Robson wanted the Portuguese to join him at Newcastle as an assistant manager with a view to eventually taking the top job but Mourinho, who returns to north‑east England for aChampions Leagueengagement with Benfica on Tuesday night, declined.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreInstead, Robson’s former translator turned No 2 at Barcelona kicked off his own managerial adventure the following year with a brief spell atBenfica. Now, after a turbulent stint at Fenerbahce, the wheel has turned full circle and he is back in charge at the Estádio da Luz after succeeding the sacked Bruno Lage last month.The match on Tuesday night will be the 62‑year-old’s 13th competitive appearance on Tyneside as a manager but previous trips with Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham produced only three wins. How he would revel in registering a fourth victory at the expense of a club with which, thanks to Robson, Mourinho has always claimed to feel a strange affinity.“I’m a little Magpie,” he told interviewers in Portugal last month. “The club up there know how much love and respect I have for them. I learned that from Mr Robson.”View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho with Bobby Robson and Ronaldo after the 1997 European Cup Winners’ Cup final which Barcelona won 1-0 against PSG.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockNewcastle’s manager,Eddie Howe, was well aware that Mourinho, then unhappy in Istanbul, cultivated friendly relationships with the club’s Saudi Arabian ownership last season. He would take particular delight in beating Benfica.Outwardly, though, Howe had nothing but praise for the Portuguese on Monday agreeing that Mourinho was “one of the all-time managerial greats”.The Newcastle manager said: “I think you have to say that. Look, I’m not saying it just because we’re playing them tomorrow. I genuinely believe. The impact he made initially in this country at Chelsea was incredible really. He had an aura around him and his teams. Coaching wise, he had a big impact on me.”Quite apart from any personal edge, Newcastle could do with confirming the feeling that they really are much better than their Premier League position. Benfica, third in the Primeira Liga, should represent a useful litmus test, particularly as they appear to be improving under Mourinho and secured a creditable 0-0 draw at the table-topping Porto in their last league game. Now the visitors hope to secure a first Champions League point – or, ideally, points – of the campaign.Mourinho, a Champions League winner with Porto and Inter, maintains Benfica are benefiting from a new, mature version of the Special One. “People change for the better,” he said. “I’m more altruistic, less egocentric. I think less about myself and more about the good I can do for others, the happiness I can spread. I’m in a mature phase of my career.”Newcastle, meanwhile, are in a slightly transitional phase. If their new £70m Germany strikerNick Woltemade has hit the ground running, Howe’s wingers have malfunctioned at times, with Anthony Elanga a £55m summer singing from Nottingham Forest struggling to make the desired impact.“Anthony’s an outstanding player,” said Howe, who could be without Sandro Tonali in central midfield on Tuesday night after the Italy international missed Monday training with a virus. “I’ve no doubt about Anthony’s qualities long term. But he’s going through a settling in period. He’s having to make slight adjustments to his game. I think he’s got a lot more to give.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho at a Benfica training session on MondayPhotograph: Rui Minderico/EPA“But I think that, as a team, we’re close to becoming something more and getting better results.

St James’ Park is a fantastic place to play football. People do not come here to watch the game, they come here to play it with them. It’s not just the stadium, it’s this club, the history, the passion and the fans.“With the economic power they have with the owners now, it’s a team that’s very close to even bigger things. It’s a very special club because of the culture in this region, it’s very different culturally to London and to Manchester. I love playing here. I said to my players: ‘It’s beautiful here and you will feel that atmosphere tomorrow evening.’”Not that he is underestimating Newcastle. “We’re coming up against a very, very strong, very physical team. Uninformed people are misled by their league position but they are a tremendous team. Newcastle are doing everything right.”So does part of the Special One hanker after managing them one day. Mourinho smiled – and demurred. “ I don’t think they need a coach now. I hope that they don’t need one in the next years, either. That would mean everything goes well for the club and for Eddie, which is what I wish.“On top of that, in this moment of my career, there wouldn’t be another club where I could be happier and more motivated than I am at Benfica. I wouldn’t change Benfica for any club.”Meanwhile Ross Wilson, Newcastle’s new sporting director, has presided over the dismissal of Becky Langley, the women’s team manager.

After eight games in the competition, they have let in three goals and not conceded in two Champions League ties and one Carabao Cup game this season.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead more“One-nil to the Ars-en-nal” was a popular chant for Graham’s team, who won the league title in 1989 and 1991. Arteta, who is seeking to end the club’s 21-year wait for a similar triumph, made the point that if victory was everything to Graham, no matter the margin, it remained the case for him.“Yes, it is and especially now,” he said. “In modern football, the margins and the results you see … it’s one goal most of the time. That defines whether you win or not so we have to be happy and comfortable with those small margins and find ways to win.“I’m not so much aware of the detail [of Graham’s team] as it was a different era. But to be associated with successful teams and teams that brought joy to our supporters and the club is, for me, more than welcome.“Collectively, we acknowledge the importance of defending. We know that if we excel in that part of the game, the chances and the probabilities to win more matches is going to be very, very high.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Graham hugs Alan Smith after Arsenal won the First Division title at Anfield in 1989.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesArteta was asked for his reaction toArsenalbeing installed by bookmakers as the favourites for the title. “The only thing that I embrace is when I see the team, the energy, the temperature, the commitment and the quality that they can deliver … it gives me that conviction that we can go all the way,” he said.Arteta was full of praise for Simeone, who has been in charge at Atlético since December 2011. When the Argentinian took over, the club were 10th in La Liga and he would lift them to a fifth-placed finish. They have never come in outside the top four in any of his full seasons.It is possible to see the similarities between Arteta and Simeone; the passionate way that they live the matches on the touchline, their love of unyielding, physical lineups – with gamechangers in particular areas. But Arteta knows that there is a major difference. Simeone has won La Liga twice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can sense that in every single ball, in every single yard, the way that they play. It’s about how they compete and then after how they play.

So why did it happen?The former Tottenham manager made a rash Premier League return, and it will probably be his lastSign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereJonathan WilsonMon 20 Oct 2025 10.40 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 13.34 EDTShareThe weirdest aspect of Ange Postecoglou’s 40-day reign at Nottingham Forest was how inevitable it all felt. The only shock was that he was sacked on Saturday, within minutes of a3-0 home defeat to Chelsea, rather than a day or two later. But by then, it was obvious this ill-starred adventure had run its course; perhaps it was kinder to everybody to bring it to an end. Forest, certainly, had to act quickly if they are to make the most of their first European campaign in three decades.But why was such an obviously terrible appointment made in the first place? What was it that made theNottingham Forestowner, Evangelos Marinakis, ever think that Postecoglou was the right man to succeed Nuno Espírito Santo? They met in July at an event staged by the Greek league to celebrate Postecoglou winning the Europa League with Tottenham, but was it really just that? That they got on well over a glass of wine?Nottingham Forest close to appointing Sean Dyche as head coachRead moreForest exceeded all expectations last season by finishing seventh, but they did so by sitting deep and playing on the counter. It was simple and effective. It got the best out of the two central defenders, Murillo and Nikola Milenković; Morgan Gibbs-White reveled in the freedom given him by a deep-lying midfield platform; Chris Wood had the season of his life, benefiting from the service provided by the rapid wide forwards, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga.That is not Postecoglou football, though, which raises two obvious questions. Did Marinakis really not understand that? And did Postecoglou not understand that? Could an owner, even one as volatile as Marinakis, really have so little understanding of football that he didn’t realise how profoundly unsuited Postecoglou was? Perhaps the idea was that Postecoglou would oversee Forest’s transition to become a more overtly attacking side and Marinakis simply underestimated the gulf in philosophy between Postecoglou and his squad.The issue of why Postecoglou took the job is more baffling. He’s been a successful coach. He clearly understands the issues. At Tottenham, for all his bluster, he amended his style significantly in his final months, grinding out results in the Europa League. But still, being willing to compromise in extremis – and Spurs, as Postecoglou repeatedly pointed out, had an injury crisis – is not the same as undergoing some radical late-career conversion.Postecoglou’s style is about pressing; this is not a Forest squad that can press. His first game in charge was against Arsenal. Four days before that, any thought that Milenković could push out was removed as he was sent off playing for Serbia against England, clumsily tripping Harry Kane as the forward got away from him. In hindsight it appeared almost a cry for help. Postecoglou was typically bullish after starting with a 3-0 defeat. We’d see a team playing the way he wanted them to the following Wednesday, against Swansea in the League Cup. Fortune rarely rejects such hostages: Forest went 2-0 up and lost 3-2, Angeballin excelsis. After which the decline followed its predictable path.Postecoglou gets his payoff. And perhaps that will seem worth it for 40 days of work, such a brief stint that there was hardly time for pressure to build. But that probably ends his hopes of working in thePremier Leagueagain. His last 18 league games yielded just six points. Who would take a chance on somebody with that record?Although his Tottenham finished fourth-bottom of the league, that at least was offset by victory in the Europa League. Memories of his eight wins in his first 10 games plus that success made his record defensible. But his 40 days at Forest have tipped the balance. Postecoglou now exists essentially as a meme, a Baghdad Bob of the dugout, making absurd claims even as the situation deteriorated around him while passive-aggressively calling people “Mate”. Taking the Forest job has torched what remained of his reputation.So whydidhe take it? Was it ego? Did he think he could get this bunch of unsuitable players to play his way? Was it desperation? Did he, aged 60, think – surely wrongly – that this might be his last chance of landing a Premier League job? Or did he feel time drawing in, and think it was now or never? He spoke of how a relaxed and tanned manager was merely one who was out of work; perhaps he just missed the adrenaline. But given how obvious the mismatch was to everybody else, surely Postecoglou must have known what he was up against?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s like a street player’Sid Lowein VillarrealMon 20 Oct 2025 15.34 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 16.53 EDTSharePep Guardiola, the man who coached Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi Hernández, has said that Rayan Cherki is among the most talented players he has seen and is convinced the forward will buy into the team ethic atManchester City.The 22-year-old Frenchman, who has played only seven times since his £30.5m move from Lyon in time for the Club World Cup in June, returned from a thigh injury at the weekend. A five-minute appearance in the2-0 win against Everton, in which he almost set up Erling Haaland for a third goal, has been followed by him travelling to Villarreal for what would be his Champions League debut at the club.And although he urged patience, the manager was at a loss for words to explain Cherki’s qualities, suggesting that the only doubt could be how he settles into the structure and adapts to doing simpler things well.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead more“Rayan is one of the huge stars I have ever seen in my career,” Guardiola said, puffing out his cheeks. “Technically and individually he is top. The question is how he settles and what we are going to do, how he reads the game and every action the game needs. He started at the [Club] World Cup, but then there was some time off. [We have to go] step by step, but the talent he has: I have the feeling that most of the time when the ball comes to him, the situation gets better.“Not all the time he has to play, like, make exceptional things, he has to play just football. But he has something. [Such as] the pass for Erling in the last moment [against Everton], many, many things that he can do.“He is a guy that doesn’t feel the pressure when is going to get the ball. He’s like a street player. He is grumpy – ‘give me the ball, give me the ball’ – when he doesn’t get the ball, you know. He has been a short time here; it will take a bit of time because you have to play with your [team]mates.”Asked if Cherki will fit within the team ethic, Guardiola replied: “Yes of course. These kinds of players are so intuitive, so intelligent. They see everything.”The City manager also spoke highly of Nico González, who looks poised to start in the heart of the midfield. Rodri has travelled to his former club, who are expected to honour him before the game at the Estadio de la Cerámica, but is unavailable with a muscle injury. Guardiola said: “I have the feeling that Nico is getting better and better. We are really pleased with his behaviour and he will get better year by year. He is cultured, open minded, he is a lovely, lovely guy. His mum and dad have to be so proud of how he is as a human being and a player. He has to be himself but when you play with top, top players you always learn. You can see how your game can be better but Nico has to be Nico, for sure.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Actually, wait, no: theywerelaughing now. Laughing and shouting and swearing and scrambling to escape the bench, like someone had set fire to it. Someone like him: 6ft 3in and 15 stone of Uruguayan beef, tearing off his top and leaping over the boards advertising Kicking My Feet, fists thudding at his bare chest while Barcelona’s players chased him, Frenkie de Jong leapt on for a ride, and over on the far side of Montjuic the manager who wasn’t supposed to be there let rip. “It’s football, it’s emotion,” Hansi Flick said.When it’s like this especially. On a weekend when the first 15 seconds of every game weren’t played at all and weren’t always broadcast either – La Liga distracting everyone from the 22-man standstill protests over their unilateraldecision to go to Miamiby encouraging cameras to look elsewhere and commentators to talk about something else – the best was instead saved for the final seconds when attention was actually on the pitch. And there it was all kicking off. Properly, this time.Bayern virtuoso Kane conducts Klassiker as Jobe Bellingham’s slip proves vital | Andy BrassellRead moreJan Oblak made an exceptional 89th-minute save to secure a 1-0 win for Atlético Madrid against Osasuna, Ante Budimir somehow stopped where he never is. Thibaut Courtois did the same for Real Madrid, denyingAbu Kamaraat the Coliseum on 95.40. Antony, who they call the GOAT, scored his first two goals since heading backacross Triana Bridge to Betis, completing a comeback on 93 to draw 2-2 with Villarreal. And it was minute 89 when Carlos Soler might just have saved the Real Sociedad manager Sergio Francisco’s job and did cost Celta Vigo a first win, leaving them aseventh1-1 instead. Before all that, there was the emergency striker rescuing Barcelona, Araújo sending everyone bananas on 92.27.“I asked if he could play in that position,” Flick admitted, a plan occurring to him under pressure. Could he? “If I did, I’d score more goals,” Araújo said afterwards. And although a “nah, I’m joking” followed fast, just as it did when Gerard Piqué used to like saying the solution to those games when the clock just kept running and the ball just wouldn’t go in was tostick him up front soonerand when Sergio Ramos complained about getting bored at the back what withhis “striker’s soul”, there was something in it. This time, at least, it was true.Barcelona had needed it to be. With seven days to go until theClásicoand eight minutes to go until full-time in the other Catalan derby, they were drawing 1-1 withGirona. A gorgeous Pedri goal, out for a gentle stroll in the area, stepping past defenders and rolling the ball calmly through them all into the net, had given Barça a 1-0 lead. An outrageous overhead kick from Axel Witsel soon made it 1-1. And Girona should have taken the lead as well, wasting three clear chances in the first half that were exactly the way you imagine, Barcelona caught with the highest line since César Azpilicueta’s shorts. Now the second half was slipping away, and so too was the top of the table.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowReal Oviedo 0-2 Espanyol, Sevilla 1-3 Mallorca, Barcelona 2-1 Girona, Villarreal 2-2 Real Betis, Atlético Madrid 1-0 Osasuna, Elche 0-0 Athletic Club, Celta Vigo 1-1 Real Sociedad, Levante 0-3 Rayo Vallecano, Getafe 0-1 Real MadridWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Lamine Yamal and Pedri had gone, nothing left to give, and were now sitting silently on the second row of the bench. Raphinha, Ferran Torres and Robert Lewandowski hadn’t been there in the first place, sitting in the front row of the stands. Flick had used four substitutes – Fermín López had gone on, Roony Bardghji too – but there had been no way through. It was time for one more; it was time to send the big bloke on up front, the way Johan Cruyff used to do with José Ramón Alexanko, not afraid to play “like Everton” when he needed to, as one columnist put it. Except that wasn’t exactly the way it happened, and it almost didn’t happen at all, clock ticking past 90 with his sub hardly having a touch let alone a chance.View image in fullscreenRonald Araújo scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner to send Barcelona top of La Liga.Photograph: Javier Borrego/AFP7/ShutterstockWhen the board went up, Flick was sent off for complaining that four added minutes weren’t enough, referee Jesús Gil Manzano flashing one yellow and standing there all make-my-day-punk, challenging the German to make him flash a second, which he did. And that, it seemed, was that. But it turned out Flick was wrong, and when the goal came after just two-and-a-half minutes, it wasn’t booted up to the big bloke or thrown into the mixer. Araújo had been a striker until he was 17, a player defenders would bounce off but also one who “would put my foot on the ball and everything” until he was sent further back, and this was more Lineker than lump it. All about anticipation and timing, a finish of finesse rather than physique, Araújo dashed across the front of three defenders, arriving by the near post to guide it low first time past Paulo Gazzaniga and in at the far post.And then he was off, shirt left on the turf behind him. Watching from by the tunnel, down which he was supposed to have departed, Flick delivered his fist-on-forearm celebration – a “sleeve-cutter” orbutifarraas they call it in Barcelona, named after the Catalan sausage. The subs came pushing and shoving their way out of the bench and flooding the technical area, Pedri and Lamine Yamal embracing in the shadows and the last out. Across the pitch they piled on to Araújo. When the whistle went, they came from the stands too, Torres and Raphinha and the rest celebrating in civvies, the intensity of it all eloquent. “Sometimes you have to win like this,” López said. Sometimes, in fact, it is good to, Flick suggested. And sometimes you just have to win, full stop.Barcelona had needed that. They came into this weekend having beenbeaten by PSG, a better side than they are. Then they had beenbattered by Sevilla. They had not played well against Girona either: despite the win, Pedri said he wasn’t happy with how they had performed, rightly noting that they are failing to apply the pressure that makes the high line work. The doubts were accumulating, the absences too. TheClásicowas coming up, the fear growing that if Kylian Mbappé could time his runs right this time, that line is more porous than ever. A draw against Girona would have put them on the edge, four points behind. Lose at the Bernabéu and it might not have been a stretch to say the title was out of reach already.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had needed it too, the warmth with which they went to him telling. That he started on the bench seemed telling too. Despite initially joining Barcelona’s B team, there has always been a sense of him being the least Barcelona of their defenders, a Uruguayan who for allthe Brazilian influenceadmitted that he had to ask Xavi what, or who, the third man was; the player that Luis Enrique had identified as the one PSG could let have the ball and who had been sent off against them; a centre-back of extraordinary athleticism but who Flick seemed unsure about entrusting to lead a line that required coordination and precision ahead of recovery speed.There had been injuries too, others making a case for inclusion in his absence, and an awareness that he was one of their few sellable assets. At times it has felt like it has been easy to scapegoat him, to profile him as just not quite right somehow, to overlook what he has done and make a target of him instead, to see pressure applied on him for reasons beyond just the way he plays. Not immune to that, he too had wondered if a departure might be best, an offer coming from Juventus. When he renewed his contract it came with a buyout clause that was not so much a deterrent as an invitation. At the end of the Super Cup final, Lewandowski put an arm around his shoulder and told him to stay, at least for now: there will be chances to play, he says; in the summer maybe you can think again.In the summer, Iñigo Martínez went and the Uruguayan stayed, which didn’t end the doubts, the feeling that maybe he wasn’t as needed as he would like to be. Off the back of an international week when he didn’t travel, staying behind to work instead, Eric García and Pau Cubarsí still started ahead of him. Andreas Christensen was introduced before he was. Four men went first, but now in their time of need, the clock running down, there he was sent on a special mission: a striker again, back in touch with the boy he used to be, pulling on his shirt sure he was going to score and telling them so. “They laughed, but so it was,” Araújo said.PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid911242Barcelona914223Villarreal96174Atletico Madrid96165Real Betis95166Espanyol92157Elche92148Athletic Bilbao90149Sevilla921310Rayo Vallecano911111Alaves811112Getafe9-31113Osasuna9-21014Levante9-4815Mallorca9-4816Valencia8-4817Celta Vigo9-3718Real Sociedad9-5619Oviedo9-12620Girona9-136Explore more on these topicsLa LigaBarcelonaGironaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a sentiment that those who have closely followed his progress would recognise. The 23‑year‑old goalkeeper, whomoved to United from Royal Antwerpat the beginning of September, is all about stability and humility.It was Lammens’s second appearance for United and his second victory afterthe 2-0 win against Sunderlandat Old Trafford at the start of October. What was all the fuss about? Then Lammens seemed to catch himself. “I just try to prepare the same way as I’ve always done, treat it like any other game but, of course, you have to be realistic – it’s not like any other game,” he said.Slot concedes Liverpool face challenge after Manchester United’s Anfield winRead moreThe pressure on United finally to win back-to-back league matches under Ruben Amorim; the intense heat on the manager himself; the spotlight on the goalkeeper position after all that has happened with André Onana and, to a lesser extent, Altay Bayindir. It all went into the mix. And that was before people considered that it was comfortably the most high-profile game of Lammens’s career, in which he has played regularly for a single season – last time out at Antwerp.Lammens would acknowledge that the outside noise had been impossible to ignore. And everything seemed to narrow to a fine point when Cody Gakpo equalised for Liverpool in the 78th minute. The defending champions had been undone late on in their previous two league matches – thedefeats at Crystal PalaceandChelsea. But the sample size for them scoring decisive goals at the death has been far larger this season. The momentum was with them. Anfield was rocking. It felt as if they were set to surge to victory.That United resisted, emerged victorious, was down to various factors. Bruno Fernandes’s marvellous assist for Harry Maguire’s 84th-minute header which proved to be the winner was one. Liverpool’s profligacy or, to put it another way, United’s good fortune was another. Gakpo hit the woodwork three times and his 87th‑minute miss when unmarked in front of goal was inexplicable. But above all, there was an energy and a spirit about United.There have been numerous false dawns during Amorim’s near one year in charge. As he and the team look ahead to Brighton’s visit to Old Trafford on Saturday, they have something on which to build; something on which they have to build. “Two wins in a row is something we’ve been looking forward to … to get the momentum going,” Lammens said. “That was a big part of what the coach told us this season – get the momentum going. There’s been quite some disappointments this season, some games that we wanted to take momentum from but we couldn’t.“This could be a start of some good momentum. Especially defending in the last 20 minutes, defending the box and how we throw ourselves in front of the ball … I’m really proud of the team.”Lammens was asked how Amorim had coped with it all; the relentless scrutiny, the questions. “For me, he’s always the same,” he said. “As a coach, he gets a lot of pressure. You can feel it from the outside; you can read it, you can hear it. But he does really good to try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team. He takes a lot of the pressure from us. That’s also what the great managers do.”View image in fullscreenSenne Lammens denies Alexander Isak at Anfield.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAAmorim showed his pragmatic side at Anfield. He ordered Lammens and the defenders to play high and direct at times, even though he had selected Matheus Cunha as a false 9 rather than Benjamin Sesko as a real one. The idea was to compete for second balls, then work some combinations, and the approach drew a dismissive response from Arne Slot, the Liverpool manager in essence labelling United as low‑block, long-ball merchants.It was not entirely fair because United showed assurance in possession, especially in the first half when they created chances, mainly up the right side where Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo linked well. Cunha was excellent. Nobody at United was about to apologise for anything.“We know how Liverpool press, that they’re going to go man-v-man so being realistic, coming to Anfield … it’s quite difficult to build up,” Lammens said. “From the beginning with the defenders, I made the decision that we should get more of a long ball and do it with the second ball even though we didn’t really have a target striker. We did quite good [with it], so that’s how we could still push them away.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a part of the reason why Amorim heaped praise on Lammens afterwards; the latest detail in a whirlwind couple of months.“It’s [been] a lot, of course, from the outside,” Lammens said.“I try to keep my best friends close, my family, and the rest is a little bit like outside noise. Now I’m doing good so it’s all praise. I know and I’m realistic … if it goes not so good it will be all bad commentary.“I think my social media has exploded but they told me [that would happen] before the transfer. It’s just a really good feeling that you get the praise. Also with the wins, it’s a really nice feeling.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Athapaththu, calm amid the storm, finished with career-best figures of four for 42.The drama began with Rabeya Khan trapped leg-before off the first ball, followed by a run out next delivery. Then, Bangladesh’s hopes sank when their captain, Nigar Sultana, danced down the track only to find long-off lurking. When Marufa Akter was adjudged lbw next ball, Athapaththu had conjured the unthinkable, defending nine with a single run conceded in the over.“We handled the pressure well. We knew that if we took the game deep, teams could crumble,” Athapaththu said. “It wasn’t perfect, batting collapses and dropped catches hurt us, but luck smiled at us today.”For once, fortune favoured Sri Lanka, whose campaign had been marred by rain, missed chances and misfiring batters. Hasini Perera, who struck her maiden one-day international half-century, made 85 off 99 balls, peppered with 13 fours and a six. She was the backbone of Sri Lanka’s 202 all out as she reached the milestone of 1,000 runs in ODIs. A 74-run partnership with Nilakshika de Silva gave Sri Lanka a solid launch pad, before another collapse saw six wickets fall for 28 runs.Even so, the Sri Lankans held their nerve in the death overs to seal the win and climb to sixth in the standings. With four points, they are level with New Zealand and India, although will need results to go in their favour to grab the last semi-final spot. Australia, South Africa and England have already booked their places in the last four.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But sources say a key factor in the decision was fears that Maccabi fans could cause trouble during their visit.The decision to ban Maccabi fans was made by Birmingham’s safety advisory group and relied heavily on the police’s view of the likelihood and potential sources of violence.Maccabi’s game on Sunday against their Tel Aviv rivals Hapoel was cancelled before kick-off after violent scenes. Israeli police said their officers were injured with “smoke grenades and pyrotechnic devices” thrown on to the pitch. Maccabi blamed their rivals.The UK football policing unit, which leads efforts to drive violence out of the game, will speak to its Israeli counterparts to understand the violence at Sunday’s match.The prime minister’s official spokesperson said on Monday: “We acknowledge events over the last few days and we condemn any violent behaviour. We understand the UK football policing units are reaching out to their Israeli counterparts to gain an understanding on what happened at last night’s match in Tel Aviv.“We all want to ensure that all fans can enjoy the Aston Villa game safely early next month and that’s why the Home Office is working closely with West Midlands police to understand what resources may be required for this to be possible.”One option could be that government funds extra officers to police the event, from when Maccabi fans arrive in Birmingham to when they leave. Discussions are continuing.Ayoub Khan, the independent MP for Perry Barr in Birmingham, said Sunday’s trouble in Tel Aviv showed the ban was right. He said in the Commons: “I know the reality on the ground and I know that there has been a deliberate, disingenuous move by many to make this a matter of banning Jews – to conflate matters of policing with those of religion.“Those who are not welcome in Aston are hooligans that have a long history of violence and vile racism. Chants like ‘F the Arabs’, ‘we will rape their daughters’, that ‘there are no schools in Gaza because there are no children left in Gaza’ – it’s these hooligans that are not welcome.“Can I ask the minister how many millions of British taxpayers’ money is her government offering to overturn the respective expert judgment of the West Midlands police and the safety group.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is set against the backdrop of rising antisemitism here and across the world, and an attack on a synagogue in Manchester in which two innocent men were killed.“It has a real-world impact on a community who already feel excluded and afraid.

Some teams will use a piece of tape attached vertically to the trackside pit wall as a marking indicator for drivers of their grid box.With visibility from the car very limited, especially of the markings on the grid itself, it is a visual aid for the driver to ensure they are positioned correctly for the start. Notably in Bahrain this season Norris placed his car just ahead of his grid slot and was given a five-second penalty.There is nothing in the regulations against a team using duct tape in this fashion but equally there is nothing preventing other teams from removing it. In this case, however, the employee in question had entered what is known as the “gate well area” after the formation lap had begun in an effort to remove the tape, against the instructions of the marshals there. Entering this area when it has been cleared for the start is considered an “unsafe act” and carries a hefty fine.The FIA stewards’ report said a team representative from Red Bull at the subsequent investigation stated that the team member “was not aware of the efforts of the marshals to stop him”.The post-race press conference in Austin for the Red Bull team principal, Laurent Mekies, was delayed as he attended the FIA hearing and he later described the incident as a “misunderstanding”.It is understood this is not the first time Red Bull have attempted to tamper with McLaren’s grid-side markers and the latter looked into a new way of using it at Austin.Explore more on these topicsRed BullFormula One 2025Lando NorrisFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Toronto lost to Kansas City in the 1985 ALCS.Seattle, the only big league team without a pennant, will play in a postseason Game 7 for the first time. The winner faces the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series beginning Friday.The Blue Jays turned three double plays behind Yesavage, two of them to escape bases-loaded jams. That made Toronto the first team to induce consecutive bases-loaded, inning-ending double plays in a postseason game. They’re only the fourth team to turn two in a single postseason game.Shohei Ohtani powers Dodgers back to World Series with two-way masterpieceRead moreToronto also took advantage of Seattle’s season-high three errors. By comparison, the Blue Jays have made four errors in 10 playoff games.Guerrero’s sixth career postseason homer – all this year – tied him with José Bautista and Joe Carter for the most in Blue Jays history. Bautista threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the game.Addison Barger homered and drove in three runs for the Blue Jays, who had lost their previous four games when facing postseason elimination. That streak stretched to Game 5 of the 2016 ALCS against Cleveland and included wild-card round losses to Tampa Bay in 2020, Seattle in 2022 and Minnesota in 2023.Guerrero’s leadoff homer in the fifth made it 5-0 and chased Mariners starter Logan Gilbert. The right-hander allowed five runs, four earned, and seven hits in four innings.Yesavage took a shutout into the sixth. He was charged with two runs and six hits, five of them singles. Five of his strikeouts came on his split-finger fastball, as did both double-play grounders with the bases loaded.The 22-year-old Yesavage threw a season-high 31 splitters. He got 10 whiffs on splitters and five more on sliders.Three of Yesavage’s six major league starts have come in the playoffs. He’s won twice in three starts this postseason after winning one of three outings in the regular season.The Mariners used two walks and a single to load the bases against Yesavage in the third but were denied when slugger Cal Raleigh grounded into a 3-6-1 double play. Raleigh’s first-pitch grounder came off his bat at 101 mph.Raleigh finished 0 for 3 with three strikeouts.Seattle came up empty again with another bases-loaded opportunity in the fourth when JP Crawford grounded into a 4-6-3 double play.The Mariners broke through and chased Yesavage in the sixth. Josh Naylor’s solo shot was his third home run of the playoffs. Yesavage exited after Randy Arozarena’s base hit, and Eugenio Suárez greeted Louis Varland with an RBI single.Toronto took advantage of fielding errors by Julio Rodríguez in center field and Suárez at third base to score twice in the second, when Barger and Isiah Kiner-Falefa had RBI singles.Ernie Clement hit a two-out triple off the left-field wall in the third and scored when Barger homered, his second of the potseason.George Springer started at designated hitter for the Blue Jays and went 0 for 4 with a walk. Springer exited in the seventh inning of Friday’s Game 5 loss in Seattle after he was hit on the right kneecap by a 95.6mph pitch from Bryan Woo.Guerrero was hit by a pitch from Seattle reliever Matt Brash in the seventh. Guerrero moved to second on Alejandro Kirk’s single and was advancing on a wild pitch when he scored on Raleigh’s throwing error.Toronto is expected to start RHP Shane Bieber on Monday. Bieber allowed two runs and four hits over six innings in Game 3, a 13-4 win for the Blue Jays. He struck out eight and walked one as he bounced back from a poor outing against the Yankees in the Division Series.Seattle RHP George Kirby, who allowed eight runs and eight hits, including three homers, over four innings in Game 3, is lined up to start for the Mariners.Explore more on these topicsMLBToronto Blue JaysSeattle MarinersBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

By Monday evening, Amazonsaidall of its cloud services had “returned to normal operations”.In the UK, Lloyds bank was affected, as well as its subsidiaries Halifax and Bank of Scotland, while there were also problems accessing the HM Revenue and Customs website on Monday morning. Also in the UK, Ring users complained on social media that their doorbells were not working.In the UK alone, reports of problems on individual apps ran into the tens of thousands for each platform. Other affected platforms around the world included Wordle, Coinbase, Duolingo, Slack, Pokémon Go, Epic Games, PlayStation Network and Peloton.By 10.30am UK time, Amazon was reporting that the problem, which first emerged at about 8am, was being resolved as AWS was “seeing significant signs of recovery”.However, after reporting further positive progress by late morning in the UK, Amazon still appeared to be struggling to overcome the glitch this afternoon as it acknowledged it was still experiencing elevated errors.“We can confirm significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services … We are investigating,” AWS said in an update at about 7am Pacific time and 3pm UK time.To aid the recovery, AWS said it was putting in place limits on the number of requests that could be made on its platform.Experts said the outage underlined the dangers of the internet’s reliance on a small number of tech companies, with Amazon, Microsoft and Google playing a key role in the cloud market.Dr Corinne Cath-Speth, the head of digital at human rights organisation Article 19, said: “We urgently need diversification in cloud computing. The infrastructure underpinning democratic discourse, independent journalism and secure communications cannot be dependent on a handful of companies.”Cori Crider, the executive director of the Future of TechnologyInstitute, a thinktank that supports a sovereign technology framework for Europe, said: “The UK can’t keep leaving its critical infrastructure at the mercy of US tech giants. With Amazon Web Services down, we’ve seen the lights go out across the modern economy – from banking to communications.”Madeline Carr, professor of global politics and cybersecurity at University College London, said it was “hard to disagree” with warnings about the over-reliance of the global internet on a small number of companies.“The counter-argument is that it’s these large hyper-scaling companies that have the financial resources to provide a secure, global and resilient service. But most people outside those companies would argue that is a risky position for the world to be in.”Last year, airports, healthcare services and businesses worldwide were hit by the “largest outage in history”, caused by a botched software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike thathit Microsoft’s Windows operating system.Amazon reported that the problem on Monday originated in the east coast of the US at Amazon Web Services, a unit that provides vital web infrastructure for a host of companies, which rent out space on Amazon servers. AWS is the world’s largest cloud computing platform.Shortly after midnight (PDT) in the US (8am BST) on Monday, Amazon confirmed “increased error rates and latencies” for AWS services in a region on the east coast of the US. The ripple effect hit services around the world, with Downdetector reporting problems with the same sites in multiple continents.Cisco’s Thousand Eyes, a service thattracks internet outages, also reported a surge in problems on Monday morning, with many of them located in Virginia, the location of Amazon’s US-East-1 region, where AWS said the problems began and where AWS has a number of datacentres.Experts said the outage appeared to be an IT issue rather than a cyber-attack. AWS’s online health dashboard referred to DynamoDB, its database system where AWS customers store their data. Amazon appeared to rule out foul play, saying the root cause was an internal subsystem responsible for monitoring its load balancers, which prevent traffic from overloading its servers.“The incident appears to have been caused by some accident within AWS, rather than being the result of any malicious intent,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London.The UK government has said it is in contact with Amazon over the outage.A spokesperson said:“We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.”The House of Commons’ treasury committee in the UK has written to the economic secretary to the Treasury, Lucy Rigby, to ask why the government had not yet designated Amazon a “critical third party” to the UK’s financial services sector – which would expose the tech firm to financial regulatory oversight.The committee chair, Meg Hillier, pointed out that Amazon had recently told the committee that financial services customers were using AWS to support their “resilience” and that AWS offered “multiple layers of protection”.Explore more on these topicsInternetAmazonSnapchatBankingEconomicsComputingSoftwarenewsShareReuse this content"

Images he shared with the Guardian show exaggerated, stereotype-perpetuating scenes: children huddled together in muddy water; an African girl in a wedding dress with a tear staining her cheek. In acomment piece published on Thursdayin the Lancet Global Health, he argues these images amount to “poverty porn 2.0”.While it is hard to quantify the prevalence of the AI-generated images, Alenichev and others say their use is on the rise, driven by concerns over consent and cost. Arnold said that US funding cuts to NGO budgets had made matters worse.“It is quite clear that various organisations are starting to consider synthetic images instead of real photography, because it’s cheap and you don’t need to bother with consent and everything,” said Alenichev.AI-generated images of extreme poverty now appear in their dozens on popular stock photo sites, includingAdobe Stock PhotosandFreepik, in response to queries such as “poverty”. Many bear captions such as “Photorealistic kid in refugee camp”; “Asian children swim in a river full of waste”; and “Caucasian white volunteer provides medical consultation to young black children in African village”. Adobe sells licences to the last two photos in that list for about £60.“They are so racialised. They should never even let those be published because it’s like the worst stereotypes about Africa, or India, or you name it,” said Alenichev.Joaquín Abela, CEO of Freepik, said the responsibility for using such extreme images lay with media consumers, and not with platforms such as his. The AI stock photos, he said, are generated by the platform’s global community of users, who can receive a licensing fee when Freepik’s customers choose to buy their images.Freepik had attempted to curb biases it had found in other parts of its photo library, he said, by “injecting diversity” and trying to ensure gender balance into the photos of lawyers and CEOs hosted on the site.But, he said, there was only so much his platform could do. “It’s like trying to dry the ocean. We make an effort, but in reality, if customers worldwide want images a certain way, there is absolutely nothing that anyone can do.”View image in fullscreenA screen grab showing AI-generated images of ‘poverty’ on a stock photo site. Pictures such as these have raised concerns over biased imagery and stereotypes.Illustration: FreepikIn the past, leading charities have used AI-generated images as part of their communications strategies on global health. In 2023, the Dutch arm of UK charity Plan International released avideo campaign against child marriagecontaining AI-generated images of a girl with a black eye, an older man and a pregnant teenager.Last year, theUN posted a videoon YouTube with AI-generated “re-enactments” of sexual violence in conflict, which included AI-generated testimony from a Burundian woman describing being raped by three men and left to die in 1993 during the country’s civil war. The video was removed after the Guardian contacted the UN for comment.A UN Peacekeeping spokesperson said: “The video in question, which was produced over a year ago using a fast-evolving tool, has been taken down, as we believed it shows improper use of AI, and may pose risks regarding information integrity, blending real footage and near-real artificially generated content.“The United Nations remains steadfast in its commitment to support victims of conflict-related sexual violence, including through innovation and creative advocacy.”Arnold said the rising use of these AI images comes after years of debate in the sector around ethical imagery and dignified storytelling about poverty and violence. “Supposedly, it’s easier to take ready-made AI visuals that come without consent, because it’s not real people.”How AI monitoring is cutting stillbirths and neonatal deaths in a clinic in MalawiRead moreKate Kardol, an NGO communications consultant, said the images frightened her, and recalled earlier debates about the use of “poverty porn” in the sector.“It saddens me that the fight for more ethical representation of people experiencing poverty now extends to the unreal,” she said.Generative AI tools have long been found to replicate – and at times exaggerate –broader societal biases. The proliferation of biased images in global health communications may make the problem worse, said Alenichev, because the images could filter out into the wider internet and be used to train the next generation of AI models, a process which has beenshown to amplify prejudice.A spokesperson for Plan International said the NGO had, as of this year: “adopted guidance advising against using AI to depict individual children”, and said the 2023 campaign had used AI-generated imagery to safeguard “the privacy and dignity of real girls”.Adobe declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentArtificial intelligence (AI)PovertyHealthCharitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

But even Michael Connelly, the author of the bestselling Lincoln Lawyer series, feared he might fall behind when writing about AI.Connelly’s eighth novel in the series, to be released on Tuesday, centres on a lawsuit against an AI company whose chatbot told a 16-year-old boy that it was OK for him to kill his ex-girlfriend for being unfaithful.But as he was writing, he witnessed the technology altering the way the world worked so rapidly that he feared his plot might become out of date.“You don’t have to lick your finger and hold it up to the wind to know that AI is a massive change that’s coming to science, culture, medicine, everything,” he said. “It’s going to affect all parts of our lives.“But it’s kind of the wild west; there’s no government oversight. AI is moving so fast that I even thought my book might be archaic by the time it got published.”The Lincoln Lawyer novels are a series of Los Angeles-based thrillers in which the defence attorney Mickey Haller works out of his Lincoln car. They have been adapted into a 2011 film starring Matthew McConaughey, as well as a Netflix series.View image in fullscreenMatthew McConaughey in The Lincoln Lawyer.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex ShutterstockNot for the first time in the series, The Proving Ground took some inspiration from real-world events.Connelly said: “One was this case in Orlando, wherea teenager committed suicide, allegedly at the urging of a chatbot. Before that there was a case in England, where a person with some mental health issueswas encouraged [by a chatbot] to jump the wall at Windsor Palacewith a bow and arrow to try to find the Queen.”On the themes of the novel, he added: “Is free speech a human right or mechanical right? In the Orlando case, the judge said he wouldn’t grant a machine human rights. But it’s an interesting question. Is AI going to reach a point that it shares the rights that human beings have?”Connelly, 69, is one of the world’s leading crime writers, his books having topped bestseller charts and sold more than 89m copies. He is also known for the Harry Bosch series, which has been made into a TV show by Amazon. (In Connelly’s fictional universe, Haller and Bosch are half-brothers.)The writer has his own battles with AI. He is part of a collective of authors, including Jonathan Franzen, Jodi Picoult and John Grisham,suing OpenAI for copyright infringement.“The Author’s Guild came to me and said: ‘Do you know that all your books were fed into the giant maw of OpenAI’s training of its chatbot?’” Connelly said. “I didn’t. If we let that go by, it will put every publisher out of business. Authors will have no protections on their creative work. The purpose of the lawsuit is to have proper rules put in place for all levels of use.”He cited chess championGarry Kasparov’s loss to IBM’s Deep Blue in 1997as “one of the benchmarks that led us” to this moment. When asked if authors could go the way of grandmasters, he said: “It could happen, but I don’t think it’d be an improved world.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In Tumbalong park on Saturday, families who had arrived for a free concert for kids meandered around the garish yellow CommBank Tour zone, as a line wound its way into the giant L’Oréal tent. But metres away at the International Convention Centre, inside the halls dedicated to gaming, the corporate influence was more muted.With theglobal gaming industry downturncontinuing with no end in sight, big studios are continuing to keep a wary distance from Australia, with its high cost of living – meaning that even at a conference that screams synergistic brand-o-rama from every pore, indie developers took centre stage. Larger teams were rare; most projects on show were the results of solo developers or couples. And, much like Australia’s gaming scene more broadly, many of them were punching above their weight.View image in fullscreenA still from the upcoming game Mixtape by Melbourne developers Beethoven and Dinosaur, and published by Annapurna Interactive.Photograph: Beethoven and Dinosaur/Annapurna InteractiveThe two Australian games with the biggest backing at the showcase still felt relatively scrappy. SXSW’s game of the year,Mixtape, from veteran developers Beethoven and Dinosaur (who put out theenjoyable psychedelic journeyThe Artful Escape in 2021) and mid-tier US publisher Annapurna Interactive, is a gleeful 90s coming-of-age tale that feels like an Edgar Wright-esque comedy mixed with the animation style of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Set for release later this year, the game is a nostalgic ride through all the best parts of a well-spent youth: skating downhill on a lazy afternoon as Devo blasts off a dinky cassette tape; headbanging to Silverchair on a road trip; sneaking booze into a party, and escaping the cops in a barely controllable shopping trolley. My 20-minute demo had me grinning ear to ear, with at least one absolutely incredible joke involving controllable tongues that made me burst with laughter.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningPro Jank Footy, meanwhile, is the brainchild of theDanger 5co-creator David Ashby and collaborator Tyler Roach, backed by film distributor Umbrella, making their tentative foray into gaming. It’s a ridiculous, arcadey take on AFL that harkens back to SNES-era sports games; after each goal, the losing team picks one of three absurd powerups (seagull attacks, giant players, resetting the score back to nil-all, etc) before play resumes. The live demonstration in Tumbalong park – commentated by Broden Kelly of Aunty Donna, who also appears in the game – drew a small crowd of mostly families, but the brave few who risked humiliation on stage in return for a neat scarf seemed to be having a pretty good time.View image in fullscreenBroden Kelly of Aunty Donna commentates on a live stage demo of Pro Jank Footy at SXSW Sydney.Photograph: Samuel Graves/SXSW SydneyBut there were highlights to be found in games with even less-established backers. One of my favourite experiences on the floor was the hyperkinetic shooterHyper Primate, which casts you as an ape with an assortment of cobbled-together wooden guns, blasting other animals in search of giant floating bananas. The game has an unashamedly amateur look, but the movement mechanics felt absolutely sublime as I slid, dashed and jumped around a jungle arena at dizzying speeds.Another gameplay triumph was solo effortHuedini, a frantic top-down game where you rapidly match colours to avoid or absorb enemies and other obstacles; even after a very brief session, I could sense the game’s simple-seeming mechanics had the potential to build to a brain-melting complexity.The Victorian government’sstrong support for indie developerscontinues to pay off, with multiple projects (including Huedini) funded by VicScreen; my other picks from that cohort wereWay to the Woods, a gorgeous adventure game following a deer and fawn with light-related powers in an overgrown cityscape, and the charming postie puzzle gameLetters to Arralla, which tasks you with deciphering picture-based addresses as you get more familiar with the gentle island community (also, everybody is a root vegetable). There was a surprisingly strong contingent from South Australia, too, from Pro Jank Footy to the intensely satisfying minimalistic cube-rolling puzzle gameToya, which proved a calming oasis in the midst of a busy show floor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Strong projects from small teams includedA Week in the Life of Asocial Giraffe, a point-and-click social anxiety puzzler out of the US;Abyss X Zero, a 3D Zelda-style action game from Brazil; andCrescent County, a pastel-coloured broom racing simulator from a UK-based developer.Battlefield 6 is yet another cliche-ridden war game. We deserve betterRead moreA common complaint about previous iterations of SXSW Sydney was the price tag, with even the cheapest week-long access pass for games costing more than $100. This year, entry to the games exhibition was free on the final day, which meant there were families and kids everywhere. Party games likeCow Chess(a project from a Sydney-based duo which involved neither cows nor chess and felt like a cross between Worms and Super Smash Bros by way of Terry Gilliam) andChained Beasts(a co-op Roman gladiator game, except every player is bound together by chains) benefited hugely from the madcap energy of a sea of children running gleefully for any game they could get their hands on.There were, frankly, too many indie games to play in a day – a nice problem to have. Other parts ofSXSWSydney might be consumed by brand activations, but at least for video games, the indie spirit lives on.Explore more on these topicsGamesSydneySXSWfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This stop-motion adventure wants you to hold someone’s handBex April MayMon 20 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 05.02 EDTShareStop-motion adventure Out of Words was one of the most striking reveals at this year’s Summer Game Fest. While most games are built from code, Out of Words is made from clay, fabric, and glue: a love story literally crafted by hand that even caught the attention of Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima (“The biggest praise we could imagine,” game director Johan Oettinger says.)Oettinger dreamed of making a stop-motion video game since he was 12, when he first played 90s point-and-click claymation game The Neverhood. After years working across films, commercials and installation art, Out of Words became the project to merge these two lifelong passions.View image in fullscreenA handcrafted world … Out of Words.Photograph: Epic GamesThe process of bringing clay to life is as unusual as the game itself. The 40-strong studio in Aarhus, Denmark developed a pipeline of custom scanners and photogrammetry to bring handcrafted assets intoUnreal Engine, paired with stop-motion cutscenes that see animators move puppets 12 to 24 frames per second. “Something magical happens when real materials are formed to represent a character … [it] gives a sincerity that makes the character more real than any other form of storytelling,” Oettinger says.This means that the studio is as likely to be immersed in glue, wood and clay as it is in programming. “Yes – and we’re just as likely to be singing the best Disney songs than to be in the most focused silence,” game developer Mariano Pugliese says. “The same enthusiasm is shared between the puppet maker turning wood and iron into a character and the CG artist adjusting the sets in the game.”The story of Out of Words centres on Kurt and Karla, two young characters on the brink of first love. “I want to tell a story that meditates on the split second where you are looking for the right words to say to the one you are falling in love with, and this is of course almost impossible, especially if you are an early teen,” says Oettinger. “The split second becomes a whole inner journey of light and darkness … in our story this journey is shared between the two characters, the split second becomes their inner world of finding the right words and hopefully coming out on the other side of the game holding hands.”View image in fullscreenA cast made of clay … Out of Words.Photograph: Epic GamesOut of Words is a co-operative adventure controlled by two players, either in person or online, with the journey the game’s leads go on mirroring the players’ evolving relationship.“The co-operative play element is at the very core of the game design,” says design lead Jeff Sparks. “Players experience all the highs and lows together, guiding Kurt and Karla through a world full of unexpected challenges.” Trust is a key theme, while the co-op action has been designed to reflect the evolving bond between the characters.Even its strangest puzzles are built on emotion. One features a giant clay face, Sparks explains: “When Kurt and Karla walk on to his mouth, it twists and shifts around, almost like they’re tickling his lips … at its core it’s just an elaborate door, but with all the creativity and mechanics layered on to it, it comes alive in a way I’ve never seen before.”In the end, Out of Words isn’t aboutbosses, but the adventure of human personal connection. “You must treasure the immense adventure it is to express your love to someone for the first time,” Oettinger says. “The dream is that you experience this and it forges a deep connection between the two of you playing.”The ambitions are lofty: “We basically want you to remember this experience for the rest of your life.” And what could be more fitting for a game made by hand, than to be all about what happens when you finally reach out and take one?Out of Words is set for release on PC,PlayStation 5and Xbox in 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsIndie gamesPuzzle gamesAdventure gamesPCPlayStation 5XboxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No just agreement is possible on that basisMon 20 Oct 2025 13.55 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 20.51 EDTShareIt wasn’t quite the calamity of February, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy was publicly humiliated in the Oval Office by Donald Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance. But the Ukrainian president’s latestvisitto the White House on Friday was, by all accounts, a disquieting experience. Mr Trump’s publicmusingsbefore the meeting suggested that his stance had hardened towards Vladimir Putin, to the strategically significant extent of being willing to sell long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv. But by the time Mr Zelenskyy arrived in Washington, the US president had changed his mind, instead lecturing his guest on the need to make territorial concessions to Russia.So far, so familiar. Since being re-elected, Mr Trump has repeatedly resiled from following up tough talk on Russia with meaningful action. Fauxdeadlinesfor Mr Putin to make substantive steps towards peace have come and gone, treated with indifference by the Kremlin. Last week, the US secretary of war, Pete Hegseth,statedthat Washington was ready to “impose costs” if Russia continued the conflict. But a two-hour phone call at Mr Putin’s request was enough to defuse that threat, and for Mr Trump to once again position himself as a neutral arbitrator between two warring parties.The return of that insidious and amoral framing signifies a moment of diplomatic peril for Mr Zelenskyy. In language that is more suitable for describing a contested real-estate deal than an illegal invasion costing hundreds of thousands of lives, Mr TrumptoldFox News that Mr Putin was “going to take something … he’s won certain property”. Should a plannedmeetingin Budapest take place between the US and Russian presidents – to be hosted by Hungary’s Putin-friendly leader, Viktor Orbán – discussion of a potential carve-up will dominate the agenda, as it did in the failed Alaska head-to-head.That prospect should concentrate minds ahead of a EU leaders’ summit later this week in Brussels. In the wake of the signing of the Gaza peace agreement – in relation to which Mr Putin was careful to offer fulsome congratulations – Mr Trump has taken todescribinghimself as “the mediator president”. In grimly paradoxical fashion, there is every possibility that he will try to bully Mr Zelenskyy into an unacceptable deal that rewards Russia’s aggression, in order to burnish his supposed credentials as a supreme peacemaker.It is critical that Europe provides Ukraine with the resources and staying power which allow it to resist such pressure. Progress isreportedlybeing made on proposals backed by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, which would use frozen Russian assets to secure an interest-free £122bn loan to Kyiv. Such money, however it is sourced, will be fundamental to supporting Ukraine’s defence effort into next year. At a more symbolic level, there are alsosignsof a new determination to find ways to circumvent Mr Orbán’s opposition to advancing Ukraine’s bid for EU membership.As Mr Trump pursues his mercurial path, guided only by vanity, mercantilism and admiration for the exercise of brute force, EU leaders will need to be creative and determined in ensuring that Ukraine’s interests are adequately defended in the weeks and months to come. Mr Putin is playing the US president again, exploiting the absence of a moral compass in Washington. More than ever, a robust counterweight is required on the other side of the Atlantic.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Instead the event showcased liberal-democratic consensusMon 20 Oct 2025 12.54 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 14.36 EDTShareOver the past week or so, it seemed as if someRepublicanleaders were hoping that Saturday’sNo Kings demonstrations– the marches and rallies hosted by a coalition of liberal groups across the country and worldwide – would turn violent. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, called them“Hate America” rallies, a moniker that wasquicklypicked upbyotherRepublicans, and described the No Kings protests as a crucible of potential riots,representing“all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people”. “You’re gonna bring together the Marxists, the socialists, the antifa advocates, the anarchists, and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat party,”he said. Tom Emmer, a representative for Minnesota, described the rallies as a product of the “terrorist wing” of theDemocraticparty. And Roger Marshall, a senator from Kansas,fantasizedthat the protests would require action by the national guard. Others, such as the attorney general, Pam Bondi,musedabout who might be paying the protesters to show up – an idea that seemed to dismiss the notion that anyone might opposeDonald Trump’s agenda for principled, rather than cynical, reasons.At times they sounded almost wistful. Republicans, the president himself chief among them, have been fervently endeavoring to cast those who oppose their authoritarian consolidation of power as enemies – contemptible un-Americans who lack virtue, common values, or the protection of the law. In a world where it was once considered the height of inappropriate partisanship for Hillary Clinton toreferto a “basket of deplorables” among Trump voters or Barack Obama tomournthe conservatives who “cling to guns or religion”, it barely registered as news on Thursday when the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,toldFox News: “The Democrat party’s main constituency are made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.”How can blue states fight back against Trump? With fiscal disobedience | Eric ReinhartRead moreBut no matter how fervently and how deeply the Trump regime appears to hate the American people, theNo Kings proteststhat brought millions to the streets on Saturday suggests that the American people hate them even more. In the densely packed streets of cities from New York to Austin to Oakland to St Augustine, Florida, the massive protests took on a tone of jubilant contempt, with Trump and his various lackeys derided on signs and in effigies, with jokes that ranged from the high-minded to the vulgar. At a protest in San Francisco, I saw one man holding a sign that quoted Walt Whitman, walking near a woman making a vulgar reference to Trump’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. A number of people donnedinflatable character costumes– I saw a starfish, a teddy bear, two unicorns, a rooster and a pickle. They originated fromPortland’s protestsagainst Immigration and Customs Enforcement and national guard deployments as cheeky ways tomockthe Trump administration’sclaimsthat the city was “war-torn” and in need of armed invasion. If the anti-Trump resistance movements of his first administration were characterized by a kind of self-serious righteousness, those of the No Kings era have devolved into irreverence and humor. At times I was reminded of a peculiar feeling I have sometimes had, in the desperate hours after funerals or bad breakups, when I have been crying for so long that I find I’ve started laughing.The No Kings protests have been criticized for their capaciousness and indefinite agenda, and it is true that the demonstrations are the product of several large liberal groups and bring together people whose politics and inclinations would not ordinarily mix. At San Francisco’s protest, I saw the signature red rose of the democratic socialists, the Aztec eagle of the United Farm Workers, and a gold lamé sign held aloft by alargely unclothed manwho declared himself a libertarian – in addition to a motley mix of men wearing the powdered wigs and tricorn hats of the founding fathers, women with white feathered sleeves and hoods posing as bald eagles, and a staggering number of people who wrapped themselves in the American flag.The hodgepodge of symbolism might reflect the chaotic and disorganized nature of the anti-Trump coalition – which, containing as it does the majority of the US’s 340 million people, is rife with contradictions. This has long been a problem for the Democrats: the party fears that their tent is too big, their base is too far from swing voters, and the coalitions of Obama and Joe Biden are too fractured and fragile to ever be maintained. But Trump has perhaps created a new kind of glue that can hold together a different kind of political movement: something that vast swaths of the American people hate even more than they hate each other.Amid the density of references and imagery, No Kings might also indicate a new political posture being born: a left-liberal popular front that mixes principle with irreverence. The aspiration of No Kings, in a way, is to abolish itself – to rebuild, perhaps a little sturdier and more honest this time, the kind of constitutional system in which law and persuasion replace Trump’s model of violence and domination. To put it another way: the people at the No Kings rallies all agree that they want to restore the kinds of liberal-democratic conditions that will enable them to disagree with one another.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Prove them wrong | Judith LevineRead moreAt any rate, the violence that the Trump regime seemed to long for did not materialize. In San Francisco, an organizer speaking into a megaphone urged attenders to ignore any pro-Trump agitators they might encounter, and to not engage with any federal agents. “If you see uniformed feds outside a building,” he warned the crowd, “it’s bait.” Before the marches, some seemed frightened of what might happen – whether Trump-aligned federal forces might crack down with mass arrests, or whether pro-Trump militias might instigate a fight. But the demonstrations seem to have been remarkably peaceful, even cheerful, avoiding provocations and meeting virtually no violence from Trump-aligned forces. In New York, an estimated 100,000 marchers participated in No Kings events across the five boroughs, and an officialTwitter accountassociated with the New York police department reported that there had been no arrests of protesters.Trump appeareddisappointed. On Saturday evening, after the marches had largely disbanded and the millions who had turned out to oppose him went home, he took to Truth Social, his proprietary social media platform, topostan AI-generated video of himself. In the cartoon, Trump –wearing a crown– flies a fighter jet over the No Kings protests, and dumps feces on the protesting citizens. It was a peevish, petulant little display of contempt – the kind of behavior that you would punish in a child but which has become bog standard for the president of the United States. He evidently wanted Americans to know that he hates them.

I doubt that the27 Chicago police officerswho were accidentally teargassed by Ice agents think it’s a golden age and ditto for thegrowing number of US citizensIce hasarrested.Trump is battling the ravages of Time – in more ways than one | Dave SchillingRead moreNor does the US seem like the shining city upon a hill when Ice agentsslam a 79-year-old US citizento the ground in Los Angeles. Nor when Trump’s Department of Homeland Securityposts thuggish videosof stormtrooper-like Ice agents – videos that seem more like Germany in the 1930s than any golden vision of the US as it approaches its 250th birthday.Only a huckster would boast of a golden age when his public approval ratings are deep underwater. According to a CBS/YouGov poll in early October,58% of the US publicdisapproves of Trump’s performance, while 42% approve. Another poll found that62% of Americansbelieve the country is heading in the wrong direction.As part of his golden vision, Trump promised good times for working-class Americans, but74% of the US publicsays the economy is in poor or fair condition and nearlytwo-thirds opposehis signature policy oftariffsand more tariffs. In a big thumbs down for Trump,53% of the publicsays his policies are making the economy worse.Candidate Trump promised that prices would begin fallingon his first dayback as president, butprices havecontinued to climbsince he returned to office, partly because of the tariffs he’s imposed. What’s more, Trump’s tariff mania has created so mucheconomic uncertaintythat job growth hasslowed hugelyunder Trump compared with under Joe Biden. According to Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, there was“essentially no job growth” in September.Trump promised blue-collar Americans he wouldincreasemanufacturing and the number of factory jobs, but factory activity hasdeclinedfor seven straight months, and factory employmenthas fallensince April, too. There’snothing goldenabout any of that.Showing Americans’ increased pessimism under Trump, aWall Street Journal-Norc pollfound in September that the share of Americans who say they have a good chance of improving their standard of living has fallen to just 25%, arecord lowin surveys taken since 1987.The10 million Americanswho will losehealth coveragebecause of Trump’s One Big (Not So) Beautiful Bill Act probably don’t consider this a golden age. Likewise with the22 million Americanswhose health insurance premiums will double on average, often soaring by thousands of dollars, unless Trump and congressional Republicans extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act.Scientists complain that Trump is singlehandedly ending America’s golden age of scientific research withhisdeep,myopiccuts– cuts that could end US leadership in medicine and other vital fields of research.

Nor does one feel golden about the attorney general Pam Bondi not only stonewalling a Senate hearing (especiallywhen asked aboutTrump’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein), but insulting several senators – she called Adam Schiff of California a“failed lawyer”. In the same crude vein, a White House spokesperson slimed the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, calling him“an incompetent slob”. It doesn’t look like transparency or civility are part of Trump’s golden age.Trump can’t possibly feel golden about an August poll that found thatnearly two-thirds of Americansbelieve he is corrupt, with 45% viewing him as “very corrupt”.When Trump spoke at the UN in September, the assembled diplomats must have thought it was a dark age for US diplomacy, not a golden one, when Trump berated them by saying: “Your countries are going to hell.” The next day, Britain’s Daily Mirror ran a front-page photo of Trump with the headline: “DERANGED – World’s Most Powerful Man-Baby.”In his inauguration speech, Trump said: “From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.” But people from many countries are giving low marks to second-term Trump. When Pew asked residents of various countries whether they have confidence that Trump will do the right thing in world affairs, in Canada77% of respondentssaid they had no confidence, while 22% had confidence. In Mexico, 91% had no confidence. In Germany 81% had no confidence, while 18% had confidence. In the UK, 62% had no confidence to 37% who had confidence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s harder than ever to view the US as a bulwark of democracy and freedom, considering that Trump hasembracedVladimir Putin,deployedtroopsto major cities, declared war onleading universities, dispatchedmaskedagents to makemass arrests, andpushedto indict his political enemies. In Mexico, the favorability rating of the US hasplummeted32 percentage points since 2024, to just 29%, while in Canada, it has fallen 20 points to just 34% favorable. In Sweden, the US’s favorability rating is down 28 points to 19%, and in Germany it’s down 16 points, to 33%.I’m sure that many rightwing, “don’t tread on me” Americans don’t see this as a golden age. I can’t imagine they like seeing masked agents snatching people off the streets or Black Hawk helicoptersdescendingon apartment buildings or Ice agents bashing in doors andwindows. That’s not what freedom looks like.Even the country music star Zach Bryan – a navy veteran who calls himself “confused” politically – is complaining, witha new songsaying Ice “is going to come bust down your door” and “the middle finger’s rising, and it won’t stop showing/ Got some bad news / The fading of the red, white and blue.”Trump’s anti-truth crusade is not just an attack on facts – it’s an unravelling of the Enlightenment | Polly ToynbeeRead moreTrump, the salesman and showman, always feels the need to boast – to brag that things are the best ever under him. But his high disapproval ratings at home and abroad suggest many people think he is ushering in a dark age – an age of disinformation and division, of suppressing critics and indicting enemies, of taking one authoritarian, anti-democratic action after another.For a lucky few, it is a golden age. For the craftsmen hired to gild Trump’s Oval Office and his humongous newballroom, it’s certainly a golden payday. As they grow ever richer, the country’s billionaires are no doubt basking in this new gilded age as Trump slashes their taxes, strips away regulations and steersdeals to his buddies(like Larry Ellison, the world’s second-richest person). And Trump no doubt thinks it is a golden age for himself as he grabs ever more power, dominates the headlines, enriches himself further anddecorates the White Housewith ever more gold.But to millions of us it feels like the opposite of a golden age as Trump takes a wrecking ball to truth, democracy and the rule of law. In declaring that it is a golden age, Trump is like the fraudster who says: “I have some wonderful, shiny gold I’ll sell you for $4,000 an ounce.” But in truth it’s just worthless fool’s gold.No one should be fooled by Trump’s delusional boasts.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS immigrationUS politicsTrump administrationUS militaryUS healthcareUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

That deserves our backingSimon JenkinsIt’s a fool’s game trying to understand the president’s true motives, but do our misgivings matter if the outcome is a speedy end to war?Mon 20 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 04.44 EDTShareDonald Trump is sensible and he is right. Basking in glory after his Gaza ceasefire, he was on Friday evening flying to Florida with his entourage of reporters. The drums of war were beating across Europe and Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had pleaded with him for Tomahawk missiles. What was his reply?Trump was clearly fed up. He had told Zelenskyy:go make a deal. He had said, “They should stop the war immediately. You go go by the battle line wherever it is … and both sides should go home. Go to their families, stop the killing and that should be it.” Matter closed. Tomahawks would merely mean escalation and more killing. Get a deal.Given that just last month, Trump had suggested Ukrainecould recover all its territoryoccupied by Russia, his capriciousness must be taken into account. Anything can mean nothing. But modern diplomacy is rarely about ideology or consistency. It is about egos and show. It means to seize each moment as it comes and see what happens.Trump clearly seized the right moment to get Benjamin Netanyahu to stop killing Palestinians. In doing so he opened a door to peace that was shut. Even those suffering Trump derangement syndrome had to approve. Motive is not the issue if the outcome is right.The handling ofUkraineby the west has lost its way in the dusty corridors of Nato, the EU and the UN. Their leaders have long retreated into wishing Zelenskyy well. They give him enough help to keep fighting but not winning. They feel good telling the world how awful Vladimir Putin is, and telling Zelenskyy to hang tough.The hawks will now reply that a ceasefire along the existing frontline will “solve” nothing. It will merely repeat the 2015 ceasefire and concede more territory to Russia. It would reward an outrage against international law and fail thousands of Ukrainians who havedied for their country, not to mention millions of westerners who have paid dearly in their energy bills. A shattered Ukraine is more honourable than a dishonourable peace. What was wrong anyway with a few Tomahawks raining down on Moscow?Both Gaza and Ukraine were territorial conflicts from which the west could theoretically have stayed aloof. History will judge whether the nature and the level of involvement has really served the cause of resolution or lasting peace. In the case of Ukraine, the US and Nato at least reacted with realism and caution. Joe Bidenlaid down firm limits on military assistanceto minimise the danger of escalation. Trump has wisely stuck to that line.View image in fullscreenTrump meets with Zelenskyy at the White House on 17 October 2025.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesNow he says he wants to bring the conflict to an end. We assume that in his conversation with Putin last week he agreed not to give Zelenskyy Tomahawks. We wait to see what Putin will agree in return, presumably so Trump can have another Gaza-style glory fest. If that is the price of an end to this war, it would be cheap. But Putin is not Netanyahu and Trump lacks leverage over him. He is taking a risk.The US’s record in sorting out the world’s woes has been dismal over the past three decades. Trump has long opposed overseas entanglements and protests they are not America’s job. He is reluctant to send troops into harm’s way and never claims for the US a divine mission to save the world for freedom. But if he wants another global cheer he will have to hold Putin’s feet to the fire. That this will be tough is not an argument against trying.The new realism dictates that in situations like these we do not stand on ceremony and spout abstract nouns. We deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. Trump now has to fashion a guarantee of security along Ukraine’s current frontline withRussiathat can satisfy both Putin and Zelenskyy. He has to do the same in Gaza to satisfy Israel and Palestine. Since he refuses to commit American troops to either venture, his powers of persuasion will have to be superhuman if his reputation is to be secured.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is right that allies have so far failed to deliver. He has operated through a ramshackle collection of courtiers eager to do his bidding and with nothing to lose. Their sole virtue so far has been to make progress.Trump’s clear intention is to bring two bitter wars to an end through personal charisma. He relies on his impact on other equally egotistic leaders standing in his way. Ukraine is at stalemate. Trump simply pleads for a stop to the fighting, a stop to the killing and a return of soldiers to their homes and families. We can call it vanity and egotism, but so what?

But better information might just helpMon 20 Oct 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 14.22 EDTShareHow was your Menopause Awareness Day 2025? Did you slip out of your meno pyjamas, sip your meno tea with a slice of homemade flaxseed-added bread and a side order of meno chocolate? Did you rush off to the gym to lift weights then to a pilates class to keep you healthy for ever? Did you remember your MHT (menopause hormone therapy – the now widely accepted term forHRT) pill, patch, gel, pessary, suppository or cream, trusting your GP or private clinic to be prescribing for you and only you, grateful that finally medication has made a difference for you? Or did you think: “How the hell do I know what is right for me?”If you wondered who you can trust, you’re not alone. In anAustralian studypublished earlier this month, more than 500 women aged 45-64 noted “significant scepticism” about the motives of the pharmaceutical industry, along with genuine concern about who to trust and who was after their money at a vulnerable time of life. Now researchers warn that women are being exploited in a “menopause gold rush”.My own menopause was ghastly. If you think hot flushes are bad (they are), try 40 an hour in your 30s while having chemotherapy, then radiotherapy, then failing IVF, and all the while with none of your mates understanding what you’re going through. This was more than 20 years ago, when the menopause discussion was virtually nonexistent – and while we can all be glad things have changed in the past decade, the way menopause is now being sold should raise cause for concern for anyone approaching menopause.Because here’s the thing: menopause is a transition. Just as puberty, pregnancy, parenthood and coming to terms with infertility are transitions, so too is menopause. Yes, it takes time – even now, at 62, I still get hot flushes very occasionally, usually if I’ve eaten too much sugar or am dealing with something very emotional, but I know it will pass. I know what ishappening physiologically, and knowing what is going on internally makes all the difference. (I’m not convinced that menopause toast would, no matter how much flaxseed it contained.)Having been postmenopausal for so long, I became interested in how the focus, and the marketing, is on the transition itself. I’ve spent the past five years researching postmenopause, usually around the later 50s and 60s, when the tougher physical and emotional parts of the transition are largely over for many of us and we move into our vital third act. What emerged from my diverse group of interviewees was a growing awareness of how meno marketing preys on the ageist, misogynist andpronatalist culturein which most of us are raised.Our culture’s ageism tells us that old women are invisible, thatstaying attractive should be our priority and that we lose all value when we lose fertility. This triple whammy is especially painful – and lucrative for marketeers – because it plays to our internalised fears. After a lifetime of being trained to value the male gaze and to believe that being a “real” woman relies on our fertility – and that to maintain both of these things we must stay young and beautiful – well, of course it bites when we age. Unlike other signs of ageing, many elements of the menopause transition can’t be disguised by hair dye, makeup or a clever arrangement of clothes. A sweaty hot flush might be fine forHighland Mayan Guatemalanwomen, for whom menopause means a raise in social status and some of whom call hot flushes the rising of their animal spirit, but for many of us it can be very problematic. We hide our tampons in pretty flowery cases and wear pads to protect others from seeing leaky breast milk, but sweating in public can be both physically uncomfortable and – often more painfully given our societal preference for women to pretend we are men in the workplace – admits to the impossibility of fully controlling our bodies.This fear and concern then feeds into menopause infighting where, instead of MHT and non-MHT camps working together to support us through the transition, they’re pitted against each other as if only MHT will help, or only herbal supplements and weight lifting are the correct way to go. Which creates a real struggle for each of us to find our somewhere-in-between.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In some studies, women report fewernegative physical symptomsof menopause when they live in a society that values older women.Given the market’s passionate engagement with menopause, I’m particularly interested in what will happen when the companies trying to sell us things realise that most of us will be in postmenopause for about a third of our lives – or maybe the market will be too ageist, misogynist and pronatalist to come after our pennies then. We can but hope.And just so you know: while everyone in my research talked about physiological and emotional difficulties in the transition, once they were out the other side – even while dealing with workplace discrimination and the caring demands of their loved ones – all of them also described postmenopause as time of thriving and growing.

The lyrics were nonsensical (as you’d expect from a pair of preteens), but there was a surprising crispness to the rhyming structure.“We got ChatGPT to write it,” the eldest said. This was neither a confession nor a boast. Every 12-year-old knows the AI shortcut. Two minutes earlier, they didn’t have a song. Now they had something ready to perform. Admittedly the improvised melody could best be described as “indeterminate”, but the right prompt could have fixed that.All I could say was: “You’ve missed the fun part!”ChatGPT has its uses, but I still hate it – and I’ll tell you why | Imogen West-KnightsRead moreThey could have spent an entertaining hour with a pen and paper, bouncing ideas and daft couplets around and, most crucially, left their working parent undisturbed. Instead, they skipped straight from inspiration to opening night.This scene seems anything but uncommon. The author Danielle Binkswrote recentlyabout the pall that generative AI has cast over this year’s Book Week, when a visiting author now seems less aspirational and more anachronism. Kids are learning young that AI won’t just do the tedious things, but all the creative things too. Who cares about authors when books can just write themselves?It’s understandable that kids would privilege the end product over the process – our girls’ performance was probably more important to them than the song itself – since society is built around achieving goals and outcomes, ideally by the quickest, least painful means. Such is productivity.But for this generation of young humans, there is a building sense that maximal productivity might mean leaving out the human element altogether. All the skills they are learning at school – maths, writing, even coding – risk being totally redundant by the time they graduate. Why bother learning to do something a machine will do better and faster? Why train for jobs that will no longer exist?For parents of young children, the arrival of AI (and the associated human redundancy) means helping kids negotiate an existential crisis that feels several generations advanced from our own. The career paths that are disintegrating beneath our feet likely won’t exist at all by the time our children are ready to follow them.Our eldest is a keen writer, but she is aware that humans might not be paid to write books by the time she’s ready to be published. And why should our youngest spend hours and years honing her sketching skills when ChatGPT can immediately draw a fox riding a dragon? What’s the point in being creative at all any more?The answer, of course, is because the process is the point. When we stick those crayon drawings on the fridge it isn’t because each is a fantastic work of art, but rather a remnant of a great burst of creativity on the part of our offspring. It’s the process we’re celebrating. A key element of our digital age, with its focus on insta-publishing from blog posts to TikToks, has been the devaluing of craft in favour of immediacy. Why do something well when you could do it fast and still get all the clicks?The arrival of AI is a chance to remind kids that sometimes the end result isn’t the one on the page in front of you. The goal is not to have created, but to be a creator. To be someone who enjoys making bad art for long enough that some of it might one day please others as much as it pleases you. And even if that never happens, maybe the point is the happy – if often frustrating – hours you’ve spent making something pointless.If you want to be joyless about it, you could argue that AI making hard work redundant means we need to help kids value hard work for its own sake. Doing things the hard way is usually the most rewarding way, and as much as we’re drawn to them, we don’t value the easy things.The appeal of endurance sports, I can only imagine, isn’t simply getting to a destination that it would have been quicker to travel to in a machine. It’s about becoming the sort of person who can run an ultramarathon despite the physical toll and hardship. Our efforts may not always change the world, but they often change ourselves.My kids may be in terribly crafted costumes, but the real magic of Book Week is in the pages | Saman ShadRead moreThis is the key to creativity. Creating their own art shows kids the world as they understand it and, in doing so, teaches them about themselves. Creating is about experimentation, about finding new methods and mediums that feel true and meaningful. Creating is also about failure and slowly closing the gap between intention and ability. There are no lessons to be learned from outsourcing that process.The pop stars of the future may be synthetic. Our galleries may fill with AI art. But maybe, as parents, we should seize this disconnection between creating and having created to shift the focus away from the end product. We can encourage a generation of endurance artists.If a computer can make anything, maybe it’s time to stop valuing the thing itself. This means shifting the tense to focus on the moment – on the active, not the passive. Because it turns out the most important part of creativity is not the having done, but the doing.

She was 38. The type of cancer, mesothelioma, is incurable; the best prognosis is a few years, though most people don’t get that long. “You always think of asbestos as a disease from decades ago – affecting men who worked in heavy industry – so to be diagnosed in my 30s is shocking,”she told the Northern Echoin 2022. “I want to see my children grow up but now I have to come to terms with the thought that this might not happen.” Sadly, Bone passed away in November last year, just three years after her diagnosis.For most people, the word “asbestos” will evoke previous eras: dusty Victorian and Edwardian factories; the shipyards of the interwar period; postwar building sites. Yet asbestos was not banned in the UK until 1999. According to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), it still kills around 5,000 people every year. Many anti-asbestos campaigners believe that this figure is a serious underestimate, and that the real total iscloser to 20,000. Mesothelioma has a long latency period: anything from 15 to 40 years. Helen Bone could have been exposed to asbestos at school, at the college where she studied to become a critical care practitioner, or at the two hospitals where she later worked.Bone is part of what’s known asthe third wave of asbestos deaths. The first wave was those who worked directly with asbestos in mines and factories. The second wave was those who worked with or near the material: shipyard and rail workers, builders and other tradespeople, engineers. The third wave comprises all those who have been exposed as asbestos-containing materials deteriorate or are disturbed, releasing millions of fibres into the air, unseen. If the first and second waves constitute a horrific occupational disaster, then the third wave is a vast environmental and infrastructural catastrophe.Around 6m tonnes of asbestos were imported into Britainbetween 1870 and 1999. It remained mostly hidden behind walls and ceilings, laid into cement roofs and pipes, and was woven through textiles. British companies used two especially harmful types: crocidolite and amosite, which were mined in South Africa. British companies,Cape plcand Turner & Newall chief among them, relied on British imperial domination and, later, apartheid, to keep mining costs low and profits high.Thanks to the efforts of anti-asbestos campaigners and trade unionists, the use of asbestos declined significantly in the 1980s and 90s, before it was finally banned in 1999. But the ban was not accompanied by a coordinated removal programme. The start of the new millennium should have been the moment for a reckoning with asbestos. Instead, the material receded from view, its prohibition giving the impression that it was a problem solved. A lot of asbestos has been removed over the past 25 years. There are several decent companies that observe the law and work safely. There are also plenty ofcowboy outfitsthat cut corners and put their workers and the public at risk.A lot of asbestos remains in place and is now far beyond its intended design life.The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012operate on the basis that risk is low if the material is undamaged and left undisturbed. This policy ofin situmanagement is bad in theory and worse in practice. A recent audit by the National Organisation of Asbestos Consultants and the Asbestos Testing and Consultancy Association found that “of 128,761 buildings … examined over a six-month period, 78% had asbestos,” and that “71% of the asbestos items recorded … were damaged”; 30% were in the highest risk category, requiring immediate removal.The regulations place much of the onus on the “duty holder” who is responsible for monitoring asbestos-containing materials and for supplying information to building users in an asbestos management plan. Yet in many cases, rather than living documents, these plans are left to gather dust in a drawer. The regulations do not differentiate by the type of building, even though studies have shown that the risk of developing mesothelioma and lung cancer increases dramatically for those who areexposed when they are young. Nor is there any differentiation by the type of asbestos, even though it is known that amosite and crocidolite are particularly dangerous.There are nations that have chosen to address this challenge. In 2016, the South Korean Ministry of Education ordered that asbestos be removed from all schools by 2027. The government has allocated 2.872 trillion won (£1.8bn) to the programme. The AustralianAsbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agencywas founded in 2013 and is coordinating a multi-phase national strategic plan to eliminate future cases of asbestos-related disease in the country.The HSE does appear to be moving in this direction, though it has yet to set out a clear timeframe. In June, the all-party parliamentary group on occupational safety and health publisheda reporton the legacy of Cape plc. As well as calling on Cape’s parent company, Altrad, to pay £10m towards research into asbestos-related cancer, the group reiterated the need for the government to commit to a national asbestos removal programme.The enduring presence of asbestos in schools, hospitals, housing and various other buildings presents not only a technical and logistical challenge, but also a challenge of political imagination. In the face of compounding social and ecological crises, the demand to remove and rebuild cannot simply be a call to replace what was there before, just without the asbestos. Rather, it implies a different kind of society with properly funded education and healthcare sectors, mass retrofitting programmes, and well-resourced local councils training and running their own asbestos removal teams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Britain’s asbestos disaster is to be addressed, then coalitions of campaigners, trade unionists and tenants’ rights groups will be vital. In the 1970s and 80s, similar coalitions took on a powerful industry and succeeded inreframing asbestos as an urgent risk to public health.

It’s the new normal of the western worldTimothy Garton AshThe likely new government in Prague will add one more state opposed to the EU’s green deal and migration and asylum pactMon 20 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 14.57 EDTShareIf you open your window on a quiet street in central Prague, the first sound you hear is the trrrrk-trrrrk-trrrrk of carry-on suitcases trundling across paving stones, as tourists walk to their hotel or Airbnb. (The Czech capital had8 million visitorslast year.) As they trek around Prague Castle and fill the Old Town bars with cheerful chatter, these visitors – many of them probably unaware of therecent election victoryof rightwing populist nationalist parties – may think this is just another normal European country. And you know what: they will be right.Some more extensively informed newspaper commentators, reaching for an attention-grabbing generalisation, tell a different story. This is eastern Europereverting to type, they say. After Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, now Czechia as well! The truth is more interesting – and more worrying.Thirty six years ago, at the time of the velvet revolution in autumn 1989, people in Prague would constantly tell me they just wanted theirs to be a “normal” country. By normal, they meant like (West) Germany, France, Britain, Spain or Italy. Well, now it is. It’s just that the normality has shifted in the meantime. Back then, the prevailing western normal was liberal, internationalist, pro-European; now it’s increasingly anti-liberal, nationalist andEurosceptic. In the Czech election campaign, the incumbent prime minister, Petr Fiala, tried to mobilise Czech voters by asking: “Do we want to move towards the east or towards the west?” . But what does that mean, when the west is the US president, Donald Trump, and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, not to mention Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland and France’s Rassemblement National, all currently leading in opinion polls?The likely next prime minister, Andrej Babiš, leader of the election-winning Ano (Yes) party, is a billionaire businessman who has used his great wealth to make a remarkable political career. He has already been prime minister, from 2017-21. Troubled by legal proceedings for allegedly corrupt past dealings, he is not a man of deep ideological convictions but an “entrepreneurial populist” who goes where the votes are. Remind you of anybody? Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi perhaps? Or Trump.More extreme are the smaller parties slated to be his coalition partners: the hard-right Freedom and Direct Democracy party, led by the half-Japanese Czech nationalist Tomio Okamura, and the eccentrically named Motorists for Themselves. The Motorists have proposed for foreign minister a former racing driver called Filip Turek who has a deeply unsavoury past record, including being photographed apparently making aNazi saluteout of a car window. That’s horrible; but the country’s president, Petr Pavel, has the constitutional power to block his nomination. And how abnormal is all this really when the standard of normality is toytown Action Man Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, lecturing 800 top American military commanders about the importance of doing press-ups andshaving off your beard?France has historically been the country most given to looking down its nose at the eastern half ofEurope, with what I call intra-European Orientalism. But, even given odd characters like Okamura and Turek, Czech politics are a model of democratic stability compared with French politics today. And Babiš can look like a serious leader when compared with such farcical figures as Britain’s recent prime minister Liz Truss.If we dig a little deeper, we find further evidence of a pan-European patchwork. Thanks to remarkable economic growth since the end of communism, the Czechs now enjoy a per capita GDP which, whenmeasured at purchasing power parity, is the 14th in the EU, ahead of Spain and Portugal. Czechia has thelowest shareof population at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU and one of thelowest unemployment rates. On other indicators, such astertiary education, it does less well.Thanks to the legacy of two great presidents, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the founding president of Czechoslovakia after the first world war, and Václav Havel, the founding president of theCzech Republicafter the cold war, it has democratic pluralist institutions that are fairly solid by today’s western standards. They include a senate that the incoming populists will not control; an independent constitutional court and national audit office; and a still widely respected public service television and radio. These will come under threat from the populists in power, but an active civil society and the country’s president will defend them. If only we could say the same for the United States.Of course, history matters. There are still some notable regional similarities dating from the 40 years of Soviet domination and communist rule until 1989. But increasingly, it’s the legacies of pre-communist history and pre-1914 empires that matter more. Take attitudes to the war in Ukraine. People blithely generalise about eastern Europe being more supportive of Ukraine and hostile to Russia than western Europe. In fact, it’snorth-eastern European countries such as Poland and the Baltic states thatdisplay that attitude, but so do other north Europeans, such as the Finns and Swedes, who have long experience of Russian imperialism. By contrast, countries insouth-eastern Europe such as Bulgaria and Serbia, with their legacies of orthodox Christianity and Ottoman rule, tend to be softer on Russia and less supportive of Ukraine. In this respect, they have more in common with other south European countriessuch as Greecethan they do with, say, Estonia or Denmark. Again, it’s a pan-European patchwork.Don’t get me wrong. Czechia’s right turn is a real cause for concern, particularly for Ukraine. Thanks to the initiative of President Pavel, a former Nato general, the country has led a remarkable scheme to coordinate European purchases of ammunition for Ukraine, wherever in the world that ammo can be found. Last year it sent1.5m roundsto Kyiv and aims to supply1.8mby the end of 2025. This is by far the largest part of Europe’s vital ammunition supplies to Ukraine. Now Babiš sayssomeone else should take it on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Motorists’ backseat driver is the veteran Eurosceptic Václav Klaus. Both Ano and the Motorists belong to the Patriots for Europe group, along with Austria’s Freedom party, Spain’s Vox, Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz and Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National.So let’s not get hung up on regional generalisations. Every European country has peculiar features and strong common ones. The real challenge now is how to get beyond this retrograde new normality to anewnew normal, which will certainly be different from that of the 1990s and 2000s. The message to take home in our intellectual roller bags (trrrrk-trrrrk-trrrrk) from the glorious city of Masaryk and Havel is that we, across Europe and the entire western democratic world, have shared problems and must seek shared solutions.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCzech RepublicOpinionEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s easier for politicians to blame ‘outsiders’Mon 20 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 11.18 EDTShareEvery few weeks, another announcement. Immigrants must dothisto earn the right to stay in the UK. Others must dothatif they are to be allowed to work in the UK. The demands grow more punitive and absurd, like the whiteboard of a meeting where everyone agreed there were no bad ideas. Voluntary work! A decade to receive citizenship! Hear me out: English A-levels!These are all real policies and pledges. Migrant NHS doctors for example, labouring for long work daysbeyond what they are paidfor will now have toprove that they “contribute to society”to earn permanent settlement in the UK. The benchmark for that contribution is volunteer work (sorry,morevolunteer work) in the community. The five-year route to settlement is now being extended to 10, to make absolutely sure that in addition to being in work, paying taxes, making national insurance contributions and paying a hefty charge to use the NHS, you’re not taking the piss. The latest demand is that some migrants must be able to speak English to A-level standard because, according to home secretary Shabana Mahmood, “it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life”.I should pause here to explain the English requirements that are already in place, and who this concerns. The migrants this policy applies to are in the “skilled worker”, “high-potential individual” and “scale up” categories, which allow companies to recruit talented individuals for skilled roles. There is already a test which proves that these individuals can broadly get by – it’s called a job interview. Besides, the visas associated with these categories already require people to be able to speak English to GCSE level. Is it now important that applicants must be able to analyse the form of anextract from The Woman in Black? I’m not quite sure. I do not have an English A-level, likethe vast majority of peoplein the UK, who somehow have not crashed the economy for lack of that qualification.You see, A-level English capability is obviously not a serious or carefully considered benchmark, but an opportunity to say some strong stuff about “coming here and not speaking our language”. Like so many political interventions, this one is based on elision, on invoking a lumpen grunting blob of immigrants who can’t and won’t speak English, won’t “play their part” and must be constantly subject to new crackdowns to prove their worth and their assimilation.There is an entire industry surrounding the UK’s existing residency and citizenship requirements, fromtests about Boudiccaand Elizabethan poets to English-language tests where you must converse at a high level with an examiner, as well as other written and spoken exams that feed into UK embassies and visa processing centres across the world. But we have now entered the territory of unreality, where there are ever-more announcements whose sole purpose is to give a sense that a crisis is being handled.The supposedly unifying thread of all these new policies is “integration”: this mythical concept that has taken on the quality of a religious ideal. But let’s talk about all the ways integration happens, and whether, in fact, it is even something that is on offer for all, not just migrants. Integration is based on facilitating interaction and enmeshment in a society. It depends upon the children’scentrethat links parents to others in the community and pools advice and resources. It depends on the libraries that provide literature and history and local knowledge. It depends onyouth clubsandmidwife visitsandcommunity centresand public-sector workers who are not so burnt out at the end of a day working in under-resourced schools and hospitals that they have no bandwidth to volunteer their work in their communities.Yet all of these services have been hollowed out by years of austerity, pushing people back into their own small networks and atomised lives. How integrated do you feel on a regular basis? Do you have an extended society of neighbours and drop-in centres and free spaces that haven’t been sold off for development where you can spend time with other people? I doubt it. Britain really is that island of strangers, yet the sense of social alienation that is now a quintessentially contemporary British experience has been forged by economic and political decisions, not immigrants.View image in fullscreenMarchers at the Unite the Kingdom rally in London, September 2025.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty ImagesAt the same time, we have started building our own bubbles, exacerbating this sense of isolation. We don’t all consume the same media any more, and mobile phones and livestreaming have allowed for the creation of infinite personalised silos of existence. Modernity and austerity combine to fracture collective experience but, well, who would want to reckon with these histories? What political establishment has any interest in the hard work of tackling what can be done to address that fraying of the national fabric, when you can erect some ideal of an integrated society that does not exist, and lay its arbitrary expectations on immigrants who must now alone prop up the delusion that the problem isn’t in the place they are coming to, but in them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toOpinion UKFree daily newsletterSee things from another point of view with our daily selection of opinion pieces.

The author of Australia, A History: How an ancient land became a great democracy. And the one who praised Viktor Orbán in his speech at the Hungarian conference of Conservative Political Action Network, or Cpac, the same Viktor Orbán who is accused of steadily destroying democracy in Hungary.There is one Tony Abbott but two faces. At the same Cpac conference in Hungary, he stated: “Trump 1.0 and Brexit were popular revolts that couldn’t quite drain the swamp. We have to hope that Trump 2.0 will be more successful, lest resistance to moral vanity projects be further discredited.” It’s as plain as daylight that US president Trump’s administration is trying to dismantle democracy in the US, so the question is, what is it that Abbott is hoping will be more “successful”?Conservative Liberals want to use immigration to bludgeon Labor. But it’s bad politics, and bad on principle | Tom McIlroyRead moreThe answer is white Christian nationalism, albeit an eccentric Catholic, parochial version expounded by the right kind of immigrant that Abbott extolls in his speeches at Cpac, white and British. Abbott was an acolyte of Bob Santamaria, who led the traditionalist conservative Catholic and anti-communist movement in Australia and was a founder of the Democratic Labor party, which split from the Australian Labor party in the 1950s and kept them out of power until 1972.Frank Bongiorno, professor of history at the Australian National University, judges the book highly: Abbott “has done a good job with Australia: A History. There are places where he has done a very good job.” When I read in the introduction that Abbott attributed the term “fire-stick farming” to palaeontologist and environmentalist Tim Flannery, rather than historian Geoffrey Blainey, my suspicions were aroused. In 1975, in The Triumph of the Nomads, Blainey argued that “firestick farming” was “a symbol of their technology and often a sign of their achievement” and completely transformed the continent, an idea pursued rigorously by Bill Gammage in The Greatest Estate on Earth. Flannery, on the other hand, argued in The Future Eaters that Aboriginal people caused the extinction of the megafauna, a theory long since overturned by evidence.I have several theories about the blend of fact and error, evidence and myth, ideology and history that Abbott weaves together when claiming Australia as “the world’s most successful immigrant nation” with quite a few counter-arguments to follow. I dismissed the possibility that the book was written by AI or by volunteers at the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation or the Institute of Public Affairs.Recasting Welcome to Country as an inherently divisive and unpatriotic ritualBlainey wrote the congratulatory preface, and I returned to this to try to understand the contradictions disguised in some “very good” history. There is indeed some “very good” historical writing in this book. Yet I was left asking why, when it sits alongside sloppy rhetorical arguments that are not entirely supported by the facts.In concluding his chapter on the 1980s, when the second greatest mining boom created great wealth accompanied by financial incompetence and crime, and the rise of female entrepreneurs and an Aboriginal middle class, he writes: “This was the new Australia, becoming less convinced about its British foundation and increasingly celebrating its immigrant character.”Yet, just two pages into his chapter on the emergence of conflicts about multiculturalism and immigration in the 2000s, he cites the FitzGerald report, Immigration – A Commitment to Australia. The recommendation Abbott lauds is this: “linking the grant of citizenship with a declaration to respect the fundamental principles and institutions in Australian society”. This is followed by Newspoll data from August 1988: “77 per cent of respondents believed that Asian migration should be slowed.” In a 1984 speech at a Rotary conference in Warrnambool, Blainey argued that the pace of Asian immigration was too high and not supported by most Australians.The “Blainey Debate” continues today and is polarised broadly into two camps: those opposed to immigration of non-whites, multiculturalism and non-whites in general, and those who support an immigration policy that is non-racist and a multicultural Australia.Australia: A History by Tony Abbott review – mostly celebratory account of ‘a land built by heroes’ | Frank BongiornoRead moreThe opposing street protest camps on the streets on Sunday-last represent the extremes of this national argument, the March for Australia flag-bearing mob versus the anti-racist mob.Abbott slips and slides with the term “immigrants” but which immigrants are never identified, except by their absence from grand notions of British traditions. This is exactly the intent though: to make the case for “the most successful immigrant nation” while constantly referencing its British roots, as FitzGerald did, as the reason for this valorised success. By cleverly recounting a “good”, even “very good” account of Australia’s history, even with its many flaws and overreach, the assertions he makes at Cpac conferences around the globe, in London, Hungary and Brisbane, appear reasonable. They are repeated in almost statesman-like language in Chapter 18, “Drifting Backwards”.His account of the many years of debate on constitutional recognition ofIndigenous Australians, which, for a brief moment in our history, he deviously supported, is studded with half truths and alternative facts. He concludes, in the style of Steve Bannon: “Half a century on from the Indigenous referendum in which 90 per cent had votedfor equality, this time, just over 60 per cent ultimately votedagainst inequality.” He then derides “official enthusiasm for acknowledging ‘country’ on every official occasion – as if it belongs more to some of us than to all of us”.This is not just a misunderstanding of the fact that the traditional country of a specific Aboriginal group belonging to a limited area is what is being acknowledged, not the entire territory within the Australian national boundaries, but a deliberate and devious recasting of Welcome to Country as an inherently divisive and unpatriotic ritual.Then he goes on to complain about “flying the Indigenous flag co-equally with the national one – as if the flag of some of us has the same status as the flag of all of us”. This too is a devious reversal of reality: section 5 of the Flags Act 1953 deals with flags other than the red and blue ensigns: “The Governor-General may, by Proclamation, appoint such other flags or ensigns of Australia as he or she thinks fit.” The Australian Aboriginal flag and Torres Strait Islander flag were proclaimed flags of Australia under section 5 of the Flags Act 1953on 14 July 1995, another fact referred to repeatedly in the long list of court findings on the matter, Senate inquiries and civic studies texts. So, two flags are often hung on either side of the national flag, not one, as Abbott states. And neither of them has the status of the national flag.More facts undermine the cheap argument peddled here; there were many Australian flags and confusion about the correct use of the red and blue ensigns until, in 1951, King George VI endorsed the Australian government’s recommendation to use the commonwealth blue ensign as the Australian national flag.Like so much in the rhetorical sections of the book, common but mistaken beliefs, such as Abbott’s views on acknowledging “country” and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags, are not supported by historical facts or easily accessible public records. In Chapter 1, “An Enlightened Beginning”, Abbott slyly cites the late Prof Lyndall Ryan and Dr WEH Stanner, and other scholars reviled by the rightwing touts, notably Keith Windschuttle, whose similarly cunning tome, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, argued that there were few massacres and Aboriginal deaths were caused by disease, a nonsense belief that the right still clings to. Abbott cites Ryan and other rigorous scholars precisely because the evidence is now overwhelming. There were hundreds of massacres, recorded and in the public domain, and there were thousands of Aboriginal people murdered by the colonists, and, in many cases, the names of the murderers are recorded.If we check Abbott’s political stance on “patriotism”, “values”, “democracy” and other concepts that slippery political manoeuvres have devalued, by turning to his Cpac speeches, the Trumpist intent is plain to see. We have not forgotten that Warren Mundine chaired Cpac in Australia, nor that in 2015, on a visit to Kalgoorlie, Abbott said that then Western Australia premier, Colin Barnett, was right to close nearly half the state’s 274 remote communities. He said at the time: “What we can’t do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.”Lifestyle Choices would be a more accurate title for this purported defence of democracy, one that does not include Indigenous Australia in any meaningful way. It is intended to become the style manual for the March for Australia types, providing them with a thesaurus of terms and factoids to defend their Dad’s Army version of our nation.Marcia Langton AO is a Yiman and Bidjara woman from Queensland.

I bet you do too.”Throughout the book, Giuffre beguiles, apologises and cheerfully breaks the fourth wall in an effort to soften the distaste she assumes her story will trigger. Make no mistake: this is a book about power, corruption, industrial-scale sex abuse and the way in which institutions sided with the perpetrator over his victims. Epstein hanged himself in prison while awaiting trial in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator, is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, outcomes largely enabled by Giuffre’s testimony. But it is also a book about how a young woman becomes a hero. And yet here she is, having to charm us out of shrinking from her in horror.Of course, these assumptions of hers aren’t wrong. Giuffre, who was 41 when she died and whose deft, smart book is co-written with the journalist Amy Wallace, knows that to be a victim of sexual violence is to be at best pitied, at worst reviled. (Sample headline from the Daily News: “Jeffrey Epstein Accuser Was Not a Sex Slave, but a Money-Hungry Sex Kitten, Her Former Friends Say.”) I approached Nobody’s Girl with two questions. First, does it give any insight into the so-called Epstein list, the catalogue of prominent men to whom Giuffre and others were trafficked? The closest we get to a fresh allegation is Giuffre’s description of one of the scores of men Epstein forced her to have sex with as a “politician” and “former minister”, who choked and beat her almost unconscious, but who, she writes, is too powerful to name. (When she told Epstein how violent the man had been, he said coldly: “You’ll get that sometimes.”)The book breathes life into Giuffre’s legal status as a victim, showing us a girl like any we knowSecond, does the book make life harder for Ghislaine Maxwell, currently in a low security prison in Texas and sucking up to President Trump to have her sentence reduced? (Her latest appeal was rejected earlier this month.) On this score, Giuffre’s account must shunt the possibility of reprieve further out of reach. It was Maxwell – or “G Max” as she insisted the girls call her – who spotted Giuffre working as a 16-year-old locker-room assistant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, and brought her to Epstein’s house to be “interviewed” as a possible masseuse. Giuffre was forced to have sex with Epstein that day and both then and in subsequent assaults, Maxwell participated. “Maxwell began lashing out at me during our threesomes,” writes Giuffre. “If I complained, she hurt me more.”This brings me to a third question: given its punishing nature, why read this book? I’ve heard more than one person say they “don’t have the stomach” for it – not phrasing any victim needs to hear – but while the book is relentlessly, shockingly hard, it is also a clear-eyed and necessary account of how sex offenders operate. Giuffre’s greatest fear – that being raped and trafficked puts her beyond empathetic reach of most people – is not, in fact, what happens. Narrative does what deposition can’t by taking us into the room with her. The book breathes life into Giuffre’s legal status as a victim, showing us a girl like any we know, like us, and enlivening the reality of those who are trafficked while being “free” to walk away.Abused since the age of six, by the time she met Epstein, Giuffre writes: “I had been sexualized against my will and had survived by acquiescing. I was a pleaser, even when pleasing others cost me dearly. For 10 years, men had cloaked their abuse of me in a fake mantle of ‘love’. Epstein and Maxwell knew just how to tap into that same crooked vein.”Giuffre’s recollections ofPrince Andrew, meanwhile, a man with whom she was allegedly forced to have sex three times – once in the context of an orgy on Epstein’s island – present him in an even more buffoonish and grotesque light. “We disrobed and got in the tub, but we didn’t stay there long because the prince was eager to get to the bed … In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.” Prince Andrew denies Giuffre’s allegations that he had sex with her, that she had been trafficked to him by Epstein or that he had ever met her. But so much focus has been put on the prince that after reading this book, it wasn’t him I thought about most; it was the casual visitors to Epstein’s New York mansion, the illustrious men and occasional woman whom Giuffre says she encountered at dinners there.In respect of these people I’d like to ask: who the fuck did they think the 17-year-old at the table was? What did they think she was doing there? Only Melinda Gates, who met Epstein once and cited him as a factor in the breakdown of her marriage to Bill Gates, sensed what apparently none of these people could put their finger on. Giuffre quotes from a statement made by Gates after her meeting with Epstein: “I regretted it the second I walked in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified.” It was an insight that evidently escaped geniuses like the MIT professors Epstein continued toadviselong after he’d become a convicted sex offender.Giuffre was rightly proud of holding Epstein and Maxwell to account. And yet for any survivor of sexual violence, the cost of recovery – let alone of confronting her abusers in front of the world – can be impossibly steep. At the beginning of the book, Amy Wallace shares details of Giuffre’s fraught final months, including multiple health problems and alleged domestic violence at the hands of Robert Giuffre, her Australian husband. (Robert Giuffre’s lawyer has declined to comment on the allegations, citing ongoing court proceedings.) On 1 April, Giuffre wrote to Wallace: “It is my heartfelt wish that this work be published, regardless of my circumstances at the time.” Three weeks later, she was found dead on her remote Australian farm, leaving behind three children. In a lawsuit Giuffre brought against Epstein in 2009, her lawyers stated the injuries she suffered as a result of his abuse included “a loss of the capacity to enjoy life”, and were of a magnitude that made them “permanent in nature”. The same might be said for this important, courageous, tragically posthumous book.Nobody’s Girl: Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice by Virginia Roberts Giuffre is published by Doubleday.

But, in 1969, the song sold two million copies. It’s now been No 1 in three different decades’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 20 Oct 2025 09.48 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 14.57 EDTShareNorman Greenbaum, singer, guitarist, songwriterSpirit in the Sky started as an old blues riff I’d been playing since my college days in Boston, but I didn’t know what to do with it. After I moved to LA, a guy I knew came up with a way of putting a fuzzbox inside my Fender Telecaster, which created the distinctive sound on Spirit in the Sky.I’d come across a greeting card with a picture of some Native Americans praying to the “spirit in the sky”. The phrase stuck in my head. One night I was watching country music on TV and the singer Porter Wagoner sang a gospel song, which gave me the idea to write religious lyrics. Although I came from a semi-religious Jewish family, I wasn’t religious, but found myself writing Christian lyrics such as “When I die and they lay me to rest, I’m going to the place that’s the best” and “Gotta have a friend in Jesus”. It came together very quickly.I survived a car crash and now give thanks to the spirit every daySoon after that, I was playing the Troubadour club in LA when the Lovin’ Spoonful’s producer Erik Jacobsen walked in. He said he had a production deal with Warner Brothers and was interested in signing me. When we recorded Spirit in the Sky for my debut album, the finished mix sent shivers up my spine. Initially, Warner said a four-minute single containing lyrics about Jesus would never get played on pop radio, but eventually they relented. In 1969, it sold two million copies. But I couldn’t recreate the success.In 1986, I was working as a cook when Dr and the Medics took it back to No 1 in the UK. Then Gareth Gates’s 2003 version meant it was No 1 in three different decades. It’s been in countless movies, including Apollo 13, Oceans 11 and Guardians of the Galaxy. I’m 82. A few years ago, I was a passenger in a car crash and spent three weeks in a coma. I feel like I was granted another life. So now every day, I pray and give thanks to the spirit in the sky.Erik Jacobsen, producerI saw Norman at a hootenanny at the Troubadour singing one song, School for Sweet Talk, but he said: “I’ve got a million songs I’d love to play for ya.” It turned out he’d had a minor hit called The Eggplant That Ate Chicago with a group called Dr West’s Medicine Show and Junk Band and had a whole raft of crazy songs about goats, chickens or a Chinese guy who ate some acid. I said: “Let’s make some records that somebody might like.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Records/AlamyI put him together with Norman Mayell, the drummer from San Francisco psychedelic group Sopwith Camel, and Doug Killmer, a bassist, who’d played a lot of black music. The Spirit in the Sky riff originated in an old John Lee Hooker tune called Boogie Chillen’ and set the tone for where the song went, but the rhythm track sounded too loose. I got Norman to bring his acoustic guitar in and we recorded two performances – each slightly different – and made it stereo. Then we brought in gospel singers the Stovall Singers and their church-type clapping became a key part of the groove. A guitarist called Russell DaShiell played a hell of a solo. By now, the track was sounding immense, but when I heard Norman’s little vocal, my heart sank. It just wasn’t heavy enough, so once again I recorded two performances and combined the two together. I thought: “Thank God!” It sounded amazing.The single got a lot of play on KRLA, a hugely influential radio station, but it came out just before Christmas, when people buy records for others, not for themselves, so there were no sales. KRLA stopped playing it. Then, two weeks into January, 22,000 orders came in from record stores in LA. Everyone started playing it again – and it just took off.The funny thing is that when we went in to record it, my engineer was sick but we went ahead anyway with just a handful of little mics, no headphones and no sound baffling. Every sound was coming in on every mic, but it sounded great. For years people asked: “How in the world did you get that sound?” I said: “I just pointed the amps right at the drums. I had no idea what I was doing.”Norman Greenbaum’s 1969 debut, Spirit in the Sky, is available on vinyl on Craft Recordings, with a Dolby Atmos mix of the single on Apple Music.

Audiences have taken them to their heart – one couple saw the first play on a date, got married and had its title engraved on their ringsDavid EldridgeMon 20 Oct 2025 12.30 EDTShareIt’s October 2017 and I’m sitting at the National Theatre, notebook open and pen poised, waiting for the third preview of my playBeginningto begin. The first previews had flown and I felt relaxed, enjoying the preshow music and its house party vibes. But instead of the play’s two characters, Laura and Danny, awkwardly flirting in her north London flat, I found myself imagining a couple 10 years older, in a big house in Essex. A relationship at breaking point. Middle. Fuck, I thought, and pushed the thought away as the show started.Eight years on and the final play of my trilogy, End, is in rehearsal at theNational Theatre, with Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen playing a couple knocking 60. The three plays aren’t linked narratively as I wanted audiences to be able to experience them as individual works. Beginning tells the story of a couple on the edge of 40 who have just met and the 100 minutes it takes them to kiss. Middle is the story of a late fortysomething couple whose marriage hangs in the balance at 4am. In End, Alfie and Julie must decide how to live the end of their relationship. You don’t have to have seen Beginning or Middle to appreciate or enjoy End, but the collection of plays make a whole and explore my preoccupations from differing perspectives.The plays consider relationships and the different kinds of loneliness that exist in and out of them. They share worlds in north London and Essex; they’re all single-action plays that exist in real time. In all three there’s music and dancing, some food and drink and tidying up. The men all support West Ham United. There’s a sense of progression. Beginning begins at about 2am and by the time End ends it’s about 8.20am. The plays are set in late 2015 and the first half of 2016 in what feels like a more innocent time, when the London Olympics are a recent memory. In all three plays, six lives stand on the edge of massive change. So does the world.View image in fullscreenA relationship in crisis … Daniel Ryan and Claire Rushbrook in Middle at the National Theatre, 2022.Photograph: Johan PerssonInitially, after my moment of epiphany, I was reluctant to write Middle, although I couldn’t stop thinking about it. The problem was at that stage I didn’t have an idea for End, and I didn’t want to start writing a second play until I had an idea for the third. I knew Middle would look at a relationship in crisis, so I didn’t want to write a “divorce play” with End. I didn’t want to write a “deathbed” play either. After a while, I realised the way you live your end as a couple might be a choice. It might be something the characters don’t agree upon.In Beginning andMiddlethe characters live what I’d describe as regular lives, but I realised they didn’t have to in End. Like me, the characters could come from working-class Essex backgrounds but now live in north London. They could have professional lives as artists, a writer and a DJ. In the play, Alfie quips to his partner, Julie, “it’s been a long time since we’ve been ordinary people” and she replies, “where you come from never really leaves you”. After nearly two years of mulling, by August 2019 I knew I had two more plays in me.One of the chief pleasures of making these plays is in the way audiences seem to take them to their heart. I’ve lost count of how many punters asked me if Laura and Danny stay together and have a child after the end of Beginning. One couple who saw the play on their first date, got engaged and sent me a picture of their wedding rings engraved with Beginning. A few years later, one of them emailed me with the news they were getting divorced. It made me feel inconsolably sad. As if I were somehow personally responsible. Claire Rushbrook and Daniel Ryan who performed Middle often struggled to get beyond the stage door after a show for audience members sharing tales of relief that their marriages had survived – or ended.View image in fullscreenThe different kinds of loneliness in relationships … Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen star in End at the National Theatre.Photograph: Theo McInnes“Relatability” is a word often used in relation to the plays, but it’s not something I strive for consciously. I try to tell the truth about people, and I think about John Osborne’s notion, that he wanted to give audiences “lessons in feeling”. Early in 2023, I made a ManchesterBeginningfor the Royal Exchange theatre. Although I know the city well, I fretted initially about Crouch End in north London becoming West Didsbury and Manchester United becoming Danny’s team. But the audience connected with the universal feelings of insecurity and attraction we all experience when we meet someone we like, not a street name or a football team. I suppose this may explain too why the plays have travelled and found homes in places as varied as Reykjavík, Santiago and Shanghai.I wrote a first draft of Beginning in November 2015, and it’s been a decade now that I’ve been reflecting upon love and what it means to be with someone. People ask me if my views of relationships have changed over the last 10 years. I think they have. I suspect in my early 40s I was driven by ideas of romantic love, desire, and a notion “if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be”. But nothing in life is fated and the characters in these plays all make decisions to be brave, to risk their hearts and change the direction of their lives. And they have the wisdom to create the space that might allow them to feel differently. Fancying the pants off someone still matters. But to love is to decide to give love a chance too. At 52, I think I stand with my characters.We’ll have to see how End goes but I suppose it’s a truth, to borrow from Benjamin Franklin, that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except taxes and death. We live our whole lives with the knowledge that one day we will be gone and that those who love us most will lose us. When I was writing End, I came across the work of Crouch End poet Carole Satyamurti, who died in 2019. In her striking posthumously published memento mori, she reflects “… the trick is to resist anticipating / The time when November gales/ Will strip the trees of consolation, turn / Our gaze earthwards to where brown / Leaves inscribe mortality in every dusk; / But celebrate the reds, the blues, the blacks”. It’s how we live that matters. Right until the very end.End is at theNational Theatre, London, 13 November-17 January.Methuen Dramawill publish David Eldridge: Trilogy on 20 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreDavid EldridgeRelationshipsClive OwenRoyal ExchangefeaturesShareReuse this content"

My instructions had been perfectly clear: break into the Louvre, head for theDenon wingand deliver me the Leonardo da Vincis. Instead, what did they do? Brought me trinkets! Stand there, over the trap door. A bit more to the right.It would be nice to think an art collector supervillain somewhere was punishing the Louvre raiders for their moronic bad taste. Admittedly, security around the Mona Lisa has improved sinceit was last stolen in 1911, but the museum’s other Leonardos just hang on the wall like other paintings. And there is so much beauty, so many quiet galleries, scattered through this vast former palace: the thieves could have got out with a Chardin still life, a Rogier van der Weyden, an ancient Mesopotamian statuette.Louvre heist: hunt on for thieves after eight ‘priceless’ jewellery pieces stolenRead moreObviously I am glad they didn’t. My first reaction when I heard aboutthe heist on Sunday morningwas relief. This is such a treasury of art, but in a well-planned job the thieves used an extending ladder on a truck to enter the Galerie d’Apollon and grab a bunch of old royal knick-knacks. Despite breathless reports of the theft of “France’s priceless crown jewels”, this is scarcely like stealing the British crown jewels that symbolise our still-monarchical state. France hasn’t had royals in a long time so these are obscure relics.Among the stolen items are a necklace and earrings that belonged to Marie-Amelie, wife of the 19th-century monarch Louis-Philippe and technically the last queen of France. After his reign ended in the 1848 revolution they were exiled in Britain and she died in Surrey in 1866. Then power was seized by Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of the original Emperor Napoleon. The thieves have also taken a tiara and brooch belonging to his wife, Empress Eugénie, who died in Madrid in 1920, 50 years after her husband was deposed.Got all that? This is the kind of French constitutional history that gave me a headache as an A-level student. Even the stolen emerald necklace and earrings associated with the original, more exciting Napoleon belonged to his second wife, Marie Louise, not the renowned Josephine. I think the French culture minister must have had to suppress a snigger while claiming these items have “immeasurable heritage value”.View image in fullscreenNicked knack … Empress Eugenie’s tiara from the Louvre’s collection.Photograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyNo, this is not about history, let alone art. It is about sapphires, emeralds and diamonds, and the gold and silver in which they are set. It doesn’t take an art detective to figure out that thieves who executed a robbery that ignored all the Louvre’s cultural treasures for these brainless items are ruthlessly interested in the precious materials from which they are made. Is this part of a new kind of “art” heist that isn’t about art at all?The thieves who liftedMaurizio Cattelan’s golden toilet from Blenheim Palace in 2019were not interested in Cattelan’s art (and who is, really?) but the gold which they were able to sell within days. The loo literally melted away into the inexhaustible market for precious metals. It seems all too likely the Louvre’s crown jewels will be broken up and their precious elements untraceably sold as anonymous jewels and metals, unless the crooks are caught first.This is so much more practical than trying to sell a world famous artistic masterpiece. “Classic” art theft is irrational and doesn’t really work. When thieves took The Scream from the Munch Museum in Oslo they had no real idea what to do with it. The painting, as I was told by the Oslo police, was badly damaged by being kept in a wet van before its recovery. How could you really keep such an icon underground for long? The theft of Caravaggio’s Nativityby the Palermo mafiaalmost certainly resulted in this great work’s destruction into worthless fragments of canvas and pigment. But precious stones and metals carry on being precious.It’s possible the thieves are not immediately planning to break up everything. Some of the royal jewelstaken from the Green Vault in Dresden Castlein 2019 were recovered in Berlin in 2022. But the raid in Dresden – a city that houses artistic masterpieces such as Raphael’s Sistine Madonna and Giorgione’s Sleeping Venus – adds to the evidence that thieves are targeting precious gems and metals from museums rather than going to the bother of trying to profit from a famous painting.Perversely this may be good news for guardians of the world’s great art. The Louvre will be looking at its security, but perhaps the real security of art lies in its ever increasing fame, when even lesser known sculptures and paintings can be looked up online instantly.When Goya’s portrait of the Duke of Wellington wasstolen from the National Gallery in 1961, the James Bond production designer Ken Adam wittily put it on the wall in Dr No’s lair, the joke being that only a Spectre supervillain might commission such a crime. Thetrue story, involving a retired Newcastle bus driver and his son, turned out to have its own peculiar romance. But anything romantic or underdoggish about art heists is a thing of the past. The thuggish crime at the Louvre suggests any interest in art by the underworld has been replaced by cold calculating greed. Art is fragile, they reckon. Diamonds are forever.Explore more on these topicsArt theftMuseumsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our writer goes searching for signs of lifeMichael HannMon 20 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 13.09 EDTShareNo one can really say when rock’n’roll was invented. You could say March 1951, with the release of Rocket 88 by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats. Or maybe July 1954, whenElvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black stopped messing around between takes at Sun Studios and started hammering through That’s All Right, which became the future King’s first single.But the year rock’n’roll reallybecamerock’n’roll was 70 years ago, in 1955: the year Little Richard burst on to the world with Tutti Frutti; the year of the first riot at an Elvis show; the year of Blue Suede Shoes and Maybellene; the year of Bo Diddley singing his own praises. In the US, Rock Around the Clock by Bill Haley & His Comets was the biggest record that year. In the UK, its presence on the soundtrack of the teensploitation movie The Blackboard Jungle reportedly sent teddy boys into rampages of cinema-smashing.It’s just the same 20 bands doing the same 20 songs every week. They’re not bothered about innovationIn fact, 1955 was at the centre of such a huge pop-cultural moment that if you are over 40, you almost certainly grew up with rock’n’roll as a constant background in your life. In the 1970s, groups such as Stray Cats, Showaddywaddy, Matchbox and Darts were Top of the Pops regulars. Shakin’ Stevens was the biggest-selling singles artist of the 80s, and many other rock’n’roll revivalists had hits. Punks covered old rock’n’roll songs – and punk’s rock’n’roll mutation, psychobilly, was one of the biggest youth cults of the early 1980s. Even after that, contemporary hits such as George Michael’s Faith or Girls Aloud’s Love Machine made reference without descending into revivalism. KT Tunstall’s Black Horse and the Cherry Tree used the Bo Diddley “shave and a haircut, two bits” rhythm.But today, the genre is in danger of disappearing. “There’s nobody, apart from the offspring of existing rock’n’rollers, to take the place of the people who are dying off,” says John Hopkins, who edited UK Rock’n’Roll magazine until he was forced to close it earlier this year. He cites Rockers Reunion, in January, the first big rock’n’roll all-dayer of the year. “My reviewer made the point that everybody seems to be on sticks and Zimmers.”View image in fullscreenHuge pop-cultural moment … Bill Haley and Elvis Presley in 1955.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesIt’s not as though pre-Beatles pop has disappeared. Lana Del Rey has built a career on it.Laufey’s neo-bossa-nova and jazz-pop balladsare huge. Stephen Sanchez’s global hit Until I Found You might as well have been a lost recording from 1958. In the UK, George Ezra and Jake Bugg have borrowed from it, occasionally straying close to rockabilly, asEzra did on Cassy O’. And vintage soul, of course, pops up everywhere. But rock’n’roll, in the sense a teenager 70 years ago would have understood it? Not so much; certainly not in the UK. When you hear the words rock’n’roll these days, they tend to mean presenting as rough and ready, summoning not greased quiffs, but theme bars with tattooed bartenders and Guns N’ Roses on the jukebox.The only place the old rock’n’roll values still flourish, Hopkins says, is in what is referred to as the “fluffy” scene – in effect, cosplaying 1955. “But it’s just the same 20 bands doing the same 20 songs every week, and they’re not bothered about innovation. That’s a nice social event, but it’s not music.”How can this have happened to one of the most energetic, boundary-pushing styles of music in history? Observers say that, as the spotlight has gradually moved away, the rock’n’roll scene has hardened, and arguably cut itself off. “There are some strong rules in rock’n’roll and rockabilly about what you can and can’t do,” says Rupert Orton, guitarist with the Jim Jones Revue, who played an ultra-high-energy, punked-up variant on rock’n’roll in the 00s. “But in a very slow way, it metamorphoses.”View image in fullscreenOvertones of Elvis … Elliot James Reay.Photograph: Lorne Thomson/RedfernsOrton remains active behind the scenes – he books the annual Red Rooster festival, which gives due prominence to rock’n’roll – and makes the point that rock’n’roll, like so many enduring subcultures, has long been an overwhelmingly working-class pursuit. As a writer and editor, I know that means traditional media will have less interest in it. Also, the hardcore rock’n’roll scene seems to reject outside interest – I contacted the organisers of several rock’n’roll weekenders for this piece, and none replied. “They are very insular,” Hopkins agrees. “When I started on the magazine, I went down to an event and I felt like an alien. It was very difficult to get to know people.”To give an idea of how marginalised rock’n’roll in the UK now is, consider one of its brightest young sparks. Dylan Kirk, from Kent, is 25, and his band Dylan Kirk & the Killers are hotshots on the rock’n’roll circuit, playing weekenders and clubs. He plays between 30 and 40 shows a year. When we speak, he is looking for a new job to replace the one he has at a Wetherspoons. This is not a world where the big break is just around the corner.Kirk, inevitably, was introduced to rock’n’roll by his parents, then taught himself to play it on the piano. He even started playing because of them. “My dad was in the car one day and he said, ‘I’ve been in this pub that has a piano. We’re going to go down there now and you’re going to play it.’ I was too shy to sing, but that was the first time I played in front of anybody – just a little boogie-woogie.”And who are his audience? Are there any kids present? “The people I’m performing to now were part of the rock’n’roll revival of the 70s and 80s. But there are young people, too, down to teenagers. I think most of the youngsters do treat it as a lifestyle – it’s not about the music, it’s about the fashion.”View image in fullscreenCosta del song … the annual Rockin’ Race Jamboree in Torremolinos.Photograph: Jorge Guerrero/AFP/Getty ImagesNevertheless, there remains the unanswered question: even if there aren’t lots of young musicians playing rock’n’roll, why has it disappeared so thoroughly from pop’s recipe book? “That’s a question I ask myself,” Kirk says. “I do find it strange that I don’t hear it.”Perhaps rock’n’roll’s greatest problem, though, is that everyone thinks they know it, and that they can define it in one word: Elvis. Yes, people tend to know a few other songs – by Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis or Chuck Berry – but Elvis seems to be all they need. Witness the success ofBaz Luhrmann’s hyperstylised biopic, and the way the entrails of his life continue to be picked over. There’s no other musical genre quite so associated with a single figure, one who has been dead for 48 years, and who is still – by an extremely long way – the most commercially successful rock’n’roll performer of the present day.If the ageing of the fans is an issue for rock’n’roll, so too is the ageing of the music industry. For decades, record companies and recording studios were populated by people who had grown up with rock’n’roll, either as a formative experience or as a background noise. Now the producers who might have suggested a Bo Diddley backbeat or a twangy rockabilly guitar have retired, and the major label A&R people are more likely to be reliant on algorithms and data than personal taste.Outside the UK, rock’n’roll is still a big subculture. Orton highlights the annual Rockin’ Race Jamboree in Torremolinos, Spain, which attracts up to 30,000 people for five days of rock’n’roll, roots music and related activities (Kirk will be at next year’s). “It’s really quite incredible,” Orton says. “There were kids there who couldn’t have been older than late teens. They looked as if they’d just walked out of The Wild One.”View image in fullscreenThe US might yet save rock’n’roll … JD McPherson performs in Nashville last month.Photograph: Erika Goldring/Getty Images for Americana Music AssociationSweden, famously, has its raggare culture, venerating the 50s – there’s even the “rockabilly town” of Enviken, famed for its devotion to the past. Ask Spotify and it’ll serve you up a genuinely exciting playlist of Swedish rock’n’roll. But even there, apparently, it’s really only the kids of the revivalists who are continuing the traditions.Still, as well as having birthed it, the US might yet save rock’n’roll. JD McPherson, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, came through playing rock’n’roll, before widening his range to other older forms of US music. McPherson noticed his audience getting younger, especially since he released a Christmas album a few years back. And when he DJs, he notices the old rock’n’roll numbers he began playing at the end of the evening to clear the crowds have started filling the dancefloor. He believes rock’n’roll can return.‘I tried to be nice. Sometimes I would explode’: John Fogerty on Creedence, contracts and controlRead more“It has to be someone very good, who can utilise the rhythms and motifs of the music, but make it feel like right now.” And why might that happen? “It’s definitely happening with country music – with neo-traditional country,” he says, referring to artists such as Zach Top who are once again stripping country back to drums, bass, guitar, fiddle and pedal steel. And of course, lots of the country superstars – ones who are filling arenas in the UK now, such as Chris Stapleton – have strong seams of rock’n’roll in their music.McPherson says he’s “a little long in the tooth” to get to arena level himself. “But I do think at some point something will happen. It has to be something real and it has to be somebody who really loves it. And maybe it won’t be called rock’n’roll at all. But when it happens, it will happen accidentally.”Perhaps it could even come from the UK. Take the Bury-born, Elvis-indebted Elliot James Reay who, at 23, is earning millions of streams for his throwback tunes: he looks and dresses the part. The six songs he has released so far, once again, lean heavily towards pre-Beatles pop, rather than to true rock’n’roll – more Richard Hawley than Little Richard – but all it would take would be that one song, the one that’s more Hound Dog than Love Me Tender, and we’ll be there. After all, as Chuck Berry noted, rock’n’roll’s not hard: it’s got a backbeat, you can’t lose it, any old time you choose it.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockRockabillyElvis PresleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We meet the founder of the schemeOliver BascianoMon 20 Oct 2025 06.20 EDTLast modified on Mon 20 Oct 2025 06.22 EDTShareOn a railing, not far fromTate Modern, is a lockbox. Enter a code and inside is a membership card to the museum, enabling free access to its temporary exhibitions. You get your ticket, you return the card.The Artist Membership Project, much to the ire of the city’s arts institutions, has been operating for three months with more than 600 members, mostly artists and recent graduates. Curator Ben Broome, who describes the guerrilla initiative as “part mutual aid project, part artwork”, estimates that those signed up have saved thousands of pounds in museum entry fees.“I work in the art world, I can generally beg, borrow, and steal a pass, or I know someone who works at the museum,” Broome says. “But I did a studio visit with an artist who had recently graduated and is still finding her footing in the industry and I asked if she had seenthe Ed Atkins show at Tate Britain. She replied that she’d have loved to have gone but it cost £18 and simply couldn’t afford that.”A 2024 study found that the median annual salary of artists in the UK was just £12,500 a year, a 40% decrease since 2010.Broome went away from the studio visit with a plan forming. He would email a dozen friends who run commercial art galleries and ask them to donate £100. He would then invest the money in membership cards to nine institutions, including the Tates Modern and Britain, the Courtauld Gallery, the National Gallery andNational Portrait Gallery. These would be hidden in lockboxes, the location and code to which are provided over a WhatsApp group.“It’s a little bit clandestine, it’s a little bit punk. There’s a sprinkling of low-level anarchy to the project,” Broome says. “That’s why people have responded so well to it, because it does feel somewhat divisive or uncouth. And I think we need a bit of that.”View image in fullscreenProvocation … another Artist Membership Project card is shared.Photograph: Jay IzzardBroome adds: “I understand why these institutions have to charge for these shows, they cost thousands to stage. I just think that the act of charging artists is alienating the very audience that makes these institutions great in the first place.”The curator cites the example of MoMA in New York, which offers a heavily subsidised artists’ membership scheme. Artists simply have to show some evidence of their practice at the museum’s information desk, be it a website or their social media.There seems an appetite for a similar concessionary rate in the UK, as within days the WhatsApp group had blown up and the cards were being used several times a day. A spokesperson for Tate said: “Unlike many museums abroad, the UK’s national museums are free to all, including to artists … This is only possible because of the support of our members and the income generated by our exhibitions.”Representatives of the Royal Academy and the V&A also noted that temporary shows were a major source of income. The terms and conditions of all the membership programmes involuntarily included in Broome’s scheme expressly forbid the sharing of cards. All the institutions pointed out they operate free entry days, occasional pay-what-you-can events and reduced prices for under-25s or those on benefits.Broome says he understands the financial constraints on museums and that they do what they can. “Being the director of a major museum in London is no easy task, but I think we can separate the dire situation of the public-sector art world and the fact that artists can’t afford to see exhibitions. They are intertwined, both of these things are rooted in governmental failures. That being said, the audience who are using the membership scheme, they’re just not coming to your institution anyway. So it’s better to get those people through the door.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gilane Tawadros, director of theWhitechapel Galleryin London told the Guardian: “I wasn’t personally aware of this scheme, but many of our staff are also practising artists, so I would imagine they are. I fully understand the need for artists to share resources as ticket prices for exhibitions are often prohibitively expensive and being able to go and see work is vital. I think it would be great for arts institutions to consider as many ways as possible to support and nurture our artist communities.”Earlier this month theBarbicancancelled Broome’s membership card, citing “suspicious activity”. He crowdfunded for a replacement under a new name which was promptly also cancelled. Now however a spokesperson says the gallery will reach out to him to “explore options”.“The idea behind this project was not to create an infrastructure from which people could access free exhibitions indefinitely,” the curator says. “It was always destined to fail in that. Some of the cards have got so soggy from being out in the elements that they’re practically unusable, one of the lockboxes has seized up. It was designed to show the precarity of artists and that there is a need for an alternative model – which I think it has done.”Explore more on these topicsArtArts fundingMuseumsTate BritainTate ModernBarbicanNational GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1964, aged seven, he was taken by his mother to see “a kid named Bob Dylan” play a local college gym. By the age of 14, living in San Diego, he was writing record reviews for a local underground magazine whose main aim was to bring down Richard Nixon. Shortly after that, he started interviewing the bands of the day as they came through California – first Humble Pie forCreem, and then the Eagles, the Allman Brothers Band and Led Zeppelin for Rolling Stone.Crowe previously fictionalised his story in the 2000 filmAlmost Famous, which he wrote and directed. His lyrical and compulsively readable memoir The Uncool is bookended by the opening of a musical version, which coincides with the death of Crowe’s mother Alice whose aphorisms, including “Put some goodness in the world before it blows up”, are scattered throughout the book. Alice insisted that Crowe skip two school grades, driving his precocity; she was also dead against rock’n’roll on account of its unbridled hedonism. When Crowe asks her what Elvis did on The Ed Sullivan Show that was so subversive he had to be filmed from the waist up, she “clinically” replies: “He had an erection”.Nevertheless, unbridled hedonism is exactly what the book depicts, through the starry-eyed gaze of youth: unlike, say, Joan Didion in Slouching Towards Bethlehem, Crowe didn’t study the counterculture’s casualties too closely. His is a world of aftershow parties filled with characters like Freddie Sessler, a drug dealer who is rumoured to have made his fortune manufacturing pencils; late-night dressing-room jam sessions (Crowe has his guitar gently removed from his hands by a roadie called Red Dog when he attempts to join in with the Allman Brothers); eager, undamaged groupies (he knows a crew called the Flying Garter Girls whose leader Pennie Lane’s credo is “only blowjobs, and that’s it”); and, as the early 70s wear on, omnipresent cocaine use, though Crowe doesn’t partake. “I couldn’t shake the image of my teacher-mother popping up,” he says. “You’re killing brain cells!”The Uncool captures an extraordinarily creative period in which rock music was stretching out in all directionsThe few music journalists making a viable living today would be agog at the access he enjoyed. When I interviewed the Rolling Stones for the Guardian nine years ago, I got about 15 minutes with each of them in a succession of Boston hotel rooms. (Fortunately, they were very good value.) Compare that with the 18 months Crowe spent with David Bowie in LA for a Rolling Stone cover story that ran in February 1976. He shadowed Bowie at parties with Ronnie Wood and in the studio with Iggy Pop; he hung out with him day and night in houses he was renting, meaning that he was there to record the heartstopping moment when Bowie suddenly jumped to his feet mid-interview because he thought he’d seen a body fall from the sky. The cocaine-and-occult-addled Thin White Duke pulled down the blinds, on which he had drawn a pentagram, lit and quickly blew out a black candle, then told Crowe: “Don’t let me scare the pants off you. It’s only protective. I’ve been getting a little trouble from … theneighbours.”The Uncool captures an extraordinarily inventive period in which rock music was stretching out in all directions, whether towards country music thanks to artists like Gram Parsons, or the conceptual in albums by the likes of Yes and the Who. Crowe was part of a burgeoning music press that, as well as recommending new bands to its readers, or conveying what rock groups had to say for themselves, would interpret, celebrate and contextualise the huge creative strides some of these musicians were making.The work of writers like Crowe’s hero, Lester Bangs of Creem, amplified this sense of sonic excitement and exploration. While musicians may not have enjoyed being on the receiving end of his most brutally scathing criticism, Bangs pushed them to do better. One can almost hear him revolving in his grave at today’s Rolling Stone, which this month gave a five-star rave review to one of Taylor Swift’s worst ever albums. Although given that Jann Wenner, the founder of Rolling Stone, fired Bangs because he was insufficiently deferential to Canned Heat, he might not have been that surprised. Wenner, Bangs tells Crowe, is “a self-serving, ass-kissing heap of guano.”Crowe is honest about the way writers, including himself, could be seduced by this proximity to stardom – something Bangs vociferously warned him against. He was never the build ’em up, knock ’em down type and undoubtedly got closer to some rock stars than was healthy for journalistic objectivity. In 1978, he managed to coax Joni Mitchell into an interview – she was long a “Rolling Stone disbeliever” thanks to a 1971 stunt in which the magazine “published a chart of her boyfriends and dubbed her Old Lady of the Year”. When she asked to see his piece before it was published, Crowe agreed, and took in her “corrections” as well. Mitchell rewarded him by signing some artwork for her then-current album Mingus with the words “Thanks for the collaboration”. As Crowe says, “Famous for her honesty, she had outed me as a collaborator. What was criminal among journalists was a badge of honour for me.”View image in fullscreenCameron Crowe in September 2025.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianWhile his journalistic ethics may have wilted in the megawatt glow of his favourite rock stars, Crowe’s writing style flourished. In The Uncool, he succinctly evokes both eccentric characters and the era they represented. Of fellow journalist and future Doors biographer Danny Sugerman, Crowe writes: “His hands forever on his hips, he looked like he was always posing for an album cover that didn’t exist.” Gram Parsons is encapsulated thus: “The more he woke up, the more he had the air of a well-educated, stony young prince. He spoke about country artists the way a planetary scientist discusses the cosmos.” Crowe’s taste in music doesn’t inspire quite as much confidence – my faith was fatally shaken by his belief that the musically terrible Ryan Adams is “part of the same DNA chain” as Parsons. Crowe admits that one of the reasons he got a foot in the door at Rolling Stone was because he loved Jethro Tull, Deep Purple and the Eagles whereas the magazine’s staff “were the Van Morrison-Bob Dylan crowd.” Sun-dappled, hairy-chested rock is his thing.Punk enters the book like someone switching the lights on at the end of a party. On the same day the Sex Pistols make the cover of Rolling Stone, Crowe’s friends, members of the southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, are killed in a plane crash. It’s the end of an era. When his name doesn’t appear on the cover of Rolling Stone for his Joni Mitchell story, Crowe knows he is out of favour. “I’m 21,” he tells his parents. “I’m washed up.” He manages to transfer his talents to Hollywood, his career up and running once he writes the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which harks back to his schooldays.It’s another ode to lost youth. Crowe knows how potent an elegiac mood can be, or as he calls it, “the happy/sad”. It’s a gorgeous melancholia he detects in some of his favourite songs, from Silence Is Golden by the Tremeloes to Love Don’t Love Nobody by the Spinners, a Philly soul masterpiece over which he bonds with Bowie. But the source of this ache lies closer to home. Crowe writes that his sister Cathy took her own life aged 19, after suffering from a mental illness that was stigmatised and barely understood in the California of the mid-60s. Crowe, then just 10, couldn’t understand why his beloved big sister hadn’t left him a message of some kind, until he remembered the two Beach Boys singles she had ordered, which arrived at the house after her death: “My California Girl sister was telling me not to worry, baby.”Crowe shows that music can sometimes be a key, not only to the deepest aspects of one’s own self, but to the otherwise incomprehensible inner lives of others. On top of that, it offers solace, joy and camaraderie for a lifetime. Remembering that Dylan concert in 1964, Crowe writes: “The chilly gymnasium had become a gathering of a tribe. It was that rare feeling that we were all exactly where we belonged.”The Uncool by Cameron Crowe is published by HarperCollins (£22). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Mendonça calls Bolsonaro’s conviction a sign that justice has prevailed.“And I do hope he goes to jail,” he adds, rejecting rightwing calls for Bolsonaro’s sins to be forgiven and forgottenthrough a pardon. “[We came] very close to … the collapse of society. [There can be] no amnesty. It’s all very clear, I think,” says the film-maker, citing “overwhelmingly shocking” evidence of Bolsonaro’s guilt.View image in fullscreenThe Secret Agent is set during Brazil’s military dictatorship in the 1970s.Photograph: handoutRemembering is at the heart of Mendonça’s new film, The Secret Agent, agripping political thrillerset in 1977, the 13th year of Brazil’s brutal two-decade military dictatorship and also the year Bolsonaro graduated from the Agulhas Negras military academy, a South American West Point, before starting his improbable march towards the presidency.The film, which earned Mendonça the best director award at this year’s Cannes film festival and has beencalled a masterpiece, tells the story of Armando, a good-natured academic who is forced into hiding after clashing with a reptilian regime official who orders his murder.The professor, played by the Civil War star Wagner Moura, finds shelter in a safe house for dissidents and social outcasts in Recife, the north-eastern city where Mendonça grew up.Mendonça, 56, set out to make a period thriller rather than a classic dictatorship movie about “young guerrilla fighters robbing a bank to fund actions against the dictatorship”.But when friends watched the electrifying movie, reactions suggested he had made a film infused with recent history, which “was actually about the last few years living in Brazil” under Bolsonaro, a paratrooper before he became a politician, who openly pined for a return to military rule.View image in fullscreenArmando, third from left, is played by Wagner Moura in the film.Photograph: CinemascopioWhen Bolsonaro took office in 2019 and began packing his administration with military men and reviving the violent, illiberal rhetoric of the 1964-85 dictatorship, it felt like “an exercise in fetishism with a long-lost Brazil” from half a century earlier, Mendonça says.Bolsonaro’spersecution of the artsharked back to the military period when cherished cultural figures fled overseas. Bolsonaro’s closure of the culture ministry – now reversed by Lula – “was one of the biggest attacks against the country I’ve ever seen,” Mendonça says.“It’s proof he doesn’t understand the country at all – and it felt so, so aggressive. That was something I just found awful – such an act of violence,” says the film-maker, who spent part of his adolescence at school in Essex in the early 80s, travelling into London to watch films in Leicester Square. (The Secret Agent features two hat tips to the anglophile director’s fondness for the UK: a cameo from the British consul to Rio, Anjoum Noorani, and a reference to the University of Leeds.)Bolsonaro’s days in power now appear over, with the disgraced 70-year-old expected to start serving his sentence next month – the same time as The Secret Agent goes on general release in Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unlike Argentina and Chile, Brazil has largely allowed military officials toescape punishmentfor the bloodshed they caused.Brazil’s Bolsonaro was convicted but the military appetite for a coup lingersRead more“It seems to be the way the Brazilian psyche operates,” Mendonça says, remembering the 1979 amnesty law that let human rights violators off the hook for dictatorship-era crimes.“Maybe it made sense at the time. But looking back now … I don’t think it was a good idea … It’s almost like the default behaviour [in Brazil] is amnesty: ‘Serial killer kills 87’. ‘Oh, he had a mother … He has two kids. Let’s go easy on him!’.”In The Secret Agent’s final scene, a researcher from the present hands a memory stick to the runaway academic’s son containing devastating details of his father’s plight. “You can see panic in the son’s face,” Mendonça says. “You know, [it’s like]: ‘Get this thing out of here because I can’t deal with this.

The commissioner has been clear he doesn’t believe officers should be policing toxic culture war debates, with current laws and rules on inciting violence online leaving them in an impossible position.“As a result, the Met will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents. We believe this will provide clearer direction for officers, reduce ambiguity and enable them to focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations.“These incidents will still be recorded and used as valuable pieces of intelligence to establish potential patterns of behaviour or criminality.“We will continue to investigate and arrest those who commit hate crimes – allowing us to comply with statutory guidance while focusing our resources on criminality and public protection.”Linehan was questioned on suspicion of a public order offence relating to his post after his arrest last month.It sparked a free-speech row which prompted the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to say at the time that the police should focus on the most serious issues.In one of the three tweets cited by police at the time of Linehan’s arrest as evidence of an alleged crime, he had written: “If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.”Another was a photograph of a trans-rights protest, with the comment “a photo you can smell”, and a follow-up post which read: “I hate them. Misogynists and homophobes. F*** em.”The Free Speech Union said it had instructed lawyers to sue the Met for wrongful arrest on Linehan’s behalf.Its general secretary, Toby Young, said: “I’m glad the police have dropped the case, but it should have been obvious there was no case to answer in the first place. Graham should never have been interviewed about his tweets, let alone arrested by five armed police officers and held in a cell for over 12 hours.“We’ve instructed a top flight team of lawyers to sue the Met for wrongful arrest, among other things. Graham deserves an apology and the police must be made to pay a price so they stop behaving like the Stasi.”Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeGraham LinehanPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

The location, they suggest, would have been of secondary concern to the criminals.“You may ask why thieves who want to steal expensive jewellery are breaking into a world-famous museum rather than a Cartier store,” said Christopher A Marinello, a leading expert in the recovery of stolen works of art. “The answer is simple: it’s because these days a Cartier store is better protected.”View image in fullscreenThe jewels stolen from the Louvre. Top row from left: a necklace and pair of earrings from Napoleon’s wedding gift set to Marie-Louise; Empress Eugénie’s brooch; a sapphire and diamond tiara, necklace and earrings. Bottom row: Empress Eugénie’s decorative bow (left) and diadem (right).Composite: Louvre/AlamyA spate of violent jewellery shop thefts mean that many outlets have beefed up their security in recent years, with armed guards on their premises and wares no longer kept on display overnight.Museums, meanwhile, look more exposed, partly because of the in-built reason of being public-facing institutions in historic buildings, and partly the current economic climate in many western countries.“Since Covid, governments across the globe have cut back on law enforcement and the culture sector,” said Marinello. “If thieves can get into the Louvre, it shows how vulnerable our institutions have become. This is a horrible time to be a museum.”The theft of the objects – including necklaces made up of eight sapphires and 631 diamonds, the tiara of Empress Eugénie featuring nearly 2,000 diamonds and a hugely valuable crown once owned by Napoleon III’s wife that the thieves dropped by the roadside on their way out – has inevitably drawn comparisons with the 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa from the same museum, carried out by the Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.View image in fullscreenA mug shot and fingerprints of Vincenzo Peruggia.Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyBetter points of reference may be the2019 burglary of jewellery from Dresden’s Green Vault Museumworth over €113m, the theft of a£4.75m gold toilet from Blenheim Palacethe same year, the2017 heist of a large gold coin from Berlin’s Bode Museumor even a spate of thefts ofsports memorabilia from US mining museums.In each case, the crimes appeared mostly motivated by the material value of the objects that disappeared. “There’s a simple pattern here,” said Marinello. “Smash, grab, and melt it down as quickly as possible.”If the artefacts were to remain intact, experts say, the thieves would struggle to find a buyer. “There’s no way to sell something as immediately identifiable as the Louvre’s jewels on the licit market”, said Lynda Albertson of the Association for Research into Crimes against Art, an organisation that tracks trends in museums, including thefts and vandalism.“They would be immediately recognised, especially given the Ministry of Culture has released images of the pieces. Even a private collector or an auction house like Sotheby’s or Christie’s would want to see paperwork establishing proper ownership before touching such striking pieces.”1:06‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen from Louvre in rapid heist, says French minister – videoIn the past, museums were often reluctant to go public about the disappearance of well-known works of art and would stay silent out of embarrassment. These days, as art thefts are more widely publicised, the storage and sale of stolen art is risky business for any criminal.“If you steal a Picasso, it has to remain intact or it becomes worthless, and you have to conceive of a scheme to keep it in hiding, perhaps by passing it around difficult criminal actors,” said Marinello. “And you’re constantly exposed to the risk of an accomplice telling the police to cash in a ransom.”For similar reasons, the art detectiveArthur Brandsaid it was vanishingly unlikely that the theft had been ordered,as Dutch media havereported could be the case for golden Dacian treasuresstolen in January from the Drents Museumin the Netherlands. “Stolen to order is something from the Hollywood movies,” he said. “Nobody would touch this. It’s all around the world and in all the newspapers. If you buy this, if you get caught, you end up in prison. You cannot show it to your friends, you cannot leave it to your children.”Altering stolen works by melting down or re-cutting does reduce the value. When it comes to diamonds, it also comes with considerable risk because contemporary cutting techniques give stones a larger and lighter surface area, and antique-cut stones would either draw unwanted attention or barter the price down for a coverup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fitting similar security equipment in historic buildings is difficult and expensive.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesCrucially, however, melting down or re-cutting eliminates the evidence of the crime. “My guess is that the Louvre thieves will try to take the stolen goods to places with diamond expertise like Israel, India or even as close as Antwerp, and find someone to cut out the gems,” said Marinello.The heist at the Louvre has alreadyraised questions about security measuresat the museum, with a leaked state auditor report expected to be published next month criticising “considerable” and “persistent” delays in updating equipment and noting that security cameras were lacking in many rooms. But security experts say displaying precious items in historic buildings with a steady stream of visitors comes with risks that are impossible to eliminate completely.“Historic buildings are much harder to protect,” said Erin Thompson, a professor of art crime at City University of New York. “Many of them have nice big street-facing windows that makes it easy for thieves to get away, and there may be building protection statutes in place that mean you can’t fit them with proper bulletproof glass.”The most solid security systems for buildings should be conceptualised “like a fortress”, said Peter Stürmann of the German security company VZM, which advises museums and archives. “There should be several layers to repel attackers.”How the Louvre museum robbery happened in video, photographs and mapsRead moreModern buildings are fitted with state-of-the-art external CCTV cameras or in-built seismic detectors that raise alarm about a smashed window in real time, but old museums may be reluctant to uglify their exteriors. Laser scanners can be hard to fit to stuccoed ceilings. Motion and sound detectors may also have to be disabled during the day as hordes of visitors stomp through a museum.The timing of the Louvre raid, which took place between 9.30am and 9.40am local time, was typical of recent thefts, Stürmann said. “There’s a good reason why thefts tend to happen at either opening or closing times. It’s often when guards change their shifts and before the museum is full of visitors who effectively act as additional security staff.”Technological progress may have thrown up new gadgets that can raise the alarm more quickly and efficiently, but it has also given thieves new tools with which to circumvent security measures. In Paris, the robbers reached the museum’s first-floor window with a vehicle-mounted ladder and cut through a glass panewith a battery-powered disc cutter.Elaine Sciolino, the author of Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World’s Greatest Museum, said the conversation inFranceabout the 232-year-old building had mostly focused on crowd control in recent years, and less on security.The museum has an on-site brigade of about 50 permanent firefighters, orsapeurs-pompiers, but their mission is mainly to protect the collection from fires and flooding. “There is no rapid-response unit,” Sciolino said. “Ultimately, the security of the Louvre all comes down to political will and money, and currently France simply has no money.”Additional reporting by Senay BoztasExplore more on these topicsParisMuseumsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But even Michael Connelly, the author of the bestselling Lincoln Lawyer series, feared he might fall behind when writing about AI.Connelly’s eighth novel in the series, to be released on Tuesday, centres on a lawsuit against an AI company whose chatbot told a 16-year-old boy that it was OK for him to kill his ex-girlfriend for being unfaithful.But as he was writing, he witnessed the technology altering the way the world worked so rapidly that he feared his plot might become out of date.“You don’t have to lick your finger and hold it up to the wind to know that AI is a massive change that’s coming to science, culture, medicine, everything,” he said. “It’s going to affect all parts of our lives.“But it’s kind of the wild west; there’s no government oversight. AI is moving so fast that I even thought my book might be archaic by the time it got published.”The Lincoln Lawyer novels are a series of Los Angeles-based thrillers in which the defence attorney Mickey Haller works out of his Lincoln car. They have been adapted into a 2011 film starring Matthew McConaughey, as well as a Netflix series.View image in fullscreenMatthew McConaughey in The Lincoln Lawyer.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex ShutterstockNot for the first time in the series, The Proving Ground took some inspiration from real-world events.Connelly said: “One was this case in Orlando, wherea teenager committed suicide, allegedly at the urging of a chatbot. Before that there was a case in England, where a person with some mental health issueswas encouraged [by a chatbot] to jump the wall at Windsor Palacewith a bow and arrow to try to find the Queen.”On the themes of the novel, he added: “Is free speech a human right or mechanical right? In the Orlando case, the judge said he wouldn’t grant a machine human rights. But it’s an interesting question. Is AI going to reach a point that it shares the rights that human beings have?”Connelly, 69, is one of the world’s leading crime writers, his books having topped bestseller charts and sold more than 89m copies. He is also known for the Harry Bosch series, which has been made into a TV show by Amazon. (In Connelly’s fictional universe, Haller and Bosch are half-brothers.)The writer has his own battles with AI. He is part of a collective of authors, including Jonathan Franzen, Jodi Picoult and John Grisham,suing OpenAI for copyright infringement.“The Author’s Guild came to me and said: ‘Do you know that all your books were fed into the giant maw of OpenAI’s training of its chatbot?’” Connelly said. “I didn’t. If we let that go by, it will put every publisher out of business. Authors will have no protections on their creative work. The purpose of the lawsuit is to have proper rules put in place for all levels of use.”He cited chess championGarry Kasparov’s loss to IBM’s Deep Blue in 1997as “one of the benchmarks that led us” to this moment. When asked if authors could go the way of grandmasters, he said: “It could happen, but I don’t think it’d be an improved world.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

De Niro said there needed to be “much more” resistance, adding: “The politicians are going to recognise that: either face the wrath of Trump or the wrath of the people – and they have to be more afraid of the wrath of the people.”De Niro also said thatTrump’s plans to seek a third termhad to be opposed. “We cannot let up on him because he is not going to leave the White House. He does not want to leave the White House. He will not leave the White House. Anybody [who] thinks, ‘Oh, he’ll do this, he’ll do that,’ is just deluding themselves.”He added: “It’s a classic bully situation. We see it, and there’s no other way to face a bully.

That’s the only way this is going to work.”No Kings protests across the US: in picturesRead moreDe Niro had previously shown hissupport for the No Kings protestin a video in which he said: “The original No Kings protest was 250 years ago. Americans decided they didn’t want to live under the rule of King George III. They declared their independence and fought a bloody war for democracy. We’ve had two and a half centuries of democracy since then. Often challenging, sometimes messy, always essential. And we fought in two world wars to preserve it.”He added: “Now we have a would-be king who wants to take it away. King Donald the First. Fuck that. We’re rising up again. … We’re all in this together, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.”De Niro has a long history of speaking out against Trump.In a pre-election video in 2016he described Trump as “a bullshit artist” and in 2019 he told the Guardian: “I can’t wait to see him in jail.”In 2023 he called Trump“evil” and “a wannabe tough guy with no morals or ethics”, andin May this year told the Guardian: “The man is a bully and you can’t let bullies win.”Explore more on these topicsFilmRobert De NiroDonald TrumpProtest (US)MSNBCTV newsUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

At about 9.30am – half an hour after visitors began entering via the front of the museum – the robbers positioned themselves at the south side of the building and used a vehicle-mounted extendable ladder to reach the second-floor balcony window.View image in fullscreenThe furniture lift, extended to the balcony of a gallery at the Louvre, that was used by the thieves.Photograph: Paul Dza/Sipa/ShutterstockTwo of the thieves broke in through the window using an angle grinder and other power tools, gaining access to the museum’s Apollo gallery.Louvre annotated imageThe Apollo gallery is home to France’s historic collection of crown jewels and was built in 1661 by Louis XIV. The items targeted by the thieves were located in the middle of the gallery.Apollo gallery layout.They then smashed glass displays and grabbed jewellery.What was stolen, and what was left behind?Officials said eight pieces were stolen:A necklace and a pair of earrings originally given by Napoleon I to his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise.A diadem (similar to a tiara), brooch and decorative bow belonging to Napoleon III’s third wife, Empress Eugénie. The diadem is dotted with nearly 2,000 diamonds.A tiara, necklace and single earring from a sapphire set worn by – among others – Marie-Amelie, the last queen of France.

The gang tried to set fire to the vehicle before they left but they were prevented by a member of museum staff.The robbery was completed in seven minutes, sources and officials told Agence France-Presse.The museum announced it was closing and visitors filed out.People leaving the Louvre on Sunday.Forensic teams and police officers were later seen at the scene of the break-in.Police at the scene of the Louvre break inWho are the suspects?Officials said a team of 60 investigators was working on the theory that an organised crime group was behind the theft. The interior minister, Laurent Nunez, said the raid was thought to have been carried out by an experienced team.What are people saying about museum security?The heist has reignited a row over a lack of security in France’s museums, which are far less secure than banks and increasingly targeted by thieves.Last month, criminals broke into Paris’s Natural History Museum, making off with gold samples worth $700,000, while thieves also stole two dishes and a vase from a museum in the central city of Limoges, the losses estimated at $7.6m.The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, admitted on Monday to security flaws in protecting the Louvre. “What is certain is that we have failed, since people were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels, giving France a terrible image,” he told France Inter radio.Nunez acknowledged that securing museums was a “major weak spot”. He noted that security measures at the Louvre had been strengthened in recent years, and would be reinforced further as part of a multimillion-euro overhaul of the museum.Has this happened before?View image in fullscreenMugshot and fingerprints of Vincenzo Peruggia, who stole the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911.

Vincenzo Peruggia entered the museum dressed as a museum worker. When no one was looking, he removed the painting and sneaked out. He was later arrested and the painting recovered.Another notorious episode came in 1956, when a visitor hurled a stone at the Mona Lisa, chipping paint near her left elbow and hastening the move to display the work behind protective glass.Sunday’s heist was the first theft from the Louvre since 1998, when a painting by Camille Corot was stolen and never seen again.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsParisMuseumsFranceEuropeNapoleon BonaparteexplainersShareReuse this content"

It forms a very small part of Johnson’s magnificent literary achievement, and its scope is unambitious. What it succeeds in doing, as an elegy closer in style and diction to an 18th-century“occasional” poem, is a kind of mimesis: it adds up to a portrait of the admirable Dr Levet. We’re not merely told about him but given a physical presence in the tropes and rhythms of the verse.The Hull-born Robert Levet (1705-1782) had lived in Johnson’s household from the later 1740s. He had become interested in medicine when, working as a waiter in Paris, he listened in, fascinated, to the doctors’ conversations as they dined. It seems a subscription was made for him to receive some training in pharmacy and anatomy. He remained unqualified, and, in London, his practice was among the poor. He worked for very small or no remuneration. As Johnson’s personal physician, he was deeply trusted by his master.Johnson’s recourse in the elegy to allegorical figures (“Hope’s delusive mine”, “Misery’s darkest cavern”, “lonely Want”, “lettered Arrogance”, to list a few) is relentless; the poem isn’t capacious enough to allow them to be explored and most may pass quicker through the reader’s mind than they deserve. However obvious-seeming, they are often rich in allusion - Want, for example, having been deserted by the friends that Wealth would, presumably, have easily kept, is revealingly “lonely”. Hope as a “delusive mine” is a powerful image allotted more generous space: the vicissitudes of the perilous activity (mining) are seen in realist terms, involving “sudden blasts” and “slow decline”. Metaphorically, they connect to Johnson’s own failure of hope, and the demise, abrupt or gradual, of his “social comforts”, so placing Robert Levet among the household companions Johnson deemed essential to his mental and physical wellbeing.It’s illuminating to see, in the torrent of verbal virtuositygathered on Wikiquotes, James Boswell’s report of Johnson’s words on “hope” as “perhaps the chief happiness this world affords … but expectations improperly indulged must end in disappointment …” . Johnson’s first quatrain here centres on a hope that is based on his wants rather than their possibility. It’s the forlorn hope that death is avoidable.Levet himself has been “well tried through many a varying year”. The rhetorical imperative, “See Levet to the grave descend” seems to denote both shock and fulfilled expectation. It also mocks any elevated poetic or biblical connotations of death. A thumbnail sketch of Levet the man follows: it sets out his qualities, with a touch of loving exaggeration, as “officious” (dutiful), “innocent, sincere / Of every friendless name the friend.” The contradictory nature of the man is condensed in the oxymoronic line “obscurely wise, and coarsely kind”. Johnson’s words to Boswell are more directly revealing: Levet is “a brutal fellow, but I have a good regard for him, for his brutality is in his manners, not in his mind”.It’s in the sixth stanza that Johnson most effectively characterises Levet, by contrasting him tacitly with doctors of higher training and aspirations: “No summons mocked by chill delay, / No petty gain disdained by pride, / The modest wants of every day / The toil of every day supplied.” This is one of the more elegant stanzas, visualising perhaps the gracious disdain of the higher-ranked physicians, but the lines are still firmly end-stopped and modestly cadenced. Johnson’s ABAB-rhymed tetrameters tramp steady circles throughout the poem, suggesting the regular, heavy tread as Levet makes his rounds, serving his patients with skill and care, but no inessential flourishes.In the last stanza, Levet’s demise is treated without special ceremony. The merciful swiftness of the death, apparently from heart attack, urges no pious sentiments from Johnson. His technique is as matter-of-fact as Levet’s medical learning. “Death broke at once the vital chain / And freed his soul the nearest way”. The undoing of a prisoner’s shackles is suggested in that gruff, unemotional language and rhythm. If the closeness of the soul to the mythical organ of love, the heart, is implied, Johnson makes little of the point.On the Death of Dr Robert Levet combines accomplished technique with resistance to the florid elegiac manners of Johnson’s period. It does its subject the greatest honour not by characterisation alone, but by being made in that character’s image.Note: the modernised text used here is fromthe Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 4.Explore more on these topicsSamuel JohnsonCarol Rumens's poem of the weekPoetryDoctorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All the tricks of the trade are here, and director Stuart Ortiz plays things more or less straight. In fact it’s a mockumentary: not a parody but instead a horror movie that happens to be told using the format of a true crime documentary.The story, about a masked killer called Mr Shiny (if you think this name strains credibility, don’t forget there are real serial killers nicknamed the Happy Face Killer, the Dating Game Killer and the Doodler), is functional enough. There are lurid details of the killings, and police officers talking about how the crimes were beyond belief; there are taunting notes from the murderer; passages where the trail goes cold; moments when the police nearly catch Mr Shiny, only for him to slip through their fingers.It’s a reminder of how comfortingly familiar these tropes have become, and because this is fiction, the moral questions triggered by actual true crime films are at a slight remove; there’s no need to ask whether the victims’ families are being properly respected here.The only area in which Strange Harvest is a little disappointing is in its practical effects – the prosthetics and gore work. Everything else looks exactly as it should, but the footage and photographs of the bodies lack the same precise verisimilitude. This wouldn’t matter in a straightforward goofy horror movie, but here it leaps out as clunky and fake.Indeed, if you didn’t know that you were watching fiction, it would be your first real clue. The rest of the re-creation is highly convincing – not least in the casting. Everyone here looks and acts exactly like the character type they are playing. There are no implausibly prettified police officers, or serial killers out of Vanity Fair’s Rising Stars page.Ignore the film’s marketing, which seems intent on positioning it as a run-of-the-mill masked maniac movie; this is a fascinating and neatly realised horror riff on the 2020s’ most popular genre.Strange Harvest is on digital platforms from 27 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Coming from an Indigenous group whose stories have been systematically effaced by official narratives, he looks to these clustered dots of light as both historical document and spiritual manifestation. Echoing Buck’s holistic approach to astronomy, Lisa Jackson’s hybrid documentary draws from a wealth of eclectic visual styles, all woven into a stunning portrait of a formidable community elder.Someone always on the go, Buck is often seen behind the wheel, heading from one job to another. Speaking at academic conferences and workshops, and leading lectures and presentations for young students, he not only makes astronomy accessible but also builds lasting connections between different generations. This sense of togetherness is especially touching considering Buck’s own tragic family history. He was separated from his siblings growing up, after they were forcibly removed from their parents by the state. His home life was gripped by a cycle of addiction, poverty and depression.The film depicts these chapters from his youth through stylised, evocative re-enactments shot on sumptuous 16mm film. Guided by Buck’s narration, these are images imbued with nostalgia and melancholy; the transitions between past and present are seamlessly done, lending a touch of poetry to an astonishing life story. His tireless efforts to preserve Indigenous tradition and knowledge have laid important community foundations that were once suppressed. Moving between the sky and the Earth, from the personal to the collective, Jackson’s sweeping documentary conjures a universe of experiences with striking style and insights.Wilfred Buck is on True Story from 24 October.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAstronomyNative AmericansSpacereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a show based on recent history that’s simultaneously uncomfortable with its status as, in the wry words of one character, “heritage”. In telling the story of the pioneering 1980s Sheffield garage run by three female mechanics, Gwenda’s Garage celebrates these women while refusing to turn them into calcified historical figures.As the performers tell the audience, this is a half-remembered, incomplete version of the actual Gwenda’s Garage, with fictional characters in place of the real mechanics. The musical is as much about the female protagonists’ activism against the backdrop of Tory rule and the introduction of Section 28 as it is about the garage itself, with rousing songs such as We Had a Scam and Welcome to Sheffield creating an infectious atmosphere of collective feminist and queer protest.View image in fullscreenComplex relationship … Nancy Brabin Platt and Sia Kiwa in Gwenda's Garage at  Sheffield Playhouse.Photograph: Chris SaundersThe beating heart of the show is the relationship between co-workers Bev (Nancy Brabin Platt) and Terry (Sia Kiwa). While Bev wants to settle down and become a mother, Terry is – as she sings – a “family of one”, resistant to monogamy and uncompromising in her activism. Their experiences underline what’s at stake here, as Bev is threatened with the removal of her foster kids and Terry struggles with the doubled oppression of being Black and gay in an overwhelmingly white women’s movement. Both must grapple with when to stay quiet, when to compromise and when to speak out.Next to this complexity, other characters are lightly sketched. While performed with real warmth by Eva Scott, kind and capable garage boss Carol remains slightly under-explored; likewise charming but clueless trainee mechanic Dipstick (Lucy Mackay). The addition of curious outsider Feona (Georgina Coram) allows for exposition and some crowd-pleasing gags at the expense of Southerners, but her journey from customer to ally to fully fledged member of the sisterhood feels rushed and thin.Jelena Budimir’s buoyant production is rough around the edges in a way that suits the scrappy spirit of the garage. No straightforward history play, Gwenda’s Garage is an unruly and joyful story of making change, with its eyes as much on the present as the past.At Sheffield Playhouse until 25 October.

The difference between shop-bought and homemade gnocchi is vast, especially the vac-packed, long-life kind, which are dense and can be heavy. Freshly made gnocchi, with fluffy baked potatoes, however, are light as air, pillowy and silky. If that sounds intimidating, let me reassure you that this recipe is really forgiving, and much easier than making fresh sheet pasta. I love them served simply, as here, with a slightly nutty sage butter andlotsof parmesan. The simple sauce lets those gnocchi sing.Parmesan and sage jacket potato gnocchiPrep10 minCook30 min+Serves42 leftover cooked baked potatoes, or 2 baking potatoes (about 550g)2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing1 large eggSea salt andblack pepper100g flour, plus extra for dustingNutmeg40g unsalted butter, cut into cubes2big sprigs fresh sage, leaves picked1 garlic clove, smashed in its skin30g parmesan, finely grated½ lemonIf you’re baking the potatoes, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, put in a small tray and rub all over with a little olive oil. Bake for about an hour to an hour and 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender all the way through. (If you’re using leftover cooked jacket potatoes, put them in a bowl and pop in the microwave to reheat.) When the potatoes are still warm but cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and press the flesh through a potato ricer and into a medium bowl (or mash by hand). You will need 275g mashed potato.Make a well in the middle, crack in the egg, season well and beat with a fork. Sift in 90g of the flour and finely grate in a few scratchings of nutmeg, then knead, adding the extra flour if the mix feels sticky. You want a smooth dough, but don’t overwork it.Turn out the gnocchi mix on to a lightly floured surface, divide in two and roll into long sausages. Cut the dough into 2½-3cm-long pieces, then arrange on a floured tray. Press a fork into the tops to give the gnocchi lines and extra surface area, if you wish.To cook the gnocchi, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Put the butter, olive oil, sage and smashed garlic in a large frying pan on a medium heat, and fry until the butter starts to turn lightly golden and nutty and the leaves go crisp. Take off the heat.Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface – that’s when you know they are ready. Using a spider or slotted spoon, lift the cooked gnocchi into the butter pan, along with a little of their cooking water, and toss with half the grated parmesan and a squeeze of lemon until they’re all coated in the glossy, buttery sauce (add more of the cooking water as needed).Serve topped with the extra grated parmesan and more black pepper.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyPotatoesVegetablesItalian food and drinkCheeseHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Food assistant: Lucy Ellwood.Indian food and drinkKaran Gokani’s sweet treats for Diwali – recipesThese ladoos are sweet, nutty morsels of dough perfect for sharing, while a quick Indian take on a bread pudding should be an instant hitKaran GokaniMon 20 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareDiwali is often called the festival of lights, a celebration of good over evil. It’s the most widely marked festival in India and feels a bit like Christmas does in the west. It’s synonymous with fireworks, bright colours, endless parties and tables creaking under the sheer weight of food and desserts. NoDiwaliis complete without boxes of sweets (mithai) and dried fruit exchanged between friends and family. In the UK, we keep those traditions alive, dressing up, visiting temples, reading Indian mythology to the kids and, most importantly, gathering with friends from every background and religion. For me, Diwali is about togetherness and sharing food that feels special, but doesn’t keep you in the kitchen for hours. The bread pudding is my take on the indulgentshahi tukda, while the ladoos are perfect to gift or to enjoy with a cup of chai after the feast.Easy ladoos (pictured top)Ladoosare one of the most iconic Indian sweets, right up there withgulab jamunsandjalebis. Picture an Indianhalwai’s shop overflowing with sweets of every shape, colour and size, all expertly crafted and generously laden with ghee. Ladoos often take centre stage, making them a popular choice of gift during auspicious occasions or for offering to Hindu deities at temples. This version is one of the simplest, requiring just a handful of ingredients, and can be prepared in minutes.Prep10 minCook50 min plus coolingMakes15-20110g ghee250g gram flour¼ tsp ground green cardamom1 pinch saffron(optional)50g mixed almonds and pistachios, toasted and roughly chopped180-200g granulated sugar, to tasteMelt the ghee in a nonstick pan on a medium heat. Turn down the heat, add the gram flour and cook, stirring constantly to combine it with the melted ghee and to make sure it doesn’t catch and burn. Keep cooking and stirring for 30-35 minutes. To begin with, the mix will resemble wet sand, but as you continue cooking and stirring, it will turn to a peanut butter consistency and smell wonderfully nutty. Don’t try to rush things, or leave the mix unattended, because it can burn very easily, and the slow roast is essential to the characteristic, nutty flavour of the ladoos.Take the pan off the heat, stir in the cardamom and saffron, if using, then leave to cool until just warm to the touch.Add the nuts and sugar to the cooled ladoo mixture, mix thoroughly, then tear off small chunks and roll between your palms into 15-20 x 4cm balls. Put these on a plate spaced slightly apart and leave to cool to room temperature.You can now serve the ladoos immediately, or store them in an airtight container and keep at room temperature for up to a week.Indian bread puddingView image in fullscreenKaran Gokani’s Indian bread pudding.Photograph: Kim Lightbody/The Guardian. Food styling: Tamara Vos. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food assistant: Lucy Ellwood.This takes inspiration from Hyderabad’sshahi tukda, a dish that’s typically made by frying bread in ghee, then soaking it in a thick, richrabdi, which is created by simmering full-fat milk for hours until it reduces to a fraction of its original volume. My version is a healthier, easier and quicker alternative that requires a lot less tending to and lets the oven do all the heavy lifting.Prep10 minCook1 hr+Serves4-612 slicesstale white bread, crusts removed100g ghee, or melted butter1 litre whole milk1 x 397g tincondensed milk150g sugar, or to taste1 pinch saffron, soaked in 2 tbsp milk¼ tsp ground cardamom, or the seeds from 2 pods, crushed¼ tsp ground nutmeg(optional)40g almonds, roughly chopped40g raisinsCut the bread into triangles, spread all but a teaspoon of the ghee over both sides of each piece, then arrange the triangles as they fall in a greased, roughly 20cm x 30cm, rectangular baking dish.In a large bowl, whisk the milk, condensed milk and sugar until the sugar dissolves, then stir in the saffron and its soaking milk, the cardamom and nutmeg, if using. Pour the milk mixture evenly over the bread in the dish, so it all gets soaked, then leave to steep for 10-15 minutes. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.Bake the pudding for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.Meanwhile, melt the remaining ghee in a small pan on a medium heat, then fry the almonds until golden. Turn off the heat, add the raisins and leave them to cook in the residual heat, stirring constantly, for a minute. Sprinkle the nut and raisin mix over the pudding and serve warm or chilled, just as it is or with a scoop of vanilla ice-creamThese recipes are edited extracts from Indian 101: Real Indian Recipes Made Simple, by Karan Gokani, published by Bluebird at £28.
