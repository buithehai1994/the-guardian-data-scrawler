It was later found to be a fake.Police named the attacker on Thursday night as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent.Greater Manchesterpolice revealed that three other people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – had been arrested “on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism”.It is understood the attacker entered the UK as a young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006.LivePolice declare Manchester synagogue attack 'terrorist incident' – videoThe attack drew widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, with Keir Starmer calling the knife attacker a “vile individual” who “attacked Jews because they are Jews, and attacked Britain because of our values”. Political rivals Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage were among those joining him in showing support for the Jewish community.It happened just days before the second anniversary of the 7 October attacks by Hamas in Israel. Police said there would be heightened security at synagogues and Jewish community centres in coming days. Research published today showed that more than a third (35%) of British Jews said they felt unsafe in the UK, compared with just 9% before the 7 October attacks.The Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council ​said in a statement on Thursday evening that the attack was “sadly something we feared was coming”.They added: “We call on all those in positions of power and influence to take the required action to combat hatred against Jewish people, and will be working with the authorities on a series of additional measures to protect our community over the coming days.”Six minutes of terror: how Manchester synagogue attack unfoldedRead moreStarmer flew back to the UK early from a gathering of European leaders in Denmark to chair an emergencyCobra meetingafter the incident before speaking to the nation from Downing Street..Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: “Israel grieves with the Jewish community in the UK after the barbaric terror attack in Manchester.“Our hearts are with the families of the murdered, and we pray for the swift recovery of the wounded.”In reference to his combative speech at the UN general assembly last week, the Israeli prime minister added: “As I warned at the UN, weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism. Only strength and unity can defeat it.”Police said three people remained in hospital with serious injuries. One was stabbed while another was hit by a car, and a third man “presented himself at hospital with an injury that may have been sustained as officers stopped the attacker”.The Guardian understands the attacker’s last known address was in Manchester. Police said that officers were continuing inquiries as part of their investigation in Crumpsall and nearby Prestwich.In a statement, Greater Manchester police said: “We are now able to confirm that, although formal identification is yet to take place, we believe the person responsible for today’s attacks is 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie. He is a British citizen of Syrian descent.“A suspicious device worn by the attacker during the incident has been assessed and was deemed not to be viable.“Based on what we currently know, our records do not show any previous Prevent referrals relating to this individual.”The statement added: “We are working to understand the motivation behind the attack as the investigation continues.”The investigation is being led by counter-terrorism police.At an earlier press conference, the GMP chief constable, Sir Stephen Watson, said that, thanks to the bravery of worshippers, security staff and the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from entering the synagogue.He said: “There were a large number of worshippers attending the synagogue at the time of this attack.”Witnesses were said to have seen a car driving erratically before a man got out and started attacking people with a knife. When it became clear what was happening, members of the congregation are said to have blockaded the doors to the synagogue.Rob Kanter, 45, a university lecturer with a PhD in Jewish-Muslim relations, was inside the synagogue at the time of the attack. When he first heard the shots, Kanter said he felt “bewildered, because I think the adrenaline kicks in” and then found himself thinking “am I really hearing this?”His first response then was “how are we going to keep ourselves and everyone else safe?” But he said the mood inside the synagogue was “actually relatively calm” as the attack unfolded outside.Kanter said: “I would say the mood among our fellow congregants was very calm, and everyone deals with these things in their own way. Some people get through this in a very quiet way, others like to talk, some people even try to use an element of humour just to keep themselves going.”Kanter said that once they were evacuated by police, the rabbi did his best to continue with the Yom Kippur service.View image in fullscreenAn armed officer at the scene.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAGMP said officers had been called to the synagogue on Middleton Road at 9.31am by a person who said he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and that one man had been stabbed.The force said: “Firearms officers were deployed at 9.34am as police continued to receive further reports from members of the public that a security guard had been attacked with a knife.”It said it declared Plato – the national codeword used by police and emergency services when responding to a “marauding terror attack” – and a major incident at 9.37am.Shots were fired by police firearms officers at 9.38am, with paramedics arriving at 9.41am, the statement continued.Video shared on social media appeared to show police officers pointing guns at someone lying on the ground outside the front of the synagogue. Members of the public could be heard shouting to firearms officers that the suspect had a bomb strapped to him.The Guardian view on the Manchester synagogue attack: a tragic wake-up call for Britain | EditorialRead moreDistressed relatives and friends of those inside the building gathered at the cordon. A woman whose husband was inside the synagogue said she was sick with worry as she had been unable to contact him since the attack.“We’re just waiting for news,” said the woman, who did not want to be identified. “I’ve not even got dressed yet, I just ran out in my pyjamas.”Another woman, who lives nearby, said she had family and friends who attended the synagogue and she had rushed out as soon as she heard the police helicopter.Olivia Gold said: “I’m absolutely distraught. It’s Jewish new year as well and this is the holiest day in the calendar … It would have been very busy, mainly with the men doing the service. It’s a big shul [synagogue].”The UK’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, said on Thursday night: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”He added: “This is not only an assault on the Jewish community, but an attack on the very foundations of humanity and the values of compassion, dignity and respect which we all share.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterUK security and counter-terrorismGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Only strength and unity can defeat it.”The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, accused the UK of failing to act against antisemitism in his response tothe attack in Manchester, which killed two people.Manchester synagogue attack: what do we know so far?Read moreSa’ar said he was “appalled” by the murders, claiming that antisemitic incitement had become “widespread” across Britain.“The truth must be told: blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as calls of support for terror, have recently become a widespread phenomenon in the streets of London, in cities across Britain and on its campuses,” Sa’ar said in a post on X on Thursday night.He further accused British authorities of failing to take the necessary action to stop the “toxic wave of antisemitism” and allowing it to persist.“We expect more than words from the Starmer government. We expect and demand a change of course, effective action, and enforcement against the rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement in Britain,” Sa’ar said.Netanyahu released a statement saying that Israel was standing in solidarity with the British Jewish community.“Israel grieves with the Jewish community in the UK after the barbaric terror attack in Manchester. Our hearts are with the families of the murdered, and we pray for the swift recovery of the wounded,” Netanyahu said in a statement released by the prime minister’s office on Thursday.Netanyahu had fiercely criticised the UK government when it recognised the Palestinian state earlier last month, alongside several other states such as Australia.“As I warned at the UN: weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism,” Netanyahu said on Thursday. “Only strength and unity can defeat it.”He accused Keir Starmer and other leaders who had recognised the Palestinian state as “giving a huge reward to terrorism”. Starmer has said that recognition of a Palestinian state is a necessary step to a peaceful two-state solution and that Hamas would be excluded in any future Palestinian state.LivePolice declare Manchester synagogue attack 'terrorist incident' – videoA man attacked the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall on Thursday morning, killing two members of the Jewish community and seriously injuring four more worshippers who had come to celebrate Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.The man, who police said appeared to be wearing an “explosive device”, was shot dead by police after stabbing one person and attempting to run over members of the synagogue with a car. Police later said the device was “not viable” and that they had arrested two suspects in connection with the attack.Greater Manchester police said they declared Plato – the national codeword used by police when responding to a “marauding terror attack” – in the morning. Starmer flew back to the UK early from a meeting of European officials in Denmark to chair an emergency Cobra meeting to address the incident.Speaking after the meeting, the prime minister condemned the “vile” attack and told British Jews that he would do “everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve”.“To every Jewish person in this country, I also want to say this: I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you, I really do,” Starmer said.In a July report, the Board of Deputies of British Jews foundwidespread failures to address anti-Jewish discriminationin the country including within state institutions.In August, the Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors antisemitism, saidit had recorded 1,521 antisemitic incidentsin the first half of 2025. This was the second-highest number of its kind but down by a quarter from the record number recorded last year.Israeli officials such as Netanyahu have in the past claimed pro-Palestine activism has led to an increase in antisemitism, an accusation activists have rejected.Explore more on these topicsIsraelManchesterGreater ManchesterBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

The terms ‘Zionist’ or ‘Zionism’ were employed in 210 instances, while the offender made a direct comparison between Israel and the Nazis on 172 occasions.”Every month in the first half of 2025 saw at least 200 incidents. The highest monthly total in the first half of 2025 came in June, with 326 incidents, coinciding with an escalation in the Israeli military operation in Gaza and war between Israel and Iran.Explore more on these topicsAntisemitismJudaismIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

They said they had received 1,500 pledges to attend the demonstration and risk arrest and were expecting hundreds more to register by the weekend.A letter sent by the Metropolitan police to Defend Our Juries after the attack in Manchester – in which two members of the Jewish community died and four were left in a serious condition – said the event in London would require “a significant policing plan”.“Following the horrific and tragic events that have taken place in Manchester this morning, the details of which are still developing, the Met is stepping up reassurance and protective security operations across the capital with a particular focus on London’s Jewish and Muslim communities,” said the letter, which was signed in the name of the deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan.“However, as you know, your previous large-scale events and other concurrent protests place a significant pressure on policing and draw officers away from the communities they serve to be in central London. This means less neighbourhood and response officers in their communities and less officers focusing on serious crimes.”Adelekan said the force would be required to deploy hundreds of officers to the protest given the number of people being urged to turn up, and after the last three events in central London. Those required more than 2,500 officers, including counter-terrorism officers.“This weekend we would ask you to consider pausing your activity and postponing it for another weekend. This would ensure that those officers who would otherwise be policing your event can instead be in their communities, providing a visible reassurance and protective security,” the letter said.“This would ensure we are able to dedicate all the resources we have to ensure that Jewish Londoners can be as reassured as is possible during the Jewish high holy days, and that Muslim communities can be protected against those who may exploit these tragic events.”Defend Our Juries said in its reply to the Met that it “utterly condemned” the attack in Manchester, and it said it had always been the choice of the Metropolitan police as to whether or not to make arrests at its protests.“This is what genuine terrorism looks like and we join with others in condemning it unreservedly,” the group said.It went on: “According to your letter, it appears the political oversight in proscribingPalestine Action, which aimed to save lives in Palestine, is taking away from the police protecting the community from those who seek to take lives.“As I’m sure you will understand, the protection of our democracy and the prevention of countless deaths are critical issues. Therefore, our protest will go ahead as planned for this Saturday.”Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionMetropolitan policePoliceLondonProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

They will say “yes, but we need this and that”, Abusada said.Hugh Lovatt, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said it would be very difficult for Hamas to accept the terms unconditionally. “That is understandable. The text lacks details. But then anything other than total and final acceptance will be used against Hamas by Israel, the Trump administration and possibly the Europeans,” he said.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has accepted the Trump plan, which has incorporated many of Israel’s principal demands and was formulated without consulting Hamas.Israel intercepts aid flotilla but one ship reported to have escaped blockadeRead moreNetanyahu, who is wanted for alleged war crimes by the international criminal court committed during the Israeli offensive inGaza, has said Israel would “finish the job” if Hamas rejected the proposal or slowed their implementation. In March, Israel unilaterally broke a two-month ceasefire, refusing to move to a scheduled second phase that could have definitively ended hostilities.Hamas leaders are divided between Istanbul, Doha and Gaza, which complicates discussions on the group’s response. Turkey and Qatar are putting pressure on Hamas to make concessions.One sticking point is the plan’s demand that Hamas disarm, a source close to the organisation said. The surrender of all weapons would be very difficult for Hamas to accept, especially without any political process or substantial progress towards a two-state solution.“There are different trends within the movement. The membership in Doha tends to be more pragmatic, especially compared to the military leadership in Gaza. There is an obvious need to have the buy-in of the military win, and the rank and file fighters,” said Lovatt.The war was triggered by the Hamas raid into southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. About 250 were taken hostage, of whom 48 remain in Gaza, though fewer than half are still alive.More than 66,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israel’s offensive in Gaza, much of the territory reduced to rubble, and most of the 2.3 million population displaced many times.View image in fullscreenSmoke billows after Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City on Thursday.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPATrump’s proposal will require the militants to release all Israeli hostages within 72 hours of a ceasefire coming into effect, the gradual withdrawal of Israeli military forces to a buffer zone along the perimeter, and a surge of humanitarian aid. It also requires Israel to free more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, many serving life sentences, which Hamas could frame as a significant win.Another concern for Hamas is the vague promise of Israeli withdrawals, though the clear statement that there will be no annexation or occupation of Gaza by Israel was welcomed by one source close to Hamas.Some analysts say divisions within Hamas are often exaggerated.“I don’t think there is a real split between Gaza, the West Bank and the outside leadership. They all agree on opposing the disarmament because the armed struggle is such a deep principle in their nature and identity,” said Michael Milshtein, an expert in Hamas at Tel Aviv University.Hamas has suffered very significant losses in the war. Thousands of fighters have been killed, along with almost all senior military leaders. A report by ACLED, the independent violence monitoring group, found at least 40 commanders and key operatives in Hamas’s military wing had been killed by Israeli airstrikes since March. Their deaths have left only one senior commander from Hamas’s pre-7 October military council still in command, ACLED said.But Hamas continues guerrilla operations and maintains fragments of governance in the absence of any alternative. Humanitarian officials in Gaza said the group still had a strong presence in Gaza City, the “central camps” farther south and the coastal zone of al-Mawasi.Hamas, which was founded in 1987, has recruited thousands of new fighters who, though inexperienced and poorly equipped, can inflict casualties on Israeli forces.Milshtein said that, according to military sources, 90% of Hamas commanders had been killed, 97% of its rockets destroyed or launched, but only 40% of the group’s extensive tunnel network had been destroyed.“Hamas have adjusted to the new conditions. They are active in areas where the [Israeli military] has declared Hamas is totally defeated, but you can’t totally erase Hamas. They have metamorphosed and they have survived,” Milshtein said.Some within Hamas are committed to rejecting the Trump plan outright.“There is a trend from the military wing, especially the younger fighters, which wants to keep fighting,” Lovatt said. “Their view is that Israel is struggling strategically: the mobilisation of reservists is a huge burden, elections are due within a year or so, there is growing international and domestic pressure … So, for them, it’s just a question of who will hold out the longest.”Explore more on these topicsHamasGazaPalestineIsraelDonald TrumpIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022, at-home medical abortions were made permanent in England and Wales, after temporary legislationallowed them to take place at homeduring the pandemic. In Northern Ireland, at-home abortion care is not permitted at any gestation.Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) recommending that early medical abortions can occur safely at home in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, legislation acrossEnglandand Wales limits this to 10 weeks.Thestudy, published in BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health, looked at the outcomes of abortions carried out between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy in hospital and at home across NHS Lothian in Scotland, between 2020 and 2025. At-home medical abortions are legal in Scotland up to 12 weeks.During this period, 14,458 referrals were made to the abortion service, and of these 485 women (3.5%) were assessed as being between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy either by the date of their last period or by an ultrasound scan.The researchers found that 97% of abortions were successful for both groups of women.They also found cases of serious complications, such as heavy bleeding or infection, one month after the procedure among those who had opted for a medical abortion at home. But despite this, the researchers concluded it was a rare complication among women who are less than 20 weeks pregnant.“Our study contained a small number of patients, with only one case of haemorrhage that presented one month following abortion with chronic bleeding, and so admission to hospital for [early medical abortion] is unlikely to have altered this,” they said.The researchers concluded that the study showed that at-home medical abortions between 10 and 12 weeks were “highly effective and safe”.The abortion pill is safe. But why should Trump let facts get in the way of his agenda?  | Moira DoneganRead more“In line with WHO guidance, action is needed to extend [early medical abortion] at home up to [12] weeks to women across the rest of the UK and beyond,” they concluded.Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the BritishPregnancyAdvisory Service, said: “This important study from Scotland adds to the already extensive body of evidence that at-home medical abortion between 10 and [12] weeks’ gestation is safe and effective.“Thousands of women each year in the UK are being compelled to attend hospital appointments and undergo surgical procedures when, as this research makes clear, they could be treated at home.”She added: “When the abortion law was first passed in 1967, it was designed to protect and improve women’s health. Nearly 60 years later, this legislation is restricting our ability to innovate and develop services in line with clinical practice.“It is time for parliament to modernise our out-of-date legal framework, and finally allow healthcare professionals to give all women in the UK the best possible care, including the choice of an at-home medical abortion care throughout the first trimester.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAbortionHealthPregnancyWomen's healthWomenEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The assessments contained in the key document will inform the broad shape of the 26 November budget.Reeves this week usedher conference speechto warn Labour figures against “peddling the idea” that the government could abandon fiscal responsibility, while Keir Starmer told delegates the fiscal rules were “non-negotiable”.It came after Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, last week suggested that Labourshould not be “in hock”to global bond markets, amid pressure to turn around the government’s dismal ratings in opinion polls.The chancellor has also faced intensive lobbying from business leaders warning her against tax rises targeted at industry after last year’s autumn budget, while Labour is bound by manifesto pledges not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT.Some senior figures in government – including Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister – appeared this week to flirt publicly with the idea of breaching the tax pledges.Morgan Stanley suggested Reeves could keep bond markets satisfied by breaking Labour’s promises, because this could help raise billions of pounds while limiting the impact on the UK economy.“The most gilt market-friendly outcome is one where, perhaps in a breach of manifesto commitments, the government introduces [about] 1% of GDP in tax hikes next year,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tax increases that lead to higher consumer prices could weigh heavily on growth, while also forcing the Bank of England to maintain interest rates at higher levels.In a table of possible tax hikes that it argued could raise between £25bn and £45bn, the investment bank said the biggest potential revenue-raising measure would be to extend the freeze of income tax thresholds by at least another year to generate between £7bn and £10bn.Other measures included taxes on gambling, the banking industry, changes to council tax and an overhaul of pension taxation.“Overall, we believe the budget is likely to be less bad than feared on the balance of 1) tax increase impacts spread across sectors (and therefore generally moderate), while 2) still being extensive enough to reduce the current level of market fiscal concerns (at least tactically),” Morgan Stanley said in its note to clients.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyEconomicsTax and spendingLabourRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

In February, she said the UK would “probably have to leave” if the treaty prevented the government acting in the national interest.Despite private concerns from one nationConservativesthat such a decision will force out moderate Tories, the party leader is understood to have signed off plans to leave the international agreement.Badenoch is now expected to announce in a speech at the party’s Manchester conference on Sunday how the Tories would exit the ECHR, after a shadow cabinet meeting on the decision on Friday.In a blow to Badenoch on the eve of conference, another former Tory MP, Sarah Atherton, defected to Reform UK, saying the Conservatives “had promised strength but delivered weakness”.In June, Badenoch set up a commission to examine whether the UK should withdraw from a series of international legal agreements, including the ECHR and the refugee convention, and overturn some domestic legislation, such as theClimate Change Actand the Equality Act.Centrist Tory MPs have been keeping their concerns to themselves to avoid making the party’s dire poll ratings worse. “Given where we are I’m not speaking out against it,” one said, while another added it was “difficult to argue against” given the party’s circumstances.However, several Tories who have previously spoken out against leaving the ECHR, warning about the impact on the Good Friday agreement and the UK’s international reputation, now appear to have changed their minds.“The ECHR is failing us all. Europe needs a new convention on asylum and immigration to cope with the world of 2025, which is very different from the world of 1945,” one MP said. “[Keir] Starmer needs to be leading the charge or he’ll lose. People outside the beltway have had enough.”Another Tory MP said: “Things have changed. When people perceive international agreements as stopping governments doing things they voted them in for – democracy comes first.” A third added: “The world has moved on in respect of the ECHR and will have moved even more by the next general election.”A Labour source said: “This is a desperate grab for relevance by the Conservatives, who are following Reform off the cliff edge in offering unworkable solutions that are against Britain’s national interest.”A Conservative party spokesperson said: “No decision has been taken. Kemi Badenoch will take a decision in consultation with her cabinet and that is happening on Friday.”The ECHR was established in 1950 and sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries of theCouncil of Europe. It is a central part of UK human rights law and has been used to halt attempts to deport people who are deemed to be in the UK illegally.Critics have focused their concerns on article 3, which protects against inhuman or degrading treatment, and article 8, which helps to protect the right to private and family life.Individuals and countries can make an application to theEuropean court of human rightsin Strasbourg (not to be confused with the court of justice of the EU in Luxembourg), but only if they have exhausted every domestic route.During the Conservative leadership election, the ECHR became a dividing line between Badenoch and Robert Jenrick, who failed to become leader. Badenoch argued that leaving the ECHR would not solve the UK’s problems, while Jenrick said his party would “die” if it argued to stay in.Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, said last week that prospective Conservative candidates shouldeither support leaving the ECHR or stand down.Addressing a meeting of the Thatcherite Bruges Group thinktank, he said: “I would get them to sign a contract to say they actually stand for Conservative values. I would get them to say you have got to leave the ECHR, and if you don’t want to do that, don’t stand as a Conservative.”Moderate Conservatives were concerned by Jenrick’s words. A former Tory minister said: “This move of effectively setting an ideological purity test is a dangerous route for any political party. It is more sensible to expand your support rather than contract it.”Labour has announced plans to attempt to restrict people’s use of the ECHR to fight deportation.Keir Starmer said on Monday that he wasready to change the way the ECHR is appliedin the UK to enable the government to deport more asylum seekers whose claims have been refused and foreign criminals who claim they are victims of torture.He said the government needed to “look again at the interpretation” of articles 3 and 8 of the convention, which protect the rights of people against breaches of their family life, and torture or inhuman treatment if removed back to their home country.Explore more on these topicsConservativesKemi BadenochCouncil of EuropeHuman rightsEuropean court of human rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

And he appeared to suggest that he wanted to ensure they did not face a repeat of “practices” he and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, had faced when younger – a possible reference to intrusive press scrutiny that also plagued their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.William said of the “insatiable” media he experienced growing up: “They wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they’d be everywhere.“And if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.”With regard to his change agenda, William said: “I embrace that and I enjoy that change – I don’t fear it. That’s the bit that excites me, is the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical change, but changes that I think that need to happen.”He added: “I think it’s very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this. But, there’s also points where you look at tradition and go: ‘Is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?’”Asked by Levy, star of the hit TV series Schitt’s Creek, if he thought about being king, William replied: “It’s not something I wake up in the morning and think about, because to me, being authentic and being myself and being genuine is what drives me.“And then you can attach whatever labels and kind of roles that come on top of that, but if I’m not true to myself, and I’m not true to what I stand for and believe in – then it doesn’t really matter who you are, it gets lost.“I take my roles and my responsibilities seriously but it’s important, like I said to you earlier, you don’t feel they own you – you have to own them.”Explore more on these topicsMonarchyPrince WilliamTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Any institution that resists could be hit with crushing fines or stripped of federal research funding.”“If anyCaliforniaUniversity signs this radical agreement, they’ll lose billions in state funding – including Cal Grants – instantly. California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom,” Newsom said in the statement. Cal Grants is the state’s $2.8bn student financial aid program.Trump’s proposed “compact” was offered to schools that were seen by Trump as “good actors”, May Mailman, a senior White House advisertold the Wall Street Journalon Wednesday, with a president or a board who were, in the Trump administration’s view, “reformer[s]” who have “really indicated they are committed to a higher-quality education”.The “compact”requires universities to eliminate departmentsthat are seen as hostile or dismissive to conservatives, limit the proportion of international students on campus, accept the Trump administration’s definition of gender and restrict the political speech of employees, as well as freeze their tuition fees for five years. It also demands that universities crack down on “grade inflation”, an increase in the proportion of students receiving top marks in their classes, the Wall Street Journal reported.Trump administration must restore $500m in funding to UCLA, judge rulesRead moreThe University of Southern California is a private research university with an$8.2bn endowment. Putting academic freedom aside, some of Trump’s proposals would be economically challenging for the school, the Los Angeles Times reported.More than a quarter of the 2025 freshman class is made up of international students, the newspaper notes, with more than half of international students coming from China or India. The Trump administration’s compact not only limits international student enrollment to 15% of students, but also requires that no more than 5% come from any one country.“We are reviewing the Administration’s letter,” USC said in a statement in response to questions about Trump’s compact. The university did not immediately comment on Newsom’s statement.Most otherUS universitiesfall within the 15% cap, but about 120 exceed it, including USC, Columbia University, Emory University and Boston University, federal data shows.Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaHigher educationTrump administrationWest CoastDonald TrumpUS universitiesUS constitution and civil libertiesnewsShareReuse this content"

We have no right to do so for reasons of our own security.”“I think no one doubts that Russia’s countermeasures will not be long in coming,” he added, speaking at the Valdai plenary session, an annual gathering of officials and foreign policy experts where Putin often sets out his views on global affairs.His remarks came as45 European leaders gathered in Copenhagenfor a summit aimed at bolstering support for Ukraine and accelerating defence projects intended to ensure the continent is capable of deterring Russian aggression. The meeting followed turbulent weeks in which several European countries reported Russian drone and jet incursions, raising fears that Moscow was testing Nato’s resolve.While threatening Europe, the Russian president struck a conciliatory note towards Donald Trump, despitethe US leader’s recent disparaging remarks about him.In what appeared to be an attempt to win back Trump’s favour, Putin lavished praise on him, claiming that “if Trump had been in power, the conflict inUkrainecould have been avoided” – a line the US president has often used himself in public speeches.Both Moscow andVolodymyr Zelenskyyhave spent months trying to court Trump over the war in Ukraine, as the US leader has repeatedly shifted his stance.In recent weeks, Kyiv appeared to gain the upper hand, with Trump expressing disappointment in Putin for prolonging the fighting and dismissing Russia’s economy and military as a “paper tiger”.US to give Ukraine intelligence on long-range energy targets in Russia, say reportsRead moreAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Trump recently authorised US intelligence agencies and the Pentagon to help Kyiv carry out strikes deep inside Russian territory – a move which would amount to a significant shift in US policy under his leadership.Zelenskyy has also lobbied Washington for Tomahawk cruise missiles, Barracudas and other long-range US-made weapons capable of hitting targets up to 500 miles away.As on previous occasions when criticised by Trump, Putin brushed it off, seemingly counting on the US leader to change his mind.He described Trump as a “comfortable interlocutor” who knows “how to listen” and said Moscow was seeking a “full-scale restoration” of relations with the US, praising Trump’s administration for its “directness and lack of hypocrisy”.Responding to Trump’s “paper tiger” jab, Putin suggested the remark might have been ironic, saying: “If we are comfortable being at war with the wholeNatobloc, but we’re a paper tiger, then what is Nato?”The Russian leader also praised Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza, saying former UK prime minister Tony Blair –expected to play a central role in the initiative– could “make a positive contribution”.Putin then digressed to recall how he once stayed overnight at Blair’s home and the two had coffee together the next morning “in their pyjamas”.The tone was notably harsher when it came to Europe, with most of Putin’s ire directed at the continent, blaming “European elites” for obstructing peace in Ukraine and “whipping up hysteria” in the region.He said: “It turns out that war with the Russians is practically on the doorstep. They repeat this nonsense, this mantra, over and over again … They can’t believe what they’re saying, that Russia is going to attack Nato? They’re either incredibly incompetent if they truly believe it, because it’s impossible to believe this nonsense, or they’re simply dishonest.”Putin also condemned France’s arrest this week of the crew onan oil tanker from Russia’s “shadow fleet”, which was suspected of serving as a launchpad for drone flights that forced Danish airports to close last week.He said: “The tanker was seized without any grounds in neutral waters. This is piracy.”On the war in Ukraine, there was no sign that Putin was seeking compromise or scaling back his maximalist goal of forcing Kyiv’s capitulation.Despite Russia’s modest recent progress on the battlefield, he insisted that his forces were “confidently advancing” along the entire front.Putin also claimed Ukraine was suffering far greater losses than Russia – even though western estimates put Russian casualties at close to a million, higher than Ukraine’s.“Given Ukraine’s losses, Kyiv should think seriously about starting negotiations,” Putin said.Joining European leaders in Copenhagen, Zelenskyy said Russia was “stepping up its destructive actions” and urged Europe to show the “political will” to act without delay.The Ukrainian president said: “We see clearly that only joint action and united efforts can guarantee real security. No country should be left alone against this threat.” He called on Europe to “increase the pressure, and increase the pressure now, so that Russia is forced to end the war and change its policy”.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinDonald TrumpRussiaUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeNatonewsShareReuse this content"

In the past three days alone, he has posted or reposted calls to cancel Netflix for its content at least 26 times.Musk’s anti-Netflix tirade began on Tuesday, when he posted “this is not ok” while reposting from rightwing activist account Libs of TikTok’s clip of the Netflix show Dead End: Paranormal Park, in which the character Barney says he is transgender.“Dead End Paranormal Park, a show on Netflix, is pushing pro-transgender on CHILDREN. This show is advertised for 7-YEAR-OLDS,” said the Libs of TikTok post, referring to Netflix’s TV-Y7 rating designating the show appropriate for viewers aged seven and older. Paranormal Park ran for 20 episodes in 2022, and was canceled by Netflix the following year. The company is not currently promoting the show.Zach Barack, the voice actor for Barney and the first openly trans actor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, quickly rebuffed Musk’s narrative on X,writing: “you can fear monger all you want, but kids & parents have told me it saved their lives!!”In the days since, Musk has reposted several tweets from other users who claim to have canceled their subscriptions in protest of what he claims is an agenda to brainwash children with content supportive of LGBTQ+ rights.“Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” hepostedon Wednesday while quoting a meme depicting Netflix’s “transgender woke agenda” as a Trojan horse being admitted to a castle labeled “your kids”.“True,” hewroteon Thursday over another user’s tweet claiming: “Transgender propaganda isn’t just quietly lurking in the background on Netflix. They are actively pushing it on users.” He linked to anarticleon Netflix’s Tudum media site titled “Celebrate Trans Day of Visibility with These 16 Movies and Shows”.Musk has also called out pro-trans themes in shows such as The Baby-Sitters Club and Cocomelon, advanced rightwing arguments that Netflix has an “anti-white” hiring process, and reposted false claims, including that 100% of political donations by Netflix employees in 2024 went to Democrats.Additionally, Musk commented “Cancel Netflix” on a Libs of TikTok post about Netflix’s 2023 report on its diversity and inclusion initiatives.Musk is the father of a trans daughter, Vivian Wilson, who haspublicly criticizedher father’s anti-trans vendetta. In her 2022 petition to legally change her name and gender, Wilson wrote: “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.”Musk has sincesaidthat he “lost my son, essentially” and claimed that he had been “tricked” into allowing gender-affirming care for Wilson, whom he claimed was “dead, killed by the woke mind virus”.Netflix, a company whose executives have repeatedly invoked freedom of speech when faced with backlash for content on its platform, has not publicly responded to Musk’s taunts. This is not the first time the company has come under fire from the right; in 2020, outrage over its film Cuties, which depicted underage actors performing sexualized dance routines, led to a spike in US customer cancellations, though it receded within days.In 2021, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos cited free speech when defending comedian Dave Chappelle, whose anti-trans comments in his special The Closer led to an employee walkout at Netflix’s California headquarters. Sarandos has also stood behind the company’s decision to commission three specials from rightwing comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, whose racist comments calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at a Trump rally last year drew widespread consternation.Musk’s calls for mass cancellation of Netflix subscriptions comes on the heels of an unrelated free speech firestorm in Hollywood over Disney’s indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow under pressure from the Trump administration. After backlash from celebrities as well as customers cancelling their Disney+ subscriptions, the company allowed Kimmel back on the air.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskNetflixUS televisionAnimation on TVTelevisionTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Today, a third of greenhouse gas emissions come from the global food system and taming the climate crisis is impossible without changing how the world eats, the researchers said.Foodproduction is also the biggest cause of the destruction of wildlife and forests and the pollution of water.The planetary health diet (PHD) sets out how the world can simultaneously improve the health of people and the planet, and provide enough food for an expected global population of 9.6 billion people by 2050.The diet is flexible, allowing it to be adapted to local tastes, and can include some animal products or be vegetarian or vegan. However, all versions advise eating more vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes and whole grains than most people in the world currently eat. In many places, today’s diets are unhealthy and unsustainable due to too much meat, milk and cheese, animal fats and sugar.People in the US and Canada eat more than seven times the PHD’s recommended amount of red meat, while it is five times more in Europe and Latin America, and four times more in China. However, in some regions where people’s diets are heavily reliant on starchy foods, such as sub-Saharan Africa, a small increase in chicken, dairy and eggs would be beneficial to health, the report found.Chart shows different parts of the world and how much they eat from which food groups, as described in the fifth paragraph of the articleSevere inequalities in the food system must also be ended to achieve healthy and sustainable diets, the researchers said. The wealthiest 30% of the world’s population generates more than 70% of food-related environmental damage, it found. Furthermore, 2.8 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet and 1 billion are undernourished, despite enough food being produced globally. The food system is also failing the 1 billion people living with obesity, the report said.The report recommends shifting taxes to make unhealthy food more costly and healthy food cheaper, regulating the advertising of unhealthy food and using warning labels, and the shifting of today’smassive agricultural subsidiesto healthier and more sustainable foods.View image in fullscreenThe report recommends shifting taxes to make healthy food cheaper.Photograph: Wu Hao/EPA“What we put on our plates can save millions of lives, cut billions of tonnes of emissions, halt the loss of biodiversity, and create a fairer food system,” said Prof Johan Rockström, who co-chaired theEAT-Lancet Commissionthat produced the report. “The evidence is undeniable: transforming food systems is not only possible, it’s essential to securing a safe, just, and sustainable future for all.”“This is not a deprivation diet,” said Prof Walter Willett of the Harvard TH Chan school of public health, and another commission co-chair. “This is something that could be delicious, aspirational and healthy. It also allows for cultural diversity and individual preferences, providing flexibility.”The report,published in the Lancet, was produced by 70 leading experts from 35 countries and six continents. It builds on the2019 reportthat introduced the PHD, but includes new evidence of the health benefits of the diet.“We have been able to look at this diet in relation to health outcomes such as total mortality, diabetes, respiratory diseases, heart disease, stroke, etc and we found very strong inverse relationships” said Willett. The diet was also linked to reduced cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.Overall, the researchersestimated global adoptionof the PHD couldprevent 15m early deaths a yearin adults. The estimate did not include the impact of the diet reducing obesity, meaning it is probably an underestimate.The PHD recommends plant-rich, flexible diets, including:Fruits and vegetables – at least five portions a dayWhole grains – three to four portions a dayNuts – one portion per dayLegumes (beans, peas, lentils) – one portion per dayDairy – one serving of milk, yoghurt or cheese portions a dayEggs – three to four a weekChicken – two portions a weekFish – two portions a weekRed meat – one portion a weekskip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In low income countries, it’s the starchy foods and grains, whereas in high income countries it is animal-sourced foods, sugar, saturated fats, and dairy. It’s insane how much dairy is consumed in Europe and North America.”The data underlying the report isavailable onlineand can be used to tailor different planetary health diets for the tastes of people in specific countries and of different ages. The website also shows how much the diets reduce deaths, improve nutrition, and cut environmental impacts. “Hopefully this will lead to more science-based policymaking,” said Springmann.View image in fullscreen‘What needs to be reduced differs a lot [from country to country]. In low income countries, it’s the starchy foods and grains.’Photograph: eFesenko/AlamyThe PHD is better than current average diets for many nutrients, including fatty acids, fibre, folate, magnesium and zinc. Adequate iron and vitamin B12 could be provided by green leafy vegetables, fermented soy foods and algae, the researchers said.Moving diets towards the PHD could be achieved by helping consumers make better everyday choices, said Prof Line Gordon, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, for example by shifting taxes to make healthy foods cheaper, and putting warning labels on unhealthy foods. “But it is not just about getting prices lower, it’s also about bringing purchasing power up so that people can afford a healthier diet” she said.“Our recommendations are grounded in scientific evidence and real-world experience,” Gordon said. “Changes are already under way, from school meal programmes to regenerative agriculture and food waste reduction initiatives.” England bannedprice promotions on unhealthy foodson Wednesday and willban advertising such foods online.The report estimates that food-related ill health and environmental damage costs society about $15tn a year. It said investments to transform the food system would cost $200bn to $500bn a year, but save $5tn.Alongside a shift in diets, the report calls for other changes to the food system, including cutting the loss and waste of food, greener farming practices, and decent working conditions, as a third of food workers earn below living wages.The launch of the PHD in 2019 led toattacks from meat industry interests. Rockström said: “The [new report] is a landmark achievement. It is a state-of-the-art scientific assessment that quantifies healthy diets for all human beings in the world and the environmental boundaries all food systems need to meet to stay safe. So we have a really rigorous foundation for our [results]. We are ready to meet that assault.”Explore more on these topicsFoodHealthFarmingClimate crisisFood & drink industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s what the polls sayMichael Savage,Seán ClarkeandAshley KirkReform’s lead is persistent but pollsters themselves point out that their models come with significant uncertaintyUK politics live – latest updatesThu 2 Oct 2025 06.49 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 15.59 EDTShareNigel Farage has spent his political career disrupting the political order, but with Reform UK’s popularity on the rise, some in Westminster believe he could be on course to pull off the greatest political earthquake in modern British political history.Not only have recent polls pointed to Reform effectively replacing theConservativesas the main opposition, some have even suggested Farage could enter Downing Street if such support is maintained at the next election.But what exactly are the current polls telling us? And how likely is it that such a huge shift will actually materialise?Reform’s poll lead is persistent, but recent. Its support first matched and overtook Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives at the start of the year. Soon after, it was vying with Labour. It was in April, as voters began to focus on local elections, that Farage’s party began to enjoy a solid poll lead.The Guardian’s latest poll tracker – which takes an average of the polls over the last 10 days – has Reform polling at 31%. This is 10 points ahead ofLabour, on 21%.Poll averagesOverall vote shares only tell part of the story. Several pollsters now use polling models that combine a bumper sample of polling data with demographic information to estimate how each seat might play out. The technique, known as MRP (multi-level regression and post-stratification) modelling, is designed to help reveal an increasingly chaotic political map.The latest of these, fromYouGovpublished on 26 September, estimated that Reform UK could win 311 seats if an election were held today. While this would be 15 seats short of an overall majority, it would put Farage in Downing St. The model suggests 231 of Reform’s projected seats would be gains from Labour.Other recent MRP models have even pointed to absolute majorities for Reform.MRP comparisonHowever, pollsters themselves make clear these models come with significant uncertainty. That uncertainty has only grown with the rise of multiparty politics, which makes first-past-the-post election results very volatile.As YouGov said on the release of its latest MRP, small changes could make a big difference. “On our central projections,Reform UKare winning no fewer than 82 seats by less than five percentage points,” it stated. “If they were to in fact lose all such hypothetical contests, they would end up falling well short of a parliamentary majority, rather than being within touching distance.”MapNevertheless, the reason Labour seats are so vulnerable to an increase in Reform’s popularity goes back to the nature of its landslide election victory last year. While it secured a colossal 411 seats, it was built on an incredibly efficient distribution of votes, rather than overwhelming support. It won just enough votes in the right constituencies to secure them.It means it is susceptible to the reverse dynamic – small losses of support in many seats could result in them ending up in the hands of others. Meanwhile, the arrival of multiparty politics has potentially lowered the vote share a party such as Reform needs to win a seat, as votes are divided in more directions.Prof Sir John Curtice, the doyen of British political pollsters, has also noted that MRPs suggest Labour would lose proportionally more votes in seats it currently holds – and more again in seats it holds where Reform came second in 2024.This is not a fanciful outcome. The disastrous result suffered by the Conservatives last time came from the fact they lost more votes where they had been strongest, putting previously safe seats at risk.Chart showing potential Labour lossesThere are, of course, huge caveats to all this. The most obvious is the fact that there is unlikely to be an election for years – most in Westminster don’t expect one until 2028 or 2029. If a week is a long time in politics, three or four years is an eternity.Polling is only ever a snapshot of current opinion, rather than a prediction. Polls always come with margins of error – and British elections are harder to forecast than ever because of the growing influence of new and smaller parties.Some trends are clear, however. Reform has managed to capitalise onrecord unpopularity for the new Labour government. Since the general election, Labour’s polling has dropped from 37.5% in July 2024 to 23.3% in June 2025 – a fall of 14.2 percentage points in a year.That is the worst for any government since 1983, whendata from PollBasebegan. Before this, the biggest recorded drop in popularity for a new government was in 1992, when John Major’s Conservatives, weary from years in government and a series of sleaze scandals, fell 9.8 points in 12 months.Previous governments’ pollingIt is common for new governments to lose popularity in their first year and come back to win re-election. But given the narrowness of its majority in many seats, the sheer size of Labour’s fall in support is a cause for concern.Meanwhile, Reform is in new territory. Whether it can maintain its current poll share as an election nears – and the thoughts of voters turn to who they actually want in government – is an unknown.The other major variable is the future of the Conservative party. Badenoch has failed to make an impression, but if she or another Conservative leader can begin to rekindle interest in the party, the electoral kaleidoscope will shift once more – and present a new challenge to Farage.Explore more on these topicsOpinion pollsReform UKLabourNigel FarageConservativesKeir StarmerKemi BadenochanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is built with ephemerality, with aggressive marketing.”But, she added, France’s distaste for the trend went even deeper: “It differs from French culture’s tradition of keeping objects, of savoir-faire – Shein holds a stigma that is moral as well.”Yet despite such outspoken antipathy, and with a Change.org petition to ban Shein in France now having topped 270,000 signatures, the country has not been immune to the brand’s inexorable rise over the past five years.Its model, based on shipping orders of cheap clothes directly from Chinese factories to homes, reportedly brought in $1bn net profit last year, making it not simply a figurehead of “ultra-fast fashion”, but one of China’s most lucrative companies. That is despite criticism overits environmental impactandworking practices, including allegations of forced labour that the company has denied, and cases of child labour that led to supplier contracts being terminated.Its success rests with the mind-boggling speed and volume at which it can produce designs, with 7,200 new items listed on the site every day. “It marks an entirely new way of consuming – everything is multiplied by a hundred,” said Abriat. Between late 2022 and late 2023, the company introduced 1.5m products to the US market – roughly 37 times more than Zara and 65 times more than H&M, according to Reuters.View image in fullscreenA model walks the runway during Shein’s ‘Endless Summer’ show in Paris in 2023.Photograph: Kristy Sparow/Getty ImagesAround the time of the Dijon pop-up opening, the French senate approved legislation aimed at curtailing ultra-fast fashion, specifically platforms such as Shein and its ultra-low-cost shopping rival Temu. It proposed a range of measures, from eco-taxes to a ban on advertising, restrictions on influencer collaborations, mandatory disclosure of production practices, and redirection of taxed revenues towards French sustainable producers.The bill was praised by many as a step in the right direction, but raised eyebrows for distinguishing between “classical” fast fashion (Zara and H&M among others) and “ultra-fast fashion”. The former group faces less stringent constraints. For some, this distinction seems to make high-street labels appear more virtuous by comparison, despite similar supply chains; for others, it is simply regarded as a way of undercutting Chinese competition.Yet France has its own history of fast fashion, rooted in the Sentier, Paris’s historic garment district in the 2nd and 3rd arrondissements. From the 1970s onward, the quarter, alongside other such wholesale districts (including in Marseille), developed a model based on rapid turnaround, small quantities, and short supply circuits, often replenished on demand rather than by seasonal calendars.This fuelled the rise of cult – and affordable – homegrown high street labels, such as Naf Naf, Kookaï, and Jennyfer, which thrived in the 1980s and 1990s, both in France and abroad, before outsourcing production and eventually disappearing or repositioning themselves. By the late 20th century, the Sentier’s system was outpaced by international labels such as H&M and Zara, which delocalised production and scaled up sourcing and stock – a dynamic portrayed in the French film saga La Vérité si Je Mens! (Would I Lie to You?), which is set in the area.On a cultural level, Abriat compared Shein’s reception to that of the arrival of H&M on Paris’s rue de Rivoli in 1998: “It was considered vulgar. The fashion elite saw it [as] devoid of taste or culture.” Today, she said, “they have been worked into actual labels, fully accepted” while Shein has taken on the pariah role.Attracting teenagers, H&M radically shifted its image with Karl Lagerfeld’s collaboration in 2004, which sold out within hours. From then on, France’s fashion establishment began to accept high-street pieces as part of the Parisian wardrobe.Other fast-fashion megabrands sought credibility by working tightly with renowned industry names. Emmanuelle Alt, the former editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris, worked with Zara as a creative consultant, while Suzanne Koller, the co-founder of Self Service magazine and current fashion editor at M magazine, has collaborated extensively with the brand, around fashion direction and styling. The model and Chanel ambassador Caroline de Maigret walked in an H&M runway show, and the model Aymeline Valade has appeared in a Zara lookbook and told W magazine that she shops there, for basics at least.Sophie Fontanel, a writer, influencer, and fashion editor at L’Obs, said: “Here in Paris, it has become common to mix Zara, vintage and luxury, all with a certain knowhow. Parisians don’t go to Zara for statement pieces or counterfeits, but for basics: shirts, jeans, timeless staples.” Few admit to wearing the brand, however. “You don’t say it,” says Fontanel. “Or you say: ‘You won’t believe it, but it’s Zara.’”A key difference with Shein is its online presence, which represents a cultural shift for older shoppers. the French-British influencer and writer Camille Charrière said: “The French still like to shop in stores, with their friends and family, on the weekend. They don’t change outfits radically to go out on the weekend or at night, their purchases are less compulsive.”View image in fullscreenShein has announced plans to open a shop in the BHV store in Paris.Photograph: Antoine Boureau/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty ImagesPart of the appeal of ultra-fast fashion lies in its size inclusivity. The plus-size market is still virtually non-existent in France, particularly among mid- and high-end labels.Ultra-fast fashion has also introduced new ways of consuming: online shopping, skipping fittings, and bulk ordering. Garments are often worn once, then thrown out or resold on secondhand platforms – a drastic shift in pace, durability and building a wardrobe.Charrière stressed that there was a “slow” way of wearing fast fashion: “One shouldn’t torture oneself about wearing fast fashion. I have Zara dresses from five years ago that I still wear. To me the most important thing is to force myself to use what I buy … to commit to wearing it.” While that doesn’t change the supply chain it came from, Charrière may have a point: shaming Shein customers often overlooks the privilege of being able to afford more expensive alternatives.Shein has seized on that tension. In April it plastered slogans such as “Fashion is a right, not a privilege” across billboards and ads. Christophe Castaner, the former interior minister who is now head of Shein France’s communication, accused lawmakers of punishing low-income shoppers with what he called “a VAT on the products of the poorest”, adding: “Personally, I find that pretty disgusting”.Sheinhas saidin response to reports of labour abuses that it works “tirelessly to ensure that these isolated cases are removed from our supply chain entirely”.For Elise Goldfarb, a professor at the Institut Français de la Mode and an active voice in denouncing the use of Uyghur forced labour in fast fashion supply chains, the phenomenon has shed light on the reality of another segment of French society. “Fast fashion speaks to a segment of the population for whom it feels outrageous to be lectured about ecology during a major crisis they are paying for,” she says.Taxation and regulation may be a useful first step, but they leave the core problem of overproduction untouched. The real question is how the industry can be reshaped around the durability and repair of clothes that can be passed down generations, once so central to the French approach.“It’s like a flood of information with no attachment, everything interchangeable,” said Stéphane Popescu, co-founder of a consultancy specialising in ethical fashion. “I see mountains of ultra-fast fashion clothing in vintage stores, and it feels as if the emotional value of things has disappeared, like there’s no time to build memories around items.”Explore more on these topicsSheinRetail industryFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It turned into a compellingly intimate memorialRachel AroestiThu 2 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 21.26 EDTShareAs sad as it was, there was something undeniably poetic about Ozzy Osbourne’s death in July, 17 days after his final performance withBlack Sabbathin their native Birmingham, and only four months after he moved back to the UK. Consider Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home the explanatory notes accompanying that eerie, strangely elegant verse; a documentary following the rock icon’s final months as he reflects on his life, roots, work, ill-health and impending death. As for that last one, the 76-year-old didn’t believe in heaven or hell. And he was incandescent at the prospect of dying in his adopted home of America and lying for eternity in a “McDonald’s version of a cemetery”.Ozzy had been suffering from a slow-progressing form of Parkinson’s disease for the past two decades, which in conjunction with a 2019 spinal injury significantly impeded his ability to walk. Yet he died unexpectedly of a heart attack. Evidently, this programme was not meant to be a record of his final days. Instead, this amusing, absorbing hour-long film has been salvaged from material filmed for a 10-part fly-on-the-wall series about Sharon and Ozzy’s decision to leave LA and return to their old house in Buckinghamshire, which began production in 2022. Skipping across the years, the timeline feels a little fudged, but the makers have managed to pull together an intelligible story revolving around the pair’s preparations for the big move: the renovation of their country pile, Welders (a gigantic new lake is required, natch), the packing, the goodbyes.As such, everything is drenched in a devastating dramatic irony. Sharon heralding the pair’s “last chapter” together in England, and later looking lost in Ozzy’s study on a solo visit to the UK (“it’s just strange he’s not here”). Ozzy experiencing a gravitational pull back to the motherland; clearly a desire to escape the US before it’s too late. (“I never wanted to be American,” he claims, after the camera has lingered over the royal commemorative china on display in his LA mansion. What is he looking forward to about a British summer? “Wimbledon” is his irreverently off-brand answer.) Then there’s Ozzy dwelling on the existential necessity of performing live: he needs the audience “like air,” he explains, as his final gig looms.‘He spoke up for me when I was in prison’: Anthrax, Lamb of God, Rick Wakeman and more share memories of Ozzy OsbourneRead moreOddly enough, it’s not only his music career that ended up coming full circle. In his second act as a pioneering reality star, the bat-chomping, luxuriantly bouffanted Prince of Darkness was replaced by a bewildered and (as he later admitted) perpetually stoned patriarch shuffling round a chaotic household. Comfortingly, much of this documentary strongly recalls The Osbournes, despite it being 20 years since the reality sitcom ended. The hallmarks are all here: the performative relatability and no-bullshit candour (Sharon: “We’re loud, we’re outspoken, but we’re quite normal”; Ozzy: “I wouldn’t say we’re fucking normal!”); the shifting sands of Jack and Kelly’s transatlantic accents; the foul-mouthed tirades; the constant, nauseating dog-fouling. Seasoned reality pros, the lot – even the pets know how to deliver nostalgic high jinks.This retooled documentary was meant to air in August, but was pulled from the schedules at the last minute at the behest of the family. The timing was obviously an issue – it would have been broadcast less than a month after Ozzy died – but it’s unclear if umbrage was taken with the contents, too, or if anything has been changed. Well, except for the title: it was originally listed as Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home.This version certainly hammers home the bond between Ozzy and Sharon: rather than a tribute to his career, the focus is on his relationship with his wife of 43 years, who comes across as a model of patience and tolerance; a beloved (grand)mother and devoted wife who struggles to balance the demands of both roles (her husband wants to return to England; Jack and Kelly feel their parents should remain near their offspring). Ozzy is characteristically frank about his infidelities and drug and alcohol use, and praises Sharon’s loyalty. He says, not for the first time, that he can’t live without her.In the final scene, footage of Ozzy’s funeral procession through the streets of Birmingham is overlaid with his own voiceover. “It’s been a great life,” he insists, in his trademark matter-of-fact Brummie style. “I wouldn’t change a damn thing.” I cried. This could quite easily have added up to a rather distasteful documentary: an attempt to control the narrative by his loved ones; an attempt to capitalise on a megastar’s death via a serendipitous TV commission; the repurposing of a dead man’s words to schmaltzy effect. But somehow it doesn’t feel cheap. Don’t go into this programme expecting an unsanitised deep dive into Ozzy’s life and work – instead appreciate this compellingly intimate and extremely moving farewell.Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now in the UK and will air on ABC Entertains and ABC iview at 8pm on 12 October in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewSharon OsbourneOzzy OsbourneBlack SabbathMetalPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Taxi (1998)In her breakout film, modern greatMarion Cotillardsupplies annoying-girlfriend comic relief for Samy Naceri’s gallivanting Marseille taxi driver. The spunkiness and sultriness she gives out in every scene is small beer for her – but you’ve got to start somewhere. There are worse places than in this French box office ram-raider, which spawned a franchise.19. Innocence (2004)View image in fullscreenBeguiling … Innocence.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyA little-seen, highly beguiling Lucile Hadžihalilović drama in which a group of schoolgirls emerge from coffins and are inculcated into a mysterious boarding school you might call “femininity”. As dance instructor Mademoiselle Eva, Cotillard is more of a vibe than a character: a smiling stringency. Her utterances, such as “Obedience is the only path to happiness”, feel right out of a fairytale.18.Big Fish(2003)Cotillard’s first English-language film part: a supporting role as the pregnant wife who accompanies Billy Crudup to visit his dying father (Albert Finney) in Tim Burton’s fabulist drama. She gets a nice bedside scene as the ailing Finney spins another yarn; with those limpid eyes, there’s no one better for credulous reaction shots. An importantentréefor what, by Gallic actor standards, has been an unusually fruitful Hollywood career.17.Little White Lies(2010)Another French mega-hit, a deluxe version of the bourgeois-holiday comedy written and directed by Cotillard’s former long-term partner, Guillaume Canet. Repairing to Arcachon with a group of friends fretting over a missing member who’s in hospital, she layers laid-back melancholy into the mix. Laid-back, that is, until her so-called chums subject her to a tubing ordeal behind a boat – and she unleashes a virtuoso swearing display.16.Nine(2009)Take It AllRob Marshall’s spin on 8½ travesties Fellini something rotten. But, among a stacked cast of cinematic doyennes, Cotillard earns her keep in the pivotal role: the sidelined wife played by Anouk Aimée in the original, the sacrifice on the altar of Daniel Day-Lewis’s director’s egotism. Going one up on the revenge dress, her revenge Broadway showstopper, Take It All, is where her grace ignites into rancour.15.Assassin’s Creed(2016)Not quite as challenging a use of Cotillard’s talents as Lady Macbeth for her second collaboration with director Justin Kurzel. As the chief Templar scientist responsible for regressing people into the memories of long-dead killers, she doesn’t get to do any parkour, unlike the rest of the cast. Instead sheis the movie’s still centre, emanating sadomasochistic chill as she skewersMichael Fassbenderon the time-travelling gizmo.14.A Good Year(2006)View image in fullscreenLove among the vines … Cotillard and Crowe.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Allstar“McDonald’s is in Avignon, fish and chips in Marseille” – Cotillard’s cafe owner serves up Gallic sauce straight to Russell Crowe’s expat trader straight in this Peter Mayle-esque jolly. DirectorRidley Scott, who owns a Provencal vineyard, gives full rein to his Provencal vineyard-owning fantasies as Crowe – over for a quick property deal – woos the local beauty. Cotillard is the sparring partner a slugger like Crowe needs if he is to stay light on his toes in thispastisscrewball.13. Pretty Things (2001)A Cotillard deep cut, adapted fromenfant terribleVirginie Despentes’ 1998 novel Les Jolies Choses. The actor shows her range, expertly differentiating extrovert party girl and buttoned-up introvert twin sisters. When the former kills herself and the latter hijacks her budding rock-star career, Cotillard turns out to have hypnotic mic presence that proved handy in future jobs.12.A Very Long Engagement(2004)Cotillard sports an excellent bird fascinator during a scene in which her vengeful sex worker, Tina Lombardi, assassinates one of the army officers responsible for her soldier boyfriend’s death in the first world war. She is similarly eye-catching in Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s film; an implacable foil to more benign lead actor Audrey Tautou, dipping into a well of darkness she later used so effectively on big-budget canvases.11.Annette(2021)Another demanding singing role for triple-threat Cotillard after La Vie en Rose and Nine – as the soprano partner of Adam Driver’s renegade standup comedian. This time, she had to belt out her numbers live on set, occasionally while Driver pops up from between her legs during cunnilingus. Perhaps by this stage she was a little typecast as a doomed women, or – as in Inception – the projection of an out-of-control male psyche. But it’s still another effortlessly supple turn.10. Little Girl Blue (2023)View image in fullscreenAlmost unrecognisable … Little Girl Blue.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA fascinating memory film that gives a fleeting glimpse into Cotillard’s process; the actor aids director Mona Achache in her quest to comprehend her late writer mother, Carole, by incarnating the latter. It’s a meditation on grief, motherhood and generational abuse, with an unrecognisable Cotillard at its centre. Her sketches of this bohemian firebrand are also a reminder that acting – in seeking to recapture the past – is another form of compulsion.9.The Dark Knight Rises(2012)Her death scene as villain Talia al-Ghul was subject to a bit of an internet pile-on – and Cotillard later admitted she botched it due to being stressed on set. But she is highly effective elsewhere, first as Bruce Wayne’s classy ally Miranda Tate, then unmasking herself and administering the “slow knife” with lethal politesse. Thank God someone – unlike Batman and Bane – could enunciate nicely.8. Love Me If You Dare (2003)View image in fullscreenHigh-concept fluff … Love Me If You Dare.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyIt didn’t get anywhere near as much overseas love as the likes of The Fifth Element or Amélie – but this French romcom, bringing together future real-life couple Cotillard and Canet, is surprisingly sophisticated. It’s pure high-concept fluff: they play the grownup versions of childhood friends whose games of dare continue into adulthood. Cotillard grounds it, handling her soulmatemanquéwith a brisk and downbeat frankness.7.Public Enemies(2009)Michael Mann tried to shake up the period gangster film free of established mores in this biopic of John Dillinger – and Cotillard’s emotional dexterity made her a perfect fit for his raw-looking digital photography. She feels utterly fresh in the role of Dillinger’s girlfriend Billie Frechette, initially wary but charmed by his sense of destiny; less a cliched moll than a flesh-and-blood woman swept up in the hurricane of the great American now.6.La Vie en Rose(2007)Often cited as Cotillard’s finest hour – in part because of the association with sacrosanct French icon Edith Piaf. Her performance is a fine technical achievement, with her nailing la Môme’s cramped body language, repertoire of grimaces, and earthy putdowns across multiple decades. But it feels as if Cotillard is hemmed in by biopic conventions and only fleetingly allowed to – as Piaf’s mentor orders – “live the song”. The bravura sequence when the singer segues from the agony of her boxer lover’s death straight to the stage is one such opening.5.Inception(2010)In just a handful of minutes, Cotillard has sledgehammer impact as “Mal” (geddit) – the pea in Christopher Nolan’s oneiric mattress-stack. Chief dream infiltrator Leonardo DiCaprio can no longer be trusted to construct his alt.realities for fear of being invaded by the guilt-ridden revenant of his dead wife. Cotillard brings a malefic charge to this solipsistic femme fatale in a part all the more powerful for existing chiefly in the mind’s eye.4.Rust and Bone(2012)There is something faintly preposterous about Jacques Audiard’s melodrama – amateur kickboxer romances orca-training amputee?!? – but not about the performances. Cotillard’s gift for wordless communication comes to the fore here as Matthias Schoenaerts’ bruiser tries to coax her back to the land of the living. Shades of shame, detachment, rage and bitterness cascade out of her.3.Macbeth(2015)View image in fullscreenTenderness … with Fassbender in Macbeth.Photograph: Dmc Film/AllstarCotillard and Michael Fassbender surely qualify as the best-looking Macbeths in history. Ultra-grim Australian director Justin Kurzel exploited Cotillard’s Frenchness to cloak her Lady Macbeth in something otherworldly; there is a spacey, dissociative air to her scheming that marks her version out from the usual angry harangues. The tenderness with which she delivers her repentance speech to a vision of her dead child is harrowing.2.The Immigrant(2013)James Gray’s slow-burn drama dwells on the flipside of the American Dream: the oppressed and the exploited on whom the Michael Corleones and the Tony Montanas trample as they march upwards. As a Polish New Yorker forced into prostitution, Cotillard’s performance is a miracle of naturalism. Her natural Romantic style curbed by her character’s wariness, she plays the role with an entrancing delicacy. As her ordeals and forbearance pile up, her face starts to look like that of a religious icon.1.Two Days, One Night(2014)View image in fullscreenAnxiety rollercoaster … Two Days, One Night.Photograph: Les Films Du Fleuve/Sportsphoto/AllstarCotillard harnessed the sense of gnawing inner dismay that gives her such believability in femme fatale roles to devastatingly realist ends in this Dardenne brothers’ tour de force. She plays a depressive worker at a solar panel factory who, over one weekend, must persuade her colleagues to forgo the €1,000 bonus they’ve been offered to work longer hours, so her company can fire her. Ever attuned to her character’s emotional somersaults, Cotillard not only excels at her trademark expressiveness – but also the reverse: this beleaguered woman threatening to shut down completely. In what writer David Graeber might have called a “bullshit jobs” thriller, or what we can call a capitalism redemption story, Cotillard’s anxiety rollercoaster renders it all the more heartening when she pulls out of this nosedive at the last minute.Explore more on these topicsRankedMarion CotillardTim BurtonMichael FassbenderRidley ScottÉdith PiafChristopher NolanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While cats are mainly lurking in dark spaces waiting to collaborate with the orchestra on a cheap jumpscare, dogs are quick to alert their owners of nefarious goings-on, acutely sensitive to threats whether they be human or not.Play Dirty review – Shane Black’s action comedy comeback is a blastRead moreIn the often ingenious new horror film Good Boy, a pet dog isn’t just an easily dismissed harbinger of evil, he’s also the main character. Like last year’sPresence, which saw Steven Soderbergh tell a ghost story through the lens of the ghost, andIn a Violent Nature, which gave us a gory slasher as seen by the killer, we’re given a fresh perspective on a story that’s anything but, this time a haunted house horror as seen by Indy, a loyal retriever. He’s worried about his owner, Todd (Shane Jensen, whose face we barely see), who’s retreating to his grandfather’s remote cabin after an undefined medical crisis.There’s already something haunted about the cabin, filled with memories of Todd’s family and the dogs they had before Indy, told via creepy old videotapes mysteriously filmed and preserved, but there’s something else lurking in the shadows. Indy is loyal to a fault, never too far from his owner, but as Todd’s behaviour starts to grow alarming, becoming sicker as he stays there longer, how good of a boy can Indy be?It turns out averygood boy, played rather brilliantly by another very good boy, the real dog of director Ben Leonberg, also called Indy. Without the assistance of any digital trickery (the film is small and ultra low budget) he is our eyes and ears throughout, fearfully reacting to bumps in the night and an owner who appears to be having a Jack Torrance-style transformation at the hands of the house and the spirits within it. Clearly working with the trust of the dog on his side, Leonberg turns a gimmicky elevator pitch into something surprisingly impactful, Indy representing a sort of confused child, unable to understand the disintegrating behaviour of his owner, without any real option but to stick by his side. Leonberg finds some nifty ways to tweak the construction and perspective of familiar haunted house scenes, late-night shadow exploration and basement checking led by a protagonist handicapped by his instincts and priorities, as well as an unwavering loyalty that risks his safety. There’s a sadness to how steadfast he remains even as the person he’s programmed to protect might be the one he needs protection from, a refusal to give up on someone losing their mind and maybe soul. Leonberg also weaves in the expected contemporary genre trope – using a supernatural force to represent something more grounded, an insidious form of generational trauma, an inescapable rot – but without the clumsiness of his peers.Yet even at a brief 73 minutes, Good Boy can feel stretched, a film that never quite convinces you that a short wouldn’t have worked better. Even though Indy is a remarkably expressive dog, there are only so many variations on dialogue-free scenes of him checking out a weird noise in the dark and the cycle soon gets repetitive, exposing a script that’s a bit on the thin side. The craft on display does however convince you that Leonberg has what so many other lazier, jumpscare-driven horror film-makers don’t currently possess, tasking himself with a pretty lofty narrative and technical feat and mostly pulling it off, bringing it home with a fittingly melancholic finale. His debut serves best as a punchy announcement of what he can do with so little, and big things clearly lie ahead for him. I just hope he brings Indy along.Good Boy is out now in Australian cinemas, US cinemas on 3 October and in the UK on 10 OctoberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsDogsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The only real coverage I got was in the techie music mags, but then Hide and Seek was in The OC, Headlock got on the radio and I started getting recognition. If only we could have had TikTok and all this free promotion 20 years ago … but if I’d received then the kind of attention I get now, I might have made different life choices, so I wouldn’t have changed anything.Did you really remortgage your flat to finance Speak For Yourself?AD2023I spent four years making an album in [the electronic duo] Frou Frou on Island Records, but it never recouped so I never saw a penny. Making another album with that label would have felt like taking your best dress back to the dry cleaners after they burned it. After I got out of that deal, no bank would lend me any money. Then I realised that my two-bedroom flat in Waterloo I’d bought for £120,000 was worth a hundred grand more a year later. I remortgaged it to make the album and never looked back. Funnily enough, after all the attention on TikTok recently I’ve just received my first royalties from Frou Frou after 25 years.More than 20 years ago, you recorded and toured withJeff Beck. How did the collaboration come about?Ben1976I met Jeff when I was 19 at a songwriting camp in [the Police manager] Miles Copeland’s castle in the Dordogne. I was much younger than everybody else and socially awkward so I got pretty drunk. I was sitting outside playing guitar very badly to myself and Jeff said: “Let me show you some shapes.” I said: “Wow, you’re good!” Later that night I ended up drunkenly driving a golf caddy around the estate and crashing into Miles’s mum’s prized terracotta pots. A week later I got a message from my manager asking: “Did you meet Jeff Beck?” He told me he was this really famous, legendary guitarist – I had no idea! – who wanted me to sing on his record. I sang his gorgeous Nadia as best I could and did some shows with him. He was a sweet man and I loved him so much. A lot of people from that generation are just so grateful to have been able to do what they loved all those years, and their egos are very small in comparison to the amount of fame they had.View image in fullscreen‘If only we could have had TikTok and all this free promotion 20 years ago’ … Imogen Heap, London, 2006.Photograph: Nigel R Barklie/ShutterstockThe Listening Chairis a unique, autobiographical song, intended to update [with an added minute] every seven years. How hard was it to distill a seven-year period into one minute?CoopertapesI don’t know if I did it very effectively, but I sat in a physical listening chair and asked audiences: “What’s the song that you feel still needs to be written?” There were hundreds and hundreds of different answers, but all relating to their ages. For anyone aged 0-7 it was single word answers like “cat” or “piano”, from 7-14 it was fun, 14-21 was about wanting to be themselves and 28-35 “I’m in the wrong job and that maybe I shouldn’t be with my partner.” I never got around to 35-42 because my sister died in my 42nd year and I just couldn’t do it, but I’m about to release the final piece, a 13-minute fiesta called I Am, about who I am now. The Listening Chair is all true. The line “Wonderbra thrown around the German classroom … I’ll never live it down” is about the time my best friend – who wasn’t then – took my stupid padded bra out of my drawer and threw it through the German classroom window. Then everyone threw it around. I was mortified.How did you get the idea for The Happy Song? It reliably cheers my one-year-old whenever I put it on, so thank you.Madi22Thebaby milkcompanyCow & Gate wanted to create a piece of music that would make babies happier, so they put me in a room with scientists, psychologists and 50 babies. I iterated various bits of music depending on their reactions. My two-year-old daughter Scout started some of the melodies. We’d taken her to the Transport Museum so that’s where “bing bing on the bicycle, beep beep in the car” comes from. The sound at the beginning is her laughing at my friend’s cat. Kids love The Happy Song, but it calms stressed-out parents, too.Were you really a rebel at school and if so what were you rebelling against?k4ren123I feel awful now for some of the things I did. The last straw came when I told the matron to F-off and they expelled me, but they still needed me to be the jewel in the crown for the end-of-term concert, so I ended up living in the headmistress’s house and she was really kind to me. I just found boarding school insanely boring. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and autism, which might explain why I’ve always wanted to shake it up and do new things.How many hair colours have you had?toniaaaProbably more recently, actually, all kinds of green and stuff. When I was younger I had issues around my body, so like I’d wear leg warmers to make my legs not look so skinny or wear over-the-top costumes with feathers. For the longest time I’d back comb my hair into a huge bush because I felt my head was too small. It’s only in the past six years I’ve realised I actually like my hair – I just needed to stick some layers in it.It’s been 11 years since your last proper album. Will we ever get a new one?Paula485Well, I did the Harry Potter album [The Music of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child – in Four Contemporary Suites], and a couple of years ago I made the music to an Audible podcast called Climate of Change with my zoologist/film-maker friend Dan O’Neill, who gave me a bunch of sounds like insects croaking underground, which we turned into a double album. I just got bored of the song structure, but now I’m really excited about freestyling and making up lyrics in the moment. I’ve spent thousands of hours caged up in the studio and I’ve missed a lot of life. There will be a record shortly which will be the final piece of that old world but I’m more excited about creating music in real time.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve spent thousands of hours caged up in the studio and I’ve missed a lot of life’ … Heap plays in Los Angeles, March 2025.Photograph: Rolling Stone/Getty ImagesIn2014, Taylor Swiftinvited fans to herRhode Islandhome to hear her new album1989while she plied them with cookies.

Fans expressed concerns. Is it still ongoing?trev_trevA hundred percent. When people think of AI they maybe think of this conscious brain making all the music while I’m sitting there being a puppet. I see it as a collaboration. Say I’m in a park and there’s dog sounds and a bus going by. AI might identify the key or some natural rhythm that’s happening and potentially shape the music, which will help me have more time to be human. At the moment, with what’s going on in the States and the Middle East, we’re making such a horrendous job of existing, so maybe AI is like the next stage of evolution to help us make sense of everything. It’s not the devil. I’m still gonna make music and it’s gonna be great.Michael Caine famously said of his role inJaws: The Revenge, “I have never seen the film, but by all accounts it was terrible.

Are they wrong?Some believe AI can spark their child’s imagination through personalized stories and generative images. Scientists are wary of its effect on creativityJulia Carrie WongThu 2 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 16.09 EDTShareJosh was at the end of his rope when he turned toChatGPTfor help with a parenting quandary. The 40-year-old father of two had been listening to his “super loquacious” four-year-old talk about Thomas the Tank Engine for 45 minutes, and he was feeling overwhelmed.“He was not done telling the story that he wanted to tell, and I needed to do my chores, so I let him have the phone,” recalled Josh, who lives in north-west Ohio. “I thought he would finish the story and the phone would turn off.”But when Josh returned to the living room two hours later, he found his child still happily chatting away with ChatGPT in voice mode. “The transcript is over 10k words long,” he confessed in asheepish Reddit post. “My son thinks ChatGPT is the coolest train loving person in the world. The bar is set so high now I am never going to be able to compete with that.”From radio and television to video games and tablets, new technology has long tantalized overstretched parents of preschool-age kids with the promise of entertainment and enrichment that does not require their direct oversight, even as it carried the hint of menace that accompanies any outside influence on the domestic sphere. A century ago,mothers in Arizonaworried that radio programs were “overstimulating, frightening and emotionally overwhelming” for children; today’s parents self-flagellate overscreen timeandsocial media.‘I want him to be prepared’: why parents are teaching their gen Alpha kids to use AIRead moreBut the startlingly lifelike capabilities of generative AI systems have left many parents wondering ifAI is an entirely new beast. Chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) are engaging young children in ways the makers of board games, Teddy Ruxpin, Furby and even the iPad never dreamed of: they produce personalized bedtime stories, carry on conversations tailored to a child’s interests, and generate photorealistic images of the most far-fetched flights of fancy – all for a child who can not yet read, write or type.Can generative AI deliver the holy grail of technological assistance to parents, serving as a digital Mary Poppins that educates, challenges and inspires, all within a framework of strong moral principles and age-appropriate safety? Or is this all just another Silicon Valley hype-bubble with a particularly vulnerable group of beta testers?‘My kids are the guinea pigs’For Saral Kaushik, a 36-year-old software engineer and father of two in Yorkshire, a packet of freeze-dried “astronaut” ice-cream in the cupboard provided the inspiration for a novel use of ChatGPT with his four-year-old son.“I literally just said something like, ‘I’m going to do a voice call with my son and I want you to pretend that you’re an astronaut on the ISS,’” Kaushik said. He also instructed the program to tell the boy that it had sent him a special treat.“[ChatGPT] told him that he had sent his dad some ice-cream to try from space, and I pulled it out,” Kaushik recalled. “He was really excited to talk to the astronaut. He was asking questions about how they sleep. He was beaming, he was so happy.”Childhood is a time of magic and wonder, and dwelling in the world of make-believe is not just normal but encouraged by experts in early childhood development, who have long emphasized the importance of imaginative play. For some parents, generative AI can help promote that sense of creativity and wonder.View image in fullscreenYing Xu: ‘If [children] believe that AI has agency, they might understand it as the AIwantingto talk to them orchoosingto talk to them.’Photograph: RooM the Agency/AlamyJosh’s daughter, who is six, likes to sit with him at the computer and come up with stories for ChatGPT to illustrate. (Several parents interviewed for this article requested to be identified by their first names only.) “When we started using it, it was willing to make an illustration of my daughter and insert that in the story,” Josh said, though more recent safety updates have resulted in it no longer producing images of children. Kaushik also uses ChatGPT to convert family photographs into coloring book pages for his son.Ben Kreiter, a father of three in Michigan, explained ChatGPT to his two-, six-, and eight-year-old children after they saw him testing its image-generation capabilities for work (he designs curriculums for an online parochial school). “I was like, ‘I tell the computer a picture to make and it makes it,’ and they said: ‘Can we try?’” Soon, the children were asking to make pictures with ChatGPT every day. “It was cool for me to see what they are imagining that they can’t quite [draw] on a piece of paper with their crayons yet.”Kreiter, like all the parents interviewed for this article, only allowed his children to use ChatGPT with his help and supervision, but as they became more enamored with the tool, his concern grew. In October 2024, news broke of a 14-year-old boy whokilled himselfafter becoming obsessed with an LLM-powered chatbot made by Character.ai. Parents of at leasttwo more teenagershavesince filed lawsuitsalleging that AI chatbots contributed to their suicides, and news reports increasingly highlight troubling tales of adults formingintense emotional attachmentsto the bots or otherwiselosing touch with reality.“The more that it became part of everyday life and the more I was reading about it, the more I realized there’s a lot I don’t know about what this is doing to their brains,” Kreiter said. “Maybe I should not have my own kids be the guinea pigs.”[My daughter] knows [ChatGPT is] not a real person, but ... it’s like a fairy that represents the internet as a wholeJoshResearch into how generative AI affects child development is in its early stages, though it builds upon studies looking at less sophisticated forms of AI, such as digital voice assistants like Alexa and Siri. Multiplestudieshave found that young children’s social interactions with AI tools differ subtly from those with humans, with children aged three to six appearing “less active” in conversations with smart speakers. This finding suggests that children perceive AI agents as existing somewhere in the middle of the divide between animate and inanimate entities, according to Ying Xu, a professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.Understanding whether an object is a living being or an artefact is an important cognitive development that helps a child gauge how much trust to place in the object, and what kind of relationship to form with it, explained Xu, whose research focuses on how AI can promote learning for children.Childrenbegin to make this distinction in infancy and usually develop a sophisticated understanding of it by age nine or 10. But while children have always imbued inanimate objects such as teddy bears and dolls with imagined personalities and capacities, at some level they know that the magic is coming from their own minds.“A very important indicator of a child anthropomorphizing AI is that they believe AI is having agency,” Xu said. “If they believe that AI has agency, they might understand it as the AIwantingto talk to them orchoosingto talk to them. They feel that the AI is responding to their messages, and especially emotional disclosures, in ways that are similar to how a human responds. That creates a risk that they actually believe they are building some sort of authentic relationship.”Inone studylooking at children aged three to six responding to a Google Home Mini device, Xu found that the majority perceived the device to be inanimate, but some referred to it as a living being, and some placed it somewhere in between. Majorities thought the device possessed cognitive, psychological and speech-related capabilities (thinking, feeling, speaking and listening), but most believed it could not “see”.Parents who spoke with the Guardian remarked upon this kind of ontological gray zone in describing their children’s interactions with generative AI. “I don’t fully know what he thinks ChatGPT is, and it’s hard to ask him,” said Kaushik of his four-year-old. “I don’t think he can articulate what he thinks it is.”Josh’s daughter refers to ChatGPT as “the internet”, as in, “I want to talk to ‘the internet’.” “She knows it’s not a real person, but I think it’s a little fuzzy,” he said. “It’s like a fairy that represents the internet as a whole.”For Kreiter, seeing his children interact with Amazon’s Alexa at a friend’s house raised another red flag. “They don’t get that this thing doesn’t understand them,” he said. “Alexa is pretty primitive compared to ChatGPT, and if they’re struggling with that … I don’t even want to go there with my kids.”A related concern is whether generative AI’s capacity to deceive children is problematic. For Kaushik, his son’s sheer joy at having spoken with what he thought was a real-life astronaut on the ISS led to a sense of unease, and he decided to explain that it was “a computer, not a person”.“He was so excited that I felt a bit bad,” Kaushik said. “He genuinely believed it was real.”John, a 40-year-old father of two from Boston, experienced a similar qualm when his son, a four-year-old in the thralls of a truck obsession, asked whether the existence of monster trucks and fire trucks implied the existence of a monster-fire truck. Without thinking much of it, John pulled up Google’s generative AI tool on his phone and used it to generate a photorealistic image of a truck that had elements of the two vehicles.When [LLMs are] latching on to negative emotion, they’re extending engagement for profit-based reasonsAndrew McStayIt was only after a pitched argument between the boy, who swore he had seen actual proof of the existence of a monster-fire truck, and his older sister, a streetwise seven-year-old who was certain that no such thing existed in the real world, that John started to wonder whether introducing generative AI into his children’s lives had been the right call.“It was a little bit of a warning to maybe be more intentional about that kind of thing,” he said. “My wife and I have talked so much more about how we’re going to handle social media than we have about AI. We’re such millennials, so we’ve had 20 years of horror stories about social media, but so much less about AI.”To Andrew McStay, a professor of technology and society at Bangor University who specializes in research on AI that claims to detect human emotions, this kind of reality-bending is not necessarily a big concern. Recalling the early moving pictures of the Lumière brothers, he said: “When they first showed people a big screen with trains coming [toward them], people thought the trains were quite literally coming out of the screen. There’s a maturing to be done … People, children and adults, will mature.”Still, McStay sees a bigger problem with exposing children to technology powered by LLMs: “Parents need to be aware that these things are not designed in children’s best interests.”Like Xu, McStay is particularly concerned with the way in which LLMs can create the illusion of care or empathy, prompting a child to share emotions – especially negative emotions. “An LLM cannot [empathize] because it’s a predictive piece of software,” he said. “When they’re latching on to negative emotion, they’re extending engagement for profit-based reasons. There is no good outcome for a child there.”Neither Xu nor McStay wants to ban generative AI for children, but they do warn that any benefits for children will only be unleashed through applications that are specifically designed to support children’s development or education.“There is something more enriching that’s possible, but that comes from designing these things in a well-meaning and sincere way,” said McStay.For an individual child, [AI] might increase their performance, but for a society, we might see a decrease of diversity in creative expressionsYing XuXu allows her own children to use generative AI – to a limited extent. Her daughter, who is six, uses theAI reading programthat Xu designed to study whether AI can promote literacy and learning. She has also set up a custom version of ChatGPT to help her 10-year-old son with math and programming problems without just giving him the answers. (Xu has explicitly disallowed conversations about gaming and checks the transcripts to make sure her son’s staying on topic.)One of the benefits of generative AI mentioned to me by parents – the creativity they believe it fosters – is very much an open question, said Xu.“There is still a debate over whether AI itself has creativity,” she said. “It’s just based on statistical predictions of what comes next, and a lot of people question if that counts as creativity. So if AI does not have creativity, is it able to support children to engage in creative play?”Arecent studyfound that having access to generative AI prompts did increase creativity for individual adults tasked with writing a short story, but decreased the overall diversity of the writers’ collective output.“I’m a little worried by this kind of homogenizing of expression and creativity,” Xu said about the study. “For an individual child, it might increase their performance, but for a society, we might see a decrease of diversity in creative expressions.”AI ‘playmates’ for kidsSilicon Valley is notorious for its willingness to prioritize speed over safety, but major companies have at times shown a modicum of restraint when it came to young children. Both YouTube and Facebook had existed for at least a decade before they launched dedicated products for under-13s (the much-malignedYouTube KidsandMessenger Kids, respectively).But the introduction of LLMs to young children appears to be barreling ahead at a breakneck pace.While OpenAI bars usersunder 13from accessing ChatGPT, and requires parental permission for teenagers, it is clearly aware that younger children are being exposed to it – and views them as a potential market.In June, OpenAI announced a “strategic collaboration” with Mattel, the toymaker behind Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. That same month, chief executive Sam Altman responded to the tale of Josh’s toddler (which went pretty viral on Reddit) with what sounded like a hint of pride. “Kids love voice mode on ChatGPT,” he said on theOpenAI podcast, before acknowledging that “there will be problems” and “society will have to figure out new guardrails.”Meanwhile, startups such as Silicon Valley-based Curio – which collaborated with the musician Grimes on anOpenAI-powered toy named Grok– are racing to stuff LLM-equipped voice boxes into plushy toys and market them to children.View image in fullscreenA child swings on a swing with Grem, a chatbot in the Grok toy line by Curio.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The Guardian(Curio’s Grok shares a name with Elon Musk’s LLM-powered chatbot, which isnotoriousfor its past promotion of Adolf Hitler and racist conspiracy theories. Grimes, who has three children with former partner Musk, wasreportedlyangered when Musk used a name she had chosen for their second child on another child, born to a different mother in a concurrent pregnancy of which Grimes was unaware. In recent months, Musk has expressed interest in creating a “Baby Grok” version of his software for children aged two to 12, according to theNew York Times.)The pitch for toys like Curio’s Grok is that they can “learn” your child’s personality and serve as a kind of fun and educational companion while reducing screen time. It is a classically Silicon Valley niche – exploiting legitimate concerns about the last generation of tech to sell the next. Company leaders have alsoreferredto the plushy as something “between a little brother and a pet” or “like a playmate” – language that implies the kind of animate agency that LLMs do not actually have.‘I love you too!’ My family’s creepy, unsettling week with an AI toyRead moreIt is not clear if they are actually good enough toys for parents to worry too much about. Xu said that her daughter had quickly relegated AI plushy toys to the closet, finding the play possibilities “kind of repetitive”. The children ofGuardianandNew York Timeswriters also voted against Curio’s toys with their feet. Guardian writer Arwa Mahdawi expressed concern about how “unsettlingly obsequious” the toy was and decided she preferred allowing her daughter to watch Peppa Pig: “The little oink may be annoying, but at least she’s not harvesting our data.” Times writer Amanda Hess similarly concluded that using an AI toy to replace TV time – a necessity for many busy parents – is “a bit like unleashing a mongoose into the playroom to kill all the snakes you put in there”.But with the market for so-called smart toys – which includes AI-powered toys, projected todoubleto more than $25bn by 2030 – it is perhaps unrealistic to expect restraint.This summer, notices seeking children aged four to eight to help “a team from MIT and Harvard” test “the first AI-powered storytelling toy” appeared in my neighborhood in Brooklyn. Intrigued, I made an appointment to stop by their offices.The product,Geni, is a close cousin to popularscreen-free audio playerssuch as Yoto and the Toniebox. Rather than playing pre-recorded content (Yoto and Tonies offer catalogs of audiobooks, podcasts and other kid-friendly content for purchase), however, Geni uses an LLM to generate bespoke short stories. The device allows child users to select up to three “tiles” representing a character, object or emotion, then press a button to generate a chunk of narrative that ties the tiles together, which is voiced aloud. Parents can also use an app to program blank tiles.Geni co-founders Shannon Li and Kevin Tang struck me as being serious and thoughtful about some of the risks of AI products for young children. They “feel strongly about not anthropomorphizing AI”, Tang said. Li said that they want kids to view Geni, “not as a companion” like the voice-box plushies, but as “a tool for creativity that they already have”.Still, it’s hard not to wonder whether an LLM can actually produce particularly engaging or creativity-sparking stories. Geni is planning to sell sets of tiles with characters they develop in-house alongside the device, but the actual “storytelling” is done by the kind of probability-based technology that tends toward the average.The story I prompted by selecting the wizard and astronaut tiles was insipid at best:They stumbled upon a hidden cave glowing with golden light.“What’s that?” Felix asked, peeking inside.“A treasure?” Sammy wondered, her imagination swirling, “or maybe something even cooler.”Before they could decide, a wave rushed into the cave, sending bubbles bursting around them.The Geni team has trained their system on pre-existing children’s content. Does using generative AI solve a problem for parents that the canon of children’s audio content cannot? When I ran the concept by one parent of a five-year-old, he responded: “They’re just presenting an alternative to books. It’s a really good example of grasping for uses that are already handled by artists or living, breathing people.”The market pressures of startup culture leave little time for such existential musings, however. Tang said the team is eager to bring their product to market before voice-box plushies sour parents on the entire concept of AI for kids.When I asked Tang whether Geni would allow parents to make tiles for, say, a gun – not a far-fetched idea for many American families – he said they would have to discuss the issue as a company.“Post-launch, we’ll probably bring on an AI ethics person to our team,” he said.“We also don’t want to limit knowledge,” he added. “As of now there’s no right or wrong answer to how much constraint we want to put in … But obviously we’re referencing a lot of kids content that’s already out there. Bluey probably doesn’t have a gun in it, right?”"

Her two-yearEras tourestablished her as the defining entertainer of her generation, and after herrecent engagementto American footballer Travis Kelce, one of its biggest celebrities. Now, after an unexpectedly brief hiatus, Swift returns with her 12th album in yet another guise: a showgirl.Swift made The Life of a Showgirl with Swedish super-producers Max Martin and Shellback while touring Europe last year. Shedescribed the projectas a tribute to her “joyful, wild, dramatic” life as an entertainer, and a look “behind the scenes” of the Eras spectacle. Album imagery by fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott shows Swift bejewelled with diamantes, fishnet tights, fur and feathered headdresses.“Swift has crafted a different persona for pretty much every album, so it’s not such a surprise that we’re seeing a new side of her,” says Drew Nobile, an associate professor of music theory at the University of Oregon. But why a showgirl – and why now?It is not as much of a clash with Swift’strademark girl-next-door relatabilityas it may seem. “She’s leaning into the idea that her public image is a gilded fantasy,” Nobile says, allowing her to present herself as both “the billionaire pop star who dazzles arenas every night, and the same old girl beneath the costumes. It would ring hollow if she just came back with a down-to-earth album of personal songs, as if the Eras tour never happened.” Even the title The Life of a Showgirl, he says, “seems to be suggesting that behind the sequins is a real woman.”Swift isn’t the first pop star to draw from the 19th-century showgirl tradition. For her Man! I Feel Like a Woman! video,riffing on Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love, Shania Twain donned a top hat and tuxedo jacket to transform the original’s sleaze into sex appeal and female empowerment. Lady Marmalade, from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack, emphasised showgirls’ solidarity. Kylie Minogue chose tocelebrate her“long-term relationship” with fans with her art deco-inspired Showgirl tour of 2005; Lady Gaga acknowledged her debt to cabaret at last year’s Paris Olympics. Among pop’s new generation, Sabrina Carpenter’s skits draw from vaudeville while Addison Rae often wears sequins, tulle and lingerie-inspired looks.View image in fullscreenArt deco inspired … Kylie Minogue performing on her Showgirl tour, 2005.Photograph: Maurice McDonald/PAFor pop stars such as these, the showgirl offers both stage-ready looks and historical context – but she has never been mere spectacle, argues Alison J Carr, the Sheffield-based author of Viewing Pleasure and Being a Showgirl. Each showgirl extends the tradition and reflects the “pleasures and anxieties” of her time, she says. “There is no original showgirl: she’s always a quotation.”The iconic showgirl emerged from 19th-century social change: industrialisation and the shift to the city, the birth of nightlife and women’s increasing visibility in public. After emerging in Parisian music halls and cabarets, the style spread to England, where John Tiller’s legendary troupe popularised what was called “precision dance”.The “kickline” of performers standing shoulder-to-shoulder, and their synchronised can-can dances, all seemed to reflect the dawning machine age and cast women as symbols of modernity, Carr says. “Forms of progress, for ill and for good, [were] showing up in what the showgirls were doing.”Introduced to the US, the showgirl was quickly absorbed into the emerging entertainment business and “became part of Americana”, Carr says. Producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr developed the revues’ winking mix of sex appeal, glamour, comedy and theatrical performance. But by the 1970s and second-wave feminism, showgirls had been spurned along with beauty queens as creations of the male gaze, “dehumanising and objectifying”, Carr says.There was little acknowledgment of showgirls as skilled professionals. Yet many were classically trained dancers, and performed in 2-3in heels and wore costumesweighing as muchas 22lbs (10kgs). Most shows required them to be 5ft 8in or taller, so as to not appear swamped on stage; strong legs, back and core muscles were a must. “There’s a lot of steps, the dancers are running up and down … it’s incredibly physical,” says Carr.View image in fullscreen‘It’s incredibly physical’ … a dancer poses in front of the Moulin Rouge, Paris.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/ReutersWhen animated by the performer, however, the costumes’ glitz and glamour actually serve to highlight her humanity and talent, Carr says. “All that embellishment is saying that you’re important, you deserve to be seen, you’ve got something to say.”Carr recalls seeing a troupe in Los Angeles, made up of women with different looks and builds. “You could see that all of them had just decided: ‘I’m going to be that beautiful woman in the kickline.’ It’s not contingent on what you look like, what you’re wearing – it’s that inner commitment ... You’re audacious because you know you’re that good.”That would certainly seem to appeal to Swift, known for her formidable work ethic and ambition to be the biggest and the best. To prepare for the Eras tour and three-hour shows night after night,Swift sang the entire setlist aloudwhile running on a treadmill, daily, and did three months of dance training.That professionalism, and commitment to putting on a stellar performance, defines the showgirl, Carr says. “You’ll see recordings of performers, and films, but this is the ephemera – the show is really the live encounter.” Likewise, Swift’s Eras Tour film was pitched as a way to relive the experience, not as as replacement; many fans attended more than once.But what does a real showgirl think of Swift’s self-coronation? “She absolutely looks like a showgirl,” says Lou Anne Chessik. Over her 12-year career, Chessik performed in Jubilee! – the longest-running revue in Las Vegas and the inspiration for this year’s Pamela Anderson dramaThe Last Showgirl– as well as other extravaganzas in Vegas, Reno and Tokyo.“I loved being a showgirl, wearing all the amazing costumes, our camaraderie backstage,” says Chessik. But it was demanding work. Chessik worked six-month contracts, performing six to seven nights a week and two shows a night (three on Saturdays). She was even limited in how much time she could spend outdoors: “We could not have tan lines … but it probably saved my skin,” she says.In 2007 Chessik founded the Showgirl Legacy Foundation to preserve those performers’ historic significance. She was delighted to see Swift posingin one of the original ensemblesfrom Jubilee!, designed by Bob Mackie for the show’s “Jewel finale”. The bra, undergarments and armbands are described as French wirework, with set stones and nude fabric backing for a “nude illusion”.

She also looks the part in the album artwork, between her 5ft 10in height and her “perfect” red lipstick, just like that worn by Chessik and her colleagues. But, she adds, “our hair was always pinned up and pulled back … and we never sat in our costumes.”More than her stature or styling, Swift embodies the showgirl essence, Chessik says: “She is professional, charismatic, talented. ” She points to Swift’s comic timing in the Shake It Off video (“it reminds me of I Love Lucy”), the storytelling to her shows, and the hard work that goes into them.She has “absolutely” earned the right to call herself a showgirl, Chessik concludes, along with Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and other contemporary entertainers. “They are the top performers of their time and genre – like we were.”Certainly the “big showgirl spectacle”, at least, now belongs to stadium pop, Carr agrees. Showgirls still exist, often in coalition with drag, cabaret and burlesque performers, but performance opportunities and venues tend to be small-scale, independently run and as such vulnerable to closure. “The contemporary showgirl has a bit of precarity to her,” she says.View image in fullscreenLou Anne Chessik at the Lido de Paris, the Stardust hotel, Las Vegas, in 1981.Photograph: Courtesy: Lou Anne ChessikThe same cannot be said of Swift, who is on her way to her second billion. If anything, Carr suggests, her wealth complicates her claim to the showgirl, who is typically self-made and anti-elitist. “To become a showgirl is not something that you’re born into – you become it, you opt into it.”With so many present-day performers “labouring in the margins” and showgirl history at risk of being lost, Swift might consider putting resources towards protecting the tradition, Carr suggests. Without that extra step, she risks coming across as simply “showing off”.After all, most showgirls performed alongside dozens of others. Former chorus girls have told Carr of feeling empowered by “having many sisters”. Chessik recalls performing in casts of more than 100; even when there were leads, “not many people knew them by name”.As “the lone showgirl”, Swift has skipped solidarity and gone straight to commanding the stage solo. “She is crowning herself, coronating herself, because she’s got everything that this era wants,” Carr says.But, she adds, anyone can learn how to embrace their power and embody the showgirl’s spirit. Indeed, relative to the goddesses and queens to which female pop stars are often compared, she is closer to earth and even accessible. “It does take talent, panache, charisma, refining your craft, all of those things … but you don’t need to be a billionaire.”Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockCabaretDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The show’s superfans open up about the nonstop controversyIsobel LewisThu 2 Oct 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 16.44 EDTShareAsk fans of Strictly Come Dancing to describe the show, and the same buzzwords come up. For Poppy, 25, a Strictly diehard whomakes videos about the show on TikTok, those are “sparkly”, “camp”, “joyful”. “It’s escapism,” she says .Strictly recap bloggerAriadne , 30, echoes this – to her, it’s “feelgood television”. For more than two decades , the dance competition has presented itself as the nicest show on telly; a supportive, progressive environment on set, and a bright and soothing viewing experience at home.But are Strictly fans buying it? While past controversies have largely slipped off the show like water off a duck’s back, the show’s pristine image has taken a beating in recent years. There was the major misconduct and bullying investigation in 2024 that led to two popular pros, Giovanni Pernice and Graziano di Prima, leaving the show. In the lead-up to this year’s series – and alongside the continued fallout from Wynne Evans’s 2024 appearance – further controversy has followed. Strictly has been hit byclaims of drug use on set, plus reports thata male star of the show (not from the current series) was arrested on suspicion of rape.“And then they go and putThomas Skinnerin,” says Siân, 33, who regularly posts about the show on Reddit. “The mind boggles.”A self-proclaimed “non-political” former Apprentice contestant (who has nonetheless aligned himself with the right by wearing a Maga hat and posing for pictures with JD Vance), Skinner has majorly divided the dance competition’s fans. Poppy had been sharing her real-time reactions to the 2025 cast on TikTok. In the video where Skinner’s name was called, her nervous smileimmediately droppedto an expression of deadpan horror. “Strictly, babe, this is a mistake,” she said. “This is not inclusive. Bad move.”Calls for Skinner’s removal followed, along with counter-arguments to the tune of “so much for the tolerant left” from his supporters. The latter group, Poppy says, may be more concerning than Skinner himself. When she voiced her own disappointment at his casting on the official Strictly Instagram, she received “some horrible things back” from his fans. “These are the people you’re drawing into the show,” she argues. Judging by his stompy week one pasodoble, it seems unlikely that the former pillow salesman will make it through the competition on talent alone. Yet there are concerns that Skinner’s supporters will vote to keep him in – à la Farage on I’m A Celebrity – to support him and annoy the show’s more progressive viewers.For fans, Skinner’s casting jars with Strictly’s public commitment to inclusivity and representation. There was barely a dry eye in the house when Chris McCausland, the show’s first blind contestant, lifted the glitterball trophy in 2024; the class of 2025 includesEllie Goldstein, a model with Down’s syndrome, and RuPaul’s Drag Race starLa Voix, the first drag performer to compete on the main series; and numerous same-sex partnerships having thrived in the format in the past.View image in fullscreen‘Public commitment to inclusivity and representation’ … Ellie Goldstein and Vito Coppola during their appearance on the live show of Saturday’s Strictly Come Dancing show on BBC1.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PAThe tonal shift between their casting and Skinner’s, Ariadne says, “muddles” the show’s messaging: “[It] does feel like Strictly wants to have its cake and eat it with casting someone who will create controversial buzz around the show, but then say, ‘We’re uplifting people from minority backgrounds, the LGBTQ+ community, disabled folk.’” Viewers see Strictly as an escapist fantasy; for Siân, Skinner’s casting overshadows that. “This is the one programme I get to watch to escape all the negativity I see online, and now I have to sit and watch this guy,” she says. Some fans have declared that they’ll be skipping the show altogether in protest at Skinner’s involvement, although Poppy is more diplomatic: “It does mean there’s a place to have a loo break.”Most fans I speak to express surprise that Strictly would risk casting such a polarising figure after the battering it took last year. The misconduct investigation hung in the air in 2024 and wrapped a few weeks into the live show, with six of the 17 complaints made against Pernice by Sherlock star Amanda Abbington upheld. More shocking to many were the revelations about fellow Italian dancer Di Prima that also emerged. Seemingly from nowhere, it was revealed that Di Prima had engaged in misconduct that same year, and had evenkicked his partner, Zara McDermott, in rehearsals.For the first time, fans were given a proper peek behind the velvet curtain (beyond the usual rehearsal footage and social media content), and realised that Strictly wasn’t always so sparkly. “It did feel like betrayal,” Ariadne recalls. “I was disappointed.” In Pernice, or in the show? “In the show,” she says; it was hard to know “how much of it was covered up and how much was actually known about”. Xav, 25, is another Reddit fan, and remembers his own upset at the revelations about Di Prima. “I just didn’t expect that,” Xav recalls. “I get the pros are athletes, and this is their passion, this is their life, but [I didn’t] expect one to go that far.”View image in fullscreen‘I was disappointed’ … Amanda Abbington and Giovanni Pernice in Strictly 2023.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBCXav speaks to a tension at the show’s core: Strictly’s desire to present as eternally optimistic, despite everyone knowing that hard work is required to turn non-dancers into semi-professionals. Contracts require the celebrity contestants to complete at least 12 hours of training a week, but for many, it’s closer to 12 hours a day. Like many fans, Siân – a former dancer herself – heard Abbington’s allegations and found herself caught between wanting to believe a woman who was speaking out, and hoping Pernice was simply a “harsh, critical teacher who wanted the best out of his pupil”. “I think two things can be true at the same time,” she reasons. TheBBCinvestigation, which confirmed claims of verbal bullying and harassment but dismissed claims that Pernice was physically aggressive or made threats towards his partner, reached a similar verdict.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The introduction of chaperones was a highly publicised positive measure, although fans such as Cal, 21, were surprised it hadn’t been done sooner, “given #MeToo and all that stuff. I feel like it shouldn’t have taken something that bad to happen for them to have people in the room,” he says.Nobody wants to think that the star of their favourite show is having a horrible time – that’s a given. But there are a lot of fans for whom Strictly is Saturday night entertainment and nothing more. Even for more clued-in viewers, preserving the Saturday night show is seen as paramount. Addressing the scandals on air would feel strange, and could threaten the all-ages appeal that, for many, is one of Strictly’s greatest strengths. Siân’s Strictly-themed WhatsApp group allows her to speak to family members she otherwise wouldn’t have contact with; at a time when generational divides feel greater than ever, Strictly is one of very few shared points of connection I can talk about with my own grandmother.Some fans’ love of the show has led them to greet the news of alleged drug use with ambivalence. “Obviously it’s not harmless in a wider context of drugs, but it’s comparatively not as harmful [as the bullying allegations] in my head, anyway,” Cal says. Many have taken the same stance as Xav: “There’s people in showbiz doing drugs? Who cares?”After a scandal-stricken few years for Strictly, Poppy says that fans have mostly learned to take headlines “with a pinch of salt”. Nobody wants to downplay the severity of the more serious allegations, and few would argue that they haven’t hurt the show’s image. Still, scrutiny – from fans, from the press – may just be the trade-off for popularity, and Strictly remains very popular. “When you brand yourself as family friendly, you leave yourself open to people looking for ways in which the show, or what’s going on behind the scenes, isn’t,” Cal says. “People are always going to look – I think the family-friendly image makes people want to look harder.”Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingTelevisionEntertainment TVBBCReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/APIf the first term of Donald Trump provoked anxiety over the fate of objective knowledge, the second has led to claims we live in a world-historical age of stupid, accelerated by big tech. But might there be a way out?ByWilliam DaviesThu 2 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 10.36 EDTShareThe first and second Trump administrations have provoked markedly different critical reactions. The shock of 2016 and its aftermath saw a wave of liberal anxiety about the fate of objective knowledge, not only in the US but also in Britain, where the Brexit referendum that year had been won by a campaign that misrepresented key facts and figures. A rich lexicon soon arose to describe this epistemic breakdown. Oxford Dictionaries declared “post-truth” their 2016 word of the year; Merriam-Webster’s was “surreal”. The scourge of “fake news”, pumped out by online bots and Russian troll farms, suggested that the authority of professional journalism had been fatally damaged by the rise of social media. And when presidential counsellor Kellyanne Conway coined the phrase “alternative facts” a few days after Trump’s inauguration in early 2017, the mendacity of the incoming administration appeared to be all but official.The truth panic had the unwelcome side-effect of emboldening those it sought to oppose. “Fake” was one of Trump’s favourite slap-downs, especially to news outlets that reported unwelcome facts about him and his associates. A booming Maga media further amplified the president’s lies and denials. The tools of liberal expertise appeared powerless to hold such brazen duplicity to account. A touchstone of the moment was the German-born writer and philosopher Hannah Arendt, who observed in her 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism that “the ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction … no longer exists”.In 2025, the denunciations have a different flavour. To many of us, the central problem is that we live not so much in a time of lies as one of stupidity. This diagnosis has credibility across the political spectrum. In January, the centrist columnist David Brooks wrote a column for the New York Times titled “The Six Principles of Stupidity”. The new administration, he wrote, was “behaving in a way that ignores the question: What would happen next?”In March, Hillary Clinton – not, perhaps, ideal counsel – weighed in with an op-ed in the same paper, with the headline: “How Much Dumber Will This Get?” “It’s not the hypocrisy that bothers me,” Clinton wrote, “it’s the stupidity.” And in April, the Marxist writer and intellectual Richard Seymour posted an essay on “Stupidity as Historical Force”. In place of Arendt, Seymour quoted Trotsky: “When the political curve goes down, stupidity dominates social thinking” – once the forces of reaction predominate, so reason gives way to insults and prejudice.Trump’s lying is no less constant or blatant than in 2016, but by now it feels familiar, already priced in. What more is there to say about the “war on truth” a decade into Trump’s political career?Still, at least two aspects of his second administration are newly and undoubtedly “stupid”. One is shambolic incompetence of a degree that led the editor of the Atlantic magazine to beaccidentally added to a Signal group chatabout US military operations, a group whose other members included the vice-president and the secretary of defence. A second is its incomprehensible determination to press ahead with policies – such as tariffs and the defunding of medical research – that will do deep harm without any apparent gain, even for Trump’s backers and clients, still less his voters.The spectacle of a prominent vaccine sceptic and wellness crank as secretary of health and human services goes beyond an abandonment of truth; it feels like an assault on human progress. Bans on fluoride in tap water, passed by legislatorsin Utahand Florida at Robert F Kennedy Jr’s behest, mark a new hostility to the very idea of evidence-based government. The escalation from Trump One to Trump Two has seen irrationality spread from the deliberative public sphere to flood the veins of government.When we interpret the actions of others, a basic principle is to assume that people have reasons for behaving as they do, even if those reasons may be emotional, shortsighted or cynical. In the wake of the group chat fiasco and the tariffs upheaval, social media posters made a kind of parlour game of cramming the Trump administration’s actions into their favoured explanatory paradigm. Signalgate must have been deliberate; tariffs must be a grand plan to crash the dollar in the interest of one economic faction or another. The risk is that ever-more elaborate explanations for stupid actions end up wrongly according those actions a kind of intelligence – rather confirming the insight of the political scientist Robyn Marasco that “conspiracy theory is a love affair with power that poses as its critique”.Such speculations are often met with a retort that leans even harder into the stupidity allegation. No, Trump and his people are not playing four-dimensional chess, the response goes – we are simply witnessing the consequences of allowing a deranged man into the highest office, backed by a coterie of dim and unqualified cronies. When political sociology falls short, medical psychiatry and an unspoken social Darwinism fill the void.Not for the first time, the early months of the second Trump administration drew comparisons to Mike Judge’s 2006 movie Idiocracy, in which a soldier of average intelligence wakes up 500 years into the future to discover a US governed by idiocy. Culturally, technologically and ecologically, the depiction feels grimly prophetic. Waste and pollution are out of control. The president is a TV celebrity with the manner and style of a pro-wrestling star. Doctors have been replaced by clunky diagnostic machines. Consumers sit in front of screens flooded with ads and slogans that they repeat like memes. When the soldier advises people to stop trying to irrigate their failing crops using a Gatorade-like drink and to use water instead, they swiftly abandon this practical suggestion when the drink manufacturer’s profits collapse. “Do you really want to live in a world where you’re trying to blow up the one person who is trying to help you?” the soldier asks in desperation, after people turn on him. And, yes, it turns out they do.View image in fullscreenThe US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, at the White House, February 2025.Photograph: Leah Millis/ReutersWe might recognise stupefying consumerism and profit maximisation as symptoms of our own age of idiocy, but the premise of Judge’s satire is a politically ugly one. The reason the US has descended into this abyss over the centuries is that smart people (depicted as neurotic professionals) have stopped reproducing, while dumb people (depicted as violent trailer-park trash) can’t stop, eventually overwhelming the gene pool with stupidity. At a time when racial eugenics, natalist policy and IQ fixation are ascendant once more, this is scarcely a line of thinking that many liberals or leftists can endorse. Then again, who can be sure that opponents of reactionary “stupidity” don’t sometimes harbour eugenicist fantasies of their own? The aftermath of the Brexit vote – like tariffs, a seemingly senseless act of economic self-harm – witnessed liberal mutterings that typical leave voters were so elderly that by the time Brexit finally came into effect, many had already died.One needn’t indulge in such dark fantasies to hope that official stupidity eventually meets its comeuppance. Surely stupid economic policies must lead to stupid political strategy, resulting in the loss of power. Again, Britain’s recent experience offers a precedent: when the then prime minister, Liz Truss, put her own fiscal dogmas above the judgments of the bond markets in September 2022, she was swiftly ejected from office (with the help of the Bank of England) a mere 49 days after entering it. With Trump, many have looked to the bond markets as the final backstop of intelligence in a stupid world, the power that eventually forces idiots to confront consequences. This works up to a point, especially when financial pain is visited upon corporate executives who have the president’s ear – but it only trims away at the stupidity, warding off its worst excesses. Trump’s lack of basic causal understanding, of how policy A leads to outcome B, is not limited to economic policy, nor to Trump himself.The challenge posed by this political crisis is how to take the stupidity seriously without reducing it to a wholly mental or psychiatric phenomenon. Stupidity can be understood as a problem of social systems rather than individuals, as André Spicer and Mats Alvesson explore in their book The Stupidity Paradox. Stupidity, they write, can become “functional”, a feature of how organisations operate on a daily basis, obstructing ideas and intelligence despite the palpable negative consequences.Yet it’s hard to identify anything functional about Trumpian stupidity, which is less a form of organisational inertia or disarray than a slash-and-burn assault on the very things – universities, public health, market data – that help make the world intelligible. Trumpian stupidity isn’t an emergent side-effect of smart people’s failure to take control; it is imposed and enforced. This needs to be confronted politically and sociologically, without falling into the opposite trap of “sanewashing” or inflating strategic cunning to the point of conspiracy theory.“Since the beginning of this century, the growth of meaninglessness has been accompanied by loss of common sense,” wrote Arendt in 1953. “In many respects, this has appeared simply as an increasing stupidity ... Stupidity in the Kantian sense has become the infirmity of everybody, and therefore can no longer be regarded as ‘beyond Remedy’.”Arendt’s argument contained a glimmer of hope. Stupidity on a social scale had to be remediable, if only because it was no longer explicable as a mere cognitive deficiency among individuals. She believed that people – intellectuals as much as “the masses” – had stopped exercising their powers of judgment, preferring to mouth platitudes or simply obey orders, rather than think for themselves. But what are the social and political conditions that normalise this? One is a society where people wait for instruction on how to think, which Arendt saw as a key characteristic of totalitarianism.This social model of stupidity – crystallised in the Orwellian image of brainwashed drones, trained to obey – has a superficial plausibility as a depiction of contemporary authoritarianism, but it misses a critical dimension of liberal societies as they took shape in the late 20th century. Judgment was not replaced by dictatorship, but rather outsourced to impersonal, superintelligent systems of data collection and analysis.Over the middle decades of the 20th century, the neoliberal argument for markets, made most potently by Friedrich Hayek, always emphasised that their primary function was to organise a society’s knowledge. Where markets ran smoothly and prices were set freely, there would be no need for anyone to exercise judgment beyond their own immediate wants, desires and expectations. The “stupid” person has just as much potential to thrive in a neoliberal society as the “smart” person, because the price system will ultimately decide on collective outcomes.In the early 21st century, similar arguments have been made for “big data” by Silicon Valley ideologue and former Wired editor Chris Anderson, and for randomised control trials by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Abhijit Banerjee: that they will happily render the theories, judgments and explanations of human beings – with all their biases and errors – redundant. Once everything is quantified, right down to nanodetails, not even measurement is needed, just algorithmic pattern recognition. You don’t need a concept of “rabbit” to identify the furry thing with big ears; you just design machines to identify which word most commonly appears alongside such an image.View image in fullscreenElon Musk speaks during a news conference, May 2025.Photograph: Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty ImagesThus when people look to the bond markets to rescue us from stupidity, they are not expecting the return of “common sense”, but merely that certain behaviours and policies will receive lower scores than others. Similarly, large language models, which promise so much today, do not offer judgment, let alone intelligence, but unrivalled pattern-processing power, based on a vast corpus of precedents. (Large language models such as ChatGPT are intelligent within their own limits, but comically stupid when stretched beyond them. Google’s AI-generated search feature has been asked to explain the meaning of nonsensical made-up idioms – such as “you can’t lick a badger twice” and “erase twice, plank once” – which it confidently proceeded to do, producing torrents of bullshit. Professors will also be familiar with the experience of reading student essays that are neither very good nor very bad, but that uncanny combination of the intelligent and the stupid that is the mark of AI writing.)From the neoliberal critique of planning in the 1970s to Elon Musk’s Doge, political attacks on governmental and professional forms of human authority serve the parallel project of opening space for overarching technologies of quantification, comparison and evaluation. Yet the technological quest to “go meta” on the rest of society, thus reducing the role of human judgment, is not new. In The Human Condition, Arendt identified the launch of Sputnik in 1957 as a historical turning point, offering the possibility of an unworldly perspective on worldly affairs, downgrading the latter in the process. The cold war, which gave birth to the internet and myriad tools of control and surveillance, was a battle to achieve the most complete global viewpoint. No behaviour or movement was deemed irrelevant to uncovering the enemy’s intentions. Musk’s fixation on space (Starlink now has about 8,000 satellites in orbit) is of a piece with his flippant approach to human judgment. Pressed on why he falsely claimed, as a pretext for slashing its budget, that USAID spent $50m on condoms for Gaza, Musk casually responded: “Some of the things I say will be incorrect.”The transition of human activities on to surveillance platforms means that truth and falsehood, fact and rumour, become mere data points of equal value. False information and stupid policies can move markets at least as much as accurate information and smart policies, and so offer equal opportunity to speculators. One morning in April, the S&P 500 jumped 6% after a viral rumour that Trump’s tariff policy was being paused – a rumour the Financial Times traced back to a pseudonymous X user named Walter Bloomberg, based in Switzerland, with no offline credentials whatsoever. A Hayekian might point out that the error was quickly corrected – the market dropped 6% again within the hour – but this was a manifestly stupid turn of events.In a fully platform-based world, everything shrinks to the status of behaviours and patterns; meaning, intention and explanation become irrelevant. One of the most incisive accounts of this tendency in contemporaryUS politicscomes from political scientists Nancy Rosenblum and Russell Muirhead, in their analysis of the “new conspiracism”.Classic conspiracy theory (regarding, say, the JFK assassination) rests on an overelaborate theoretical imagination, with complex causal chains, strategies and alliances. Its demands for coherence and meaning are excessive, while its tolerance for contingency is stunted. By contrast, “The new conspiracism dispenses with the burden of explanation. Instead, we have innuendo and verbal gesture … not evidence but repetition … The new conspiracism – all accusation, no evidence – substitutes social validation for scientific validation: if a lot of people are saying it, to use Trump’s signature phrase, then it is true enough.”The new conspiracism has its technological basis in digital platforms and the rise of reactionary influencers and “conspiracy entrepreneurs”. Outlandish and pointless fantasies, such as the conspiracies circulated by QAnon or the alleged staging of the Sandy Hook school shooting, exist to be recited and shared, acting as instruments of online influence and coordination rather than narratives to make sense of the world. They may identify enemies and reinforce prejudices, but they don’t explain anything or provide a political plan. The only injunction of the new conspiracist is that their claims get liked, shared and repeated. Engagement – and revenue – is all.View image in fullscreenRobert F Kennedy Jr speaks at the White House, September 2025.Photograph: ABACA/ShutterstockThis analysis takes us beyond the 2016-era panic over “truth” to help us chart the current political flood waters of “stupidity”. When Republican politicians go on TV and make absurd claims about tariffs, vaccines or immigration, is it best understood as “lying”, or as something else altogether? Often they are simply repeating lines that have already been circulating, filtering outward from nodes – Trump and RFK Jr especially – in the conspiracist network. Some claims act as loyalty oaths (affirmations that the 2020 election was stolen), but more are just deranged and bizarre, not to mention sick, such as the claim that DEI hiring policies were responsible for the fires that devastated Los Angeles in January, and the fatal aircraft collision that killed 67 people that same month. Taken as judgments or explanations, they raise questions about the cognitive faculties of the speaker, but perhaps they are better seen as memes. The individuals might sound stupid, but they are not the architects of a media sphere in which causal explanation has been sacrificed for symbolic mimicry, to fill time and generate content.In the same essay reflecting on stupidity, Arendt distinguished between “preliminary” and “true” understanding. Because it involves applying existing concepts to particular situations, preliminary understanding has a kind of circularity. It can be clever and correct, but it falls short when confronting the genuine novelty of human actions. One can escape the most brute form of stupidity, yet not truly understand the significance of the political and historical moment. Even the cleverest person or system can get trapped in a “preliminary” understanding of events.Arendt argued that there was a second human faculty, in addition to judgment, that allowed understanding to progress to a truer grasp of meaning: imagination. Imagination, for Arendt, is the uniquely human capacity to grasp truth via speculative leaps, drawing on empathy and creativity in the process, as opposed to scientific methods. Politics requires us to navigate situations which are incomparable and immeasurable, because they are genuinely new. This in turn requires something closer to aesthetic judgment than to scientific judgment.Neoliberalism: the idea that swallowed the worldRead more“Imagination alone,” Arendt wrote, “enables us to see things in their proper perspective.” The challenge Arendt poses to us is to think of truth and meaning not from the perspective of the economist, financial analyst, data scientist or sociologist, but of the historian, the kind who sees human events as a series of breaks, anomalies and initiations.This is what the “closed world” of platform and market surveillance can’t provide: a kind of understanding that is not reducible to empirical data. Artificial or market “intelligence” has the capacity to learn at ultra-high speed from existing data, but its range of possible outcomes, while extremely large, is nevertheless enumerable and therefore finite. In the gamified space of such “closed worlds”, history is finished, and all that remains is lots and lots of behaviours. Every conceivable event, utterance or idea is already out there, whether in the real-time computer of the market or the archival one of the data bank, waiting to be discovered.Trump and his administration are undoubtedly stupid. They don’t know what they are doing, don’t understand the precedents or facts involved and lack any curiosity about consequences, human and non-human. The tariffs fiasco has been the greatest fillip to the legitimacy of the economics profession in living memory, showing by a series of brute experimental results that international trade does, on balance, enhance prosperity and efficiency. It turns out that the foundational concepts of macroeconomics do have some empirical grip upon the world after all, and that to ignore them is an act of stupidity. Tragically, a similar process is under way in public health.But if our only alternative to stupidity is to reinstall the “preliminary understanding” of expert orthodoxy (welcome as that might be in some areas), then there will be no reflection on the wider historical conditions of stupidity, nor on the extent of stupid policy and process not only tolerated but valued by contemporary capitalism. The outsourcing of judgment to financial markets, digital platforms and fusions of the two is also an invitation for people to behave stupidly, albeit within systems that are governed by some esoteric form of mathematical reason. It would be absurd to seek hope in Trump and Trumpism, but perhaps stupidity on such a world-historical level can at least offer an opportunity for “true” understanding. Nothing – markets, bots or machines – can rescue us, except our imagination.A longer version of this essay appeared inn+1 magazineListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Collapses in popularity, huge dilemmas about public spending, foreign policy emergencies, poll surges by opponents and the prospect of losing office: all can persuade even previously cautious administrations to change their direction and rhetoric – or simply say more clearly why they are in power.Politicians sometimes enjoy being bolder. Commonly seen as always calculating and never spontaneous, some are in fact relieved to stop filtering their public words and finally speak their minds. At theLabour conference this week, fringe meetings were refreshingly, sometimes startlingly, full of ministers, MPs and recent government advisers talking frankly about the government’s problems and the toxicity of modern politics.Even the business secretary, Peter Kyle, usually slick and studiedly unflustered, admitted at an event hosted byLabourTogether that “the public know that we have a big problem in the economy”, and that “our politics is going through turmoil”. After 15 months of governing as if it had enough time and public attention to be understated and methodical, Labour is switching to a more urgent, potentially more realistic approach.The most renowned example of a British government using crises to reinvent itself remains Margaret Thatcher’s. At a similar stage in its life, in 1981, it had lostover a thirdof its original support. Like Keir Starmer’s government, it was struggling to revive the economy, control inflation, raise taxes and prevent riots. Then Argentina recklesslyinvaded the Falklands in 1982, and Thatcher was handed an opportunity to relaunch her premiership as a shameless but powerful patriotic project.While there were endless flags and patriotic phrases at Labour conference, a conveniently symbolic and winnable war feels unlikely in today’s more heavily armed and geopolitically chaotic world. And Starmer is arguably in an even bigger hole than Thatcher in 1981. It’s constantly pointed out far how Labour’s poll ratings have fallen since the election,from 34%toabout 20%, yet it’s less remembered that during the campaign’s first days, in May 2024,Labour was at 45%. Its decline may well be unprecedented, in rapidity and scale, in the history of elected British governments.Was this Starmer’s best speech? Yes. But he’ll need a new battle plan to convince a doubting Britain | Martin KettleRead moreLabour’s crisis of electoral, moral and financial credibility is now causing what used to be a heavily disciplined party to criticise itself, in ways that could help save the government – or hasten its end.Andy Burnham’s callfor a more leftwing but also more broad-church administration dominated conversations in the queues for conference events, despite all the confident assurances from Starmer loyalists that the mayor of Greater Manchester had blown his leadership chances.Yet away from his packed fringe appearances there were many other, more surprising, would-be tellers of home truths. The recently elected MP for Bassetlaw, Jo White, called the energy secretary Ed Miliband’s promise that clean power would reduce energy bills within a few years “complete nonsense” – ignoring his high standing with environmentalists and Labour members.At the same event, Peter Hyman, until last year a key Starmer adviser, said that the current “age of insecurity” could not be countered by a government offering “security” – a political theme long favoured by Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves – because voters no longer believe politicians can provide it. Instead, Hyman argued, the government should ensure that voters were “tooled up” with the skills to cope with an ultra-competitive, unstable world.Fringe speakers elsewhere offered more leftwing diagnoses and solutions. The MP for Pendle and Clitheroe, Jonathan Hinder, part of the socially conservative, economically interventionist Blue Labour group, said that the government should stop “the looting of our common assets” by privatised utilities and private contractors for public services. “Working-class voters have leftwing economic values,” he said, and the government should favour “labour over capital”. Even during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, supposedly erased from Labour’s consciousness, it was rare to hear such blunt pro-worker language.What might emerge from the party’s candid and confrontational new mood? The belated but welcomeattacks on Reform UK by Starmerand his ministers suggest that the switch is not just a fleeting fashion from the conference fringe. But there is a risk that the new mix of policies and stances – more egalitarian economic rhetoric, yet continuing deference towards the financial markets; anti-racism, yet growing authoritarianism towards immigrants – will simply produce a mess.As someone who arrived in the intensely tribal House of Commons relatively late in life, whose personal history features both deprivation and privilege, and who believes in competence rather than ideology, Starmer has a tendency to be both leftwing and rightwing at the same time. That’s not necessarily a weakness. Many voters haveeclectic and contradictory politics. But often, “to govern is to choose”, as the 1950s French prime minister Pierre Mendès-France pithily put it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another will be next May’s elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and many English mayoralties and councils, when the party’s remaining strongholds will need a coherent and highly focused Labour campaign if they are not to fall. “Across this country,” saidthe new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, in her conference speech, “people feel like things are spinning out of control.”If Labour fails to produce such a campaign in only seven months’ time, then panic may set in, and the ferment at this week’s conference fringe may turn out to have been the first phase of a post-Starmer age. As well as Burnham’s leadership ambitions, the conference was also shadowed by the likely aspirations of Mahmood, Kyle, the health secretary,Wes Streeting, and Angela Rayner, whose fall from prominence already feels temporary.Whether under Starmer or someone else, it’s possible that more frankness and open-mindedness will save the government, rather than make it look fatally divided. This week at least, his premiership seems energised. Labour does have some decent policies, and most of his potential successors are strong communicators. With the Conservatives weaker than for decades, and Reform with no experience of waiting for and then contesting a general election as favourites – as its thin-skinned response to Labour’s attacks is showing – it may be less difficult for Labour to get re-elected than seems the case now.But after 14 years of often disastrous Tory government, and with many voters still wanting a broadly left-of-centre country, squeezing back in for a second term would not be a triumph for Labour.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025OpinionKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Now, I’m doing it again,and it’s Charing Cross police station. Again. I appeared on the BBC PanoramaUndercover in the Policeprogramme. I thought long and hard about taking partin this documentary, after the hatred and threats I received last year after I spoke as part of another BBC documentary.But I felt that, given the programme’s importance and everything it was trying to uncover, I just had to take part. Plus, I couldn’t let the haters win.Three years ago, I was director for London at theIndependent Office for Police Conduct, where my teams had done an incredible job investigating misconduct inside Charing Cross police station. The subsequent report uncovered victims of racism and abuse who were themselves serving officers. It also uncovered a toxic culture of misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, homophobia and ableism. Yes, really.Alongside the recommendations we made to the Met to ensure this didn’t happen again, I made the decision to publish theWhatsApp messagesunredacted. That wasn’t an easy decision, but I wanted to ensure that members of the public and other serving officers understood what discrimination actually looked like – and what their colleagues suffered. This became a global news story, andeventually led to the resignationof the Met’s commissioner, Cressida Dick.Why am I telling you this now? Because three years later the BBC’s undercover reporting shows that nothing has changed. Nothing. This is a catastrophic failure of leadership at the highest levels by the Met. I am unapologetically scathing because of all the work, all the recommendations that had been made previously. Everything had been agreed upon and supposedly implemented. So how could this possibly happen again?Thirty-one years after the murder of my son Stephen Lawrence, I can forgive his killers – but not the Met | Neville LawrenceRead moreThat’s the question that must be thoroughly explored so we know where accountability sits for this failure. What is so dispiriting, and what this documentary proved, is how some officers think and behave when they feel safe. It is a clear reflection of the extent to which far-right thinking is creeping into our public services. It’s also a confirmation of what some communities inLondonhave always feared, of what institutional racism and misogyny actually looks like in reality. If that reflection stings a bit, just consider again the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim hatred we saw in the documentary, alongside the copious examples of misogyny.I’m still processing the documentary. I was at the National BlackPoliceAssociation (NBPA) conference this week, where we were thinking hard about this.In the programme, my amazing colleague,Sue Fish, who was Nottinghamshire’s senior officer and who has worked so hard to confront misbehaviour and to make misogyny a hate crime, said what I said three years ago: this isn’t just the case of a few rotten apples. It’s about the barrel. It always was.So what next? The first thing they have to do is ask themselves, how did this happen again. How did it happen at all in the Met, but specifically how did it happen at Charing Cross, given everything they knew about the station there and its culture? This goes deep, because much was done at the station last time to move officers and disband units, but the problem is still there. This is almost a case study in failure. You can’t fault current Met commissioner Mark Rowley’s rhetoric. There is a whole body of work they are doing to have a new Met. But if, after three years, this is where we are, how can we say it is working?One thing they need to do is to repair the relationship with the NBPA. They also need to bring in people whose views will be challenging and thus are difficult to hear, but who need to be heard. The whole thing now is too internal. After theMacpherson reportfollowing the inquiry into police failures after the death of Stephen Lawrence,they had lay advisers who did provide challenge and a proper critique, but that has dissipated to nothing.They must also create conditions so that frontline officers who want no part in this feel confident in being able to speak up and that they will be supported when they do. In the programme, we saw a female officer who knew what was being said was wrong, but didn’t feel she could do anything about it because the male officer involved was senior to her. That problem must be urgently addressed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What view will she take of this?This has gone on for too long. What we need now is fewer meaningless words about “the Al Capone approach” to rooting out shameful behaviour and more humility about what they are getting wrong, allied to the courage to ask for help to get it right.

Danny Kruger was already looking very queasy when he sat at the back for the Reform press conference in which Nigel Farage revealed hisplans for mass deportationsof legal migrants. Then on Wednesday it fell to him to go on television to say that when Zia Yusuf had repeatedly said Keir Starmer was a terrorist who was plotting to kill Farage, he had actually meant something entirely different. Fair to say Danny probably isn’t living his best Reform life. It’s one thing to defect from the Tories. It’s another to be made to look a quarter-wit in the process.Nadine Dorries, though, is another matter. She really is living the dream. Maybe it helps that she was never that bright in the first place but she is a woman of no regrets. Perfectly happy to live in the day. The past isn’t just another country, it’s a parallel universe. One where any inconsistencies and inconvenient truths are consigned to blissful oblivion. She is the unthinking woman’s unthinking woman. A danger to herself but a source of amusement to the rest of us.We last saw Nad on theday of her defectionat the Reform party conference in early September. There she had been brought on stage to introduce herself. Fair to say this was not one of her finest performances. She appeared – and there is no kind way of saying this – rambling and totally incoherent. So much so that Nige had to make an unscheduled appearance on stage to interrupt her and drag her away. Her final words were: “You’ll never take me alive.” Or something like that.But Dorries is now back, giving an interview to Cathy Newman on Channel 4’s Fourcast podcast. And not a moment too soon. Politics has missed her incisive thinking and deranged conspiracy theories. We dived straight in with the accusations of racism. Nad nodded her head seriously. She had had time to consider Reform’s policies in great depth – always a warning sign when Nad says something like that – and come to the conclusion that Reform couldn’t be racist because everyone in Reform was too intelligent to be racist.Newman pointed out that deporting people with a legal right to be here probably was racist. Now Nad went rogue. She had worked in the NHS and some of her best friends had been Filipinos and Reform wasn’t going to deport all of them – she might want to check this one out with Nige – but it was fine to chuck out all those who were here illegally, which made up for most hospital workers. At which point it slowly dawned on Cathy that Nadine didn’t seem to quite understand the difference between legal and illegal.We moved on to the prime minister’s speech to the Labour conference. Here Nad went full Zia. It had definitely been an incitement to murder. Keir wanted Nige dead. Dan Brown had told her so, personally. Along with saying he thought she was the greatest living novelist. It was perfectly normal for the head of government to order executions on live TV. All of them had done that. Apart from her darling Boris. Nad didn’t seem to remember that Reform had publicly backedLucy Connollywho actually had incited violence.Now things became steadily more unhinged. Nige and Zia’s “Boriswave” had actually been a secret invention of Dominic Cummings. Yet another cog in the endless plot to bring down Boris. She knew this because she had had a conversation about it with Boris, though she couldn’t discuss any of her private conversations with her Bozzy bear. It was only a matter of time before she blamed Michael Gove.“Why don’t people blame Rishi Sunak for the increase in immigration?” Dorries pleaded. Er … possibly because it all started under Boris. And come to think of it, why hadn’t Nadine said something about it when she was in Johnson’s cabinet? That was because no one had told her all these people were coming into the country and it hadn’t occurred to her to ask. She had been too busy enjoying the Brexit benefits of controlling our borders by letting 4.2 million people in. She demanded another moment’s silence for Boris. The finest PM to have ever lived.Then the bombshell. “I’ve given my life to politics and I have a lot of wisdom,” she said. Something no one has ever said of Dorries. Or is ever likely too. There were dozens of Tory MPs queueing up to defect to Reform. But Nige was only interested in taking the very brightest and the best. People of the calibre of … Nadine. Who wouldn’t welcome someone this gifted?There was just time for one more jewel. A searing insight. No one could possibly have guessed that Reform’s health policy consultant Aseem Malhotra would use his conference speech toblame the king’s cancer on the Covid jab, because it was not as if he had ever said anything like that before. Oh, he had. Reform took only the finest minds of their generation. And if a peerage were to come her way … She was getting ahead of herself. It’s only a matter of time. “I hate doing media,” Nad concluded. She hides it well.If Nad was having a top day out, Mark Rowley, the head of the Met, was having one of his worst as he was made to do a series of interviews explaining away thelatest exposéfrom the BBC’s Panorama programme. Rowley looked as if he would rather be almost anywhere else. Even spending an hour with Nadine. That bad.It was like this. The Met wasn’t institutionally racist, misogynistic and violent, he said. It was just that the Beeb had managed to root out the five or six bad apples in the entire force. Everyone else was above reproach. People could have full confidence in the police. And no, hewasn’t going to resign. Because what would be the point? Whoever took over from him would only then have to resign the next time it happened. Then where would we be? Far better that no one took responsibility.Would that do? It would have to.The Bonfire of the Insanities by John Crace (Guardian Faber Publishing, £16.99).

Unfortunately, the ambition does not include obeying environmental rules in full, at least not for another decade or so. Rather, the creditors want Thames to be held to lower standards so that it can avoid a torrent of fines that would otherwise land in its lap.This unattractive pitch is accompanied by an appeal to blunt pragmatism. The creditors’ argument runs roughly like this: “Get real, dear Ofwat, Environment Agency and government: Thames is in a proper mess. All previous turnaround plans have failed because they were fantasies. The assets will take a decade, minimum, to fix. There is no point whacking the business with a billion or two of fines along the way because the cash is needed for investment. By all means fine us for failing to hit lower targets, but make them ones we stand a chance of achieving. Look, we’re even volunteering for a £4bn, or 25%, write-off on our debt and we’ll inject £3.15bn in equity. We may be the best you are going to get.”Their argument is self-serving, naturally. The nightmare for the creditors comes if Thames does indeed end up in special administration – temporary (definitely not permanent) renationalisation. At that point, they would lose control and their losses would be greater as the administrator looked to reorganise the business, sell it or list on the stock market. Under their own proposal, creditors have a medium-term hope of recouping their upfront losses by earning a return on their new equity – they’ll be aiming by internal rates of return of 13%-14% of that slice on the recapitalisation.The strong-arm tactics may succeed, it should be said. The government is clearly terrified of special administration – or terrified its backbenchers would demand permanent nationalisation, which ministers have ruled out. The Treasury’sstrong preference is for a “market-led” solution, of which the creditors’ plan is the only one on the table. Politicians prefer to have somebody to blame.Yet this is the point in this saga at which outsiders – the poor old customers – deserve to see proper detail on what compromises are being contemplated in the name of realism and pragmatism. The creditors’ plan is too murky –still.How much regulatory, legal and environmental leniency is being demanded? The creditors trumpet an ambition to reduce pollution by 30% up to 2030. Is that really the best Thames, even in its beaten-up state, could do? Remember the company now has its supposedly transformative Tideway super-sewer in operation. And remember the government’s target for the industryis a halving of sewage pollution by 2030.Other operational targets are minimally described, or are self-selected highlights. Then there are acres of guff about “a new customer-centric, high-performance culture, underpinned by a philosophy of acting responsibly”. It is meaningless. As for the “new world-class board”, only one name has been mentioned – the former Openreach boss Mike McTighe – and he would only be chair.The lack of detail is infuriating. This saga is being conducted as a behind-closed-doors negotiation with Ofwat, a regulatordue to be abolishedanyway. Meanwhile, Steve Reed, the environment secretary until last month’s reshuffle,declared in Julythat the rules did not allow a struggling company to be given leniency on sewage fines. So why has Ofwat been allowed to conduct talks that have always envisaged special treatment?Reed’s other contribution was to saypreparations were being made for special administration, in case they were needed. Let’s also hear those details, because whatever the complications and delays of going down that route, it offers the prospect of a chunkier debt write-down and a root-and-branch reorganisation.The Thames crisis was always going to end in a choice between two unappealing options – a recapitalisation in which the creditors’ main motive is to minimise their financial pain, or special administration. Even at this late stage, though, neither Ofwat nor the government has offered Thames’ customers a meaningful analysis of many trade-offs. Amid the murk, special administration looks the cleaner solution.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterNils Pratley on financecommentShareReuse this content"

But this one concerns the future of the world. The issue is whether the prime minister attends the UN climate summitin Brazil next month.You may think this would not require too much thought. Two years ago, Starmerattacked Rishi Sunakfor not going to a much less significant climate meeting and said that, were he prime minister, he would definitely attend.TheCop30 leaders’ summitin the Amazonian city of Belém on 6-7 November is the most important since the historic Paris Cop of 2015. But thelatest reports suggestthat Starmer’s political aides do not want him to go. They apparently think that Labour’s Reform-minded voters do not care much about the climate crisis and feel he spends too much time abroad. Meanwhile, Starmer’s foreign policy advisers point to Donald Trump’s mendacious attack on climate change science and policy at the UNlast weekand say it would look terrible for Starmer to stay away.With Kemi Badenochhaving vowedto scrap the 2008 Climate Change Act – one of the last Labour government’s greatest achievements, copied all over the world – Starmer cannot afford to go soft on his own oft-expressed climate commitments.President Lula of Brazil has deliberately called this leaders’ summit a few days before the start of the conference, with the express purpose of getting governments to renew their commitment to multilateral climate action.Lula knows he has a problem. Cop30 is one of those once-every-five-years moments under the Paris agreement when countries must bring their new climate targets, so-callednationally determined contributionsor NDCs. But we already know that the NDCs are not strong enough to achieve theParis goalsof holding global warming to 1.5C or 2C above preindustrial levels.Last week the world’s largest carbon polluter, China,announced its new targets. President Xi Jinping said China would cut its emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035. But this is far from thecut of 30% over 2021 levelswhich analysts believe would be consistent with a global path to net zero after 2050. For the EU, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, confirmed that the EU will cut its emissions by somewhere between 66% and 72% on 1990 levels by 2035 – but opposition from key member states left her unable to commit to the higher figure.The UK’s NDCwas announced a year ago at Cop29 by Ed Miliband. Aiming to cut nationally produced emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels by 2035, the UK’s target is one of the few which analysts say is consistent with a global 1.5C pathway.After Cop30, the UN will publish an official assessment adding up all the NDCs. But after China’s announcement, we know that the world will be heading for much more than 2C of warming –probably closer to 2.5C. And we know that at these temperatures there will be catastrophic impacts on species extinctions, sea level rise, water scarcity and extreme weather events.So Cop30 has a huge task: to get the world back on track to 1.5/2C. The only problem is that it can’t do this. The Paris agreement was a compromise between collective agreement on climate goals and “nationally determined contributions” to achieve them. The clue is in the name: these are not subject to scrutiny or criticism by anyone else. The “emissions gap” will not even be on the formal conference agenda. China, India and Saudi Arabia are insisting that the Paris agreementforbids negotiatorsfrom discussing it.This is why the leaders’ summit is so crucial. Lula and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, want leaders to acknowledge that their NDCs are collectively not enough.Lula has some specific proposals. He wants to create a more streamlinedUN climate council. He has put forward an innovative scheme for financing ahalt to tropical deforestation. His team is working on a UN-mandated “roadmap” to show how an annual $1.3tn (£950bn) of climate finance for developing countries can be achieved by 2035. None of this will happen if leaders don’t even attend the summit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Setting out a vision of uncurtailed US power, he shunned the UN principle of multilateral cooperation to tackle shared problems. Yet action on the climate crisis perhaps most demands this principle. Not just because global warming knows no boundaries, but because the Paris agreement is one of the few examples of successful UN action.Before Cop15 in Copenhagen in 2009, the world was on a path to around6C of warming. Due to the commitments made there, by Cop21 in Paris in 2015 this was down to around 4C. Since then, after 10 years of astonishing reductions in the cost of solar and wind energy and electric vehicles, it is nowcloser to 2.5C. That is huge progress – because countries do follow the decisions they make together under the UN system, and because a global green energy transition is already under way. It is not enough progress – but it is quite wrong to say that the UN system is not working.But it now faces its biggest ever challenge. Time is rapidly running out to get back on a 1.5C/2C pathway. If world leaders cannot agree in Belém, this will not just be a diplomatic disaster. The world’s business and finance leaders will conclude that governments are not after all serious about climate action. So they will scale down their decarbonisation plans, just as they did after the perceived failure of Copenhagen in 2009. Emissions reductions will slow. The whole global effort to arrest the process of climate change, painfully constructed over the past quarter-century, could begin to unravel.Trump will not be in Belém. But you can be sure he will be posting messages on social media throughout the summit. If leaders do not show up, he will gleefully boast that without even being there he has defeated the Paris agreement and the entire, woke “con” of the so-called climate crisis. It would be odd if Starmer decided to support him by also staying away.Michael Jacobs is professor of political economy at the University of Sheffield and a visiting senior fellow at the thinktank ODI GlobalExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionCop30Climate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

The people, the industry and the critics spoke with united voice, all of them basically retching.Actors were especially fast out of the gate to condemn a concept that is – obviously – depressing, dystopian and (if the tech behind it has ripped off real-life faces) dodgy. It is also plain shonky: my colleagueStuart Heritage has saidperhaps all there needs to be said about Tilly’s indeterminate dentistry, but there are clearly teething problems here that mean she’s far from ready for her closeup.Still,on TuesdayUS union Sag-Aftra – a whoppingly powerful organisation – hit back at this little skit that screened at a conference in Zurich by saying it believed creativity was, “and should remain, human-centred. The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics”.Natasha Lyonne and Emily Blunt urged agencies not to sign the likes of Tilly to their books. “Deeply misguided and totally disturbed,” said Lyonne. “Not the way. Not the vibe.” Blunt meanwhile, tolda Variety podcast: “Good Lord, we’re screwed. That is really, really scary … Please stop taking away our human connection.”‘It’s too late to be scared’: readers on the controversial rise of AI ‘actors’Read moreTo which one can only reply: hear, hear! And also: eh? Because such cheerleading for naturalism can feel increasingly iffy. Actors may say they are committed to human connection and emotional truth telling. They may indeed believe that they are. Yet both the movies and the decisions many of them make tell a different story.This season, at least four female actors, all A-list, none older than early 40s, appear to have had cosmetic work done on their face that renders what many of us might consider their greatest asset devalued, or at least changed, for ever.Cheeks have been smoothed, jaws tightened and lips plumped. Looks are now standardised, homogenised, blandified – no CGI or AI necessary!None have confirmed such work, and any such procedures are of course their own business. Except that that business is plausibly portraying everyday people, while trading on the affection and association audiences have fostered for them over a number of years in which they looked … different.The other week I watched an intense new drama starring one of these actors and was totally thrown by these abrupt changes to her face: subtle, yet still substantial enough to be unsettling.In the past, that face was one of the aspects of her appeal that meant I was happy to watch her reel off any old junk – and frequently had. Instead, I spent two hours feeling distanced, mournful and faintly frightened: not feelings that encourage submission to a fiction.Presumably the pressures on female actors to fight the passing of time are considerable enough to mean many make this kind of leap – for which, my sympathies. Yet changing your face to try to reject the inevitable does make protestations of commitment to gritty reality harder to swallow.It’s not just the women, of course: theirs is simply the most visible incongruity. Sometimes the entire entertainment climate feels like a vacuum of vanity. We are living in a golden age of self-absorbed cinema, in which many of the key movies of the season serve to feed the egos of their leads rather than cater for the audience.Tilly Norwood: how scared should we be of the viral AI ‘actor’?Read moreJay Kellystars George Clooney as a Clooney-esque movie icon, and is filled with commentary on the pain and glory of superstardom. Other movies which may strike the deepest chord with those who have a personal publicist include Is This Thing On?,Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,The Smashing Machineand Song Sung Blue – the latter three further fruits of Hollywood’s insatiable appetite for entertainment biopics.Elsewhere we haveDie, My Lovethe definition of an actors’ movie, in which Jennifer Lawrence (particularly) and Robert Pattinson (a bit) are allowed every opportunity to chew scenery while looking really hot, as well as Daniel Day-Lewis’s self-scripted comeback,Anemone, and Leonardo DiCaprio’s adorably scrappy dad inOne Battle After Another.Some of these are nonetheless good movies. Some, even, are superb. But if actors want to not alienate audiences, to help illuminate life as most people experience it, they might consider broadening the scope of their scripts. And they definitely need to stop surgically turning themselves into – well, into Tilly Norwood.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTilly Norwood (AI character)Artificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

My father, Ali Mustafa,was arrested by Bashar al-Assad’s forces in Syria on 2 July 2013and disappeared. Since that day, we have had no word, no trace, nothing.Every morning since he was taken I made my first thought after waking up: “He is alive.” Every night I went to sleep repeating it.My father’s arrest meant that our lives as we knew them were over as well. My family and I had to flee our country in fear for our safety, leaving him behind.Since then I have held on to the belief that if I allowed myself to mourn his loss it would mean I had accepted he was dead. We had no way of knowing whether this was true or not; to grieve without truth felt like a betrayal. So instead of grief, there was just absence.You are trapped in a state of psychological limbo between hope and despair, unable to fully live in eitherYears later, I learned that this is what psychologists call “ambiguous loss”. It is the most painful kind of loss because it never ends. When someone dies, there is a body, a burial, a ritual, a shared understanding that allows mourning to begin. But with the disappeared, there is nothing. No confirmation, no grave, no answers.You are trapped in this state of psychological limbo between hope and despair, unable to fully live in either.For all those years I really believed my father was alive. I felt it every single day. I carried his photo everywhere. I joined protests, campaigns, trials. I spoke in his name again and again.Hope was not just an emotion – it was a duty. This is what enforced disappearance does. It does not just take our loved ones. It steals our right to mourn them. For years I lived with the responsibility of fighting for my father’s life, and for all those who have disappeared. It felt like this might be my life forever – this unending struggle to find out the truth.Then, in December 2024, everything changed. The Assad regime finally collapsed and the prisons were opened. Thousands of families rushed to see if they would be reunited with their loved ones. I went there too, from prison to prison, to find my father but he was nowhere.I am left with only silence. Since then I have been unable to let go.How can I look back at the past 12 years of my life and make sense of what I went through? How can I mourn my father without seeing his body or having something tangible to say farewell to? For all those years it felt too early to grieve. Now it feels too late. That moment of farewell was stolen from us, hidden behind prison walls. The fall of the Assad regime should have brought answers but to so many families of Syria’s disappeared, it has only brought a new kind of absence.We ask for names, for lists, for truth. We are given nothing. No answers, no records, no acknowledgment.Syria’s interim government must end disappearances and unlawful detention and the sectarian violence and rhetoric that fuels itI find myself asking questions that never end. Was my father alive last year? Last month? Did he know we were searching for him? Did he die alone? Did anyone speak his name in those final moments?These questions eat away at me. They stop me from letting him go and they stop me from living.This is not only my story. It is the story of tens of thousands of families in Syria. Since 2011 there are more than160,000 Syrians whose disappearance by the Assad regime has been documentedby the Syrian Network for Human Rights, with 180,000 missing in all. Behind each one is a family stuck in the same limbo.The first thing that the interim government in Syria must do is to end enforced disappearance and unlawful detention, and stop the sectarian violence and the divisive rhetoric that fuels it. Start focusing on achieving the truth, justice and peace that we need to move our country forward.Through the new National Commission for the Missing, that means addressing disappearances by all parties without discrimination, protecting evidence and data, and ensuring families and survivors are not just consulted but are leading this process. Only an inclusive, independent and victim-centred commission can start to restore trust.As for the international community: the revolution and war in Syria and then the genocide in Gaza have stripped away the last illusions about what the world will do for us. Their inaction and complicity speak for themselves.But we must understand that our struggle does not depend on them. It depends on us – on the families who carry photos of the disappeared, on the survivors who keep telling their stories, on our refusal to forget or be silenced. Justice begins here, with our memory, our voices and our demand that the crimes never be repeated.Until the truth of my father’s fate is known – and until every family in Syria has the same truth – grief will remain unfinished but our fight for justice will not end.Wafa Mustafa is a human rights activist and works for theSyria Campaign.

It’s cheap humour, rage bait – and now, it seems, US government policyRobert TopinkaDonald Trump’s White House reveals a new ‘portrait’ of Joe Biden – and in his world, if you don’t laugh, the joke’s on youThu 2 Oct 2025 06.31 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 11.25 EDTShareOn 24 September, a White House communications adviser posted a video on X of a new presidential Walk of Fame, captioned: “Wait for it”, with a pen and eyes emoji. The video pans over a succession of presidential portraits to reveal – in place of Joe Biden’s portrait – a framedphotograph of an autopensigning his name. The sight-gag references the Maga conspiracy theory that, unbeknownst to “Sleepy Joe”, unscrupulous aides used the autopen to sign pardons in his name. The post delighted supporters and outraged critics, which only further delighted supporters.And that was precisely the point. This combination of cheap humour and rage bait is the province of the shitpost, a genre oflow-effort social media contentdesigned to amuse insiders and annoy outsiders. Like so much of internet culture, shitposting was pioneered on the message board 4chan – but Donald Trump is a natural. On the 12th anniversary of 9/11,he tweeted: “I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th.” The shitpost forces a choice: undermine public decorum by laughing along, or get offended, outing yourself as a hater and a loser.The deliberate impropriety of the shitpost makes good-faith engagement impossible. Like a children’s game of made you look, responding means either sinking to the level of the shitpost or looking ridiculous by responding earnestly to a low-effort provocation, which only proves the shitpost has had its intended effect.Refusing to abide by discursive norms can signal a refusal to abide by political norms. After Trump dubbed him “Low Energy” Jeb Bush during the 2016 Republican primaries, the more professorial younger brother of George W Bush made the mistake of arguing that he was, in fact, dynamic and busy, as if Trump were making a political claim that could be contested. But this was nicknaming as shitposting. Instead of clever metaphors, Trump’s nicknames are low-effort direct literalisms. From “Little Marco” Rubio to “No Talent” Jimmy Kimmel, their purpose is not to make a substantive claim or offer an accurate description of reality, but to titillate allies and bait enemies.Unencumbered by the establishment strategists who urged decorum during his first administration, Trump has elevated shitposting to a national strategy in his second term. Two days before the Walk of Fame announcement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)posted a videoof masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents hauling civilians into unmarked vans, cut to the opening credits of the Pokémon television series. As the theme song’s refrain has it: “Gotta Catch ’Em All”.On 4chan, home to the small but significant crossover ofanime fans and the extreme right, posters debated whether the video was “based” (internet slang meaning authentically cool and irreverent) or “cringe” (shamefully straining for the approval the “based” attain with ease). But the real target audience was liberals outraged not only by state violence but by its shameless public celebration. If the right dominates meme culture, it is less because the “left can’t meme” than because it is far easier to “own the libs” who remain committed to rational political discourse. Where liberals seek earnest debate, the shitpost offers a polemic without a point, an opportunity to indulge in cruelty.At best, shitposts function as satire. Thehopecoregenre on TikTok combines motivational speeches with slideshows of mountain lakes and island sunsets over a soundtrack of atmospheric strings and lo-fi guitar scales.Hopeless coreshitposts adopt the same format but with comedically clumsy speeches that render the inspirational slideshow absurd, mocking the vacuousness of online inspo culture. A day after the Pokémon shitpost, the DHS turned hopeless core satire into a schoolyard taunt, posting a clip ofpodcast broTheo Von saying, in his trademark laconic style, “Heard you got deported dude – bye” followed by Ice arrest videos cut to a soundtrack of reverb-soaked introspective guitar scales. The DHS deleted the post over Von’s objections, but just as “Low Energy” Jeb’s protests guaranteed his nickname would stick, Von’s complaint only attracted more attention to the video.In recent days, the vice president, JD Vance, hascalled oneprominent liberal pundit a “dipshit” and told critics to “go straight to hell”. Vance is too much of a try-hard to succeed as a shitposter, but his comments revel in the chaos shitposting creates. This chaos can have dire consequences. The 2019 Christchurch mosque shooter described his attack as moving fromshitposting to effort posting,by which he meant from trolling to taking meaningful action. But political violence itself has begun taking the form of the shitpost. Charlie Kirk’s assassin inscribed a furry memeto bait newscastersinto reading it aloud, and friends of the Dallas ICE facility shooterdescribed him asan “edgelord” and speculated that he signed a bullet “anti-Ice” as an irony-poisoned provocation. Liberal encomiums to civil discourse can feel pious, but as shitposting stretches public decorum to breaking point, what remains is an incoherent politics of cruelty that licenses outrage for its own sake.Robert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of LondonExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsInternetTikTokDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Now that it has happened, Britain faces a choice between deeper division and greater toleranceThu 2 Oct 2025 13.33 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 15.59 EDTShareTheattackon the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregationsynagoguein Manchester was outrageous. It took two innocent lives, and several others were injured. Yet it could have happened almost anywhere. It is an event with wider national meaning and lessons. On Thursday morning, Britain looked over the edge into one of thedark placesto which modern public life has been heading. Having looked and seen, Britain now needs to learn and step back.The violence began around 9.30am, just as morning prayers were being held on Yom Kippur, Judaism’s most solemn and sacred day. The synagogue was inevitably well attended. Yet within a short period of time, two Jewish victims lay dead from stabbing, with four others injured, outside what ought to be a place of prayer and community. The attacker was then himself shot and killed, possibly as he attempted to get inside the building. He may have been armed with an explosive device.Not all the details have yet been established. The solemnity of Yom Kippur means some Jewish accounts have not yet been heard. Fuller facts will become clearer in the days to come. Greater Manchesterpoliceappear to have acted quickly, decisively and effectively. Synagogue security and worshippers played a brave part too – an example of a heroism that has often marked the public response.What is beyond dispute is this: it was the most lethal attack on a synagogue in this country in modern times. It was a wholly unprovoked act of antisemitic terror. It was, however, grimly foreseen and feared. It ought to be a wake-up call to the wider nation.The immediate task is to ensure that the Jewish community in every part of Britain is protected in every possible way from the danger of further attack. That duty goes beyond the security guards who are now part of routine Jewish community life, and even beyond the police, who have quickly been mobilised to guard other synagogues. Responsibility also rests with us all, as citizens. The prime minister was absolutely right to make this his business too, cutting short his engagements in Denmark and returning to head up the response. The safety of the community and of its individual members and families is a state responsibility.The Heaton Park attack is a new and shocking climax to a tide of antisemitic violence that has grown larger since the awful events of 7 October 2023. In the 12 months after the Hamas massacre, there were 5,583incidentsin the UK – including abusive behaviour, threats, assaults, damage and desecration – a 204% year-on-year increase. We are within days of the second anniversary now. The Middle East conflict has had terrible repercussions across the globe. The damage gets worse, not better. People of every faith and none feel angry, powerless and frightened. Yet there is nothing that can justify any part of what took place outside the synagogue.On Tuesday, less than 48 hours before the attacker arrived outside the synagogue,Sir Keir Starmertold the Labour conference that Britain has reached a fork in the road, where it faces a choice between division and decency. Political speeches are frequently banal and often overstated, but the prime minister’s words turn out to be more true than he could have known. The road to division lies right in front of us. But the road to decency is the one that we must take.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Crazy as it might seem, that is the message of Kemi Badenoch’snew energy strategy. The Conservative leader proposes to repeal the 2008Climate Change Actin favour of a plan to “maximise oil and gas extraction”, and remove all legally binding carbon targets. It’s pitched as pragmatism. But it’s a lurch into ideological self-harm.Britain’s energy problem isn’t its climate legislation, which is admired globally, backed byindustryandsupportedby the public. It’s that this country remains too dependent on volatile fossil fuels. Emissions targets are not the reason for high bills. It is gas prices, which skyrocketed after Russia invaded Ukraine. They set UKelectricityprices. InEurope, they don’t – that’s why bills are lower there. Rather, Mrs Badenoch is choosing to followDonald Trumpin rolling back climate goals and seeing electricity prices in the US rise, not fall.In Britain, she is mimicking Reform UK in a race to the populist bottom. It’s a culture war stunt – turning climate doubt into tribal identity. And it’s pathetic: a retreat from 17 years of Conservative climate leadership. The former Tory prime ministerTheresa Mayrightly condemned it. This isn’t pragmatism – it’s the abandonment of a successful industrial strategy, a gift to polluters and a blow to corporate confidence. It shatters a rare cross-party consensus that made Britain a global leader.Contrast that with Ed Miliband’s Labour party conference speech, delivered the day before Mrs Badenoch’s announcement. The energy secretary offered a full-throated defence of the green transition as both an economic necessity and a moral mission. He argued that clean energy is the foundation for a new economy – one built in the interests of working people, with unionised jobs, lower bills and public ownership. He named therightwing billionairesstanding in the way – notably Elon Musk – and cast Labour’s green agenda as a battle for the future against misinformation and oligarchic wealth.The most significant part of his speech wasn’t about energy at all. It was his rejection oftrickle-down economics and austerity, the twin failures behind decades of stagnation. By doing so, he used clean energy not just as climate policy but as a Trojan horse for a deeper transformation – a blueprint for a post-crash greener, fairer social democracy. Mr Miliband’s pitch went far beyond cautious technocracy. It was a story about whose interests the economy serves, and a subtle dig at Labour’s current orthodoxy on growth.The politics of transition are hard. Mr Miliband didn’t spell out in his speech how Labour would shoulder the costs of structural change, though on the conference fringes he worked hard to turn tensions withtrade unionsinto partnership. He still faces the pressure of high bills in a cost of living crisis. Building an affordable clean energy system must be the goal of the government – not just Mr Miliband. Mrs Badenoch’s absurd plan is anti-science and a reckless attempt at framing net zero as elitist. In an age of cynicism, cautious technocracy won’t win hearts.Mr Miliband offered conviction and hope. Speeches can inspire, but it is delivery that keeps people onside. That is Mr Miliband’s test – and Britain can’t afford for him to fail.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromPeter RiddleandPaul KaneThu 2 Oct 2025 12.54 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 16.42 EDTShareJohn Harris’s visit to Kent exposed the contrast between aspirational new housing and the plight of asylum seekers living a frugal life in disused barracks (On a trip to Kent, I saw how politics is being shaped by the west’s growing hostility to outsiders, 28 September).The article suggests that politics is being reshaped by hostility to outsiders, but does not address how this is being deliberately driven by the Reform UK-led council.AtKentcounty council, very little is happening to address the inequality and poor public services witnessed by Harris, which makes it easy for Reform to blame immigration.Over the border in Medway, we hear much about what Kent county council is not going to do while it dismantles the hard work of council officers under the guise of “saving money”, with turbocharged rhetoric in praise of Reform’s hateful policy ideas that disregard the ravages of austerity, which has left all councils with no money to save.In neighbouring Medway council, we have the unenviable task of trying to maintain a working partnership with Kent on the issues that actually matter – such as improving health services and managing huge demand for adult social care and special educational needs – with inexperienced politicians whose behaviour is unpredictable and who, after six months in power, have achieved little more than a catalogue of moaning and empty threats.I went to theFaversham protestlast month to defend the rights of children seeking asylum, where supporters outnumbered the ragged crew wrapped in flags shouting insults and abuse, and allowing a 10-year-old with a drum to front their protest.The poverty and social exclusion that breeds contempt for others has been permitted as a consequence of austerity and is now being used by Reform to create division. But rather than pandering to racism, we should face up to our problems, roll up our sleeves and recapture the determination and fairness that has made Britain great before and will again.Cllr Teresa MurrayDeputy leader of Medway councilI read John Harris’s account of his visit to Folkestone while I was on a family get-together near the seaside town. I noticed that the local parish council’s minutes were pinned on a nearby noticeboard and reported that when local council workers had tried to take down flags from lamp-posts and remove the red and white crosses painted on council property, they had been abused and threatened, and had to withdraw for their own safety.Some members of my family have lived in Folkestone for decades and watched the gradual degradation of the quality of their day-to-day life, characterised by increasing street begging and rough sleepers, the deterioration of the town centre and difficulty in accessing local essential services such as health and housing.They live with a general sense of despair and unease, as do many people in towns across England. For reasons of maintaining our own social cohesion, my family have learned to avoid discussing politics, but I am sure that, as avid readers of the Daily Mail, several of them would have voted forReform UKin the local election.The strident rabble-rousing voices of Nigel Farage and his henchmen will only begin to evaporate when people can see that Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, Shabana Mahmood and the rest of theLabourleadership have made significant and perceptible improvements to those essential services and to the communities in which people live.Peter RiddleWirksworth, DerbyshireJohn Harris expresses a sadness that many of us share as the attitudes of many in Kent turn increasingly nationalist, and as we begin to see the effects of Reform UK at a county level, with such absurdities asclimate change denialsubstituting for real policy. But some flags in Faversham and Folkestone are not all of Kent.Surprisingly, perhaps, Tunbridge Wells is now represented byMike Martin, a Liberal Democrat, and a once “true blue” borough is nowmajority Lib Dem. I was, for several years, a volunteer for Kent Kindness, a charity providing language teaching to young asylum seekers in two centres in Kent. We did a great job and had lots of local support. Sadly, our services have now been cancelled by Kent county council.We need to understand, but also challenge, the falsehoods that are becoming all too dominant – and that isn’t by trying to out-Reform Reform.Paul KaneGoudhurst, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In my varied community roles, I support many people in our community who have neither – they have never had the opportunity to learn to drive or to travel beyond our borders, normally due to a low income and lack of opportunity. In the past, this lack of documents was not an issue – passports were for travel and a driving licence to prove your ability to drive – but now they are used to log on to the Government Gateway website used for many services including the state pension and child benefit.While there is supposed to be a route to log on without a driving licence or passport, no one in our very skilled team of community support workers has mastered it – and we don’t give up easily! One low-income parent we met needs to change the bank account that her child benefit is paid into, another wants to check their contributions towards the state pension – both require access to the Government Gateway, not a car or foreign travel. Both the real people in these examples (and I could find plenty of others) have a smartphone and share their personal data with Google every day. Neither possess a passport or a driving licence.Digital ID may not be the perfect answer, but the current system isn’t perfect either. There is a need for ID that encompasses everyone.Sandra ColemanChipping Norton, OxfordshireExplore more on these topicsIdentity cardsPovertySocial exclusionlettersShareReuse this content"

The point about non-urgent GP appointments is that they do not need triage – if a patient wants to see a primary care clinician for a routine concern, they can do so, whatever the issue.The number of routine slots available remains the same, and allowing people to book them online will reduce, not increase, workload by freeing up reception staff for other admin tasks, and making it easier to get through on the phone for urgent appointments. It’s urgent requests, not routine ones, that need triage.The big problem in primary care is the mismatch between demand and capacity, not how appointments are booked.Healthpolicy interventions by the government that make sense are an extremely rare thing. This is one of them.Martin GiebnerAdvanced nurse practitioner, Duns, Scottish BordersI have no fears of online GP appointment booking via triage as my practice adopted it a while ago. The practice graduated from a telephone “care navigator” system, which worked well, to the current online method. Via both routes, my experience has been exceptional, with responses sometimes within 90 minutes, and directions to attend the same day to see a GP or advanced practitioner, to receive a prescription at my local pharmacy, or to get advice via text or telephone. Initial access by phone still exists for those unable to use the new method.The online system creates better-targeted appointments, which surely means that an appropriate number of doctors can be reallocated to service the triage system. The use of emotive language by the British Medical Association such as “tsunami” and “barrage” in anticipating the effect of online booking is not helpful or accurate.

As Midtjylland streamed forward on the counterattack in the 88th minute, theNottingham Forestmanager rested his hands on his head, convinced how the next few seconds would play out. Forest, as he feared, would concede for a third time but, presumably, he did not anticipate the vociferous and vicious backlash that followed.The scenes were close to extraordinary on a sobering evening, thousands of home supporters singing: “You’re getting sacked in the morning.” Then the same fans twisted the knife a little deeper, singing the name of his predecessor Nuno Espírito Santo, with several turning towards Evangelos Marinakis, the owner watching on with his own giant private television in the directors’ box. This made for grim viewing.Nottingham Forest 2-3 Midtjylland, Feyenoord 0-2 Aston Villa, and more: Europa League – liveRead moreIt is now six games without victory for Postecoglou, whose side travel to Newcastle on Sunday before hosting Chelsea two weeks on Saturday. Then it is Porto at home in this competition, Bournemouth away and Manchester United to kick-off November. After this defeat by Danish opposition, there are doubts about whether the Australian will make it that far. The inquest in the stands began at half-time, at which point Forest trailed to set-piece goals from Ousmane Diao and Mads Bech Sørensen, formerly of Brentford, and afterwards Postecoglou faced some tough questions.Asked if he still believed positive results are on the horizon, the 60-year-old replied: “Yes, I do, and nothing I saw tonight changes any of that. I get the mood around the place isn’t going to be great, I understand people’s attitude, particularly towards me, but I never worry about that, it’s not unfamiliar territory for me. I really believe that we’re on the right track and when we get through this period of uncertainty that we’ll be on a good path. If we start winning games, the atmosphere will improve.”A week on from the optimism that accompanied Forest’s trip to Seville, where they were held to a draw against Real Betis after squandering the lead late on, the mood has shifted significantly. “I guess it’s the accumulation of things,” Postecoglou said. “It’s not like our goalkeeper is having to make multiple saves, but every time they get near our goal they [the players] get really nervous. If you allow the opposition to score just about every time they get near your goal, it’s going to be very hard to win games.”View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou during Forest’s 3-2 defeat by Midtjylland. Fans chanted “You’re getting sacked in the morning” near the end.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoPostecoglou is the first Forest manager for 100 years to fail to win any of his first six matches, though perhaps he will take encouragement that John Baynes, who did not win any of his first seven in 1925, ended up sticking around for four years. These are different days, though, as Postecoglou acknowledged. “Nothing surprises me in football, it’s the climate we’re in,” he said, when asked about the chants aimed at him. “It seems that’s the way things are going. It’s nothing I can control. The fans are disappointed, they are allowed to have an opinion on it. I heard their opinion.”Postecoglou insisted his players did their homework and knew to expect an awkward assignment but the visitors’ direct “vertical football” proved Forest’s undoing,Midtjyllandtwice scoring from set pieces before Valdemar Byskov Andreasen capped the scoring after Dario Osorio pinched possession from Callum Hudson-Odoi deep in the Danish side’s half. Chris Wood’s stoppage-time penalty after Elliot Anderson, Forest’s best player, was fouled proved merely a consolation.Postecoglou’s Tottenham were vulnerable from set pieces last season – only Arsenal, Southampton and Wolves conceded more from set plays in the Premier League – and it was a recurring problem here. Things got worse when Murillo, back in the starting lineup after injury, limped off before the half-hour mark. There was further alarm for Forest in the first half when Diao comfortably peeled off his man at another corner and directed a header wide of goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At which point Midtjylland had not even been formed, that coming three years later when Herning, the 55,000-population town in central Denmark where they play home games, and Ikast, where they now train, merged. Marinakis, the night after watching his first club, Olympiakos, fall to a Champions League defeat at the Emirates Stadium, sauntered on to the pitch before the warmups to survey the scene.Everything was in place for the occasion: the pyrotechnics as the players emerged, the Europa League-branded tunnel arch and a sellout crowd. The tifo in the Trent End was typically brilliant, an image of a Forest campervan with Postecoglou at the wheel and the words: “For a new generation our time has come”. Everything was primed for Postecoglou to register that elusive first win. Perhaps Forest were guilty of viewing this game as a gimme.

Goals from Daniel Muñoz and the substitute Eddie Nketiah ensured Oliver Glasner’s side marked their first appearance in the main phase of a European competition with a comfortable ­victory over Dynamo Kyiv despite a late red card for Borna Sosa.It was the perfect reward for the 3,500 supporters who had made the pilgrimage from south London to southern Poland as Palace made it 19 games unbeaten in all competitions to establish a new club record that dates back more than 50 years.Against opponents who have enjoyed plenty of famous European nights in their storied history but are no longer the same force of old due to the ongoing war with Russia, there was only ever going to be one winner as Glasner’s side showed they are well equipped to go all the way to the final in Leipzig despite their inexperience at this level.Nottingham Forest v Midtjylland, Feyenoord v Aston Villa, and more: Europa League – liveRead more“I’m proud that we could start theConference Leaguewith a win, away, against very good opposition,” said Glasner. “I don’t think about this run, because this already happened, so for me, it’s important what comes next. And next comes Everton and a new stadium. Really looking forward to this game, great atmosphere, great stadium.”He may have played it down but you have to go all the way back to 1969 for the last time Palace managed to go undefeated for 18 games under their former manager Bert Head when they achieved promotion to the old First Division for the first time in their ­history. These days, the south ­Londoners are an established force in the Premier League and came into this match brimming with ­confidence after their superb performance in the win over Liverpool on Saturday ­courtesy of Nketiah’s late winner.Glasner’s opposite number ­Oleksandr Shovkovskyi rested half of his first-choice side for their league game at the weekend and the veteran former West Ham forward Andriy ­Yarmolenko was one of those recalled. Kyiv’s players emerged from the tunnel before kick-off with Ukrainian flags draped over their shoulders, with a similar number of home supporters in attendance at a ground that is 400 miles from their home.In a competition that they have started as the bookmakers’ favourites, Palace are likely to face a different challenge of having to break teams down rather than hitting them on the break. Aside from a ­dangerous cross from Yeremy Pino that ­Jean-Philippe Mateta just failed to make ­contact with in the 11th minute as he ­celebrated his first call-up to France’s senior squad, they ­struggled to ­create anything meaningful against a ­determined Kyiv defence.Maxence Lacroix required ­treatment after clashing heads with Taras Mykhavko midway through the first half, with the Kyiv defender ­having to be withdrawn after attempting to come back on. He left the pitch looking distinctly groggy.View image in fullscreenDaniel Muñoz scores the opening goal, to spark celebrations from Palace supporters.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockThe Ukrainian champions did not even manage to replace him before they found themselves trailing. Pino found space down the left flank and drilled a cross to the back post, with Muñoz rising to somehow loop his header into the far corner. The Palace fans behind the goal could not contain their delight and responded to a subsequent request from the stadium announcer to only show “positive emotions” by ­launching into a loud chorus of ­anti-Uefa chants.Sosa had a golden opportunity to double their lead just before half-time but Ruslan Neshcheret was equal to his volley from Muñoz’s cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was forced into another change when Will Hughes went down a few minutes after the restart. ­Nketiah had the ball in the net after being set up by Adam Wharton, only for it to be ruled out for offside. But he did not have to wait long for another chance when Pino wriggled free down the left and the former Arsenal striker volleyed in his cross.Nketiah nearly scored again with a speculative shot from distance that was almost spilled into his own net by Neshcheret as Palace continued to dominate.Sosa’s decision to launch into a tackle on Oleksandr Tymchyk and earn himself a ­second yellow card three minutes after being shown his first could have put a dampener on Palace’s perfect day. But such is the quality of their defence these days that Palace never looked like ­conceding as they kicked off their Conference League ­campaign in style.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueDynamo KyivCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

But the German referee, Tobias Stieler, disallowed the goal and the video assistant Christian Dingert stuck with the decision, despite no handball being evident on television replays.Iheanacho capitalised on a loose pass from a free-kick to charge down a scrambled clearance from the former Celtic defender Gustaf Lagerbielke before slotting home.

Fulham visit the Vitality on Friday, offering Andoni Iraola’s side a presentable chance of recapturing winning ways and going second in the table. After a turbulent summer, Iraola has sought consistency in his team selection. Trailing 2-1 at Leeds, theBournemouthmanager made a triple change to restore three usual starters – David Brooks, Alex Scott and Marcus Tavernier – to his XI and was rewarded with a late leveller. Bournemouth have also maintained defensive stability, conceding just once in four games between the trips to Liverpool and Leeds. Marcos Senesi, often playing in an otherwise brand-new back five, has been key to the team’s continuity. The centre-back earned praise from Iraola for his defensive work and threat at attacking set-pieces – as evidenced by his headed assist for Eli Junior Kroupi’s equaliser at Elland Road.Niall McVeighBournemouth vFulham, Friday 8pm (all times BST)Longstaff key to Leeds’ set-piece threatIf Leeds are to survive and maybe even thrive this season they will need to continue taking mean dead balls. Three of the six league goals Daniel Farke’s side have scored since returning to the top tier have derived from set pieces and they could do with further examples – or at least an example – arriving at Tottenham’s expense at Elland Road on Saturday. Farke has deployed Sean Longstaff as his principal corner taker and, so far, the former Newcastle midfielder is proving highly adept and crucially consistent at the art. This reassignment of on-field duties has also liberated his fellow midfielder Anton Stach to get into the penalty area at set plays and hurl his towering frame at the ball. Back on Tyneside, Longstaff also possessed a knack for making late, almost Frank Lampardesque dashes into the box and scored a few goals from open play. Now Farke could do with rekindling that instinct in a player who lost his way a little at St James’ Park last season but is looking encouragingly renascent.Louise TaylorLeeds v Tottenham, Saturday12.30pmBlack Cats could spell trouble for AmorimWith a trip to Anfield looming after the international break, a home game against promoted opponents is, in theory, an opportunity for Ruben Amorim to lift the suffocating gloom aroundManchester United. In reality, it could be another very difficult afternoon at Old Trafford against an impressive Sunderland side with two core attributes their hosts are sorely lacking: identity and adaptability. Asked how he has been able to build such a cohesive unit from a long list of summer signings, Régis Le Bris, the Sunderland manager, said: “The new lads bring a new energy and style of play … [but] we don’t start from scratch – the identity of the club is already there.” While Amorim remains mired in his own stubborn inflexibility, Le Bris has shown he is willing to adapt. Heading into last season’s Championship playoffs on the back of five straight defeats, he switched to a more reactive style and built the foundation for success in the Premier League. All of this has been achieved while Amorim has essentially taken his United team nowhere, and few would be truly shocked if Sunderland were to push him closer to the exit door this weekend.NMcManchester United vSunderland, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenRuben Amorim is under intense pressure before another tricky fixture for his struggling team.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockArsenal can move on from Hammers defeatsAfter ending their hoodoosaway at Newcastleand at home to Olympiakos in the last two games, next up for Arsenal is a chance to banish memories of two successive defeats to West Ham at the Emirates. Both ended up damaging their hopes of winning the Premier League, withthe 1-0 reverse in Februaryone of the few occasions when Graham Potter had something to celebrate during his ill-fated spell in charge of the Hammers. A promising draw in his first match against Everton will have helped Nuno Espírito Santo settle into his new surroundings and the former Nottingham Forest manager will be keen to build on that on Saturday, having not tasted success against Arsenal since he was in charge of Wolves in 2021.Ed AaronsArsenal v West Ham, Saturday 3pmMaresca may look to Lavia against LiverpoolRoméo Lavia was excellent whenChelsea beat Liverpoolat Stamford Bridge in May. The Belgium midfielder offers elegance on the ball and a fine ability to beat the press. But while he often makes Enzo Maresca’s system look smoother, Lavia’s fitness record remains a problem. The former Southampton midfielder was injured when Chelsea beat Benfica in the last 16 of the Club World Cup in June and has only just returned. Ideally Maresca would be able to ease Lavia back in and give him time to build his fitness. Chelsea, though, are struggling with injuries. Andrey Santos and Dário Essugo will be missing when Maresca’s side host Liverpool on Saturday, heaping the pressure on Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in midfield. Options to rotate are slim. Caicedo and Fernández could do with a rest but are both playing through niggles. It is probably too soon for Lavia to start – he has only made one brief substitute appearance this season – but he will be a useful option on the bench.Jacob SteinbergChelsea vLiverpool, Saturday 5.30pmLack of in-form forwards a problem for MoyesDavid Moyes was particularly touchy on the subject of his struggling strikers when the trials of Beto and Thierno Barry cropped up before West Ham’s visit. “I’m not daft enough to think everything is going to be hunky dory,” he said. “We are still rebuilding.” That is true, but his mood will not have improved after another anonymous showing from the pair in Monday’sdisappointing draw. There are echoes of Moyes’s first spell in charge of Everton at present with a good unit lacking the high-calibre striker necessary to make a difference. Creativity is not a problem for a team with Jack Grealish, Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall but, aside from a crucial purple patch of five goals in four league games in February, Beto has not convinced. His recent body language has not impressed either. Everton felt Barry was one for the future when paying £27m for the 22-year-old this summer but would have expected more from a forward who is yet to open his account. In-form Crystal Palace, aiming to set a new club record of 19 matches unbeaten in all competitions, can prey on Everton’s glaring weakness.Andy HunterEverton vCrystal Palace, Sunday 2pmskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are these teams really capable of juggling their domestic and European commitments? Tactically speaking, is Ange Postecoglou going about silencing his critics in the right way? Will Forest’s Chris Wood score against his old club? Or might Eddie Howe’s star signing, Nick Woltemade, win the battle of the centre-forwards? Could this be the match where Newcastle’s £55m summer signing from Forest, Anthony Elanga, really comes alive down the right wing? There are so many unanswered questions and the responses will determine whether Howe or Postecoglou will need to brace themselves for “crisis” headlines. Both managers, like their teams, desperately need a restorative win.LTNewcastle vNottingham Forest, Sunday 2pmPereira needs Wolves’ recruits to show worth“You sold the team, now sell the club.” Wolves fans could not have been clearer about their feelings during therecent defeat by promoted Leedsat Molineux. There are a couple of things for Vítor Pereira to cling to, though, despite the obvious weakening of his squad byhigh-profile summer departures:a point against Tottenhamthat could so easily have been three and the Carabao Cup win over Everton that was a step towards placating growing anger in the stands. Despite João Palhinha’s stoppage-time equaliser in north London, Pereira pointed to the “spirit” of his players and his old-school methods, includingbonding trips to the boozer, appear to be keeping the dressing-room mood upbeat. Pereira’s preferred tipple is Stella Artois but, with a relegation scrap looming, it remains to be seen whether any of his summer reinforcements prove to be reassuringly expensive.Luke McLaughlinWolves v Brighton, Sunday 2pmEmery has Villa pointing in right directionIf succeeding Arsène Wenger was an impossible job for Unai Emery at Arsenal, stepping into Steven Gerrard’s shoes at Villa Park was considerably easier. “I’m not here to waste my time” – Emery’sinternal mission statementon arrival in 2022 – was one of the more memorable lines from a Premier League manager in recent times. Villa’s improvement since is attributable to appointing a smart tactician and capable motivator whose managerial career path has been an unusual mix. A flat start this season has been the first significant bump in the road during his Villa tenure and the mood has been downbeat; still, Emery’s side were undefeated in 90 minutes across five matches in September, finishing with wins against Bologna and Fulham. Form is a funny thing – just ask Morgan Rogers. But after another encouraging win against Feyenoord, Emery’s solid methods and self-belief are likely to steer Villa through a challenging time.LMcAston Villa v Burnley, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenAston Villa have shown tentative signs of progress after a difficult start to the campaign.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersFoden can ease burden on HaalandAfter six league games Manchester City’s second-highest scorer is Maxime Estevé, the unfortunate Burnley centre-back who notched two own goals at the Etihad last Saturday. It’s not a huge problem with Erling Haaland in such ruthless form having scored 11 goals in all competitions and eight in the league, double any other player’s tally and more than 11 of the 19 other top-flight teams. There was, though, a hint of frustration in Haaland’s post-match interview after defensive lapses cancelled out his two goals in Monaco. “Not good enough,” was his concise verdict on City’s overall display, and Brentford’s set-piece muscle will surely test the visitors’ soft centre again on Sunday. If City cannot keep clean sheets, Haaland will need more help from his attacking teammates. Phil Foden certainly has form at the Gtech, having scored every one of City’s six goals at the venue since 2021. If Foden can add firepower to his improved form, Pep Guardiola’s side might begin to look truly formidable again.NMcBrentford v Manchester City, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool65152Arsenal69133Crystal Palace65124Tottenham Hotspur67115Sunderland63116AFC Bournemouth61117Man City68108Chelsea6389Everton61810Brighton60811Fulham6-1812Leeds6-3813Brentford6-2714Man Utd6-4715Newcastle6-1616Aston Villa6-2617Nottm Forest6-5518Burnley6-7419West Ham6-8420Wolverhampton6-91Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolArsenalCrystal PalaceTottenham HotspurSunderlandBournemouthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A stray boot to the face inside 10 minutes made for a bloody nose and a rude awakening on hissecond Saracens debut against Newcastle, 17 years after his first. Farrell soldiered on to the hour mark, helping Saracens to a bonus-point victory before an early train home on Saturday morning. It was Sunday that left him “emotionally drained”, however.Farrell was glued to Europe’s Ryder Cup triumph, watching Luke Donald’s side so nearly snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The 34-year-old is a keen golfer – he took the phone call from his father, Andy, to join the British & Irish Lions tour in July in a clubhouse – and played alongside Donald at last month’s PGA Championship Pro-Am at Wentworth.Newcastle Red Bulls axe Steve Diamond after just one game as new ownersRead moreIn the buildup to Europe’s victory, Donald suggested he had spoken to Farrell about dealing with hostile crowds – no doubt aware of what was coming at Bethpage. Farrell insists the conversation was brief and limited to forging a team environment. Clearly he is being modest, not least because teammates, particularly those on the Lions tour this summer, hang on his every word. There are similarities too between putting a Ryder Cup team together and gelling as a Lions squad.When it is put to Farrell that Donald had turned to him for advice, he says: “I’ll take it. To get to spend a bit of time with him before that event was cool. We talked about stuff to do with a team and he asked a few questions about what I’d seen over the years around teams and bringing them together and creating an identity. It wasn’t a long chat, I was trying to get some advice about how not to shank the ball.“He was unbelievably level, very calm, so I can only imagine that stood out for the lads when they were out there, because the Ryder Cup seemed like chaos at times. I was knackered, emotionally drained by the end. It almost seemed inevitable on the last day but momentum can swing big time.”Back at Saracens’ St Albans training base, Farrell is focused on forging another team identity. Mark McCall has spoken of how his side are into their second season of a new project after finishing sixth last term – Farrell’s sole year at Racing 92. Now he brings a fresh set of eyes but an old head and renewed enthusiasm, watching youngsters like Noah Caluori, who scored a stunning try on debut against Newcastle, make their mark.It is approaching four months since Farrell’s return was confirmed, his unveiling at StoneX met with widespread intrigue over his international future. Farrell was non-committal, insisting he just wanted to enjoy his rugby again, but in hindsight his late secondment to Australia with the Lions was inevitable. He relished being back at the sharp end, appearing in the second Test victory at the MCG as well as the dead rubber in Sydney.View image in fullscreenOwen Farrell put in a strong performance for Sacracens to beat a rejuvenated Newcastle Red Bulls.Photograph: Bruce White/Colorsport/ShutterstockBut did a return to Test action move the dial with regard to his England ambitions? He was omitted from a mini-training camp before the start of the season but there would appear to be a place if he wants to pursue it, particularly at inside-centre where he started last weekend – the first time he had done so for Saracens in a decade – and appeared for the Lions. He has even bulked up a touch in preparation for spending more time in midfield.“[I’m] still in the same place,” he says. “I want to make sure I’m loving what I’m doing here. I want to make the most out of that and see where we’re at. I’m very wary of talking about it, you’ve got to play well as well. But I’m determined to make the most out of my time here and see where that takes me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We had a great balance to us. [The MCG] was great. Messing about playing cricket on there the day before, I don’t think that happens too much. An iconic stadium to win a game, like we did in that fashion, and then the celebrations after, being sat on the field sharing a beer together was pretty special.” Of his four tours, was it his favourite? “It was a pretty cool one, yeah.”The smart money is on Farrell adding to his 112 England caps at some point this season. It may not be in the autumn but as is often the case with Farrell, it is what he does not say that feels most telling. His Lions experience does not sound like it was one last international hurrah and it is hard to see Steve Borthwick wasting any time in adding someone of his standing should he find form to justify inclusion. This England squad is not overflowing with voices of authority.Farrell, for his part, is happy enough with his current form and fitness. Unlike most other Lions players he was allowed to appear last weekend because he had such an interrupted year in France with groin and head injuries. His pre-season was short but Farrell believes his injury problems are behind him.“I’ve still got some work to do but ticking away in the background rather than it being the main focus to make sure I keep improving after a tough year last year,” he adds. “I’m clear on what I need to do.”Explore more on these topicsOwen FarrellSaracensEngland rugby union teamRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the competition was spirited – especially with the US team’s rally on Sunday afternoon – some fan behavior clearly crossed the line,” Don Rea Jr wrote in an email to PGA of America members. “It was disrespectful, inappropriate, and not representative of who we are as the PGA of America or as PGA of America golf professionals. We condemn that behavior unequivocally.”During last week’s tournament, Europe’s playerswere subjected to vitriolic abuse. An MC at the event resigned after she led chants of “Fuck you, Rory” aimed at Rory McIlroy, the crowd hurled homophobic slurs at golfers and players’ wives were insulted. McIlroy said his wife, Erica,was hit by a beerthat was thrown during Saturday afternoon’s play.Europe won the Ryder Cup on Sundayafter completing a 15-13 victory.US fan ugliness at the Ryder Cup was merely a reflection of Trump’s all-caps America | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreHowever, in a BBC interview on Sunday morning, Rea seemed to minimise the abuse. “You’ve got 50,000 people here that are really excited, and heck, you could go to a youth soccer game and get some people who say the wrong things,” he said. He went on to say the behavior was distracting American players because they had to spend energy helping to control the crowd.The abuse was such that McIlroy began pushing back, telling one spectator to “shut the fuck up” during a foursomes match on Saturday morning.Rea also said during his BBC interview when asked about the abuse hurled toward McIlroy, “I haven’t heard some of that. I’m sure it happened. It happens when we’re over in Rome on the other side, and Rory understands. Things like that are going to happen.”Europe’s Matt Fitzpatrick said about the Rome reference, “It’s pretty offensive to European fans the fact that he said that, really.” Lowry said the level of abuse directed at McIlroy’s wife was “astonishing.”Derek Sprague, the CEO at the PGA of America, said on Tuesday that spectators crossed the line and that he planned to apologize personally to Rory McIlroy and Erica McIlroy, who formerly worked at the PGA.“Rory might have been a target because of how good he is, but the entire European team should not have been subjected to that,” Sprague said on theGolfChannel. “I feel badly and I plan on apologizing to them.”Rea also took heat for an awkward trophy presentation on Sunday in which he mentioned Europe had retained the cup, instead of winning it.On Tuesday, on his LinkedIn page, Rea wrote: “I’m personally taking some criticism right now and that comes with the role and just like when I was an umpire I expect it. However to the students and PGA members that follow me, know this, I am not bothered.”In Thursday’s letter, Rea was more contrite. “What makes our sport great is that we own our bogeys. We certainly own this one,” Rea wrote. “Our CEO Derek Sprague has apologized on our behalf to Erica and Rory McIlroy and to everyone with Ryder Cup Europe. I would also like to personally apologize to them and all of you for not representing our association in the best light with some of my comments in the media during the event.“While it wasn’t my intention, some of my comments were seen in a negative light which reflects poorly on not only myself but also on the PGA of America and for that I truly apologize.”He ended the email, “God Bless and as always Go USA!”The PGA of America announced in 2013 it would bring the Ryder Cup to Bethpage Black, the public golf course on Long Island that had a reputation for its raw comments directed at players. Ted Bishop was the PGA president and Pete Bevacqua was the CEO at the time of the announcement.Bishop was forced out as president in 2014 with a month left on his two-year term for a social media post when he angrily referred to Ian Poulter as a “lil girl.”Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Then they brought a couple of upgrades and that has put them on the same level.“In Baku we had the car to win and we didn’t. At the round before in Monza they were too quick for us and if there are some races coming up where he is too fast, which is very possible, because I expect them to be quick for many of the races this season …”McLaren have been fair so far in allowing their drivers to race and their team principal, Andrea Stella, has maintained that would remain so unless they had to favour one driver in order toguarantee the drivers’ championship, which would be their first since Lewis Hamilton’s in 2008.Norris, however, dismissed concerns about team orders with disdain. “I’m very concerned, yeah,” he said sarcastically. “Very worried about it and scared, frankly. I was happy you asked that … Actually, No.”With ambient temperatures forecasted to reach 31C over the weekend and humidity at more than 70%, the Marina Bay circuit has been declared a “heat hazard” by race director, Rui Marques, under new rules instigated this year.As a result all teams will have to fit systems which allow drivers to wear cooling vests in the cockpit. The vests, which comprise a series of tubes that let a coolant flow around the upper body, are not mandatory, with some drivers finding them uncomfortable.Those who opt not to wear them will have to take on 0.5kg of ballast to ensure weight parity across the grid. Singapore has repeatedly been the longest race of the season, often running to the two-hour maximum and represents a singular challenge. The track’s 19 corners are interrupted only sparsely by small straights, with drivers enduring forces of up to 5G, combined with a punishing, relentless series of braking zones. Amid which temperatures in the cockpit can rise to over 50C.“The [vest] concept is good and when you’re racing in 90% humidity and the cockpits are getting on for 60C, it’s a bit of a sauna inside the car, so I think we all welcome it,” said George Russell, who is a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLando NorrisMax VerstappenMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

That sentence alone tells you how exceptional they are, and whichever way you frame the statistics they are daunting. How about “Sonia Bompastor is yet to lose a WSL game after 15 months in charge”, “The Frenchwoman has won 23 of her 26 WSL games without defeat” or “Bompastor is unbeaten in 34 domestic matches since moving to England”? All are true, all sound formidable, and – after four wins from four this term – they are showing no signs of letting up.Who will bring this run to a halt? Eventually, Chelsea will lose a WSL match. It might not be this week, it might not be in 2025, it might not even be this season. Maybe it won’t even be during this parliament, but one day it will happen, and logic suggests that the fixtures where their streak has the highest probability of ending is in one of their away games against their main title rivals, Arsenal, Manchester City or Manchester United. On Friday, the latter of that trio will have their turn, and form-wise they have rarely been better placed to have a go at it.Emma Hayes: ‘I don’t think coaches are always thought about as human beings’Read moreThe top two teams in the early-season table go head to head in Leigh under the lights and, although the WSL season is only four rounds of fixtures old, Manchester United go into Friday’s fixture with the best defensive record in the league. History favours Chelsea though, because the most damning stat of all is perhaps this: Manchester United have never beaten Chelsea in the WSL.In fact they have managed only one draw from their 11 previous WSL meetings. Nevertheless, the home team’s manager, Marc Skinner, wants his team to believe. “It’s by far the most difficult challenge in the WSL right now, of course it is,” Skinner said. “We want to try to break that run when we play them on Friday but it’s difficult.“They’re such a well-oiled machine. They have incredible quality, depth and quality, that they’ve built over many seasons. I expect the toughest of challenges on Friday and we’ve got to be ready.“I really think you can hurt Chelsea with the ball, but you’ve got to be brave in doing that, because it’s higher risk because they’re really good in duels. You have to believe that you can beat them, you have to show Chelsea that you can beat them.”For Bompastor, who oversaw a domestic treble of major trophies last term in her first season in English football, the statistics mean very little. “This story about the unbeaten run is more for the journalists,” she said. “We started this season from zero, we won four games out of four, and we want to go into every game with the desire to win. We are early in the season, we did not achieve anything yet.”View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Melvine Malard (right) has four WSL goals already this season.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAThe former Lyon coach has fond memories of visiting Leigh, because it was where her teamclinched last season’s title on 30 April, with a 1-0 win courtesy of a Lucy Bronze header. This time they face a Manchester United side who have conceded only one goal in four league games and Bompastor said: “United look strong and they’ve had a good start to the season.“In these games, it’s always tough. Maybe you create [fewer] chances than in some of the games and you need to make sure you are clinical and efficient. I think that’s what makes the difference in the highest-level games.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In possession, we have been working hard with her, trying for her to be as successful as she can be in many aspects of her game. Right now, she is really confident [and] that’s great for the team.”It is a cliche in football that the “first goal will be crucial” but it seems especially true here; Manchester United are unbeaten in each of the past 25 WSL games in which they have taken the lead. If they can finally end their wait for a first win against Chelsea, it would be the first major twist in the WSL title race.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester United WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it meant just as much to me, and I shared that with the players last night.”Edwards’s predecessor, Jon Lewis, oversaw a succession of failures on the global stage, including beingknocked out in the group stagesof the T20 World Cup last October. However Edwards was keen to highlight the improvements in fitness and culture sinceshe took charge in April.“With this group now we’ve created an environment where it’s about taking accountability,” she said. “We’ve got real clarity on how we want to play the game, and hopefully that clarity is going to help this team under pressure.“We’re in a good place physically – we’ve made some real shifts. The signs have been really strong so far in terms of the development I’ve seen in the last six months. I’m just hoping we can take that now on to the big stage.”The job of selecting an XI will be made easier by the expectation that the captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, will bowl her full allocation of 10 overs, allowing England the luxury of selecting seven batters against South Africa. “She’s been one of the most successful bowlers in the WPL in the past few years so we’re hoping to continue that form in 50-over cricket,” Edwards said.England’s top order is stacked with experience, with Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont set to open the batting and Heather Knight at No 3. Knight injured her hamstring against West Indies in May and faced a race against time to be match-ready for this tournament, opting for time in a hyperbaric chamber over surgery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s great to have her back in that No 3 spot for us. The experience she brings to our group, on and off the field, is so valuable.”There is less certainty around the middle order, with Alice Capsey and Emma Lamb – who top-scored with 88 not out and 60 respectively in England’s warmup against Australia on Sunday – potentially fighting it out for a spot. England beat the reigning champions by four wickets, which Edwards said had given her side confidence before Friday’s game. “Our middle order showed some real maturity,” she added.That the leg-spinner Sarah Glenn took five wickets in that match has also delivered something of a selection headache. Given the turning wicket in Guwahati, England are likely to play three spinners, but it remains to be seen whether Glenn can edge out one of the established trio of Sophie Ecclestone, Linsey Smith and Charlie Dean.For now, Edwards is hedging her bets. “We’ve got to be really adaptable in this tournament,” she said. “Everyone will be prepared to play on Friday.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupEngland women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Vought has threatened to use the shutdown to conduct further layoffs of federal workers, and on Wednesday announced the cancellation of billions of dollars in federal funding for projects tied to Democrats.About $18bn was frozen for infrastructure projects in and around New York City over “unconstitutional DEI principles”, Vought said, referring to the diversity, equity, and inclusion policies that Trump has sought to stamp out from the federal government. The projects for which money was held include the Second Avenue subway line in Manhattan and the Hudson River tunnel project connecting the city to New Jersey.The cancellations sparked a furious reaction from Chuck Schumer andHakeem Jeffries, the top Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, both of whom are New Yorkers.“Donald Trump is once again treating working people as collateral damage in his endless campaign of chaos and revenge,” they said in a joint statement.Vought also announced that around $8bn in funds for 16 states – all of which are run by Democrats – was put on hold. Vought did not specify the projects, but called it “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda”.The Democratic senator Adam Schiff, who represents California, one of the states for which funding was slashed, responded: “Our democracy is badly broken when a president can illegally suspend projects for Blue states in order to punish his political enemies. They continue to break the law, and expect us to go along. Hell no.”Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator representing Oregon, another state that lost funding, said: “Ripping funding away from only blue states will raise utility bills for EVERYONE. It’s not rocket science. Vought is unfit to serve in this or any administration.”At the White House on Wednesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned that “layoffs are imminent”, but gave no further details. That’s a shift from past shutdowns, when federal workers were furloughed or told to work unpaid, with back pay coming once funding is restored.Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, on X replied: “If the president fires a bunch of people, it’s not because of his shutdown–it’s because HE decided to fire them. People aren’t negotiating tools & it’s sick that the president is treating federal workers like pawns.”SomeRepublicanssignaled they were uncomfortable with using a shutdown as an opportunity to further slash the federal workforce, which has already lost hundreds of thousands of workers through firings and buyouts.“This is certainly the most moral high ground Republicans have had in a moment like this that I can recall, and I just don’t like squandering that political capital when you have that kind of high ground,” Kevin Cramer, a Republican senator of North Dakota, told CNN, when asked about the layoff threats.The broader effects of this shutdown remain to be seen. Many national parks haveremained open, but with reduced services, as have the Smithsonian museums in Washington DC.Travel, national parks and housing: what does the US government shutdown mean for everyday people?Read moreThere has been no indication of a breakthrough in the funding dispute in Congress, where both parties have refused to back down from their demands in the day since the shutdown began.“I quite literally have nothing to negotiate,” Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, said on Thursday. The Republican-controlled chamber has passed a bill to fund the government through 21 November, but it needs at least some Democratic support to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancements in the Senate.On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators was seen huddling on the Senate floor, but it is unclear if that brought the two sides any closer to a deal.The House remains out of session, with no vote planned in the Senate today due to the Yom Kippur holiday.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Trump administrationChuck SchumerHakeem JeffriesDemocratsRepublicansUS federal government shutdownsnewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister described the footage as “shocking”.Rowley has summoned Met leaders, from chief inspector level upwards, to an emergency crisis meeting on Friday, where he will tell them to boost standards, root out wrongdoing or quit the force.The programme broadcast footage from a seven-month undercover investigation. Met officers were recorded calling for immigrants to be shot, being dismissive about a rape complaint and making anti-Muslim and misogynist comments.Rowley and other Met leaders are concerned other parts of the force have similar officers yet to be detected, with colleagues unwilling or scared to report them.The commissioner used media interviews on Thursday to deny he needed to resign. He denied the Met was institutionally racist or misogynistic.A source with knowledge of the Met leadership’s thinking said the force assessed it might take well into the next decade to detect and root out toxic officers. This comes despite 1,500 officers being removed in the last three years under Rowley.The source said: “The last few years have been about getting rid of the obviously bad ones, some of whom are just criminal. There will be other stations where this is going on. It could take a decade or more to detect and get rid of these people.”They said that while Rowley had embarked on the biggest ever corruption clearout in British policing history, “obviously there is a hell of a lot of road left to travel”.Captured in footage was an officer appearing to dismiss a complaint by a woman alleging rape and that a man had stamped on her stomach while pregnant, then releasing the suspect on bail.Other officers dismissed Muslims and immigrants as “scum”, with one talking about using extreme violence against them. He said: “I think any foreign person is the worst to deal with.”Later he said of an alleged visa overstayer: “Either put a bullet through his head or deport him.”One sergeant made repeated sexualised remarks including about masturbation. Other officers are caught on tape talking about stamping on suspects, injuring those who do not comply, and elbowing a suspect in leg restraints repeatedly in the face.Officers were also recorded discussing falsifying a statement after force was used, and avoiding making admissions in front of police cameras in their station meant to deter and detect wrongdoing.The Met is checking past cases, arrests and use of force by officers shown in the programme, in case other offences are identified, or if they may have jeopardised prosecutions.A Met spokesperson said: “Panorama highlighted serious issues with the actions and attitudes of some officers and a process is under way to identify cases which may have been affected. No further detail will be provided at this time.”The allegations have led to nine Met officers being suspended and 11 in total placed under investigation by the Independent Office forPoliceConduct. One is being criminally investigated.On LBC radio, Rowley said he hoped action to sack officers could be taken soon because the footage was so clear from the broadcast that it amounted to “incontrovertible evidence”.The IOPC may seek unbroadcast footage from the BBC. Rowley said: “But frankly some of the content from last night on its own, in my mind, would be enough to move officers to a fast-track misconduct hearing.”Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeMark RowleyPolice and crime commissionersLondonPoliceBBCFactual TVnewsShareReuse this content"

At a fringe event this week at Labour’s party conference, Rachel Reeves joked that she had a vendetta against Mone, adding: “Clearly she shouldn’t be in theHouse of Lords.”In a letter to the prime minister,Keir Starmer, Mone said that referring to a vendetta was “connoting vengeance, feud and blood feud, is incendiary and has directly increased the risks to my personal safety”. She claimed her “social media has gone into meltdown with threats and abuse” since Reeves spoke.Mone is facing calls to be removed from the Lords after PPE Medpro, a company to which she is linked, wasordered to return nearly £122m paid to it by the Department of Health and Social Carefor 25m sterile surgical gowns under a contract awarded in June 2020. It was found to have breached the contract after the DHSC arguedthe company had not complied with the relevant PPE lawsto ensure the gowns were actually sterile.A life peerage cannot be relinquished but Mone could choose to resign her membership of the Lords.Mone told Starmer: “I feel compelled to alert you to the dangerous and inflammatory statement made by your chancellor of the exchequer,Rachel Reeves.“This is one of the most troubling interventions ever made by a senior minister of the crown. The statement was not directed at PPE Medpro as a corporate entity in civil litigation, but at me personally.“It confirms that the machinery of the state is being deployed with the specific object of pursuing a vendetta against me, a private citizen and fellow parliamentarian.”Mone has demanded an “immediate and formal withdrawal of the chancellor’s statement” and public clarification “that there is no government vendetta against me personally”.She also called on the prime minister to launch an independent investigation into whether “ministers or officials have improperly influenced” the National Crime Agency, Crown Prosecution Service and civil litigation process.The high court case was separate to an ongoing investigation by the National Crime Agency, begun in May 2021, into whether Mone and Barrowmancommitted any criminal offencesduring the process of procuring the contracts. Mone and Barrowman have denied any criminal wrongdoing.In an 87-page ruling, Mrs Justice Cockerill, said the gowns provided by PPE Medpro, a consortium led by Mone’s husband, Doug Barrowman, “were not, contractually speaking, sterile, or properly validated as being sterile”, which meant they could not be used in the NHS.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or will you act decisively to end this campaign, protect my safety, and restore integrity to government?”Kemi Badenoch, the leader of theConservatives, told BBC local radio that Mone had brought “embarrassment and shame to the party”, and should have the “book thrown at her”.ALaboursource said: “When both the Labour chancellor and Conservative leader agree with each other, you’ve lost the argument.”Lawyers for PPE Medpro had told the trial that it had been “singled out for unfair treatment” and accused the government of having “buyer’s remorse”, claiming the gowns became defective because of the conditions in which they were kept after delivery.Explore more on these topicsMichelle MoneRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourConservativesCoronavirusHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

They should not be overflights.“We’re calling again on Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president … If she’s not willing to defend the single market, if she’s not willing to protect overflights, then she should go.”O’Leary suggested that Eurocontrol, which oversees the operations of Europe’s independent air traffic control services, could manage overflights during strikes.Ryanair’s statements have been the most vociferous, but a number of airlines have also aired concerns about air traffic control’s role in flight delays. While strikes are the biggest bugbear, post-Covid staff shortages in some control centres in Europe, and occasional technical glitches, have also contributed to disruption.Constraints on where planes can fly, including the closure of Ukrainian and Russian airspace, have contributed to the squeeze on flight paths, with air traffic control having to “regulate” – or delay – many more flights.EasyJet and British Airways were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsRyanairAir transportFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

First, she observed chimpanzees eating red meat. Before that moment, the scientific consensus, based on virtually no direct observation, was that chimpanzees were vegetarians.Then she witnessed an even moreunexpected behaviour: a chimpanzee male, crouched next to a high earthen tower built by termites, studiously modifying a long stalk of grass until it became a useful probe. The chimp then inserted the probe into a narrow tunnel that descended deep into the mound. As Goodall soon came to understand, members of the insect species’ soldier caste inside the mound instinctively lock their powerful mandibles on to any intruding object – and thus they became, once the probe was carefully drawn back out, victims of a crafty ape. The termites, potentially a significant source of nutrition, were tasty enough to serve as food for several species of monkey in that part of east Africa. Only chimpanzees, however, had developed the cultural tradition of “fishing” for them.Goodall, who has died aged 91, was not the first person to see wild chimpanzees use objects as tools, but she was certainly the first to observe the behaviour so closely and repeatedly, and to document it thoroughly. That chimpanzees ate meat and used tools were stunning discoveries, and with them Goodall earned her first few paragraphs in the history of primatology.The project was supposed to end within six months, but Goodall’s discoveries led to renewed support and more research. At a time when animals were usually conceptualised as mindless bundles of reflex and instinct, she came to describe the ones she was studying as deliberative creatures who remembered the past, anticipated the future, planned, had emotional lives and were driven by individual personality and character.View image in fullscreenA still from Miss Goodall and the World of Chimpanzees, broadcast on CBS in December 1965. The Gombe Stream Research Centre in Tanzania is still running today.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty ImagesShe maintained a regular presence in that forest (personally and then through assistants and associates) for more than 25 years, and even after she retired from active scientific research and moved on to a second career as a conservationist and activist, she kept the research going at theGombe Stream Research Centre. The Gombe centre today stands as the longest continuously running scientific field station.Because she did it her way, and because she was determined, courageous, resilient and passionate, Goodall helped to create a new style for the science of animal watching. She showed how to do it. Already the world’s foremost expert on wild chimpanzees, in 1962, without the usual undergraduate degree, she entered Cambridge University as a doctoral candidate in ethology. She gained her PhD in 1966, by which time she was already famous in the US as the author and subject of some astounding National Geographic magazine articles featuring her research. She also wrote a popular book based on that work,In the Shadow of Man(1971), which became an international bestseller.For a time, her popularity outstripped and even conflicted with her scientific reputation. Wasn’t good science supposed to be boring? The attitude of the time was, how could anyone be so pretty and a first-rate scientist? The zoologistSolly Zuckermanled the charge, publicly chastising her after she had given her first paper at a scientific conference in 1962 as an amateur whose reports on chimpanzee meat-eating were based on “anecdote”. Zuckerman then privately described, in a brief note to the ethologist Desmond Morris, his own “anxiety”, stimulated by Goodall’s conference presentation, “lest a subject which has been usually marked by unscientific treatment should continue in the unscientific shadows because of glamour”.In spite of such detractors, Goodall’s professional reputation grew. In the early 1970s, she was appointed visiting professor of psychiatry and human biology at Stanford University and of zoology at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. She later held academic appointments at Tufts University, the University of Southern California, and Cornell University in the US. The publication by Harvard University Press of The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), summarising the first quarter-century of knowledge about wild chimpanzees gleaned primarily from the Gombe research, prompted an international convention of primatologists at the Chicago Academy of Sciences. The gathering brought with it the sobering consensus that wild chimpanzees were declining and threatened with extinction acrossAfrica, while chimpanzees in cages outside Africa were often being threatened by cruelty and abuse.In a burst of inspiration, Goodall ended her direct scientific work in order to become an activist. She spent the rest of her life travelling around the world fighting for the future of chimpanzees and other wild species, and ultimately for our own.Born in London, Jane was the elder daughter of Vanne (Myfanwe, nee Joseph) and Mort (Mortimer) Morris-Goodall. He was heir to funds generated by the family business – manufacturing playing cards – and between the wars was a top driver for the Aston Martin racing team. Vanne was the daughter of a Congregational minister in Bournemouth. She trained as a secretary and worked in London.Mort and Vanne met in London and married, and when the second world war took him away, she returned with their two young daughters to the family home in Bournemouth. Mort stayed in the army for a few years following the war, rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and in 1950 wrote to Vanne asking for a divorce.Valerie Jane (soon to become “VJ”, then “Jane”) thus grew up with her sister, Judy, in an impoverished but cheerful and nurturing all-female household: grandmother, mother and two unmarried aunts. Her mother believed in the kind of parenting where reason took precedence over rules; and in an era when girls usually faced a narrow path of possibilities, Vanne told her daughter she could do anything she wanted if she tried hard enough. What the young girl wanted more than anything else was to be Tarzan, her hero from the books she read while sitting in the branches of her favourite tree. She wanted to swing through the trees and live among the apes in Africa.View image in fullscreenGoodall kissing Tess, a female chimpanzee, at the Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary near Nanyuki, central Kenya.Photograph: Jean-Marc Bouju/APIt was a childish dream and yet she was serious. Jane started to study animals. She tamed birds that came to her bedroom window. She learned to ride. She wandered by herself up and down the cliffs, where she became familiar with small mammals. She had from her earliest years an impressive focus.One day, the opportunity to follow her childhood dream arrived. It came in the form of a letter from an old school friend whose father, in postwar colonial Kenya, had acquired a farm in the hills outside Nairobi. The letter invited her to visit Africa and stay at the farm.By now she had left Uplands school, Poole, and, following the advice of her mother, acquired work as a secretary: first in Oxford, then London. But after the invitation to Africa arrived, she returned home to Bournemouth and waitressed until she had enough money saved to purchase her one-way passage on a boat. She arrived in Nairobi on 3 April 1957, just in time to celebrate her 23rd birthday. After staying at the farm for a month, she found a room and a secretarial job in town.But where were the wild animals, and how could she find them? She made the most direct approach possible, which was to introduce herself to the curator of the Coryndon Natural History Museum in Nairobi,Louis Leakey. As a paleoanthropologist, he was determined to follow his conviction that human evolution originated in Africa, and believed that part of knowing the great story required understanding our apeish ancestors’ behaviour, and in studying humankind’s closest living relatives: the African great apes, particularly chimpanzees.By the mid-1950s, a few astute anthropologists had embraced this idea, but almost no one knew where or how to find the chimpanzees. And far more difficult than finding them would be the problem of getting close enough to study them. They were wild and volatile. And they were many times stronger than the strongest man. They were dangerous, and people were not ordinarily foolish enough to go looking for them without a gun.Google Streetview gives glimpse into world of Jane Goodall’s chimpanzeesRead moreThen came Goodall. She made a positive first impression on Leakey and was hired as his secretary at the museum. She was passionate about animals, he recognised, and she showed herself capable of roughing it on safari for extended periods of time.Leakey decided to organise an expedition into the wilds of western Tanganyika Territory (now part of Tanzania) where Goodall would set up camp within a patch of forest at the edge of Lake Tanganyika that the British had identified as the Gombe Stream chimpanzee reserve. It was a remote location, but chimpanzees could be found in that forest, and perhaps, Leakey imagined, his secretary would discover something useful.Since the British colonial authorities ruled that no woman was allowed to go into the forest alone, Goodall’s mother agreed to accompany her. They hired a cook in Kigoma, Dominic Charles Bandora. Thus began, in July 1960, the world’s most improbable scientific expedition.Eventually Goodall received more than 50 honorary degrees, in 2002 was made a United Nations messenger of peace, and the following year a dame. She won the Stott science award from Cambridge University, the Kyoto prize in Japan, and the Kilimanjaro medal from Tanzania.In 1977 she founded theJane Goodall Institute, which works to protect chimpanzees and supports youth projects aimed at benefiting animals and the environment. Tireless as an advocate, at the time of her death she was on a speaking tour of the US.In 1964 Goodall married the wildlife photographer Hugo van Lawick, with whom she had a son, also Hugo. The couple divorced in 1974. Her second marriage, in 1975, to the British-born Tanzanian farmer and politician Derek Bryceson, ended with his death in 1980. She is survived by her son, three grandchildren and her sister.Jane Goodall(Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall), scientist and activist, born 3 April 1934; died 1 October 2025Explore more on these topicsJane GoodallAnimal behaviourPeople in scienceConservationBiodiversityAnimalsAnimal welfareobituariesShareReuse this content"

Studies have found the weather conditions that promote fires around the world are getting worse, and happening more often, because of global heating.Photograph: Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesOf the 200 most damaging fires since 1980 – that is, the fires with the highest direct costs relative to each nation’s GDP – 43% happened in the last 10 years.Half of the fires that cost US$1bn or more were also in the last 10 years. Over the 44 years analysed, the frequency of fires causing 10 or more deaths tripled while the population only went up by 1.8 times.Temperatures and the dryness of the atmosphere and of the vegetation – all factors promoting fires – all got significantly worse between 1980 and 2023.Half the wildfires happened while local weather conditions were in the worst 0.1% on record for fire danger.Disturbing regularityMany studies have found the weather conditions that promote fires around the world are getting worse, and happening more often, because of global heating.But the last major study that looked globally at the cost of those wildfires and the deaths related to them was in 2016 and found no trends.The period since then had been “punctuated by major fire disasters with disturbing regularity,” the authors said.“We went looking for that study showing things were getting worse. We felt intuitively that they were, but there was no research,” said Cunningham, of the University of Tasmania’s Fire Centre.“Climate sceptics have seized on that gap, so we hope this puts to bed the idea it’s not getting worse. Things are getting worse.“It is unambiguous and it is clear climate change is playing a role. These aren’t just bigger fires, they’re fires occurring under increasingly extreme weather conditions that make them unstoppable.”View image in fullscreenThe Sydney Harbour Bridge is shrouded in smoke haze as bushfires burn in 2021. Air pollution caused by fires can cause premature death due to respiratory problems.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPHe said the results point to the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly, but to also better manage forests close to populations. The public could help by doing maintenance to stop embers getting inside buildings and clearing fuels like leaves.Other unquantified influences that may be contributing to the worsening trend included the numbers of people living close to forests and the abandonment of agricultural areas.The authors said the trends came despite “ballooning expenditure on fire suppression” – US federal spending on fire suppression, for example, more than tripled between 1985 and 2022.“This expenditure is likely limiting (or masking) the fire crisis, but not offsetting it,” they wrote.1:10Firefighters tackle wildfires across southern Europe – videoThe number of deaths from fires was likely a gross underestimate. One database recorded 19 direct deaths from fires in Indonesia in 2015, but the resulting air pollution was implicated in about 100,000 premature deaths from respiratory problems.Roadmap to catastrophic disasterWhen the researchers looked at areas with a high risk of fires close to populations, they found this deadly combination on 10% of the planet’s land surface.Those areas included January’s fires in Los Angeles, with direct losses estimated at US$65bn – “likely the costliest fire disaster in history” – and the 2024 fires in Valparaíso, Chile, that claimed 135 lives.Both those disasters happened after the data analysis was completed, suggesting the methods were able to predict places at risk.“This provides a roadmap for where the next catastrophic disasters are most likely to occur,” said Bowman.Dr Hamish Clarke, an expert on fires and climate change at the University of Melbourne not involved in the study, said: “This is an important new paper that puts some hard numbers on a much discussed topic – global trends in, and drivers, of socially and economically damaging fires.“Unfortunately the news is not good – fires are killing more people and imposing more costs on economies around the world.”Explore more on these topicsWildfiresBushfiresClimate crisisNatural disastersAir pollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

It would never have soaked up the 550,000 tonnes of CO2every year that it originally claimed but a maximum of 1m tonnes in 100 years.The venture, which was part of since-abandoned efforts by the co-founder James Watt tobrand the business as carbon-negative or -neutral, was beset by further problems. Critics said the native trees planted there werefailing to growand buildings were sold off.Now run by a new executive team, the self-styled “punk” beer company announced in early September that it lost £37m last year while recordingbarely any sales growth. About 2,000 pubs delisted BrewDog products as consumer interest soured and the company announced it was closing 10 of its bars, including its flagship outlet in Aberdeen.Kinrara, which covers 3,764 hectares (9,301 acres) of the Monadhliath mountains, is the latest asset to be sold by the company. It has been bought by Oxygen Conservation, a limited company funded by wealthy rewilding enthusiasts.Founded only four years ago, Oxygen Conservation has very quickly acquired 12 UK estates covering more than 20,200 hectares. It aims to prove that nature restoration and woodland creation can be profitable.Rich Stockdale, Oxygen Conservation’s chief executive, disputed claims that the initial restoration work at Kinrara had failed. He said his company planned to continue BrewDog’s programme of peatland restoration and woodland creation.“We were blown away by the job that had been done; far better than we expected,” Stockdale said. “No woodland creation or environmental restoration project is without its challenges. [But] genuinely, we were astounded about the quality to which the estate’s been delivered.”Oxygen Conservation’s expansion has been cited as evidence that private investors can play a significant role in nature conservation by helping plug the gap between project costs and public funding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Zuma Press/AlamyA 30-year effort driven by long-term policies is finally paying off in Santiago in Chile – but the challenge is far from overByMaría de los Ángeles OrfilaThu 2 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 11.04 EDTShareIn Santiago, this winter was different. The mountains surrounding the city – the same ones that usually trap smog and turn it into a “pressure cooker” – were visible more days than usual.For nearly 30 years Chile’s capital has been experimenting in how to reduce air pollution; in the last few years the work has at last begun paying dividends and2025 was the third best year in terms of fewest hours of critical pollution episodessince the first atmospheric prevention and decontamination plan in 1997. Over the last decade, hours of exposure to high levels of pollution fell by 66%, which, according to the environment minister, Maisa Rojas, means the 7.5 million residents of the metropolitan region “are breathing cleaner air”.This is not just a bump, it is a sustained trend, the result of long-term policies such as modernising public transportation, implementing vehicle restrictions, and banning wood-burning heaters in winter. But experts say the challenge is far from over: while fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been decreasing in the cold months, another pollutant – tropospheric ozone – gains ground in summer, a scenario worsened by the climate crisis.“We’ve been implementing mitigation measures for almost 30 years, and it’s good to see that they are bearing fruit. Critical events are becoming less frequent. But one might expect that after so much time, they would no longer exist. That’s what we want as researchers, citizens and parents: to breathe clean air,” says Nicolás Huneeus, a researcher at the Center for Climate and Resilience Research at the University ofChile, who celebrates the progress but is not satisfied.Santiago is often compared to a pressure cooker, partly due to its geography: the Andes form a barrier that makes horizontal dispersion of pollutants difficult. The wind simply has nowhere to go. And another factor makes things worse: temperature inversion. “The city is warm, but higher up it’s even warmer, so the air in the city doesn’t move. In winter, the inversion is worse, and pollutant generation is higher. In short, Santiago has poor ventilation; we’re in trouble,” says the climatologist Raúl Cordero, a former member of Chile’s scientific advisory committee on climate change and now a researcher at the University of Groningen.View image in fullscreenView of smog over Santiago in 2018.Photograph: Claudio Reyes/AFP/Getty ImagesOther factors are the atmospheric boundary layer, which determines the volume in which pollutants are diluted. In Santiago, this layer is lower in winter (400–600 metres) than in summer (1,200 metres), increasing particle concentrations. Into this, you put the emissions from transportation and the residential sector, with firewood historically the main heating fuel, and it is easy to understand how Santiago is, at times, one of the most polluted cities in the world. In the worst years, there would be hundreds of critical alerts and environmental emergencies declared as a result of the pollution, and hospitals would be overwhelmed. Felipe Peñaloza, a nutritionist who lives in downtown Santiago, refers to “the constant black cloud that covers the city, which only disappears briefly after rain, but which remains a classic image of Santiago”.Over the last few years the local government has taken a number of steps.During pre-emergencies and environmental emergencies, wood-burning and wood-based heaters (except certified pellet stoves) are banned, agricultural burning is suspended, and people are encouraged to use public transport.Vehicle restrictions are also applied: during alerts, cars with licence plates ending in certain digits are banned from circulation; during pre-emergencies, the restrictions expand, affecting more digits and including green-seal vehicles (electric or hybrid, and gasoline or diesel cars meeting Euro 5 or 6 standards). In emergencies, traffic is limited for most vehicles.Elisa Fernández, a journalist and resident of Ñuñoa in north-east Santiago, describes herself as “absolutely compliant” with the law.Her car, which was manufactured before 2010, must be off the road one day a week between May and August. Driving it on restricted days can result in a fine of about £125. “Primarily, it’s for economic reasons, but also to contribute to cleaner air,” she says.This year compliance improved: more than 312,000 vehicles stayed off the road during winter, and violations fell nearly 23%, from 1,900 to 1,600 per day. But Cordero says real progress is coming from modernising and electrifying public transport: 30% of a 9,000-unit fleet is now electric, while targeted traffic restrictions help ease pollution peaks.Home heating and cooking electrification still lag, mainly due to limited financial support. Huneeus warns of a “rebound effect”: some users who switch to pellet stoves return to wood for economic reasons or perceived lower efficiency. This reflects “energy poverty” and limits the effectiveness of mitigation policies. Nevertheless, violations of the wood-burning ban fell sharply –88% lower than in 2024.Agricultural burning also decreased, with official data showing a 23.8% reduction in the number of fires and a 77% drop in the burned area.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This year, between May and August – the period with the worst ventilation conditions— there were 23 critical episodes, 20 environmental alerts, and 3 pre-emergencies for PM2.5. For perspective, in 2015 there were 915 hours of critical episodes for this pollutant.Cordero notes an unexpected consequence: the normalisation of pollution. “Twenty years ago, pollution levels were so severe they overwhelmed hospitals in winter. Today, critical episodes have fallen so much that pollution is no longer a public discussion in Santiago,” he says. This makes advancing further measures, such as electrifying homes, more difficult when the problem seems tolerable.But there is real gratitude for the changes. María Florencia Salazar says her daughter’s health has improved. “This helps me a lot, especially because I have a three-year-old daughter. This year, we have had slightly fewer cases of respiratory viruses.” Comparing her hospital visits, she says her daughter has been healthier than last winter and, above all, much better than in 2023.And Valentina Expósito, a functional training and yoga instructor, says she has noticed it too: “The air quality this year was better compared to previous years, I felt that there were fewer alerts and pre-emergency days. Even so, smog and pollution are still noticeable – probably less than before – but it’s hard to perceive the change unless it is more radical.”For her, the critical episodes directly affect her work. “What affects me the most is how I plan my classes for those days, understanding that more intense physical activity isn’t ideal,” she adds.Santiago’s winter success is the result of decades of policies and citizen cooperation. But the city still has work to do to ensure this breath of fresh air becomes a lasting change.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesAir pollutionChileClimate crisisEnergyAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ban had been in place for more than a month and had been condemned by Keir Starmer and local MPs.The climbdown came just days after the outlet, owned by Reach,presented the council with a legal lettersetting out further action it was considering taking.View image in fullscreenThe editor of the Nottingham Post, Natalie Fahy, pictured as she hands the leader of Nottinghamshire county council, Reform councillor Mick Barton, a copy of the Nottingham Post ahead of a full council meeting.Photograph: Joseph Raynor/Reach PLCThe company said the council was breaching local government regulations and article 10 of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), which protects freedom of expression and the right to express opinions “freely without government interference”.The ban was imposed by the council’s leader, Mick Barton, after he objected to an article about splits in his group over local government reorganisation plans.A letter from the county council’s team manager for litigation, Geoff Russell, said the restrictions had been the result of some “miscommunication or misunderstanding”.“Nottinghamshire county council confirms that your clients are and remain entitled to attend functions, meetings which are open to the public,” the letter states.Kemi Badenoch expected to announce plan to leave ECHRRead more“In addition, I can confirm that your clients will receive publications to email distributions lists to which they and all other media outlets are ordinarily entitled.”It remains unclear whether Barton is willing to be interviewed by the outlet.Natalie Fahy, Nottinghamshire Live’s editor, said: “I’m pleased this unprecedented ban has been lifted and the situation finally resolved so that we can continue to get on with our jobs as we always have done.“That means asking questions of elected council officials, having access to publicly funded information and events and holding them to account on behalf of our communities in Nottinghamshire.“This sends a firm message that journalists will not back down if our freedoms are attacked.”Fahy had previously said the incident was a troubling sign of things to come should the party form the next government.The ban had already been partly rolled back when it was lifted from a team of BBC-funded local democracy journalists that the paper also manages. However, the measures remained in place on other Nottinghamshire Live journalists until now.Explore more on these topicsPress freedomNottinghamshireReform UKNewspapersLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, the coroner in her inquest said the influence of her parents, Kay and Faramarz Shemirani, “more than minimally” contributed to her death.“It seems that if Paloma had been supported and encouraged to accept her diagnosis and considered chemotherapy with an open mind she probably would have followed that course,” Catherine Wood told a hearing atKentand Medway coroner’s court in Maidstone.She said Kay Shemirani “took a leading role in advising Paloma in respect of and facilitating access to alternative treatments”. She added: “If approached with an open mind, Paloma would have chosen the chance to survive, and if she had undergone chemotherapy she probably would have survived.”An NHS doctor told the inquest into Paloma Shemirani’s death she was concerned her mother, Kay, better known as the online influencer Kate Shemirani, influenced her daughter’s refusal of cancer treatment.Arunodaya Mohan, a consultant haematologist at Maidstone hospital, said she had recommended steroids and a PET (positron emission tomography) scan, and that Paloma had “nodded in agreement”.At the time of her diagnosis, doctors at Maidstone hospital told Paloma she had an 80% chance of recovery through chemotherapy.The doctor said she spoke to Kay on the phone, saying she expressed several “concerns” about the proposed treatment. Alison Hewitt, counsel to the inquest at Oakwood House in Maidstone, Kent, asked: “Were there concerns that Ms Shemirani was influencing Paloma?” Mohan replied: “That’s right.” Paloma later declined to have the treatment. And, when Mohan asked why, there did not seem to be a specific reason, the inquest heard.Asked if she had questioned Paloma on whether her decision was influenced by anyone, Mohan said: “She was very confident that it was her own decision and she was not influenced.”After graduating from Cambridge, Paloma was working and living in a flat with a housemate and was “estranged” from her mother until her cancer diagnosis.Paloma went to live with her mother after leaving hospital. Asked if there was a change in Paloma’s attitude after her discharge, Mohan told the court: “Yes, I was quite concerned because at the time of the hospital she had not declined chemotherapy, she was just thinking about it, but after discharge she completely discharged the treatment, which I was quite disappointed about.”View image in fullscreenKay Shemirani in 2021 at a rally opposing the Covid-19 vaccine, when she compared NHS doctors to Nazis.Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/ShutterstockUsing the name Kate Shemirani, Kay rose to prominence on social media while sharing Covid-19 conspiracy theories. She was struck off as a nurse in 2021, with a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) committee finding that she had spread Covid-19 misinformation that “put the public at a significant risk of harm”.In written statements submitted to the family division of the high court in spring 2024, Paloma said she had declined chemotherapy partly because of her “background in natural healing”, the inquest heard previously.The statements were written as part of proceedings initiated by her twin brother, Gabriel, and involving the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust, in which he sought an assessment of the appropriateness of her care options. Paloma died before they could conclude.Paloma wrote: “If I became ill, I’ve always turned to my mum first for advice as she is a trained nurse and qualified nutritionist.” The inquest heard that Paloma told the high court she was “delighted” with the alternative treatment she was pursuing, and was “sure” she would “make a full recovery” if left to continue it.The inquest heard the forensic psychiatrist Ali Ajaz spent seven sessions with Paloma on the recommendation of her mother, with whom he had a professional relationship. The doctor had appeared on Kay’s podcast as a medical expert three times, and she had referred multiple patients to him.Gabriel said his mother had “sacrificed” his sister “for her own principles”. He told the inquest: “I blame my mother entirely for my sister’s death” – for “obstructing” his sister from receiving treatment.View image in fullscreenThe high-profile conspiracy theorist addressing an anti-lockdown demonstration in Trafalgar Square in 2020.Photograph: ZUMA Press Inc/Alamy“I believe that she sacrificed Paloma’s life for her own principles, I believe that she should be held accountable for Paloma’s death,” he said.Kay claimed during the inquest proceedings that her daughter’s death had been caused by gross negligence manslaughter from medical staff, claiming she had “deteriorated catastrophically” when paramedics intervened.She said her daughter had been “well” on the morning she collapsed, telling the court: “She looks healthy and good colour … she was smiling and laughing.”After the collapse, Kay did not immediately call an ambulance, but called a friend instead, who then called the emergency services while they initiated CPR.On the 999 call played to the court, Kay was heard shouting: “She’s dying.” Despite this, she told the court “everything went horribly wrong” after the paramedics arrived.Paloma was taken to Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton on a ventilator, and brain stem death was declared on the afternoon of 24 July 2024 after a series of nationally advised medical checks.Reading a prepared witness statement, Kay accused the inquest of “attempting to shift focus” from the “real” cause of Paloma’s death. “Any attempt to place responsibility on me is false – the people who need to be answering are those who failed to confirm diagnosis, administered drugs without her consent which could have damaged her heart.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthKentnewsShareReuse this content"

He said in 2022 that his oncologist had told him his “lung cancer was cured and that the tumour in my liver was shrinking”, but in April 2023 he revealed it had returned.Murray starred as Mickey, a dim-witted friend of David Jason’s Del Boy and Nicholas Lyndhurst’s Rodney Trotter, across 20 episodes of the comedy series between 1983 and 2003.A BBC spokesperson said: “We are very sad to hear of the passing of Patrick Murray, much loved for his role as Mickey in Only Fools and Horses. Our thoughts are with his friends and family.”Sue Holderness, who played Marlene in Only Fools and Horses, paid tribute to Murray on X, saying: “RIP darling Patrick. Much love. You will be greatly missed.”Before his work on the show, Murray starred in films including Quadrophenia, Scum and Curse of the Pink Panther. His other TV appearances included in the 1990s sitcom The Upper Hand, The Bill, ITV Playhouse and Bergerac.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBBCTV comedynewsShareReuse this content"

She argued that the prolonged lockdowns and school closures were responsible for the explosion in mental health, welfare and behaviour difficulties still being experienced by children and young people.Lady Longfield,who was children’s commissionerat the peak of the pandemic, said the government should issue a formal apology for its “avoidable mistakes” to the children whose lives had been blighted by Covid and its after-effects.“The children and young people who experienced the Covid pandemic – some of whom will now be adults and some of whom are just starting school – are owed a formal apology from the prime minister in parliament once the inquiry has published its final report,” Longfield said.View image in fullscreenAnne Longfield.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer“An apology would give the government an opportunity to formally acknowledge the avoidable mistakes and the damage that was done to many children’s wellbeing, education, health, development, and safety, following decisions that were made by the then government in 2020 and 2021.“It would be a chance to say sorry, and to promise that lessons really will be learned, should there be another pandemic or national emergency in the future.”TheCovid-19 public inquirythis week started its investigation focusing on the treatment of children and young people during the pandemic, and will later hear evidence from policymakers and politicians, including Gavin Williamson, who was the education secretary during the period.Longfield said her advice or views were rarely sought by the government during the pandemic, and told the inquiry that the interests of children often “came behind in the queue to pubs, shops, theme parks but also adults, throughout”.Longfield was particularly critical of the government’s decision to drop many elements of social care provision during the pandemic, including diluting requirements for visits to at-risk children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So many things could have been done differently around keeping schools open but they weren’t.“Similarly with social care, [the government] moved straight to an outcome around diluting responsibilities,” she said.Longfield said the after-effects on children and young people were still being felt, citing the doubling in persistent absence from school, the 80% increase in education, health and care plans issued for children with special needs, and a 300% increase in autism among children since before the pandemic.Longfield said the data “is completely conclusive on the increase in virtually every indicator of [increased] vulnerability, from pre-Covid to today”.Explore more on these topicsCovid inquirySchoolsChildrenSocial careMental healthChild protectionHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Angélique Chauviré’s family said very few words to me. But I think they welcome this new sentence,” she said.Maitre Karine Linon, the lawyer representing the family of Hyman, said: “This case is unusual and it will go down in history simply because we are dealing with a defendant who is a serial killer.”Fortune had previously been convicted of three other murders which were committed on the Dutch side of the island, known as Sint Maarten.Fortune is originally from Grenada. In 2007, he was given a 21-year sentence by the Dutch court of appeal for the 2005 murder of Ervin Margarita, 23. But he escaped custody during a doctor’s visit in February 2016.In December that year, he killed Luis Sarante Diaz and Edwin Rosario Contreras in what was thought to be a botched drug deal at the Simpson Bay Resort in Sint Maarten. Their bodies were found eight months later in a lagoon several miles from the hotel.Fortune fled to the neighbouringCaribbeanisland of Saint Kitts in July 2017, armed with a rifle, wearing body armour, and carrying a substantial amount of cash. He was immediately arrested and deported back to Sint Maarten that same month.Weeks later, hurricane Irma devastated Sint Maarten in September 2017 and damaged parts of its prison. He was transferred to a prison in Curaçao before being moved to a maximum-security facility in theNetherlands. In June 2019, Fortune was convicted for Diaz and Rosario’s killings.While still in prison in the Netherlands, Fortune was tried in absentia by a French court in 2020 for the deaths of Maynard, Hyman, Chauviré and sentenced to life. But he was able to successfully file an objection to the case being held in his absence, which reopened the case for a trial at which he could be present.Guadeloupe’s attorney general Élodie Rouchouse told the court that Fortune’s case had been complicated by the fact that his crimes had been committed in different jurisdictions, which each had their own legal systems. “I reopened the case to see justice done. But it took a long time. Under international agreements you need the right authorisations, translated judgments, everything in place. That process took five years,” he said.Throughout the trials in Guadeloupe, Fortune has maintained his innocence. During closing remarks he told the jury: “I know the truth will come out but I cannot give you the truth because I don’t know anything about it. I did a lot of bad things in my life. I’m not proud of them, but I don’t see why I should be convicted for a crime I did not do.”Fortune’s lawyer, Gérald Coralie, has since confirmed that an appeal has been filed for both cases. He will be returned to the Netherlands later this month and his appeal is due to be heard in Paris.Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanNetherlandsFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

The Salvadorian national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the US without proper documentation as a teenager.Following widespread pressure, theTrump administrationreturned himto the US in June. Upon his return, however, he immediately faced criminal charges related to human smuggling, allegations that his lawyers have rejected.Ábrego wasreleasedfrom criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday while awaiting trial. But the Trump administration announced new plansto deport him to Ugandaand then Eswatini.Then Ábrego wastaken into custodyby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) during a scheduled immigration check-in in Baltimore, which was one of the conditions of his release.Ábrego entered the US without authorization around 2011 as a teenager. According to court documents, he was fleeing gang violence.Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Ábrego, repeatedly referring to him as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact that he has not been convicted of any crimes.His lawyers have filed motions requesting a gag order and said Ábrego will not be able to receive a fair trial because of the “highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements” made about him.While the federal judge in Tennessee can order prosecutors there not to make any prejudicial statements about Ábrego, it is unclear whether the judge’s authority extends to the Department of Homeland Security, which posted about the immigration court ruling on X on Wednesday.“His lawyers tried to fight his removal from the U.S. but one thing is certain, this Salvadoran man is not going to be able to remain in our country,” the post said.Since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has launched a massive crackdown on immigrants across the US, including sending federal forces and the national guard to assist US Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in numerous cities, nearly all of them Democrat-run.The actions have prompted outrage from many groups, including Democrats and civic society groups.The Associated Press contributed toreportingExplore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaUS immigrationIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationUS politicsEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Two years ago, McIntosh county commissionersvoted to increasethe maximum size of homes allowed in the Black community Hogg Hummock, also known as Hog Hammock, weakening zoning restrictions put in place several decades ago to protect the residents’ lands. The 30 to 50 Black residents of the enclave feared that the zoning changes would raise their taxes and displace them. Tuesday’s decision reversed a lower court ruling that halted a voter referendum aimed at repealing the changes. Now, county voters can decide whether to restrict large developments in the community in the future.Dana Braun, an attorney for the Hogg Hummock residents,told the Associated Pressthat they were happy with the ruling. Now, she said, county residents will have “some real say”, on the allowable sizes of homes.Hogg Hummock is one of the last remaining communities of Gullah Geechee people, the descendants of formerly enslaved west Africans who were forced to work on plantations on the Sea Islands along the south-east US. After the civil war, the formerly enslaved people resided on more than 400 acres of land, where their isolation from the mainland allowed them to retain their distinct creole language and culture. In 1996, the enclave was listed on theNational Register of Historic Placesas the Hog Hammock Historic District.The US food bank keeping Gullah Geechee farming traditions alive: ‘Our local food is like no other’Read moreThe Hog Hammock District was established in the 1990s to “reserve this area for low intensity residential and cottage industry uses which are environmentally sound,” according toMcIntosh county code, “and will not contribute to land value increases which could force removal of the indigenous population.” Alongstanding ordinancespecified that home sizes would not exceed 1,400 sq ft, but the2023 zoning changesmore than doubled that to 3,000 sq ft.In July 2024, county residents Stanley Walker, Christopher Bailey and Barbara Bailey filed a petition withmore than 2,300 signaturesto ask the probate court for a special election where county voters could decide if the new ordinance would be repealed. The probate court approved it, and hundreds of voters cast early ballots for the referendum. McIntosh county then filed litigation to prohibit the special election from proceeding and to declare the referendum petition void. Then in September 2024, a superior court ruled in favor of the county, concluding that zoning changes were not subject to the referendum process, according to the opinion. Walker and the Baileys then filed an injunction to prevent enactment of the ordinance as the case continued to wend through the courts.On Tuesday, the state supreme court concluded that the lower court erred in its decision that a special election was illegal. Justice John Ellingtonwrote in the opinionthat “nothing in the text of the Zoning Provision in any way restricts a county electorate’s authority to seek repeal of a zoning ordinance.”Jazz Watts, a Hogg Hummock resident who was behind the referendum petition, told the AP that he felt vindicated by the ruling. “The election should not have been stopped. It was stopping the voice of the people.”“The people are Geechee people because we were left unbothered and untouched,” descendant Keara Skates toldCapital B News. “I just want the Geechee people to stay Geechee.”Explore more on these topicsGullah GeecheeCotton Capital: ongoing seriesGeorgiaBlack US cultureRaceLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

In aGuardian review, Neil Bartlett wrote that the book “invites the reader to join him in an exhilarating, risk-taking, life-affirming experiment”.Daley-Ward was picked for The Catch, a story of two sisters whose dead mother mysteriously reappears. “The Catch is an extraordinary shape-shifting, genre-defying work of fiction”, said the judge and writer Simon Okotie. “Reading, by turns, as popular fiction, literary fiction and science fiction, it calls all such distinctions into question.”Joining Sackville, Haddon and Okotie on this year’s judging panel is the author Megan Nolan.Also on the shortlist is We Pretty Pieces of Flesh by Colwill Brown, who won theBBC’s national short story prizethis week. Her debut novel, about three young women growing up in Doncaster, “manages to be both boisterous and bleak, life-enhancing and life-denying, familiar and yet wholly original”, Catherine Taylor wrote in aGuardian review.Ben Pester appears on this year’s list for The Expansion Project, in which a father, Tom, searches for his missing daughter, who he believes is lost in the business park he works in. The book “is formally a collage, put together decades or centuries in the future by an unnamed ‘Archivist’ who is meant to be studying the business park’s ‘Expansion Project’ but keeps getting drawn into individual lives such as Tom’s”, Keshava Guha wrote in aGuardian review.Completing the shortlist is We Live Here Now by CD Rose, which looks at the aftereffects of the disappearance of an art installation. The book comprises a “dizzying, encyclopaedic series of stories linked by texture, resonance and suggestion”, Okotie said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

How Tribe of Frog became the UK’s trippiest, happiest club nightPlaying the oft-reviled subgenre of psytrance, this Bristol event is celebrating its 25th year. Amid the UV paint and crochet frog hats, we find out why it’s thrivingKyle MacNeillThu 2 Oct 2025 05.39 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 08.59 EDTShareSaturday’s sunset has long gone, but there’s so much UV paint glowing in Bristol nightclub Lakota that I feel I might end up with a tan from it. A throng of ravers throw shapes while a shamanic selector, flanked on stage by two dancers, pumps out squelchy beats. Colourfully daubed faces light up with joy and arms swirl into spacey lasers, ready to break through into a different dimension. For one night only, I am an initiated member of theTribe of Frog, a Bristolian club night that’s been putting on mind-boggling parties like this for the last 25 years.To mark the occasion, the team has gone mad as a box of proverbial amphibians with the kaleidoscopic decor, but the soundtrack is the same as ever: psytrance. This is a 135bpm-plus, four-to-the-floor, knowingly melodramatic, multi-layered offshoot of trance with mesmerising refrains and epic drops. Tristan Cooke, a DJ and legend of the scene who speaks to me a week before the party, explains that it “grew out of partying on beaches and nature,” specifically amid the trance scene in Goa, India, in the early 1990s. He says that psytrance enhances the effects of LSD. “It’s about attempting to achieve a peak experience. In a nutshell, it’s spiritual raving.”View image in fullscreenTribe of Frog co-founder Chris Rana on the decks.Photograph: James Gardner at TinyTogChris Rana, co-founder of Tribe of Frog, never made it to Goa but he did travel across Thailand in the 90s, where he and his late wife Donna (whose artwork continues to adorn the night) fell in love with psytrance. “For the first time in our lives, we found this feeling of freedom,” he says in the Tribe of Frog green room.Back inBristol, they started a nightlife decor business called Wildfrogz together. Why frogs? “It’s always considered a mystical animal because it can exist in two worlds, in the water and in the air,” Rana says. They met Jason Frog, as he’s known, on a job. “You can get into this plateau of bliss, where you’re dancing to this synchronised rhythm,” Jason says of his beloved genre, while munching his way through a bunch of bananas. After getting a gig kitting out a psytrance party in London called Enlightenment, they decided to throw their own.Tribe of Frog was born, with its opening night taking place in August 2000. “Every inch of wall space is covered in psychedelic banners, projections, lights and all that is just simulation to trigger the overload of the senses,” Cooke says, adding that even as a veteran DJ, playing Frog still smacks his gob: “It’s about creating a Garden of Eden in a club.” Transcendent outfits were also encouraged from the outset, with Jason explaining that “the concept has been that if you create a super-real environment, people forget their worries because they’re in this other world that their mind creates for them”.View image in fullscreen‘People forget their worries because they’re in this other world’ … Frog-costumed dancers in Lakota.Photograph: Timothy JonesSince then, Tribe of Frog has hopped across the globe and spawned a residency stage at Hampshire’s Boomtown festival. At a pub round the corner from Lakota, before the night begins, I bump into a group of twentysomethings in hand-crocheted frog hats who all met at Boomtown as solo punters. “If you put that much care and dedication into making something a tradition, you’re going to create a following,” says Matthew Sarrington, as another friend pulls up his sleeve to show a frog tattoo.Despite its widely dispersed fandom, though, Tribe of Frog is still somehow quintessentially Bristol. It’s true that it lacks any of the edge of the drum’n’bass, trip-hop or dubstep that seemingly wafts out of every concrete orifice and car window in Stokes Croft. Yet it encapsulates the left-field spirit of the city, in one way or another.View image in fullscreenA particularly colourful Tribe of Frog dancer.Photograph: James Gardner at TinyTogFor other people, however – who are obviously not here tonight – psytrance is a relentless headache, even musical torture.Dance musicfans often file it next to other oft-scorned niche genres such as happy hardcore and donk, seeing psytrance as a woo-woo scene beloved by crusty ravers sporting harem pants and scarfing too much magic mushroom chocolate.“Psytrance has always been the black sheep of the dance music fraternity,” Cooke admits. “They see it as a bunch of unclean-dreadlocked, culturally appropriating hippies. But it’s becoming part of the mainstream.” It’s true that psytrance, now far removed from its roots and attracting tens of thousands of revellers to festivals such as Boom in Portugal, hasfaced criticisms of cultural appropriation, amalgamating and whitewashing eastern iconography.But it’s an intricate issue. “Some criticisms remain valid, but every instance of ‘cultural appropriation’ should be carefully scrutinised,” says anthropologist Graham St John, the author of Global Tribe: Technology, Spirituality and Psytrance. “Sometimes, the othering in question is primitivist and even outright exploitative. Other times the borrowing and recognition is respectful and mutually beneficial.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s not just about hearing it, it’s about feeling it’ … on the floor at Tribe of Frog.Photograph: Timothy JonesFor those who aim at creating the latter, it’s a way of life, and there are always new tadpoles to join them. In the smoking area, I bump into Francesca Stevenson, an emerging psytrance selector (as Cheska Onyx) who won a competition to play tonight. “It’s not just about hearing it, it’s about feeling it,” she says, connecting psytrance’s local appeal to the south-west’s ley lines.Elsewhere, freshers-week students with constellations of glitter and gap-year tunics abound, many telling me, wide-eyed, that this is paradise. “The Frog has always just had this bottomless pool of young people,” Rana says. He also says that there have been many “frog unions” over the years – I’m told that Cliff, who plays the drums at Tribe of Frog, met his partner at Tribe and is bringing their daughter along for the first time tonight.View image in fullscreenOverloading the senses … two of the most outlandish dressers at Tribe of Frog.Photograph: James Gardner at TinyTogAround the club I overhear talk of trust funds, and discourse around the psychedelic drug 2C-B, and all of this – plus of course the psytrance itself – may put people off. But there are genuinely no posers or chinstrokers at Tribe of Frog. Mad, fun dancing is encouraged and there are multiple generations all going for it under one roof. “It’s a cool, funky, safe, amazing place … people are not going there to try and get laid. It’s about partying together,” Cooke says.The mind expansion, and sense of community, has been a lifesaver for some people. “It healed me. It brought me out of my shell. You get a better perspective on yourself,” Jason says. But while there can be individual catharsis, it’s always about the collective. Rana’s mantra, shared with me earlier, echoes in my mind as I float out of Lakota back towards Bristol coach station: “Here, you always drop your ego!”Explore more on these topicsClub cultureDance musicBristolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s a fair bit to enjoy here, although perhaps it’s best experienced on TV over Christmas in a Quality Street stupor. GoldenEye was the first to starPierce Brosnanas 007, the first to see Judi Dench as M, and the first film to challenge its own franchise identity. As M crisply says to Bond: “I think you are a sexist, misogynist dinosaur and a relic of the cold war” – although her criticism of her star agent begins and ends with that description.The film gamely attempts to reposition itself in the new post-Soviet world, with a key scene (and some of the opening sequence) taking place among the discarded, crumbling statues of Soviet heroes. Perhaps even more gamely, it revives the memory of theLienz Cossackswho were chillingly repatriated to the Soviet Union after the war by the British to be slaughtered by Stalin.There are other historical points of interest: like many 90s films, it is waking up to the possibilities of the online world, with blocky computer graphics of Microsoft Internet Explorer vintage and quaint Chicago font.Alan Cummingplays a figure who was to become an almost indispensable staple of drama-thrillers for decades to come: the geeky, nerdy computer hacker who can conveniently perform near-magical feats inside a plausibly realist scenario. And yet from the current vantage point, this film, not yet entirely dominated by digital effects, looks like a 1960s-vintage second world war film.The story begins as Bond infiltrates a Soviet military facility in the 80s alongside fellow agent 006 (Sean Bean), an adventure which ends in spectacular disaster. Fast forward nine years to the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall and Bond finds himself up against a rogue Russian mob planning to steal a Soviet space weapon called GoldenEye and use it to destroy the banking system, after removing all the money from it … or something. In fact, the exact point of stealing the GoldenEye system seems a bit sketchy. James comes into contact with super-sexy dom Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), sweetly romantic Natalya Simonova (Polish-Swedish star Izabella Scorupco) and corrupt Russian General Ourumov (Gottfried John).Robbie Coltranecould have been given more to do as Russian spy turned gangster Valentin Zukovsky, or indeed entrusted with the actual villain role, and Joe Don Baker is good-ol’-boy CIA man Jack Wade.In truth, I was never quite persuaded of Pierce Brosnan as 007, personable though his post-Bond career has proved to have been; he seems to be very close to the Roger Moore model, with elaborately tailored suits and self-aware cuff-shooting sophistication privileged over fisticuffs and action, and yet he is not given much actual on-screen humour. There is in fact a very funny initial scene with Desmond Llewelyn as Q, although the weaponry in the new BMW goes unused.GoldenEyeis in UK and Irish cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmGoldenEyeJames BondPierce BrosnanThrillersSean BeanAlan CummingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s crass, dull and utterly lacking in actual jokesLucy ManganThu 2 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 00.01 EDTShareAfortysomething alpha male, a sad sack, a playboy and an intellectual walk into a German sitcom. Eight episodes of Dudes ensues. I do not speak German and can only hope it plays better in the original. In fact, the original-original is a Spanish comedy called Machos Alfa. That is now into its third season, which suggests it at least had a charm that has become lost in translation.The alpha here is Ulf (Tom Beck). He is tall, dark, handsome, high-earning, married to an increasingly influential influencer, and he and his immaculate facial hair are on the verge of promotion to CEO of the magazine publishing company he has worked at for the last 20 years. But what’s this? He is denied his dues by the advent of Vanessa (Jaëla Probst), a hot-in-all-senses businesswoman brought in from outside by the boss to shake things up. I have never seen this setup before. I hope it doesn’t cause him to quit in a childish rage and jeopardise his entire lifestyle, re-employment prospects and marriage. Oh.The sad sack is Andi (Moritz Führmann), who is stressed at work, balding and always too tired for sex – a groundbreaking comedy trifecta if ever there was one – despite his wife Silke’s (Franziska Machens) keenness to initiate it with his stressed, balding self. The hilarity.Playboy Erik (David Rott) meanwhile has almost the opposite problem. He is ready to give up his lover and get engaged to his long-term fiancee Kim (Marleen Lohse), the lucky girl. But she wants to open up their relationship! This revelation plays out over a dinner date in which he has – oh, the comic innovation gets everywhere! – hidden the engagement ring in her favourite pudding, but ends up having to eat it himself. Later, he has to poo it out. Try to contain your hysterical laughter. You may have had some practice already. If not, there is a scene coming up in which Andi uses a butt plug on Silke and the kids burst in, which should amply provide.Intellectual Cem (Serkan Kaya) is divorced and his 16-year-old daughter has just announced that she is moving in with him. She puts his profile on dating apps and starts overseeing his love life to a degree that I consider worthy of the involvement of social services, but I am not a writer of a dismal sitcom purporting to examine life for middle-aged men in a glorious feminist age, so what do I know? Maybe there really are swathes of teenage girls out there telling their fathers they need to “fuck at least 10 women properly otherwise you’ll never move on”, but if so there shouldn’t be. Stop it. Put some boundaries in place, stay in your parent/child lanes, return life to its proper order and just stop it now.Anyway. You will never guess who his first date is – only Ulf’s nemesis Vanessa! And you’ll never guess whether he panics and tells her he’s a widower instead of divorcee or not!On and on we go, watching boring, idiotic characters do boring, idiotic things and ticking off set-pieces as we go. Silke getting drunk at a dinner party with all the friends and ranting about Andi’s lack of libido. A shrink doodling inattentively while Cem pours out his troubles. Nobody cares about men any more, you see. Ulf hitting up his contacts for work and getting nowhere (“Too old? Seriously?”, “Too manly? For real?” These are lines someone has written). He returns to the office to ask for his job back but ends up humiliating himself again. The football team they all play for keeps losing. Ah,einemetapher. A visit from Erik’s parents stymieing Kim’s wish to go to a sex party that night. Until his parents have to leave early to go to a concert. So Erik and Kim go to the sex party. You’ll never guess who they meet there. Andi and Silke are called to their children’s school because thekinderhave brought the butt plug in for – well, I was going to say shits’n’giggles, but perhaps I shouldn’t.It’s dull, it’s crass, it pulls every punch it could possibly land, it has no insight, no subtlety, no grace, no jokes – it has things that sound like jokes, are formatted like jokes and are delivered like jokes, yet are not jokes – and it makes you feel sorry for actors. And maybe Germans. I don’t know if this is the quality of television they are used to, or that they want – again, it depends on whether much is missing in translation. But I suspect not much.Dudes is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTV comedyComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is an adaptation of Alexandra Fuller’s award-winning memoir of the same name, about her childhood inZimbabwe(then Rhodesia) in the late 1970s, just before the election that brought Robert Mugabe to power, ended white minority rule and sent a thrill of fear through the world of the white farmers, including her parents, who saw which way the wind of change was blowing.There’s a lovely performance from seven-year-old newcomer Lexi Venter as Bobo, a smudgey-faced little kid left to run ferally and blissfully wild on her family’s disintegrating farm. This is a place where her parents sleep cradling guns; her dad (Rob van Vuuren) is away much of the time on a paranoid protective patrol with other white farmers, and her mum (a bravura performance from Davidtz) is going not-so-quietly frantic with depression and drink. She is blearily determined to stay on and to ignore her neighbours’ uneasy awareness of her past bipolar episodes, due to a family tragedy.She is however always pleased when her husband returns. Bobo is banished from their bedroom on these occasions, because, as she sagely puts it while listening to the baffling headboard-bumping sounds from within, her mum and dad want to “move furniture around with their clothes off”. There is also an older sister Van (Anina Reed), whose blossoming adolescence attracts the attention of her creepy Uncle Anton (Albert Pretorius).But most importantly and dangerously of all, there is their black nanny-maidservant Sarah (an excellent performance from Zikhona Bali) who genuinely loves little Bobo, but is furiously rebuked for this by her glowering husband Jacob (Shilubana N Fumani) who resents the child’s memsahib mannerisms, and who also senses that theZanu-PFmilitia will take great exception to them associating so publicly with this white child. And so it proves.It is a tremendous performance from Bali, to match those of Davidtz and Venter, although there is one qualm to be raised here: our final glimpse of Sarah is of her as a kind of hallucinated princess, a vision that exalts Bobo’s farewell; this arguably puts her in thecontentious “Magical Negro” category, a black character who is there to facilitate a white character’s more significant emotional growth. Well, for all that, it’s a powerful, immersively detailed film, with three outstanding performances.Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight is in UK and Irish cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsBiopicsZimbabweFilm adaptationsAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

But this rereleased 1957 Hammer shocker from the screenwriter Jimmy Sangster and the veteran director Terence Fisher, shows the way it should be done – with unpretentious energy and sly macabre gusto. In vivid Eastmancolor, it’s a film electrified with its own melodramatic crassness, unencumbered with good taste and certainly uninterested in making either Frankenstein or his creature in any way tragically sympathetic.Peter Cushing plays the brilliant and fatally hubristic scientist Victor Frankenstein; the young Melvyn Hayes has a notable juve-lead role in flashback as the supercilious young Victor. Working with his sorrowingly reluctant colleague and former tutor Paul (Robert Urquhart), Frankenstein secretly constructs a new human from gruesome body parts, robbing gibbets and bribing charnel house attendants in the process; he drops surplus anatomical items into his acid bath, a horrible item that inevitably plays a homicidal role later.The resulting Homo sapiens is to be the tall and rather distinguished-looking Christopher Lee. But Dr Frankenstein needs a top-quality brain from the kind of high-calibre individual unlikely to be found on the gallows, so the movie ingeniously contrives for him to set upon a bizarre murderous plan, involving a gasp-inducingly effective stunt and a vision ofRembrandt’s painting The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp, which Frankenstein is incidentally supposed to have bought. And to top it all off, this Dr Frankenstein is no romantic hero; he is cheating on his delicate fiancee Elizabeth (Hazel Court) with his smirking maidservant Justine (Valerie Gaunt) – and both women are to receive a terrible fate at the malformed hands of this lumbering monster.The creature himself is not a tragically pained or unhappy figure: he is simply violent; and the whole story is crisply told at a racy 83 minutes – making it suitable for a double-bill, of course – and yet it is delivered with absolute seriousness and conviction. The spinning wheel that channels the electricity might have inspired the design for the time machinein the Rod Taylor moviethat came three years later.The Curse of Frankenstein is in UK cinemas from 2 October, and on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from 13 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsFilm adaptationsChristopher LeePeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

What’s perhaps most striking is the pace of the performance, which knocks minutes off anybody else’s: Tetzlaff could have packed up and left the building by the time, say,Vilde Franggets offstage. Egged on by the conductor John Storgårds – who has the BBC Philharmonic sounding electric – Tetzlaff often runs towards moments of burgeoning intensity, rather than broadening out into them, and the effect is exhilarating. The downside is that some of the more densely woven passages sound fragmented this way; Tetzlaff is like a cat playing with a mouse, continually tensing, ready to pounce.View image in fullscreenElgar/Adès.It’s not by any means all rushed, though. Sometimes Tetzlaff is introspective where other violinists are assertive, and vice versa; the phrases that tug at the heart are not always those you would expect. It’s a genuinely refreshing performance.A similar energy courses through Thomas Adès’s 2005 Violin Concerto, Concentric Paths, Tetzlaff stressing urgency over lyricism, Storgårds shaping the orchestral music into huge arcs. The muscular second movement unfurls with accumulating, juggernaut intensity; the third has its catchy little melody anchored by the orchestra’s bass in a way that conjures centrifugal force.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

We then rewind to 20 months earlier when, on a Saturday morning, he took his youngest children to the National Gallery in London. While looking at a painting of Jesus being betrayed by Judas, “I sensed my body beginning to show signs of betraying me: a strange metallic tingling started to pinch my fingertips.” McNally was experiencing the beginnings of a stroke that would leave him with impaired speech and paralysis on one side of his body.I Regret Almost Everything sees McNally, now 74, reflecting on his health along with his long career, moving from bellboy at the Hilton hotel in London to teen actor – aged 16, he played the lead in a production of The Winslow Boy – to busboy at the New York restaurant One Fifth, where he was later promoted to maître d.The actor Richard E Grant brings his words to life in an understated yet sensitive narration which conveys McNally’s mourning for his old self and his newfound introspection. As the title makes clear, he has regrets: notably his divorces, being a part-time father to his eldest children and hispublic shaming of James Cordenfor his rudeness in one of his restaurants. But he finds delight in film, theatre and in his memories of sitting down with his staff at the Odeon after closing time as they drank beer and counted their tips. Of those late nights, McNally reflects: “Nothing since has ever matched that feeling.”Available via Simon & Schuster Audio, 10hr 46minFurther listeningHe Said She SaidDr Charlotte Proudman, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 9hr 35minThe award-winning barrister’s account of a career spent defending female victims of male abuse throws light on the workings of the family law courts and the iniquities of a legal system built by men.

A tone-perfect meditation on illness and recovery, partnership and writing, violence and historical neglect, it is an absolute cracker. There are subtle nods to Derek Mahon and Seamus Heaney, and many of the poems are filled with a sense of late style and unfinished business.Political memoirs are usually terrible, often screeds of self-justification and revenge, but Nicola Sturgeon’sFranklyrewrites the rules. She’s a proper writer, for a start, and knows how to consort with self-doubt, ambivalence, regret, love and kindness, openness to change, and many of the things that actually make people. I look forward to what she writes next.I found a new writer – new to me, though beloved of Norwegians for years. He is the late Dag Solstad and I devoured his novelShyness and Dignityin two sittings. It tells the story of a literature teacher of 25 years’ standing who suddenly loses his head while trying to deal with a broken umbrella. He is having a crisis and the novel charts it in an illuminating, unfussy way, creating something beautiful.I want to offer more freshly baked goods to my friends.

Each chapter details a success story in the capitalist transition from the fossil fuel economy to renewable energy and climate solutions, focusing on individuals who have made a huge difference. There is plenty of detail and information I hadn’t come across before, despite my intensive reading around the subject.Although some issues are contentious, such as carbon capture and storage – and Bill Gates has proved to be less of a climate solutions man than is claimed in the book, with his fossil fuel investments – on the whole, the developments described give a tremendous amount of hope. They show that certain governments have worked in tandem with private enterprise and are already heading in the right direction, while the new technology is developing apace. The scientific explanations are excellent, too. I had no idea how solar panels worked, for example.Patricia Lockwood, writerElaine Kraf’s Find Him! is being reissued in November, so it’s the perfect time to read it, or reread her shimmery, paisley-printedThe Princess of 72nd Street.Down BelowbyLeonora Carringtonis a classic. It’s not the direct model for my latest novel, Will There Ever Be Another You, but I remember reading it on a park bench in summer of 2020 and thinking: this is what is happening to me.

She herself has made a successful franchise out of failure with her How to Fail podcast. She understands failure and she understands that it may be too tempting to luxuriate in it, rather than seeing how quickly it can turn into success and back again.Day began her career with thoughtful, intimate novels about the fault lines of family life.Scissors, Paper, StoneandHome Fireswere old-fashioned, heartfelt works about how cruelty trickles down the generations and how lives can be tentatively remade. Then she more ambitiously embraced the thriller genre on the one hand and a larger social canvas on the other. This has presented dangers: her last novel,Magpie, risked sacrificing characterisation altogether for the sake of a grand midway reveal; before that,The Partywas so plot-driven and backstory-laden that it lacked the fine-grained intimacy of her earlier works. One of Us is a sequel to The Party, but it’s a much stronger, more distinctive novel, better read as a standalone work. Here she has returned to the intimate family dynamics at which she excels, combined with a brilliantly propulsive, almost whodunnit-ish plot and an astute analysis of power. Because the family in question is now at the heart of British political life.Martin Gilmour and Ben Fitzmaurice are schoolfriends in their late 40s. Martin was once an awkward scholarship boy, in love with the glamorous, aristocratic Ben, who protected him from bullies and asked for absolute loyalty in return. When Ben killed an undergraduate girlfriend drink-driving, sober Martin pretended to be the driver. Since then, Ben has continued to manipulate his way out of trouble and into power: he’s now energy secretary, and has managed to cover up the scandalous circumstances of his sister Fliss’s suicide. At the end of The Party, Ben cut Martin off. Now, a decade later, Ben’s wife, Serena, invites him to Fliss’s funeral, wanting to wreak revenge on her philandering husband. Martin is seeking revenge of his own for being dropped, and will be aided by Ben’s daughter, Cosima, an angry teenager keen to bring her father down.The novel is wilfully big-boned, mixing levity and real substance, and risking unwieldiness as it does soMartin’s stylish, witty first-person narration is interspersed with third-person sections told from the point of view of Serena, Cosima, a rival Tory MP called Richard Take, and even Fliss from beyond the grave. There are several transformations here, and the book hinges on the question of whether the moral revolutions taking place for the characters can parallel some kind of societal change. This is where Richard Take comes in. He, like Martin, resents the Fitzmaurices of the world for their easy assumption of power. Disgraced for watching porn in the House of Commons, he has become an unexpected success after appearing on Shit Happens!, a reality TV show where celebrities become sewage workers. Now he pledges support to Ben’s campaign to become prime minister, before joining Martin in trying to destroy him out of some combination of self-interest and a genuine desire to change politics.The novel is wilfully big-boned, mixing levity and real substance, and risking unwieldiness as it does so. The social satire can feel like a series of memes – which says as much about the banality of our moment as about Day’s writing. Cosima is committed to “Oblivion Oil”, hurling paint at sculptures; her brother is a fan of Jordan Peterson; Ben’s unscrupulous, expensive lawyer is the father of the boy who gets Martin cancelled at the university where he lectures for using the word “Orientalist” (“Yes, I do identify as male so it’s fine to call me ‘Mr’,” the student swaggers). All this would be too familiar to be interesting if Day hadn’t taken the unpredictable and energising step of centring her story on the inner lives of Tory MPs, and seeing them as capable of change and redemption. She has also created a genuinely unreliable narrator in Martin, and set herself the extra challenge of showing him becoming more reliable; while through him she investigates the value of the language of therapy.The novel opens with Martin sent by his university to a therapist to address his “cultural sensitivity issues”. He needs, he is told, to acknowledge his own vulnerability, to feel his own feelings. Martin is sure that the flaw in this is that he’s a much worse person than the therapist can believe. “I don’t know how she’d cope if I told her I’m fundamentally repellent. Unlovable even by my own shoddy standards and incapable of loving others.” But over the course of the novel, he discovers – with the reader always a couple of steps ahead of him – that his repellent actions are driven by love rather than hate; he learns, unwillingly, to feel.What’s interesting here is that Day is able both to skewer the therapist’s platitudes and to show how they contribute to the novel’s complex vision of redemption. Like so many of Day’s characters, Martin is damaged by his childhood, and does become happier after he accepts his own feelings and allows himself to be open to ordinary contentment. Ben, Serena, Cosima and even Richard Take are learning similar lessons, and because some of them have political influence, there’s the potential here for a new kind of politics in which the ordinary life matters. Ultimately, it’s appropriate that the therapy-speak proves redemptive. It’s the language of our moment, and Day’s project is in part to show that there is more energy and potential in our moment than we might fear.But, thankfully, there are other kinds of feeling and authority in the mix too. Serena and Cosima both become preoccupied by mythical figures who have found grander, more violently exciting ways to deal with wrongs, from Judith slaying Holofernes to Lilith vowing disobedience, and these are never quite forgotten. Ben and Serena are at their closest when they can understand “each other’s wickedness in a way no one else can, and what is this if not a kind of love?” Shared wickedness as love? Why not? One of Us is all the better for not giving up on its own darkness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The Mughals always regarded it as a much more refined place than India and looked to it as the source of the region’s greatest poets and artists, calligraphers and miniaturists, architects and tile makers. As recently as the early 1970s, at the height of the hippy trail, asAfghanistanfilled with travellers “high on weed and low on cash”, Kabul was still known as the Paris of the east. Memoirs of the time describe a world of miniskirts, jazz clubs, bowling alleys and ice-cream parlours. This world was linked to a poor but extremely beautiful rural hinterland where life revolved around the vine harvest and the annual arrival of nomad caravans from the Wakhan corridor.A quick flick through guidebooks of the time reveals an Afghanistan unimaginably different from today: of royal levees and fashion shows and apres-ski restaurants. Facing a photo of a gargantuan mound of melons – “delicious Afghan fruits are a treat for travellers” – you’d see a picture of “a tourist and his hunting party in the Pamir mountains with a Marco Polo sheep”. Most poignant of all are images of the priceless treasures of the Kabul Museum, almost of all which are now missing or destroyed, after looting during the mujahideen takeover of Kabul in the 1990s and the smashing up of what remained by the Taliban in 2001.In such guidebooks, there was only one place to stay: the InterContinental. This is “the finest hotel in Kabul” of foreign correspondent Lyse Doucet’s charming and often surprising memoir. “The Intercon”, as it was known, was a beacon of sophistication where Paris couturiers opened fashionable boutiques and Italian coiffeurs competed with their rival salons. Celebrated Afghan singing stars such as Ahmad Zahir (the “Elvis of Afghanistan”) lolled by the pool while his Afghan Vogue-model girlfriend shimmied past in her bikini. In the evening, guests could choose whether to drink Afghan brandy in the Nuristan cocktail lounge, dine onescargotsin the Pamir supper club or attend the annual Miss Afghanistan contest in the ballroom, followed by dancing to Gloria Gaynor in the basement discotheque.Doucet acknowledges that the Kabul InterContinental, “a white box of cement and steel”, was always, from its opening in 1969, “an iridescent bubble floating above the city’s cares”. She even hints that the kind of libertine western modernity that the hotel represented, and the corruption that financed it in what was still one of the poorest countries in the world, was partly responsible for stirring up resentments that eventually led to catastrophic and violent reactions – first Marxist, then Islamist. Nevertheless, Doucet succeeds in making the hotel an oddly successful frame for a sweeping social history of Afghanistan over the last half century and a moving symbol of its remarkable ability to endure whatever horrors fate has thrown at it.The book opens soon after President Biden has pulled the plug on US military assistance, with a description of the tragic disintegration of a 2021 wedding feast in the hotel. The news arrives that President Ashraf Ghani has fled the country and the Taliban are at the city’s gates. Guests scatter as a Taliban pickup is spotted trundling up the hill to the hotel; the bride bursts into tears and Naeem, the banquet manager, tells the groom: “Comfort your bride! If you don’t show courage today you will always disappoint her.”Doucet then doubles back to the 1969 opening during the glory days of the Zahir Shah monarchy, as Kabul pullulated with nightclubs and the InterContinental played host to black-tie dinners in the only cold war capital where western and Soviet diplomats routinely invited each other to their parties. We follow the hotel through two successive coup d’etats, the assassinations of three presidents in two years, the Soviet invasion, the successful mujahideen counterattack and the rise of the Taliban. Somehow, throughout it all, the hotel manages to remain open.What sustains the book is Doucet’s focus on the ordinary Afghans who keep the place going despite the shelling, rockets, suicide bombs and occasional massacres of both staff and guests. These are terrible affairs: during the era between the two Taliban governments, three successive suicide squads broke through rings of hotel security to maraud along the guest floors, shooting diners, throwing grenades down stairwells after fleeing staff, peppering cupboards full of hiding waiters with machine gun fire.Today, despite everything, the hotel remains a monument to Afghan resilience and to the bravery and persistence of its staff. In Doucet, and her witty, observant and sometimes heartbreaking book, they have found a worthy chronicler.The Finest Hotel in Kabul by Lyse Doucet is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£25).

The button I have to press to summon her is right next to the button I need to press to heal my samurai during a fight and I often fumble with my thumb and call her straight into a chaotic seven-on-one brawl. Mochizuki frequently gallops full pelt into an arrow or catches a sword-swipe from one of my outlaw enemies as I roll out of the way. Sometimes she stands on the edge of the skirmish, calmly waiting for me to finish disembowelling bad guys so that we can resume our picturesque adventures across the region of Ezo.Ghost of Yōtei is the follow-up to American studio Sucker Punch’s reverent samurai action gameGhost of Tsushima, from 2020. Most of the time it looks exceptionally well-directed, no matter what you’re doing: tense standoffs against formidable swordsmen, following a golden bird or a sprinting wolf across the landscape to find a secret natural spring or shrine, scaling a mountain to sneak your way into a tightly guarded fortress. But no open-world game’s dignified framing can survive the addition of a wayward player, and so sometimes I make it look entirely ridiculous by accidentally calling my horse into a fight, or setting myself on fire by mistake.View image in fullscreenAlong for the ride … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentI found Ghost of Tsushima to be extraordinarily beautiful, but also shallow and oddly dour. Its protagonist Jin couldn’t stop talking about how dishonourable he found the whole business of sneaking around and cutting Mongol invaders’ throats to save his island. Yōtei’s hero Atsu, meanwhile, is much more comfortable in her role as vengeful mass-murdering spectre. The story itself is hardly groundbreaking – Atsu’s family is murdered by a group of masked outlaws called the Yōtei Six, and she vows to track them down and bury them one by one – but star Erika Ishii gives such a good performance here as a stony-faced killer that I was fully drawn into Atsu’s bloody quest. No matter how many other characters sombrely remind her of the consuming of vengeance, she just keeps slicing up her enemies. You get the impression that she rather enjoys it.And honestly,Ienjoy it. The fighting in Ghost of Yōtei is deliciously brutal. Though you can carve your way through Ezo with a basic understanding of evasion, parrying and well-timed sword strikes, the frequent fighting is enlivened as you learn how to use dual katana, a spear, a bow and the oversizedōdachisword. The set-piece standoffs particularly never lost their challenge, as Atsu circles imposing generals twice her size, knowing that a few strikes are enough to finish her off. I play a lot of challenging action games, from Monster Hunter to Elden Ring, and I often find the combat in free-roaming games such as this rather unexciting. But after more than 20 hours of duels and free-for-alls, I’m still not so powerful that my foes fall before me with barely any effort – and therefore, I’m not bored.View image in fullscreenComfortable in combat … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony/Sucker PunchAlongside this year’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows (also set in historical Japan), Ghost of Yōtei is the most graphically beautiful game I have ever seen. There is such veneration in this digital tribute to Japan’s natural beauty, in the ginkgo trees and distant mountains, the sparse plains, rivers teeming with fish (you can spear them for your supper). This is a world built to be admired: you navigate with your eyes and your ears rather than an on-screen map. The wind shows you where to go to continue the story, but I truly felt free to wander, and it’s in that wandering that you find succinct side stories and moments of quiet. Charmingly, you can use the PS5’s controller to roast fish over a fire, play the shamisen or daub strokes of ink on canvas; returning to Atsu’s memories in familiar locations lets you relive her life before it was overtaken by violence.The music, which marries old west-style rhythms and traditional Japanese instruments, reminds me that this is 1600s Japan through an American lens. There’s probably more action and blood and death-defying climbing than in any samurai movie, but is that a bad thing? If anything Ghost of Tsushima was held back by its slavish devotion to a sombre tone that was at odds with the game’s very high body count. Yōtei does not overcomplicate things, as Assassin’s Creed Shadows does, with too many distractions, things to collect or people to recruit or bases to build. It is endearingly straightforward, and I found it very easy to enjoy. Whenever I was bored of pursuing one target, it was easy to find something else to do.View image in fullscreenPart of the landscape … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony/Sucker PunchAs Atsu’s legend grows, the people of Ezo start leaving offerings for the vengefulonryō(bloodthirsty ghost) tearing through the land’s oppressors. As you travel Ezo, you do begin to feel part of it, as Atsu is, joined in battle by wolves and pursuing scampering foxes to find hidden places in nature. I started to wonder what would happen to Atsu once her vengeance quest was complete: she can envision no life afterwards, and I wondered if she would simply melt into the wind that had guided her.This might be a straightforward tale at heart, but it has absorbed me more than any other historical action game. Even hours and hours in, I still feel a flicker of excitement whenever Atsu purposefully draws her sword at the beginning of a battle. I will be sad to see the end of it.Ghost of Yōtei is out now, £69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesFighting gamesAction gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not the best – not even close. Even at Louis Vuitton, where he became the first Black man to oversee the label’s menswear in 2018, he preferred to print on T-shirts rather than tailor them. But as a pop-culture-obsessed polymath who approached fashion with a teenager’s enthusiasm, his high-low take on streetwear sought to open up the rarefied world of fashion to kids like him who had historically been shut out of it, whether he was putting his stamp on Evian bottles, Ikea rugs, or £8,000 bags.View image in fullscreenPop-culture polymath … portrait of Virgil Abloh by Alessio Segala.Photograph: Alessio SegalaThe scale of his impact on design can’t be measured in stuff, but Virgil Abloh: The Codes, the first exhibition devoted purely to the late fashion designer’s whopping 20,000-item archive, demonstrates that he was as much a voracious collector of things – the titular codes – as he was a maker of it.Curated by Abloh’s collaborators Chloe and Mahfuz Sultan along with his widow, Shannon, this two storey exhibition uses his belongings to show his journey from the son of Ghanaian immigrants in Illinois to architect, graphic designer, DJ, and finally one of the biggest designers in the world.The layout is like a garage sale. Huge piles of folded Off-White T-shirts and Nike trainer collaborations sit alongside paintbrushes, scissors, and teenage laptops. A pair of Nike Air Jordan 1s have been turned inside out, while one of his leather handbags emblazoned with the word “sculpture” (quotation marks were one of his design hallmarks) sits alone on a stool.The more immersive exhibits include his office at Louis Vuitton (he famously referred to his phone as his desk) and a full-size DJ booth; proof of his cultural reach, growing up in Illinois in the 00s, his DJ name back then was Flat White.The signposting is minimal, and while some of the more gnomic additions – various USB sticks and mixtapes in glass vitrines – will only make sense to his diehard fans, it is a fascinating insight into the mind of a late millennial growing up in a capitalist world before TikTok.At times it can feel overwhelming, but the codified layout is also how Abloh operated. He would record his interviews with journalists on tapes which he kept in order to revisit and pore over as his work evolved. The tapes are presumably among the remaining objects still in storage which – judging by the reception and queues outside – will probably see the light of day in future exhibitions.View image in fullscreenOverwhelming … some of the objects on display at Virgil Abloh: The Codes.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersAbloh’s stint at Louis Vuitton was very successful but it was his collaborations with global brands which transcended the appeal of his tailoring, approaching each item – a Rimowa suitcase, a Nike trainer, the aforementioned Evian bottles – as if he was sampling a song. This stemmed from his “3% approach” – the idea that you could create a new design by changing an original by just 3%.Opening for just 10 days during Paris fashion week at the Grand Palais – scarcity hype was a very Ablohian strategy –the timed queues outside on its opening day suggest it wasn’t simply the hottest ticket in town, but that it was ludicrous to think that Abloh’s legacy would simply vanish from fashion’s slipstream after his death.Virgil Abloh: The Codes is atthe Grand Palais, Paris, until 9 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArt and designVirgil AblohreviewsShareReuse this content"

Well, most of the time there weren’t, although this exhibition does introduce you to one. From the Old Kingdom to the time of Cleopatra, the ancient Egyptians expected very much the same things of their artists, in a style that barely changed. An extraordinary limestone stela, or engraved slab, that was lent to the Fitzwilliam by the Louvre shows how young Egyptian artists were taught to see in the “correct” way, to make nature conform to the official style. A square grid demonstrates how to calculate proportions to render, for instance, a cat in a perfectly still profile, like a little feline god, an abstraction that was to be repeated for millennia.Yet Made in Ancient Egypt strives to take you beyond the sublime formal facade to glimpse the artists or, as it calls them more cautiously, “makers” behind the golden coffin portraits and pharaohs’ statues. “Who built the seven gates of Thebes?” asked Bertolt Brecht in his poem A Worker Reads History. Here they are, the metalworkers, woodworkers, weavers. In a wooden model made about 4,000 years ago, female workers seated on the ground weave on a loom while others stand spinning thread. You can see a fine example of such women’s handiwork, a white dress made 4,500 years ago. It hangs up, spooky as hell.View image in fullscreenCommemorative stela of the faience maker, Rekhamun, 1295-1186BC.Photograph: © National Museums ScotlandBut it was the one famous artistic genius here who held me most. A sculpted head of a girl in red quartzite, her eyes now empty almond-shaped holes, has a tiny face but a huge bald dome of a head, out of proportion with her delicate features. It comes from a period when Egypt’s cultural continuity was radically interrupted by the reign of Akhenaten from about 1353 to 1336BC. He revolutionised religion and encouraged artists to go wild, go real. The girl is probably one of his daughters, exuding eerie beauty. But there’s more. Found at Akhenaten’s capital Amarna, this masterpiece comes from a house near that of the star sculptor Thutmosis, whose home and workshop was discovered by German archaeologists in 1912. It has his style. He also created Egypt’s most famous work, the bust of Nefertiti. This anything but sensationalist exhibition leaves you to deduce that the two are probably by the same artist: the ancient Egyptian Leonardo.But this was a world in which art was too important to be sold and auctioned, exhibited and criticised. It was part of a religion dedicated to life after death and most ancient Egyptian art comes from tombs, where it had magical purposes. Even here, individual creators made their mark – often literally. In a frieze between two gods, an artist has scratched a now illegible name. Another maker has left a handprint beneath a clay “soul house”, a home for the dead.Documents hint at working conditions, which weren’t too bad. Ancient Egypt seems not to have been the oppressive slave-society stereotypes suggest. On this evidence, it was a land of skilled craftspeople who could make demands on employers. A record of work absences from the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings, inscribed on limestone almost 4,000 years ago, records the entire workforce taking two days off for a colleague’s funeral. You imagine it was a beer-fuelled sendoff.View image in fullscreenSheer skill … Glass Bottle in the Form of a Bunch of Grapes, 1295-1069BC.Photograph: Maurice et Pierre Chuzeville/© Musée du Louvre, Dist. Grand Palais Rmn. Photo Maurice et Pierre ChuzevilleThese skilled people – “hemut” – could be so successful they got fancy funerals, the aspiration of all ancient Egyptians, and put up monuments that record not just individuals but their families, for talents such as working with bronze, which were passed down, just like craft skills would be around the world for millennia to come.A block-like model here shows artists how a sphinx should be made, but ultimately this fascinating quest for the hands that carved the Great Sphinx is quixotic. There is an ineffable mystery to ancient Egypt. Where it succeeds is in making you look at Egyptian art beyond the magic and mythology to admire the sheer skill: wooden chairs with animal-feet legs, a glass bottle in the form of a bunch of grapes, an exquisite copy of the Book of the Dead. You marvel at the precision, passion and playfulness of ancient Egypt’s creators.Every artist leaves an autobiography, in their dedication and flamboyance, even in the skills passed on through Egypt’s history, which came together in this culture’s great collective work – the commemoration and preservation of the dead. The wooden board that lay over the mummy of a man who died 3,000 years ago resembles a spaceship designed to take him to the stars. On the inside, there’s a gold painting of a solar boat in which he might journey through the sky. This is art for eternal life’s sake. But it is also art that preserves the name of a worker, for the deceased is Nespawershefyt who had risen to be an overseer of craftsmen at a temple. His team saw him off in style, with a golden visage as fine as a pharaoh’s.“The books are filled with names of kings,” complained Brecht’s history-reading worker. But Nespawershefyt’s name survives through art.Made in Ancient Egypt is atThe Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, from 3 October to 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtCambridgeExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We are all children of someone, many of us parents too, and she finds it odd that so few representations of such a common experience exist.In her 2011 novelNight Waking, she combines the story of Anna, an Oxford academic worn ragged by bringing up her boys, Raphael and Moth, with a historical investigation into infant mortality. It is set on a deserted Hebridean island, where her neglectful husband Giles – so lightly drawn, he is scarcely a character at all – is preoccupied by tracking the declining puffin population. The novel juxtaposes the messy business of 21st-century child-rearing with speculations on the parental attitudes of an even messier past.Universal though child-rearing may be, one parent’s sleep-deprived night is much like another’s. On the page, Anna’s attempts to pursue a career while catering to the demands of a needy toddler and a fatalistic seven-year-old, although repetitious and familiar, do at least gather a sort of delirious intensity. On the stage, by contrast, the lack of tonal variation is wearing.This is especially the case given the decision by writer Shireen Mula and director Rebecca Atkinson-Lord ofAn Tobar and Mull Theatreto adapt the book for a single actor. There is some sense in this: the novel is told entirely from Anna’s put-upon perspective. But however sharply actor Nicola Jo Cully marks the transitions from character to character – and she marks them very sharply indeed – it is a laborious way to tell a story.Against Hugo Dodsworth’s large-scale projections of island landscapes, Cully captures the stresses and insecurities of a multitasking mother, but a production that seems to want to make a point about rural deprivation comes across as a more trivial tale of self-absorption.Touring until 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTraverse theatreSarah MossreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her rancour at being so overshadowed is clear in Cian Griffin’s slowly intriguing play, situated 13 years after Pollock’s death (in a car crash, at the age of 44, while intoxicated), but so is her devotion to him, and her toughness.Krasner (Helen Goldwyn, fantastically crabby) is working in her studio, designed by Ian Nicholas, with paintings wrapped around the walls of the auditorium, when Hank (Will Bagnall), a teenage delivery boy from her local Long Island grocery store interrupts her.He is an aspiring artist and wants to show her his portfolio, he says, but then pulls out a painting that Pollock gave his late father, decades ago, in exchange for unpaid groceries. It is an early work with no signature, which he wants Krasner to authenticate.View image in fullscreenA Socratic dialogue between artist and disciple … Will Bagnall as Hank and Helen Goldwyn as Lee Krasner in Lee at Park theatre.Photograph: Giacomo GiannelliDirected by Jason Moore, the play seems to unravel like a Socratic dialogue at first between the artist and the disciple about the purpose of art and why Krasner paints, with the latter delivering peals of wisdom and shoehorning in messages about the absence of female artists in the canon.But the awkward exposition and biography gradually fall away to reveal an affecting play about an artist who has been overshadowed for much of her life, yet has lost none of her passion or drive for her work.The ghost of Pollock (Tom Andrews) occasionally stalks the stage as a memory or critical inner voice. He judges, mansplains and fights with her (“I hate what you’ve done with the place,” he says of the studio, in one funny line). His lover is mentioned (she was also in the car crash, but survived) and so is his alcoholism. The script manages to convey a sense of genuine love and collaboration between the couple, as well as their open hostility.It suggests that Krasner, at the very least, co-founded the drip technique that Pollock became famed for, and traverses its central theme of intellectual (and actual) theft within a romantic partnership in a succinct yet subtle way.It turns into deft writing, with performances that feel real; Goldwyn is particularly strong as an artist who is tormented by the overbearing shadow of her celebrated husband, yet painting on regardless, simply because she can’t not.AtPark theatre, London, until 18 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreJackson PollockArtPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Well, let me tell you: these are absolutely nothing compared to Cate Blanchett and her indefatigable animus towards … the leaf blower. Seemingly every single leaf blower.Truly, this is one of the greatest celebrity animosities of this century. The earliest extant Blanchett-rant on the subject is aW Magazine interview, way back in 2007, when she ambiguously characterised leaf blowers – a lot of fence-sitting here – as “everything that is wrong with the human race”.In the 18 years since, the two-time Oscar winner has ranted about leaf blowers: while munching her way through chicken wings onHot Ones(“Gardeners, their faces … they know what they’re doing is stupid”); onSubway Takes(“Leaf blowers need to be eradicated from the face of the Earth”);during the press tourfor her film Black Bag (“If you see someone with a leaf blower, doesn’t your blood pressure go up?”); and even on the red carpetat the world premiereforWhere’d You Go, Bernadette(for the avoidance of doubt: “I hate them so much”). She even shoehorned them into apress conference at Cannesfor a film very much not about leaf blowers (the film’s director: “This again?”).Blanchett’s abhorrence of the leaf blower has become so renowned that she has fully leaned in,appearing in a sketchwith herBorderlandsco-star Gina Gershon. This passionate detestation has, as you might imagine, not gone unremarked upon by internet denizens. There are now a number ofcompilationsof Blanchett bitching about leaf blowers, while memes abound. The actor isn’t surprised because, as shecorrectly asserts, “I talk about them all the time.” It’s a celeb obsession only matched by Helen Mirren constantly bringing up her sadness that Kurt Cobain died before the invention of GPS (I’m serious).But it hasn’t escaped my notice that Blanchett is not the only A-lister made irate by the commonplace gardening device. Michael Fassbenderjoined her condemnation(“Bring back the rake!”) during a shared interview (to no one’s surprise, Fassbender did not introduce the topic). Danny DeVito has a hatred of leaf blowers to rival the Aussie’s. DeVito monologued on the showLovett or Leave It: “I know everyone’s got to make a living … I used to be a gardener. We did everything with a broom – you don’t take a fucking thing and make all the noise and blow the leaves from one neighbour to the next. And then their gardener blows them back to you. And on aSaturday? Fuck you, man.”View image in fullscreenCate Blanchett holding a leaf blower.Photograph: YouTubeOther stars that have gone on record with their enmity? Hugh Grant, describing them in a junket as one of his pet peeves, and then doubling down – and how – tellingSeth Meyers: “Anyone who uses a leaf blower, or hires anyone else to use a leaf blower, should have it rectally inserted.” This is not the sole time Grant has mooted sodomising individuals with their own garden apparatus,tweetingin 2018 that this would be a policy of his “when I am prime minister”. (Not sure that take would have made it into Love Actually, in which he played the role of PM.) In Vanity Fair’s Proust questionnaire Grantanswered the question“which living person do you most despise?” with “[anyone] … who uses a leaf blower”.Ricky Gervais? Hates ‘em. (“I want to ban leaf blowers. Why have they got leaf blowers? What are they doing? It’s bad for the environment, it’s noisy … it’s pointless,” he saidon the Stick to Football podcast). Teri Hatcher, appearing on Inside the Actors Studio two decades ago,responded to“what sound or noise do you hate?” with: “I know, because it happens every Saturday morning at 7 o’clock”.Cue her impression of a leaf blower. “I just wanna yell out of my bedroom window: isn’t that illegal?!”Tom Conti, one of Britain’s greatest living thesps, was soenraged by his neighbours’method of lawn maintenance that he went on a Channel 4 documentary to complain, uttering the immortal line: “If these people can’t stand the sight of a leaf then it’s not a leaf blower they need; it’s a psychiatrist.” Meanwhile, Rainn Wilson, of The Office, gotinto a spat with Elon Musk, accusingone of the greatest villains of our timethe entrepreneur of stealing his idea of a “quiet electric leaf blower”. (Musk taking credit for someone else’s ideas? Who’d have thought?)When I am Prime Minister (it can’t be long) my first move will be to compel anyone who uses, or hires anyone to use, a leaf blower to wear it, rectally, for a week.  With it switched on.— Hugh Grant (@HackedOffHugh)October 12, 2018Never before has such an ostensibly unassuming – but, given the racket they produce, actually obnoxious – instrument brought together so many disparate Hollywood luminaries in shared seething contempt. But if Hollywood as the collective noun for industry players can be said to despise leaf blowers, so does Los Angeles the city and the surrounding LA county itself.Beverly Hills, home to the great and the good and Ashton Kutcher, was one of the first cities to ban gas-powered leaf blowers, implementing the policy way back in 1978. West Hollywood proscribed them in 1986. Santa Monica in 1991. Los Angeles followed suit in 1998, prohibitingthemwithin 500ft of residential property after a 12-yearcampaignspearheaded by Peter Graves, star of the funniest film ever made (Airplane!, obviously).Julie Newmar, the original on-screen Catwoman, was another big name leading the charge. The Brentwood residenttriedplaying Mozart at full blast to block out the noise. When that didn’t work, she tried industrial strength earmuffs, but said that this made it hard for her to answer the phone.Other Newmar tacticsincluded the distribution of DIY leaflets (“Ah, for the sound of rakes and brooms on a walk or driveway …” she wrote). Finally, she sent a letter to the then-Los Angeles mayor, threatening to move, very specifically, to New Zealand.View image in fullscreenPeter Graves speaking at a city council hearing.Photograph: YouTubeAlso involved wasMeredith Baxter, star of the 80s sitcom Family Ties. In one council meeting, in support of a point made by Graves and his wife concerning leaf blowers spreading not just leaves, but fungus, animal faeces and pesticides, Baxterpiped up: “Are we going to put gas masks on our kids? It flies in the face of all rational thinking to continue using leaf blowers!”Last year, in response to growing pressure, California governor Gavin Newsom issueda statewide banon the sale of new gas-powered leaf blowers and other small off-road engines (appropriately known as SOREs), but resale, existing and electric models remain exempt. But the continuing problem, as LA has found since its ban, is the law is almost impossible to enforce; by the time police arrive on the scene (and probably don’t) the offender has moved on.🍂🍂🍂There are serious and justified reasons for the backlash. Traditional leaf blowers spew out carcinogens, carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide, while any leaking fuel negatively affects soil quality and wildlife. Karen Jubanyik, an associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine, calls lawn equipment“one of the greatest polluters”in the US.As Blanchett has vehemently attested, they are “awful for the environment”, a point made too by the nature-loving Gervais. In her appearance on Subway Takes, Blanchettcited a studythat claimed operating a leaf blower for just half an hour is estimated to produce the same level of pollution as driving a pickup truck from Texas to Alaska. Los Angeles in particular is a city of cars, but automobiles are becoming cleaner much faster, thanks to advancing electric vehicle technology and evolving legislation; so much so that pollution caused by SOREs could bedouble thatof passenger cars by 2031.The leaf blower’s impact on mental and physical health is also substantial. They can produce noise levels of up to112 decibels; louder than a rock concert;slightlylouder than someone shouting down your ear; and not far behind a jet taking off from an airport. The World Health Organizationwarnsthat prolonged exposure to noise about 85 decibels can cause irreversible hearing loss.And the health impacts of noise pollution go beyond the aural.Charlotte Clark, a professor of environmental epidemiology at City St George’s, University of London, explains to me that environmental noise triggers biological responses in an individual. Here’s the science behind Blanchett et al’s rage: “Annoyance is a stress response to noise,” says Clark. “When sound enters the ears, it is interpreted by the amygdala in the brain – which handles endocrine and autonomic functions. If the amygdala is over-activated by noise, the endocrine system will increase levels of the stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. The sympathetic nervous system will also be hyper-activated.”Blanchett is correct about her rising blood pressure. Clark mentions that these biological responses, “triggered over a long time period are risk factors for cardio-metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart attacks and strokes.” Onestudyby the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine even linked certain types of noise pollution to higher rates of early death.Then there are the mental health effects: depression, anxiety, sensory overload, cognitive decline. Interestingly, Stephen Stansfeld, an emeritus professor of psychiatry who helped create the WHO guidelines on noise pollution in Europe, tells me that an added irritant when it comes to noise is any sense of arbitrariness: “One of the factors that contributes to annoyance is the necessity or usefulness of the activity causing the noise. Thus, if people feel the activity, such as leaf blowing, is unnecessary, it is likely to be more annoying.”View image in fullscreenA 1970s Echo Inc advertisement.Photograph: YouTube/Echo IncThis seems very much to be the case with Blanchett (“the wind is just gonna blow it back!”), Gervais (“it’s pointless!”) and DeVito (“these leaves are getting a great ride”) in particular.But not everyone in the Hollywood Hills is on the anti-blower side of the hedge. For obvious reasons, landscaping companies (think of theOutdoor Power Equipment Institute(OPEI) as Big Leaf) and their employees push back. The blower was first introduced in the state after the droughts of the 1970s, when residents stopped hosing down their lawns and driveways in an effort to conserve water. Spotting a gap in the market, Japanese companyEcho Incintroduced the wearable “clean-up machine”.Back then, many gardeners in the Los Angeles area were Japanese-American, but current workers are often low-paid and of Latino descent:jardineros. They argue that their work is much more laborious without the use of blowers, and that electric ones are nowhere near as efficient (there’s also an environmental impact there, too, with theissueof battery disposal). Some workers resent that blowers are deemed a nuisance by the same residents who demand perfect lawns in record time.In 1998, fighting against the Peter Graves-led campaign, 12 workers from the Association of Latin American Gardeners of Los Angeles (ALAGA) camped outside the city hall and evenwent on hunger strikein an attempt to overturn the ban. Their victory wasn’t full-blown, but they did manage to lessen proposed punitive measures (for instance, potential six-month jail terms).Patrick Shen, director of the award-winning documentaryIn Pursuit of Silence, which explores the “deeply unsatisfying, unhealthy” effects of “our rapid-fire rhythms, the constant stimulation, and the ceaseless cacophony of noise around us all the time”, is sympathetic.Shen, who lives in a Los Angeles suburb, tells me: “On any given day, there’s a leaf blower somewhere disrupting what otherwise is a decently quiet neighbourhood. I fully support the legislation – so long as there are sizeable rebates available to landscapers to trade in their old gas-powered units. The burden most certainly shouldn’t be on these hard-working people.”🍁🍁🍁The ubiquity of leaf blowers and the strong emotions they provoke has proved fertile on-screen inspiration. There’s the critically acclaimed coming-of-age filmSopladora de Hojas(Leaf Blower), by Alejandro Iglesias, in which a group of Mexican teens search for lost keys in a pile of leaves. Then there’s Leafblowers:a gorgeously shot short film from Nownesswhich explores the “rising tension against a familiar hum” with LA director CG Watkins working with composer Billy Bultheel to push the sound of the machines “to an overwhelming level”. The protagonist, awoken by the surging burr, pops headache pills with a look of utter defeat and grips the edge of a kitchen unit, as masked workers dressed ominously all in black swing what look like the trunks of fighting elephants.View image in fullscreenA still from a film by Nowness.Photograph: Nowness/CG WatkinsAnother shortLeaf Blower Massacre(tagline: “When autumn arrives, no-one survives”), pays homage to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And then there’s Leaf Blower Massacre 2. (Presumably some people did, in fact, survive.)View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Leaf Blower Massacre.Illustration: Anthony Cooper/IMDbThe blower also has its place behind the camera. It can serve as such a handy low-budget prop that online tutorials for film-makers and SFX departments are plentiful. Often they’re used for supernatural effects or to cultivate an eerie atmosphere. (It’s quite possiblethis (not low budget) scenein Lord of the Rings utilised one, in addition to CGI.) There’s even a debate as to whether one of the most iconic movie scenes – American Beauty’splastic bag dancing in the wind– was created with the help of a leaf blower. Then there’s the manufactured glamour employment: flowing hair in adverts and high-end photoshoots (spot the man in singlet and jeans blasting Margaret Qualleyin this iD shoot).One usage Los Angeles citizens can get on board with is a more recent innovation. This summer anti-ICE protesters met the national guard on the streets of the city while “wielding leaf blowers” in a bid to disperse teargas. Or rather: “Mexican mom reveals sneaky riot tactic”, asone newspaper put it.And there is one big movie star who has spoken of the leaf blower in non-combative terms. David Oyelowo, who lives in the San Fernando Valley, north of Hollywood, once told a story on The Daily Show abouthis late father’s loveof the devices. “He’s got, like, four different leaf blowers. The problem is he never does the constant vroooooom. He goes vrooom … vrooom … vrooom … ”, Oyelowo said, imitating a staccato technique. “So for thehourthat he’s doing this … oh man.”For the love of God, nobody tell Cate.Explore more on these topicsFilmCate BlanchettHugh GrantGardensRicky GervaisMental healthDavid OyelowofeaturesShareReuse this content"

It taught him a lot, he says – but it’s a huge responsibilityThu 2 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 12.12 EDTShareKirk Jones was feeling nervous. The director was two weeks away from shooting his new film, a biopic of the pioneering Scottish Tourette syndrome campaigner John Davidson, and he still hadn’t seen his lead actor perform any of the script. Jones had been impressed by Robert Aramayo in the supernatural Netflix series Behind Her Eyes, and liked the actor when they met over Zoom.He then invited him to Galashiels, to meet Davidson in his home town, where he was convinced Aramayo was the right choice for the role. “I was confident enough not to feel the need to meet 50 other actors and audition them,” he says. But “I didn’t ask him to read”, he admits. “Looking back, I think that was insane.”His gamble paid off. When I Swear premiered at the Toronto International film festival in September,Varietydeemed Aramayo “flawless”,IndieWirepraised his “striking, star-making performance” andScreen Internationalmarked the actor out as “a major big-screen talent”. Aramayo is best known for playing Elrond in The Rings of Power, Amazon’s megabudget TV prequel to The Lord of the Rings, although Game of Thrones fans will remember him as the young Ned Stark. But his latest film feels like a throwback to a certain kind of British movie; like The Full Monty or Billy Elliot. I Swear is a social issue film, a tearjerker and a feelgood comedy, too. It’s a peach of a role for Aramayo, who portrays Davidson’s various tics with technical nuance and sensitivity, and importantly, nails the campaigner’s charisma.A week before the film’s premiere, I meet Aramayo in the basement of the Curzon Soho cinema in London. The 32-year-old is unassuming in a beige Patagonia hoodie and jeans, square-jawed but still boyish, and clean shaven with a mop of curly hair. He greets me warmly, orders a cappuccino and launches into a self-deprecating story about how he’s spent the morning making “a terrible audition tape”. A “proud Yorkshireman” and “massive Leeds United fan”, Aramayo has lived in New York since moving there to study at 18, but retains his East Yorkshire drawl.View image in fullscreenWalking the walk … Aramayo with Francesco Piacentini-Smith in I Swear.Photograph: Graeme Hunter/StudiocanalIn the opening scene of I Swear, the adult John Davidson is awarded an MBE, and on receiving it, accidentally shouts “Fuck the Queen!” Tourette syndrome is a neurological condition that induces physical and vocal tics such as twitching, shouting and spitting. According toTourettes Action, there are more than 300,000 people living with the condition in the UK. Aramayo says meeting Davidson was the first time he’d encountered someone living with Tourette’s, though he’s quick to suggest he may have met others without realising it.Davidson first developed Tourette’s at the age of 14. When he was a teenager, he was the subject of the BBC documentary John’s Not Mad. First broadcast in 1989, it is a time capsule of relative ignorance about the condition. I Swear dramatises his attempts to pursue a normal life in spite of that ignorance, one involving employment, dancing and girls.I talked to John about anything and everything. Not to impersonate him, to find his energy“People used to call John Davidson ‘Fuck off John’,” says Aramayo. Before making the film, he says, “like anybody else who hasn’t yet had the education, I would have thought it was all about swearing.” But coprolalia, or involuntary swearing, only affects around one in 10 people with Tourette’s, he says: “It is far more complex than that.” In the film, we see Davidson also juggling intrusive thoughts and OCD.Aramayo, who does not have Tourette syndrome, started to do more research. He read Evie Meg’s memoir My Nonidentical Twin and was struck by how the author “laughs with” her condition and “has fun with it”, he says. “It’s part of who she is.” He also spent time with Davidson in Galashiels, renting a house nearby “for about a month, maybe more”. He accompanied Davidson to the local community centre, where he has a job as a caretaker, to understand the pride he takes in his work. They went on dog walks, watched football and attended choir concerts together. “I just tried to get him talking about everything and anything,” Aramayo says. “I didn’t want to impersonate him, but I wanted to find his energy.”View image in fullscreenNow we’re Tolkien … Aramayo in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyA big part of that energy is Davidson’s mischievous streak. Aramayo’s performance is a dramatic one, but the scenarios in the film are often funny. At a job interview, his future employer asks him to make a cup of tea. “I use spunk for milk,” he accidentally blurts out. As a comedic set-piece, it’s irresistible, but Aramayo doesn’t play the moment for laughs. “A lot of the situations you see in the film are things that John himself laughs at,” he says. “I’ve been told those stories, and I know how he feels about them.” The film’s tone, he says, was something he and writer-director Jones discussed daily.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But, he says, “it’s not Carry On Tourette’s”.Before the film had been greenlit, Jones was considering casting an actor with Tourette’s. He tested a few scenes with Davidson, but the result was “nothing short of a disaster”. He felt uncomfortable asking Davidson to suppress his tics, and worse, to tic on cue. He says Davidson found the experience uncomfortable, too.“I did have trepidation, of course I did,” says Aramayo. The actor’s union Equity recentlycriticisedthe casting of a non-disabled actor in the lead role of a new production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, while a2025 studyfound that 80% of disabled characters on TV are portrayed by able-bodied actors. When asked how he plans to handle any scrutiny he might receive for portraying a condition he doesn’t have, Aramayo chooses his words carefully. “Look, it’s inevitable. But if we’re talking about casting, we’ve got to talk to the director, and to John, and the people who cast me in the role, and I was just really excited to play John,” he says.Aramayo grew up in Hull in the 1990s. His mother worked in foster care and had her own business selling safety clothing; his dad, he says, made sofas. At school, he was a performer who would often impersonate his teachers. “In a naughty way, yeah,” he says with a grin. “I had one Irish maths teacher … I got sent out big time.” When he was nine, he joined Hull Truck theatre’s youth programme. He’d seen his older sister, who was 11 at the time, in Richard Bean’s production of Under the Whaleback, which also featured an actor called Paul Popplewell (24 Hour Party People, Casualty). “I was like: ‘Wow. He’s cool.’” At school, acting didn’t feel like something he could pursue. But with Hull Truck, “that’s when it started to get serious”, he says.The path to becoming an actor was clear: audition for the London drama schools. “I wanted to do that,” he says, “but at the same time I wanted to try different things.” When he guilelessly Googled ‘Best drama school in the world’, the first result was Juilliard School, the performing conservatory in upper Manhattan. “It was stupid of me,” he says, laughing. “I was, like, 16.”Two years later, Aramayo was standing outside his new dorm room with his dad and sister when he saw two American college students with blue wheelie bins, running towards them at speed. “They were screaming: ‘Welcome to Juilliard!’” he remembers. “It was like they were coming to attack us. We were just three people from Hull.”View image in fullscreenStep in the right direction … Aramayo and Kirk Jones.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images/IMDbNew York City was a culture shock, and an education. Aramayo was reading classic US plays such as Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, and studying Nietzsche. “You were just trying to get your head above water,” he says., insisting that he’s “not an academic person”. Outside lessons, he worked for the university “painting or filing to try to earn some extra money”. His big city dream was expensive. “But it was good for me to learn that, and to survive on a budget,” he says.‘I had to tape my fingers together to stop me tearing the skin’: the reality of living with Tourette syndromeRead moreHis first year out of drama school was so exciting it “blew my head off”, he says. He landed a part as a sergeant in a six-part HBO series about the adventurers Lewis and Clark. It starred Casey Affleck, and involved three months of prep in Canada, in the woods. The production shot for a month, “and then it all went bang”, he says. Production was halted due to creative differences and the series was ultimately scrapped. “I didn’t understand the fragility of it.” Work, he realised, could disappear as quickly as it arrived. But “I gotGame of Thronesstraight afterwards”, he admits.Despite appearing in several shows with cult followings, Aramayo insists he rarely gets noticed. When Behind Her Eyescame out, audiences were rattled by Aramayo’s irreverent heroin addict, and the show’s supernatural twist ending. “I had some really funny interactions with people asking why I stole souls,” he says. “I’d say, ‘I’m sorry!’” He chuckles. I warn him that soon, it might start happening again, with all the praise and potential awards buzz for I Swear. Aramayo is not so sure. “You get a flurry of that stuff, and then it goes away very quickly,” he says firmly. “Then you’re back to trying to get a job.”Aramayo hopes the film will ring true for the many people with Tourette’s he’s encountered during the past year. “I just hope some of them watch it, and they’re happy with it,” he says. And as for Davidson? Jones says when he screened the film for him, “there were lots of hugs and kisses”.I Swear is in UK cinemas fromFriday.10 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBiopicsThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of PowerGame of ThronesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But I find them to be pointless accessories.Salt and pepper already come in plastic shakers from the supermarket,andwe also keep pink Himalayan salt in a small ceramic bowl from Spain, which we dispense using a wooden spoon. I like using the bowl, but Gene doesn’t because we often end up using our fingers to sprinkle the salt, which he says isn’t sanitary. But it’s just us in our home, so who cares?When we have people over, he says it’s ‘uncouth’ to have them sticking their hands into the bowlGene says it would be “more hygienic and convenient” if we didn’t keep the salt in an open bowl. But I don’t believe shakers will add to our life in any way. The plastic supermarket shakers do the job perfectly well, and I don’t think we should have more things cluttering the countertop or crowding our small wooden table.The other issue Gene has is about presentation and ease of use. When we have people over, he says it’s “uncouth” to have them sticking their hands into the bowl, which they sometimes do. One time our friend pinched the salt with her fingers, and Gene didn’t say anything until after she left, but he was really bothered. And he thinks supermarket shakers look tacky.He also wanted to decant all our soaps and washing-up liquid into plain containers. I just don’t see the point in doing that, whereas Gene is all about aesthetics. We have lived together for five years and he’s always been like this. According to him, it’s more eco-friendly to decant things instead of buying new plastic containers all the time, but I don’t think it makes a huge difference as we probably only buy salt and pepper twice a year.Rather than shakers, I think it’s more interesting to have a little bowl of salt from Spain, because it makes us look cultured and well travelled. Gene has spent hours browsing online and comparing little silver antique shakers to wooden ones. It’s too much effort. People managed without shakers for centuries.The defence: GeneProper shakers are more practical and elevate the table, showing it was laid with care and intentionSalt and pepper shakers are often dismissed as decorative or unnecessary, but they serve a practical purpose. The main benefit is hygiene.Open bowls of salt, no matter how charming or artisanal they look, invite people to dip fingers in or fumble with spoons. When guests do this, I shudder at the thought of all the bacteria in there. A shaker, on the other hand, keeps seasonings covered and dispensed cleanly.There’s also the matter of presentation. When guests are over, details count. A pair of well-chosen shakers elevates the table, while plastic or glass supermarket containers look temporary and out of place. Debbie thinks it’s funny, but I like to decant everything for aesthetics. People might not comment on these little details, but presentation helps create an atmosphere, and small touches matter. A table laid with intention feels different from one cobbled together with whatever packaging happened to come from the shop.I want wooden shakers to match our kitchen counters. Debbie doesn’t really careConvenience is another factor. Shakers are designed for speed and consistency. A quick shake gives just the right amount without fumbling or measuring. I’ve ruined many dishes by over-sprinkling salt. Shakers would occupy the same space that the supermarket containers do, but they’d help us ration the salt in our meals – and they also look nice.I want wooden ones to match our kitchen counters and our dining table. Debbie doesn’t really care, but she once expressed an interest in some antique Victorian silver ones, which I’m open to. However, I’d like to see her show more interest in our purchase, as she will be using them too. I don’t understand the pushback.Proper shakers combine hygiene, practicality, and presentation in a way that open bowls and disposable plastic containers can’t. A small change, maybe, but one that makes a difference in the feel of a shared home. Debbie should be grateful she has a man who cares so deeply about the little things.The jury of Guardian readersIt seems like Debbie will be relatively unaffected by this purchase, whereas it will make Gene a lot happier. And given the times we live in, it feels nice to find occasion to add a little more beauty to the world – or even just the table.Rebecca, 31Gene may be correct about the appearance of the dinner table, but he really needs to get over himself: the notion of decanting everything strikes me as hugely unnecessary and a salt shaker won’t stop you over-salting a dish. Salt is a natural biocide anyway, so the chances of catching something from sharing a small bowl must be tiny.Bob, 72Debbie should relinquish the salt bowl in favour of some chic new shakers. Gene’s desire to optimise their home might seem a bit over the top, but there isn’t anything wrong with it as long as he doesn’t impose the task of decanting on Debbie.Daisy, 26It’s nice to have aesthetically pleasing things in your home, and Gene seems to genuinely care about making the place look good for them both. Decanting the washing-up liquid may be a bit much, but if he wants to spend his time doing that, each to their own.Sophie, 41If hygiene is the issue, wash your hands before touching the salt. Aesthetics is a personal preference but pepper from a grinder tastes better than pre-ground and you can measure salt better by the pinch than from a shaker.Matt, 30Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who you think should lay the tableThe poll closes on Wednesday 8 October at 9am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherDani should pay for the cleaning billat the Airbnb her family rented.99%of you said yes –Dani is guilty1%of you said no –Dani is not guiltyYou be the judge - live!As part of a specialGuardian Live eventon Wednesday 26 November, Georgina Lawton will be hosting an IRL version of this column.

She discusses how to recognise the signs – and recoverEmine SanerThu 2 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 10.19 EDTShareMany of Kathleen Saxton’s clients only realise they were brought up by a narcissistic parent when they are older. Saxton, a psychotherapist, says that the truth may come with starting a relationship, meeting their partner’s family, and seeing they are nothing like their own. “Or they have family themselves, and think, ‘I would never do that to my own children.’ Sometimes it takes us until we’re in our 30s or 40s to realise that something was not OK.” Her oldest client is in their 70s and “has finally dealt with the fact they’ve got a narcissistic mother, who is still alive, and how it’s affected them all through their life”.Saxton hopes her new book, My Parent the Peacock, will help people to recognise, and recover from, a narcissistic parent. They might have grown up being controlled, in an environment where love was conditional, gaslighting was common, and they were often blamed, belittled and criticised. Their parents’ needs came above their own, and their mother or father was emotionally exploitative. The consequences of these experiences may have continued into adulthood.The term “narcissist” is commonly used, particularly on social media, as a general insult, or as a way of explaining selfish behaviour, but this “dilutes the reality of someone with real narcissistic personality disorder [NPD]”, says Saxton. “The difficulty is that people who really need support dealing with one probably don’t get the level they need, because everyone eyerolls a bit if you say, ‘I think my partner, parent, boss, whoever, is narcissistic.’”Saxton practises in London and New York. She trained to be a psychotherapist after a long and successful corporate career, but her interest in narcissism is more personal: for several years, she was close to someone she believes had NPD (though they were never diagnosed). “I became a shell of myself,” she says of the impact of the relationship, and it took two years for her to recover. In the last 10 years, Saxton has seen an increase in the number of clients questioning whether their difficulties could be due to growing up around a narcissistic parent.View image in fullscreenKathleen Saxton.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianMany of us, if we care to admit it, have narcissistic traits such as self-absorption, exaggerating our achievements or a lack of empathy. What’s the difference between a narcissist and, for want of a better word, an arsehole? Saxton laughs. “I would hope that even people who are arseholes have some sort of a conscience somewhere down the line. They might be aware that their behaviour is not good. A lot of people that do bad things, or know they’ve treated people badly, in time begin to accept it was cruel, or very selfish. Narcissists wouldn’t stop and look back.”It’s hard to know how many people have NPD, because they would never assume anything is wrong with them and seek a diagnosis, says Saxton. “It would be almost offensive to them. The diagnosis numbers we get often come through the prison system or social services,” where people would have psychiatric assessments. In her book, Saxton suggests that 10-15% of the global population may show moderate to high narcissistic traits. At the moderate end this may look like talking over people, needing praise or turning a conversation back to themselves. At the higher end, it could involve sabotage or deliberately undermining others. Those with traits severe enough to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder are thought to be between0.8% and 6.2% of the population. “That’s a massive quantum of difference,” Saxton says. She thinks NPD is more likely to be present in 2-3% of people in the UK. “But that’s still a lot of people walking around with a disorder,” she continues. “And at the moment, we don’t believe there’s any cure, which is very unsatisfactory as a therapist, never mind as another human being.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘golden child’, chosen by the parent as the favourite, might experience perfectionism and anxiety in later life.Photograph: Posed by models; lisegagne/Getty ImagesThe DSM, the influential American psychiatric diagnostic manual, first included NPD in its third edition in 1980 and now lists nine criteria, of which at least five are needed for a diagnosis. (The World Health Organization’s most recent International Classification of Diseases (ICD) manual, used in the UK and worldwide, has a “dimensional” classification system for personality disorders and does not include NPD as a specific diagnosis.) The DSM criteria include a sense of grandiosity or being “special”, entitlement, exploitative behaviour and lack of empathy. “If you’re dealing with someone with a narcissistic personality disorder, you would absolutely know something is wrong,” says Saxton. A larger number of people wouldn’t meet the criteria, but could be described as having a “narcissistic personality”, she says. The grandiose narcissist – full of self-importance – is more recognisable, but there are other types that are harder to spot. Covert or vulnerable narcissists, says Saxton, “can present as quite introverted and gentle, and often a bit victim-y and put upon, or that they have really sacrificed a lot of themselves – that can draw in attention.” Malignant narcissists exhibit grandiosity and aggression or antisocial behaviours. “You’re bordering on some sort of psychopathy with those individuals, that really would do a lot of harm to you and have no feelings about it whatsoever.”It’s incredibly isolating, because so much of the most negative behaviour is displayed behind closed doorsIn the past, it was thought that more men than women were narcissists, but Saxton thinks this was because men tend to display the more grandiose traits; women, she says, are more likely to be the covert types. Has there been a rise in narcissism? Is social media, with its rewards for self-promotion, to blame? In Saxton’s opinion, if there is a rise, it’s probably more to do with greater mental health awareness than social media, though that has “made us much more self-conscious than we ever were before”. Narcissism appears to be more prevalent in developed countries, says Saxton, but she thinks that is probably because of better access to mental health treatment. “There is more awareness of what you might be dealing with, [when previously people] may have been misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. We’ve got the language now that we didn’t have before.”You could look at current world leaders and wonder if we’re in a narcissism epidemic. In uncertain times, says Saxton, we look for certainty, and leaders with traits of grandiosity may appear to have more direction. “The difficulty is we misconstrue charisma for leadership,” she says. “And often narcissists are very charismatic, certain, confident, and we don’t realise that we’re being drawn to that in some form, because they’re giving us a sense of surety.”View image in fullscreenCovert or vulnerable narcissists ‘can present as quite introverted and gentle, or that they have  sacrificed a lot of themselves’.Photograph: Posed by models. Jupiterimages/Getty ImagesSaxton writes that, for those living with a narcissist, it can be one of the “most destructive and heartbreaking personality types”. Why? “It’s incredibly isolating, because so much of the most negative behaviour is displayed behind closed doors,” she says. Unlike physical or sexual abuse, there often aren’t clear examples of behaviour, so it’s common for someone living with a narcissist to doubt their own experiences.Even within the same family, individual children will have different experiences, says Saxton, which can make it harder for people to unpick the reality of their childhood. Each may have their own issues: the “golden child”, chosen by the parent as the favourite, might experience perfectionism and anxiety; the “scapegoat” will believe the negative thoughts about them; the “lost child”, who kept their head down, might struggle with relationships. Saxton runs groups for people who have survived narcissistic parents. “It’s validating, because often the patterns of behaviour are very similar,” she says.Saxton has observed that people who grew up with a narcissistic parent tend to have a shaky sense of self. “They don’t really know who they are, because from a young age, they’ve had to perform a role in a play that the narcissistic parent has set up: you’ve been given a role, and if you deviate from it, I’m going to punish you or correct you or criticise you, or you won’t get any time in the positive sunshine of my gaze unless you perform that role. A lot of them have moved a long way from their true self, so that’s the work I’ll do with them in therapy, to find their own voice again.”Saxton didn’t have a narcissistic parent, but her childhood was difficult in other ways. She grew up in Kent, where her father was a pianist and ran a print business. When she was 11, he went bankrupt and she returned from school to find her home being repossessed. For the next few years, she and her brother lived with their mother in church housing. Her mother struggled, and her home life was turbulent – at 15, Saxton’s school offered to refer her to be taken into care, but she refused. She stayed with a friend’s family for about six months, then moved to London.From a young age, they’ve had to perform a role in a play that the narcissistic parent has set upShe created a successful career, with senior board positions at media companies, and ran her own headhunting business for top-level corporate jobs. When interviewing executives, to probe beneath their polished interview personas, she would ask about their childhoods. One said he didn’t want to talk about it, then afterwards told her that his father had shot his mother. “I handled it, I think, calmly and kindly. But it made me think: if I want to ask those questions responsibly, I need training in psychotherapy or counselling.” Therapy in her mid-20s had helped her “understand what had really gone on in my own family”. She studied while raising two children and running her business, eventually qualifying in psychotherapy. Now she runs a clinical practice, works as a corporate coach, and has a large social media following.After she split up with her partner, Saxton met a man she believes has NPD – but it took two years for her to realise it. That it took her so long, even as a therapist herself, shows how insidious it can be to be involved with someone who has a narcissistic personality. Some of the signs were strange and relatively minor – the silent treatment, for instance – and, taken alone, they could be dismissed. It felt isolating. “If you really want a relationship to work, you excuse it,” says Saxton. “Maybe I’m being a certain way, or maybe they’re struggling because of their previous breakup. You come up with all these reasons. If I work harder, try harder, I’m more accepting … You find arguments as to why you’re putting up with this.” It was, she says, “the most challenging experience of my lifetime. It takes you apart. It quietly dismantles you, and everything you thought to be true or normal is no longer true or normal because you’ve been sucked into living in their fantasy world, the world that needs to be true for their mask to stay on. You have to abide by this false ecosystem, and the cost, if you don’t, is expulsion or being ridiculed or dismantled.”View image in fullscreenSaxton: ‘Dealing with a narcissistic parent is a very delicate journey.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianOnce she realised what she was dealing with, and tried to read up on narcissism, she found there wasn’t much available. There was Freud, of course – children are natural narcissists, he suggested, but the problems arise when they don’t grow out of it – and more recent work by psychologists such as Sam Vaknin and Ramani Durvasula, but the therapists Saxton went to see didn’t understand narcissism. It heightened her sense of isolation, but it also fuelled her determination. “I have witnessed it first-hand, and that’s what led me to study it and to specialise in it.” Saxton is now writing her next book, on surviving a narcissistic relationship (there will also be a third, about narcissistic bosses).Her research gave her the knowledge to recover, though it took about two years. For nine months, she wasn’t able to practise. “You begin to lose who you are. You’ve got to re-find your true self.” This is what she helps her clients with now. “If you’re dealing with any personality disorder, the first thing is realisation: the discovery that this isn’t just someone who’s a bit difficult, this is another level.” Then her client will start working out who they are. “What were you really before anything happened to you? Can we go back and find that part of you? There comes a point where their anger and sadness will come to the surface.” It’s not a complicated process to recover, she says, but you do need to find a therapist who knows what they’re doing. “That’s my concern – that there are not yet enough therapists specifically trained in this type of work.”In terms of dealing with a narcissistic parent, do people find it helpful to confront them? “It’s not always advisable, depending on what sort of narcissist you’re dealing with, because it could be incredibly destructive,” says Saxton. Also, she adds: “You’re never going to get an apology. You’re never going to get validation, you’re never going to get an explanation.”Why is your boss a narcissist? Blame the job ad that got them hiredRead moreMany of her clients sever contact with their narcissistic parent, but is it possible to have a relationship? “It’s absolutely possible. If you are really aware of what you’re dealing with, then you’ve got the choice.” Clear boundaries are key. “What will you and won’t you accept?” The “grey rock” method – not giving the narcissist the attention or drama they want – can help. “Directly addressing or fighting with a narcissist is going to get you nowhere. If you’re going to be in a relationship with your parent, you’ve got to be very conscious of what you’re dealing with, because it’s a very delicate journey.”You won’t change them, she stresses, but a childhood spent with a narcissistic parent doesn’t have to mean a lifetime of damage. As her seventy-something patient attests, it’s never too late to recover. “Whether the parent’s alive or dead, it doesn’t matter how old you are, you can absolutely reclaim your life.”My Parent the Peacock: Discovery and Recovery from Narcissistic Parents by Kathleen Saxton is published by Hachette (£15.99).

It is also one that, until a shamefully short time ago, I attributed to Albert Einstein, because it turns out it’s apparently enough for me just to see a quote in cursive text overlaying a black-and-white photo of a famous person for me to believe it was said by them.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Anyway, now that summer is over, most of us are left feeling that most of the year’s drinking is safely out of the way. Autumn is the hangover of the calendar year. Spring is the pre-drinks, summer the big blow-out and winter is the enormous, restorative takeaway. And when I think about hangovers, I often think of the bloody mary. It’s one of those drinks whose origins are shrouded in mystery, but the most commonly received wisdom is that it was created byFernand Petiotin the 1920s, when he was working atHarry’s New York Bar in Paris(which, at the time, was simply called the New York Bar).The International Bartenders Associationrecognises the drink as a mix of vodka, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, celery salt and pepper, which is how stickler devotees might enjoy it. And I am one of them. If you’re making bloody mary from scratch, you’re instructed to stir all these ingredients over ice, then pour them into a tall glass filled with fresh ice. This means it’s passed through ice twice before drinking, but I like my bloody marys for their, ahem, blood-like viscosity, so I stir only very sparingly.Bloody mary purists look away now: I’ve also been seeing a rise of interest in bloody marias, or bloody marys made with tequila, mezcal or another agave spirit. So I asked Pritesh Mody, creative director atThink Drinks, why this might be: “Good quality tequila and mezcal naturally have contrasting bright and vegetal notes that complement tomato juice,” he says. “Mezcal, in particular, touches on the zeitgeist for smoky flavours and, with the continued ‘premiumisation’ in spirits, those with provenance are eroding the vodka market, which is probably why we’re seeing this switch.”And, if your body doesn’t mind further assault, getting back on the proverbial horse with one or three bloody marys may be as good a salve as any – though I’m not entirely sure of the science behind that one, sorry.Four bloody mary premixes for sore headsBloody Drinks classic bloody mary£3.50 (250ml) Sainsbury’s, 6.3%.

Seeing it for the first time, when it was published in 2012, I remember thinking how daring it was to produce a book with a stripped-away spine, leaving its binding and pea-green stitching exposed. This choice was a practical one, however, because it allowed the book to open completely, meaning it lies (or leans) absolutely flat, which makes it feel like the most obliging book, with no threat whatsoever of it flipping closed at precisely the moment you need to check an instruction while your hands are covered with dough.The page that didn’t flip closed last week was 62, Russell’s basic pizza or pizzette dough, which is a great and effective recipe that I have made on and off since 2012, and a recipe that not only survived the scrutiny of the cooking teacherCarla Tomasi, but was even endorsed by her. (Although she did apply her way of kneading the dough: working in the bowl with wet hands, rather than on a floured board, so as not to incorporate more flour, and using a series of folding pulls that create more elasticity.) Russell and Carla, stretching together.The two also gave much the same advice on quick-to-make, quick-to-bake small pizzas and pizzette: you make them, you eat them, you get on with it. And you also top them however you want, although I highly recommend Russell’s combination of courgette, mozzarella, parmesan and mint.Pizzette with courgette, mozzarella and mintMakes1215gfresh yeast, or 7g fast-action dried yeast500g strong white bread flour,plus extra for dusting15g fine salt2 tbspolive oil,plus extra for greasing200gwell-drained mozzarella, thinly sliced50g grated parmesan24 mint leaves1 courgette, thinly sliced (a mandoline is useful here)Extra-virgin olive oilChilli flakes,to serve (optional)Working in a bowl or jug, measure in 320g tepid water, then stir in the yeast and wait for a few minutes.Put the flour, salt, the water and yeast mix and the olive oil in a large bowl and, using your hand like a dough hook, gradually bring it all together into a rough ball. Rub the dough from your hand, then rub both hands with a little water or oil. Still working in the bowl, knead the dough with a folding movement, bringing the edges up and over so the it smooths into a ball. Cover and rest in a warm place until it has doubled in size, which will take an hour or two, depending on room temperature.Tip the risen dough on to a lightly floured work surface and cut it into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then arrange on a lightly floured tray or tea towel, cover and leave to rise for 30 minutes. (The balls can also be stored in the fridge for up to 24 hours, just remember to pull them out 30 minutes before baking.)Heat the oven to 250C (230C fan)/490F/gas 9½, and put a flat baking tray inside. Working on lightly floured surface, roll the balls into discs about 20cm across. Working with a couple of pizzette at a time, top the dough first with a couple of bits of mozzarella and some parmesan, then a few bits of torn mint, and a few rounds of courgette. Sprinkle with salt, zigzag with olive oil, then use a pizza paddle or similar to lift the pizzette on to the hot baking tray. Bake for six to eight minutes, then serve topped with a bit more good olive oil and some red chilli flakes, if you like.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodPizzaCheeseVegetablesHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

The most recent study cited – areview paperpublished this August by authors affiliated with Mount Sinai and Harvard – is made to look like two separate studies, one from Harvard and one from Mount Sinai. ABoston Birth Cohort studyauthored by Johns Hopkins researchers is also linked twice in the release, as though it is two separate studies.Trump’s absurd Tylenol claims heighten the suffering of pregnant women in the US | Moira DoneganRead more“So you say a Harvard study found the same thing as the Hopkins study and the Mount Sinai study. It can give the appearance that [the same results have] been achieved in one study after another, all from very prestigious centers,” Singer said.Jake Scott, a physician and member of the Vaccine Clinical Advisory Committee at Stanford, said the press release “makes me sick in my stomach, to be honest”, because “they’re presenting association as causation, for one thing”.There is a much higher bar for proving causation than association. In this case proving causation would mean showing that eliminating exposure to Tylenol would actually reduce the number of autism cases.For example, rising ice cream sales might be associated with heat stroke, simply because both are things that happen in the summer, but banning the sale of ice cream would not reduce the number of heat strokes. To prove causation, it’s not enough to show that one occurrence follows another – these results must show up again and again in a variety of study designs, and scientists also need to find a plausible explanation as to how the two factors are related.None of the studies linked in the press release claim to have proven causation.In fact,all ofthemacknowledge they cannotdefinitivelyestablish causation, although some use more cautious wording than others. One way to quickly find the scope of a study’s claims is to search key terms like “causal”, “causation”, “association”, “limitations”, “caution”, and “further investigation”, according to experts.Once you actually start reading the studies, more of the statements in the press release start to fall apart, the experts said. For instance, the release states: “Scientists haveproposedbiological mechanisms linking prenatal acetaminophen exposure to altered brain development and adverse birth outcomes.” Biological mechanisms explaining how an exposure leads to an outcome are an important way to establish causation.It took decadesfor scientists to establish that cigarettes cause cancer through the biological mechanism of introducing carcinogens into the lungs, which create cancerous mutations in the cells, for example.But thestudy linkedin the release to illustrate a biological mechanism doesn’t actually include a biological mechanism, but the opposite. The authors write: “Mechanisms underlying the associations of prenatal acetaminophen exposure with adverse birth outcomes remain unknown.” Additionally, the study did not investigate “altered brain development” at all, as the press release indicated, but instead only looked at outcomes related to birth weight and gestational age.Singer and Scott agree that another way to fact check the Trump administration’s scientific claims is to look at what research is being left out of the conversation.For example, the press release left out a Swedish studypublished in 2024.“That’s a study where they followed nearly two and a half million births … they used sibling controls,” said Singer, “So what they found was that acetaminophen [the generic name for Tylenol] use during pregnancy showed a slight association [with autism].” But that association disappears when you compare siblings, who have many more genetic and environmental similarities than comparison groups in other studies, Singer explained.The authors of the Swedish study wrote: “This suggests that associations observed in other models may have been attributable to confounding,” meaning that it was likely not the Tylenol itself, but other factors connected to Tylenol use (which could include, for example, more fevers during pregnancy) that created the risk.“That’s a pretty impressive study,” Singer said. “I’m not saying they’re right either. What I’m saying as a doctor who reads the research literature, this question has not yet been answered.”Singer says there’s likely a reason why the White House included some studies and not others: “Secretary Kennedy, I think he’s under pressure, because remember, he was going to tell us the cause of autismby September.”The Tylenol claims are reminiscent of arguments against vaccines, according to Scott, who recently testified before Congress to argue against claims that vaccines cause chronic illnesses – claims based on a study thatwas never submitted for publicationdue to flaws in its design.“It’s all part of a pattern of exploiting really weak evidence that’s based on really poor quality studies,” Scott said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrHealthPregnancyDrugsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Spotted all over fashion week, from the runways (Fendi, Louis Vuitton,Jonathan Anderson’s debut at Dior) to the front row (Daniel Craig, Robert Pattinson, Lennon Gallagher), they’re also popping up on TikTok and Instagram.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

With the right styling (ie avoiding looking like you’re cosplaying Don Draper), though, a tie can give your look extra punch in all the right ways.The best ties for menSecondhand picksView image in fullscreenVintage Celine silk tie£30 at Vestiaire CollectiveTies are the first thing I rummage through in charity shops. Vintage ties tend to have more personality than new ones, whether it’s stripes or a paisley print, and they’re often made from silk – the best fabric for a tie. They’re also much more affordable. You might have to rummage hard, but it’s worth it when you’re the onlyperson at a function with your one-of-a-kind tie.Online, Vestiaire Collective is great for secondhand luxury brands. Expect everything from a vintage Burberry check to a Vivienne Westwood monogram, as well as countless Hermès designs. The one that caught my eye was this red Celine design, which has an understated Triomphe logo and horse-bit detailing. The best part? It’s £30. You can opt in for authentication to make sure it’s legit.View image in fullscreenVintage Chaps Ralph Lauren silk tie£30 at RokitFor vintage ties, Rokit is your best bet. You can find classic thrifted styles such as novelty Snoopy collabs or Looney Tunes designs, but there’s also a strong selection of retro picks from discontinued designer lines. Case in point: this paisley tie by Chaps, the Ralph Lauren diffusion line that was big in the 80s and 90s.View image in fullscreenVintage Burberrypure silktie£58.32 at VintedNo list of secondhand retailers is now complete without Vinted, though you may have to scroll for a while to find the real winners. My tip: if you find one you like, check out the seller page because they could be someone who specialises in luxury ties. This Burberry tie, for example, is from@thefellow85, who has loads of good options to choose from.High-street storesView image in fullscreenM&S floral pure silk tie£25 at M&SThough a floral tie is a little trickier to get right, all you need to do is look atLeonardo DiCaprio’s in Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Julietto see just how good one can look. That, or any of Dries van Noten’s menswear shows. Marks & Spencer currently has a strong floral option in pure silk available for £25.View image in fullscreenMoss Italiansilk medallion tie£49.95 at MossThis brand (formerly Moss Bros) has upped its game since dropping the “Bros” from its name in 2023, expanding from basic men’s office wear to cool smart-casual tailoring. Think double-breasted blazers, great knitwear and tailored trousers – alongside a great selection of ties. This simple medallion on brown silk is the best of the bunch.View image in fullscreenCharles Tyrwhitt knitted wool slim navy tie£49.95 at Charles TyrwhittA knitted tie is a smart-casual flex – self-assured without feeling stuffy. For best results, stick to block colours, natural fibres like cotton or wool and always go for the OG silhouette with a flat bottom rather than one that’s pointed. Relaxed formal-wear expert Charles Tyrwhitt has just the ticket.Luxury labelsView image in fullscreenDrake’s red-and-goldstripedtie£175 at Drake’sDrake’s is the most luxurious choice for a preppy vibe. The British brand’s collections are full of sophisticated classics that wouldn’t look out of place on JFK Jr – and there are loads of styles to choose from: polka dot, paisley, striped and geometric prints. It was hard choosing a favourite, but this retro red stripe takes home gold.View image in fullscreenTom Fordpolka-dot silk jacquard tie£230 at Mr Porter£230 at SelfridgesWhat’s not to love about a polka-dot tie? Fun but just the right side of chic, too. Choose polka dots that are a good size (nothing too tiny) so they feel intentional. Tom Ford nails the brief with this tie that’s handmade in Italy from a burgundy and white silk-jacquard.View image in fullscreenPaul Smith navy silkrabbit pinstripe tie£120 at Paul SmithPaul Smith is the best place for tailoring with a twist. The British designer’s trademark is cool colour combinations and unexpected details. This tie is a perfect example, with a subtle artist pinstripe and multicoloured rabbit monogram.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Originally two separate tailors, Gieves and Hawkes joined forces in 1974. The latter is famous for being one of the first to establish Savile Row as the hub of tailoring we know today, hence the brand’s prime spot at No 1. History aside, it’s still one of the best London tailors, so, naturally, it’s a brand that delivers on the necktie front.View image in fullscreenTM Lewin floral-geo silk tie£30 at TM LewinTM Lewin is the designer often credited with popularising the modern dress shirt, so it’s no surprise that it’s among the best places to find the shirt’s number-one accompaniment. Some of the collection feels a little reserved, but the tie that stood out for me is this handmade, silk geometric floral take – and it’s only £30. A win-win.View image in fullscreenHuntsman deco tie£175 at HuntsmanThe brand Huntsman is the inspiration behind the tailor in the blockbuster movie franchiseKingsman, and the HQ is based in the brand’s Savile Row store. Hollywood nods aside, it’s a brand known for quality tailoring, whether you’re shopping made-to-measure or ready to wear. This pure silk deco tie is no exception.Preppy brandsView image in fullscreenPolo Ralph Laurenneat silk tie£135 at Ralph LaurenFrom Oxford shirts to polos, you can count on Ralph Lauren for preppy staples – and a key part of the uniform is a necktie. The ties are well made – this one is woven in Italy using pure silk – and there’s a good mix of statement styles, vintage-coded pieces and a few plain options, too.View image in fullscreenGant striped tie£85 at GantNothing says preppy like a striped tie – thinkRobin Williams as John Keating in Dead Poets Society– and Gant has the brief nailed down with this tricolour design. We’d expect nothing less from the expert in Ivy League style – the London Regent Street store looks more like a varsity clubhouse than a clothes shop.View image in fullscreenRowing Blazers Magic 8 tie£98 at Rowing BlazersFor an eccentric take on prep, look no further than Rowing Blazers. It was founded by Jack Carlson, an ex-Oxford rower who went on to represent the US before turning to rowing-inspired fashion. The brand’s titularselection of blazersencapsulates the vibe, and the ties follow suit. There are bright, multicoloured options, some made in collaboration with cult favourite cartoon characters such as Babar the Elephant, but my personal favourite is this Magic 8 Ball design. The answer is yes.When can I wear a tie?View image in fullscreenThe late-1980s preppy look of JFK Jr.Photograph: Rick MaimanA good rule of thumb: wherever you can wear a suit, you can wear a tie. Beyond formal dress codes (weddings, Royal Ascot, Wimbledon, important work events), a tie can bring added finesse to a smart-casual look, too. Though this can be trickier to get right, I’d recommend leaning into aJFK Jr-codedpreppy look. Brand-wise, think along the lines of New York label Aimé Leon Dore or Gant, teaming your tie with an Oxford shirt and jeans, beneath a V-neck jumper with tailored shorts, or even peeping out under a varsity hoodie.For celebrity inspiration, A$AP Rocky is a master in the tie-styling department, with a recentduo of Celine looksthat switched from oversized caramel double-breasted blazer by day to crisp black tuxedo and tie at night.What type of tie should I wear?The best ties are those with a little personality (note: personality does not mean novelty). Swerve anything that feels too boring or corporate – the classic block colour woven polyester tie is a hard no. Silk designs with stripes or understated patterns look best: think 90s Armani or vintage Ralph Lauren, and you’re on the right track.My top tip? Always search the secondhand market. There is a strong range of silk designer ties from the 70s and 80s available atRokitorVestiaire Collective– you can find ties by brands such as Dior and Hermès for less than £100. And, even though it requires a bit of digging, charity shops are often a treasure trove for old silk ties. Try affluent areas, think Chelsea or Notting Hill in London, if you’re after luxury brands.View image in fullscreenWeave the Paul Newman magic: a knitted tie is a strong smart-casual choice.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockA knitted tie works, too. Take a look at Paul Newman in The Young Philadelphians– slimmer than your classic business tie in a block colour and with a flat, squared bottom. This style is particularly good if you want your look to lean casual.How thick should my tie be?There are no hard and fast rules on acceptable tie width. You could opt for a fat 90s vibe (my preference as I love louche Armani-style tailoring) or lean into something skinnier – just search forHedi boyson TikTok to see how gen Z are bringing the Pete Doherty-coded skinny tie back, so-called because of designer Hedi Slimane’s penchant for thin ties.There is one hard-and-fast rule on how to wear them: whichever style you go for, never tie with an extra-large knot. This is not a sixth-form disco. Even a classicWindsor knotcan feel a little overdone. Instead, try a four-in-hand knot, the Windsor’s slightly asymmetric cousin, which looks a little more effortless.Peter Bevan is a stylist and fashion journalist covering menswear, womenswear and beautyExplore more on these topicsMen's fashionThe FilterAccessoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

White jeans, surely, belong within the same date bracket as straw baskets. A white vest or T-shirt looks at its best when you are sunkissed. We are now at the hinge of the seasons, and autumn clothes, as a rule, celebrate the colours around us as the seasons turn: the russet of the leaves underfoot, the rich chocolate of your first mocha of the season. That is how it’s supposed to work, right?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But the reality isn’t as glowy and lovely as all that. I mean, we could dress in brown to match the puddles in the gutter, with crimson highlights to pick out our rosacea, and a flash of nutmeg to nod to the lurid vats of pumpkin spice latte that are unavoidable over the next month. But when you put it like that, it doesn’t fill the heart with seasonal joy.Which is why this is a brilliant time to wear white. It’s like turning up the brightness on your laptop screen. Everything looks instantly prettier. But not just that: it also looks cleaner, more legible, less confusing. Calming and grounding, like a long, deep breath.Think knitwear, coats and loungey separates in cool-toned Scandi, creamy porcelain or warm, rich butterI’ve been thinking about all this since I saw the autumn collection by The White Company. The brand is best known for bedding, nighties, candles – the kind of stuff that just makes sense in white – but their new design lead, Sheila McKain, an extremely chic alumna of Donna Karan, Jaeger and Oscar de la Renta, has revamped the clothes, too.Think knitwear, coats and loungey separates that come in cool-toned Scandi, creamy porcelain or warm, rich butter. Every shade, in other words, as long as it’s white. A dandelion-soft alpaca sweater, a nubbly cream shearling jacket and an elegant cowl-neck blouse – all in shades of white – make a strong case for a marble-toned autumn.View image in fullscreenActor Tiffany Hsu nails winter white.Photograph: Raimonda Kulikauskiene/Getty ImagesI was surprised to find myself as seduced as I was by the look, because winter white can read a little naff. Too self-consciously cute, too deliberately charming. I’m not going ice-skating, I’m going to work, you know what I mean? Perhaps it is because, as a clumsy person, I feel intimidated by the potential for coffee spillage, but an all-white outfit can look a tiny bit smug if you get it wrong.So how to get it right? It seems to me there are two important principles to bear in mind when wearing winter white, if you want to look sophisticated and laid-back rather than twee or sterile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

With my hemline rules, you’ll always hit the right spotRead moreNumber one: don’t wear tight white. White looks much more elegant if the silhouette and cut is generous. When white fabric is draped and slouchy – an off-the-shoulder sweater, a generous pair of pleat-front trousers – it looks mellow and soft, like snowfall. When stretched tight (a snug white tailored suit, a stretchy dress), it takes on a harsher glare and a different mood.Number two: don’t be one-note about what constitutes white. It is a broad church, and you should embrace all of it. If you think of white as any shade from transparent through to the edge of beige in one direction and the margin of grey in another, then it becomes a lot more interesting.Wearing white near the face is a centuries-old trick for making your skin look good – a string of pearls is the original ring light – and so it is worth playing around with which white is the one that bedazzles you best.But the ploy that will be most flattering overall – because it will instantly make you look terrifically sophisticated and interesting – is to wear different shades of white together. Pour a little cream (cardigan) on to your oatmeal (tank top). Wear an airy, meringue-toned blouse to counter the marble shine of stiff ivory tailored trousers. There’s more to this colour than looking like a blank page. As the nights get darker, that’s when pale starts to get interesting.Model: Ellen at Body London.

Not to mention the newly restored baronial estates where you can stay for the price of an average British B&B. This region, known as Kurzeme, is almost the size of Yorkshire (population: 5.5 million) but with a mere 240,000 inhabitants.Kurzeme (also known by its German name, Courland) has 180 miles of undeveloped coastline and a good proportion of Latvia’s 1,200 castles and mansions, as well as the ancient valley of the Abava River, listed by World Monuments Watch as one of “100 endangered unique cultural monuments”.It also boasts Kuldīga, a Unesco world heritage town, and Liepāja an upcoming European capital of culture (2027) – full of languishing art nouveau architecture, and enough former Soviet collective farms, KGB watch towers and military barracks to remind us that history really is just a breath away.View image in fullscreenLiepāja’ St Nicholas’s Orthodox Naval Cathedral overlooks ramshackle Soviet apartments.Photograph: Petr Maderic/AlamyThe Latvian bus system is excellent and extremely cheap but I rented a car for a few days to maximise my time. My tour began in Sabile, a town on the River Abava – whose crystalline, beaver-filled waters flow from Kandava to Kuldīga (Sabile is also home to several vineyards where Latvian wine can be tasted). Here, one misty cacophonous morning, I casually flipped open my Merlin birding app. Within minutes it had identified 25 birds including sedge warblers, golden orioles and spotted fly catchers and I had seen marsh harriers. Apparently such a wide variety is perfectly normal: Latvia’s bogs, wetlands, coastal lagoons and ancient forests (53% of the country is woodland while 5% is wetlands) make it one of northern Europe’s best birding sites.Just a few minutes’ drive outside town is thePedvāle Art Park, a 100-hectare nature reserve where storks pick their way through swathes of wild lupins and 195 contemporary sculptures from across the world. Founder Ojārs Feldbergs told me the Abava valley is home to 800 species of plant and animal, as well as crusader castles and Viking graves. “It was once a trading route for amber,” he tells me. “The Baltic Sea is the world’s richest source of Baltic gold, which was transported to St Petersburg and the east through this valley for centuries.”Later, the bucolic beauty and clean waters of the Abava valley, along with its therapeutic sulphur springs, attracted hundreds of German aristocracy, giving the region a disproportionate number of baronial estates. Though these fell into disrepair during the Soviet era when they became collective farms, tractor houses and pig farms, in the past decade many have been painstakingly restored as boutique hotels.View image in fullscreenOld wooden staircase leading dowm toJūrkalne beach and the Baltic Sea.Photograph: Regina Marcenkiene/AlamyAtKukšu Manor(guided tour €5), I gawped at lavishly painted ceilings and jaw-dropping frescoes. Here, for €185 for a double room, anyone can live, fleetingly, as a Baltic baron. Just north of the valley, I strolled in the walled gardens, vineyards and frescoed state rooms ofNurmuiža Castle and Spa, an elegantly restored estate where you can dip in a wild swimming lake as cranes and storks fly overhead, and double rooms cost from €80. Alternatively, atPadure Manornear Kuldīga, a reconstruction-in-progress often used for film sets, €40 will buy you a bedroom and access to the musty Soviet library that came with the house.The high street – not a single chain store in sight – includes a needle museum, a merchant’s house, and craft shops where I splashed out on handknitted socks for my kidsKuldīga itself, a charmingly dusty town, became Unesco-protected in 2023, thanks to its 17th-century wooden architecture and striking location above Europe’s widest waterfall, the Venta Rapid – crossed via Europe’s longest brick road bridge.

Afterwards, a30-minute drive – including a stop-off at the pink, fairytale Ēdole Castle–took me to Jūrkalne, a pretty and utterly deserted beach of bluffs, dunes and pine trees. Pāvilosta, the latest hotspot beloved of Rigan hipsters, lies to the south: an old fishing village where you can grab a flat white (try Cafe Laiva) and watch the rolling Baltic surf or cycle theEuroVelo 13coastal track to Liepāja.It’s here, in Latvia’s third largest city that I end my trip. With its lush parks, sandy white beaches and strollable streets of gently decaying baroque and art nouveau buildings, Liepāja makes a great base for exploring the south-west corner of Kurzeme. I stayed in the historicArt Hotel Roma(doubles from €80 a night which includes access to the hotel’s art collection) and ate as often as I could at an exquisitely restored lodgings once frequented by Peter the Great:Madame Hoyer’s Guest House. Although it’s now a museum, thedining roomoperates much as it did in 1697.View image in fullscreenExhibits in the former Soviet-era naval prison of Karosta.Photograph: Mauritius Images /AlamyBut Liepāja’s greatest attraction must surely beKarosta, once one of the USSR’s largest submarine bases, and a closed military zone for nearly 50 years. Today, it’s a ghostly swill of pristine coastline, brutalist architecture and graffitied Soviet watch towers, with the gold-encrusted domes of the Russian Orthodox St Nicholas Naval Cathedral gleaming, surreally and extravagantly, from its midst.To fully grasp Latvia’s extraordinary, violent history, I took a guided tour of Karosta prison, one of only a few former military jails in Europe open to visitors. Here, windowless cells once housed revolutionaries, miscreant soldiers and officers of the tsarist army, the Soviet army, the Latvian army, as well as deserters of the German Wehrmacht and “enemies” of Stalin – many of whom had used their metal buttons to scratch their initials into the concrete walls. A little unusually, Karosta prison offers all-night stays (ranging from €15-60 a night) for anyone not averse to paranormal activities – it’s been voted the most haunted place in the world by Ghost Hunters International. I opted, instead, for a recuperative beer from one of Liepāja’s burgeoning microbreweries, mulling over an intriguing part of the world, far from the usual tourist haunts.The writer travelled independently using the extensive network of Kurzeme’s tourist information offices and with help fromlatvia.travel.

Here, all of the world’s remaining 74 southern resident sub-species of orcas find sanctuary, surfacing daily from the depths of the Salish Sea.Out at sea watching the whales is Dr Deborah Giles, an orca scientist, with her colleague, Eba. Eba is a brown and white rescue dog with a remarkable nose. Found as a cold, wet, five-month-old puppy on the streets of Sacramento, she has been detecting whale scat – or faeces – since the age of four.View image in fullscreenSeaDoc Society’s Deborah Giles steers her research boat across the Salish Sea.Photograph: Maya Yang/The GuardianDressed in a bright orange lifejacket – and sometimes goggles – Eba perches atop Giles’s research boat, scanning the wind. When she catches a whiff of orca faeces, she raises her nose, sometimes whimpering or wagging her tail to point Giles in the right direction. Orca-detecting dogs have become an unlikely ally in the fight to save the whales.“We wanted to use Eba because it allows us to stay really far away from the whales and not stress them out,” says Giles, a member of the marine conservation organisation SeaDoc Society.Through the study of whale faeces, researchers can uncover a wealth of biological insights from a single sample, including diet, hormone levels, exposure to toxins, pregnancy, gut microbiome composition and the amount of microplastics in their system, as well as the presence of parasites, bacteria and fungi.We consider the orcas, or blackfish, part of the whole web that connects us as a tribe to all living thingsSteve Edwards, Swinomish tribeEba wears a collar adorned with a small strip of lime green and black neoprene to work. It was once part of a toy belonging to Tokitae, or Toki, a southern resident orca taken in amass capturein 1970. She spent 53 years in captivity at the Miami Seaquarium before dying in 2023, just months before a planned return to her native waters.Also known as Lolita, and namedSk’aliCh’elh-tenautby the Lummi Nation tribe,her storybecame a rallying cry for orca conservation. When she died, her longtime trainer gifted the strip of wetsuit to Giles – a quiet tribute to a whale who should have come home.View image in fullscreenTokitae, a southern resident orca, performing in her stadium tank at Miami Seaquarium, where she spent 53 years in captivity.Photograph: Miami Herald/TNSView image in fullscreenTokitae was one of six orcas captured in August 1970.

A centrifuge separates faecal matter from seawater and the sample is sent for lab analysis.Data from these samples has revealed key insights into the challenges facing the southern resident orcas.They’re an ecosystem indicator. Everything causing their decline is our fault so it’s our responsibility to help them recoverDr Deborah GilesWhere there was once a thriving population of the whales in these waters, the group now faces mounting threats. A sharp decline in Chinook salmon – their primary food source – combined with increasing toxicants and disruptive vessel noise, have pushed them to the brink of extinction.Unlike themammal-eating sub-species Bigg’s killer whale, which number about 350, and the northern residents, with more than 300, southern residents are the smallest orca ecotype in the eastern Pacific Ocean.They are genetically and culturally distinct from other populations, and like the northern residents feed exclusively on fish. Once plentiful,their population has declined nearly 20%since the late 1990s.This is particularly concerning to those who treasure them the most. Across the islands, the whales are celebrated. Images of their black and white bodies grace shop windows, T-shirts and cafe walls. But their presence runs deeper. For many Indigenous communities, including the Swinomish tribe, thewhales are considered kin.View image in fullscreenWhale monitoring used to involve invasive techniques such as firing barbed biopsy darts and satellite tags into their animals’ dorsal fins. These pictures show show swelling and unhealed barb sites on a whale a year and a half after the tracking tag fell out.Photograph: Whale Museum“We consider the orcas, or blackfish, part of the whole web that connects us as a tribe to all living things,” says Steve Edwards, chair of Washington state’s Swinomish Indian Tribal Community.Alex Ramel, a Washington state representative and whale advocate, agrees. “They are just part of the culture and the community. Every time we read about one of the southern residents being washed up or a baby being born and not making it, it’s a topic of conversation in our community.”In January,one grieving mother made headlineswhen seen carrying her dead newborn. It was her second loss since 2018, when she famouslypushed her deceased calf for more than 1,000 miles. Earlier this month, another southern resident wasspotted pushing her dead calf aroundwith its umbilical cord still attached.For Giles, who has studied the whales for two decades, their plight is symptomatic of deeper ecological damage. “They’re an ecosystem indicator,” she says. “Everything that’s causing their decline is our fault so it’s our responsibility to help them recover.”Whale monitoring used to involve invasive techniques such asfiring barbed biopsy darts and satellite tags into the animals’ dorsal fins. In 2016, one such effort ended in tragedy when awhale died five weeks after tagging, probably due to a fungal infection introduced at the wound site.Even less harmful methods, like using telescoping poles to collect breath samples, can be disruptive. “Having a boat at 30ft is very close. That would most likely elicit a stress response,” says Giles. “If it’s constant, they have this elevated stress level.”Now, scent-detection dogs like Eba, coupled with new technologies, are expanding the toolkit for non-invasive conservation practices.Out on the boat with Giles are James Sheppard, a scientist at the San Diego ZooWildlifeAlliance, and Charlie Welch, an SDZWA volunteer and head of Proper Voltage, a company focused on sustainable battery technology. Together, they have spent a decade developing conservation drones that can capture samples of the cloud-like plumes of breath from orcas’ blowholes with mounts holding petri dishes.We get a snapshot of what’s happening inside the animalJames SheppardSheppard says: “We need to get data that is robust and as close to real-time as possible, so that we can find out if there’s a real problem. Then the animal-care staff can go in and stage an intervention if it’s needed.”Out on the Salish Sea, a pod of seven Bigg’s killer whales soon appear – the southern residents are elsewhere. The team seizes the opportunity. With practised ease, the drone glides several feet above the whales.Once a whale surfaces, the drone’s petri dishes collect mist from its blowhole, capturing genetic material, reproductive hormones and signs of disease.A pod of whales swims through green-blue water.A transient pod of orcas and a mother and baby do a body roll. Credit: Joe Gaydos and Bob Friel/SeaDoc Society“We get a snapshot of what’s happening inside the animal,” Sheppard says, adding they are also finessing radiometric thermal sensors that use infrared radiation to measure internal body temperature.The duo’s drone operations have maintained a perfect flight record with no collisions, and operate under strict federal guidelines to minimise disturbance.View image in fullscreenAn aerial shot of an orca’s blowhole shown on a drone monitor.Photograph: Maya Yang/The GuardianView image in fullscreenA monitoring drone hovers above a pod of whales.Photograph: Maya Sears/NOAAA/Permit #21348View image in fullscreenPlacing petri dishes used to collect orca breath samples on modified drone.Photograph: Maya Yang/The Guardian“Most of the time the whales ignore [the drone] and if they do look at it, they’ll just turn and then just keep moving,” Sheppard says.‘Swimming with orcas is out of control’: can new rules keep tourists and Mexico’s whales safe?Read moreWith a target area no larger than two basketballs, the pilot sometimes has to go from a more than 100 metres above the whales down to little more than a metre really quickly so that they don’t miss the breath. “You only get seconds,” says Welch.Despite the technical challenges of flying drones so precisely, the team is on a mission to succeed. “What we do has to have tangible, real-world benefits for the species that we’re studying,” says Sheppard, “Otherwise we’re just stamp collecting.“We have to be advocates and we have to push for change. And that’s what the science does – it backs it up.”View image in fullscreenDeborah Giles and Eba out at sea.Photograph: Maya Yang/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansCetaceansWildlifeMarine lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are clashes in the town,” he recalled his mother saying.He gathered his belongings, closed his stall and ran home as fast as he could.Members of the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group that has been fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces in a civil war since April 2023, had attacked a military camp in the city, in South Darfur, and were rampaging through residential areas.When he got to the family home, in Al-Jir neighbourhood, amid the chaos of gunshots and people scattering for their lives, he found the bloodied bodies of his mother and two sisters on the floor, with gunshot wounds. “There was a bullet in her heart,” the 25-year-old said of the moment he saw his mother.View image in fullscreenSuba Dafallah at the Renk transit centre.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The GuardianDafallah is one of hundreds of thousands of Sudanese people who have fled into neighbouring South Sudan. He is sheltering at theovercrowded Renk transit centrenear the border, alongside more than 1,000 fellow nationals.After seeing the bodies of his mother and two sisters, Dafallah stepped outside, to see another of his sisters being taken away by RSF fighters. One hit him with the butt of his rifle as he tried to stop them.Dafallah’s sister cried out his name as she was put inside a car and tied up. He ran after the vehicle as it drove off, desperately calling her name, before collapsing.He buried his mother and dead sisters two days later, then fled towards Renk, more than 800 miles away, trekking some of the way and hitching rides, taking nothing with him but the clothes on his back.Along the way, in Ed Daein city, in East Darfur state, he witnessed another RSF attack, this time on a camp for internally displaced people. RSF fighters set a market on fire and went on looting sprees. In the chaos, he passed a woman who had been run over by a vehicle, her children left crying by the side of the road. “I tried to help but couldn’t,” he said.View image in fullscreenPeople salvage items from a destroyed medical storage building in Nyala in May 2023, not long after the outbreak of Sudan’s civil war.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe war in Sudan war has created what the UN hasdescribedas one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century.More than 150,000 peoplehave been killed,more than 14 milliondisplaced, and alarger number stillare in need of humanitarian aid.The fighting, which isfuelled by foreign powers, has raged in the absence of a concerted international effort to end it.“The scale of this crisis is one whose magnitude is not being properly recognised in the international system,” David Miliband, the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said on a recent trip to Sudan. “Neglect is feeding division and division is feeding fear.”The war has been marked by widespread brutality and atrocities, with multiple accounts ofsexual violence as a weapon of war, and thediscovery of hundreds of mass graves. Both warring parties have beenaccused of committing war crimes, and the RSF has been accused of committinggenocide,ethnic cleansingandcrimes against humanity.Areportby the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said at least 3,384 civilians were killed between January and June, mostly in the Darfur region, an RSF stronghold comprising five states in Sudan’s west and south. The region has been a centre of intense fighting in recent months, as the group pushes to maintain its territorial dominance there afterlosing the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, to the army in March.The latest focus of the battle isEl Fasher, the last remaining major city in Darfur controlled by the army. An estimated 260,000 people have beentrapped for 16 months by an RSF siegethat has cut off humanitarian assistance and caused starvation.Darfurians like Dafallah from the across the country, not just the region itself, have headed to the borders withSouth Sudanand Chad for fear of being targeted by both warring parties because of their ethnic roots.Suba Dafallah’s journeyThe RSF emerged from Arab Janjaweed militias that were co-opted by the regime of former president Omar al-Bashir from 2003 to help suppress an insurgency by non-Arab groups in Darfur.Researchers at the Avaaz advocacy group say the RSF and its allies are continuing toethnically targetdarker-skinned and non-Arab people. For their part, the army and its allies view Darfurians who did not flee areas formerly under RSF control as collaborators or sympathisers. The army is also suspicious about people from communities who formed part of the non-Arab resistance to the government and the Janjaweed in the 2000s.“Anyone with deeply melanated skin is held with a lot of suspicion,” said Shayna Lewis, Sudan specialist at Avaaz .‘There is no safe place’The Renk transit centre was full of activity despite it being the rainy season.

He said he had no choice but to flee because RSF fighters were everywhere in the city, weapons were in the hands of civilians as well as soldiers, and the army was starting forcibly to recruit people.As he travelled, he saw dead bodies by the side of the road in areas where fight had been particularly fierce.View image in fullscreenNadir Omar outside his shelter at the Renk transit centre.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The GuardianOmar, who lost his brother and six other relatives when an army aircraft bombed a market in Ed Daein, left behind his pregnant wife and their four children. He hopes they can join him in South Sudan, then go together to Uganda, the country that hosts the largest number of refugees inAfrica.The fear of being targeted by both of the war’s protagonists hung over his head throughout the journey. At one stage, he and fellow travellers hitched a ride on in a lorry carrying goats and hid among the animals to avoid being spotted by government forces.“If you decline recruitment, they accuse you of belonging to RSF, and it becomes difficult to defend yourself against that accusation,” the 35-year-old said. “If I met RSF, they would accuse me of being a member of the Sudanese army, and if I met the Sudanese army, they would accuse me of belonging to RSF.”Darfurians living in other parts of the country have also fled to Renk for fear of persecution.View image in fullscreenPeople walk among scattered objects in the Geneina market after fierce fighting in April 2023.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesGamal Issa, a retired soldier originally from Geneina city, in West Darfur state, had been living in Khartoum for years before leaving in June, a few months after the army recaptured the city.The 44-year-old said government forces were targeting people from Darfurian communities and he no longer felt safe. Any connection to Darfur was enough to arouse suspicion of an RSF connection even, he said, in army-controlled territory.“If you are from Darfur in general, you are not welcome in Khartoum,” he said. “Regardless of your ethnic group.”View image in fullscreenGamal Issa shows damage to his leg from a drone attack in Khartoum.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The GuardianIssa, who whose left leg was amputated after he was hit by an army drone strike on a market in Khartoum, travelled to Renk with his wife and their four children. He had lost his brother in another strike at the same market a month before. Two of his children, and a son-in-law, have disappeared since the war began.“I believe there is no safe place to live in Sudan,” he said.Dafallah, a mechanic and construction worker, was about to get engaged but his girlfriend disappeared when the war broke out. He was his family’s breadwinner after his father, a former Sudanese soldier, died. The mental anguish from the attack on his home is taking a toll. “At night, I have nightmares and scream my mother’s name in my sleep,” he said.His goal is to get to the city of Wau in north-western South Sudan, where his mother was originally from, to live with his uncles. “Honestly, after they killed my family and my relatives scattered … I had no reason to stay in Sudan,” he said. “Even if the war stops, I will never return to Sudan.”Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaRefugeesSouth SudanMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both said they were beaten and tortured before being dumped at their countries’ borders.Kizza Besigye, a prominent Ugandan opposition leader, and his aide Obeid Lutale were detained in Kenya in November. Besigye was later charged with treason at a military court martial in Kampala.Atuhaire said: “It points to two possible scenarios: that the three authoritarian [leaders] in east Africa are working together to crack down on critics, activists and journalists, or that they are very afraid of a united east Africa and that’s why they use force on east Africans being seen supporting their fellow east Africans who are victims of their repression – or both.”Njagi was abducted by masked men in Nairobi last year during a wave of abductions believed to have been targeted at critics of the Kenyan government. He was held incommunicado after 32 days for advocating progressive economic measures and better governance.Wine, who is challenging Museveni in Uganda’s presidential elections in January, criticised the abductions.“We condemn the continuing lawlessness by the rogue regime and demand that these brothers are released unconditionally,” the 43-year-old said on X. “The criminal regime apparently abducted them simply for associating with me and expressing solidarity with our cause.”A police spokesperson, Rusoke Kituuma, did not respond to repeated calls to comment on the matter. The government has made no statement.Museveni, 81, has held power in Uganda since 1986, making him one of the world’s most longstanding national leaders.Explore more on these topicsUgandaKenyaBobi WineYoweri MuseveniAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Armed with knives, the group set fire to a part of the facility and to a vehicle, local authorities said.The deaths were the first fatalities as anger mounts across the north African country over government spending.The recent wave of youth anger was sparked by earlier protests over poor hospital conditions after eight women died in a public hospital in the city of Agadir, and quickly spread to other cities.View image in fullscreenAn overturned police car during a protest in the Moroccan city of Salé where witnesses say groups of young men hurled stones at police, looted shops and set fires.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APThe protests started on Saturday with demands for better education and healthcare and have been organised online by a loosely formed anonymous youth group calling itself GenZ 212, which has been using used platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and the gaming social chat app Discord to mobilise support.Membership in GenZ 212’s Discord server has surged from about 3,000 last week to more than 130,000 today.The protests mirror similar youth-led unrest that has swept countries such asNepal,MadagascarandKenya.Authorities initially responded with attempts to quash the rallies, but the demonstrationsescalated into widespread unreston Tuesday night. The interior ministry said 263 members of the security forces and 23 civilians were injured during clashes.On Wednesday night, violence spread to the city of Salé, where groups of young men in densely populated neighbourhoods hurled stones at police, looted shops, set banks on fire and torched police vehicles, according to witnesses.The demonstrations have taken the country by surprise and emerged as some of Morocco’s biggest in years. There have been mass arrests in more than a dozen cities, particularly in places where jobs are scarce and social services lacking.View image in fullscreenDemonstrations across Morocco that started with demands for better education and healthcare escalated in widespread unrest on Tuesday night.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APProtesters are decrying what they see as widespread corruption, contrasting the flow of billions in investment towardpreparation for the 2030 World Cupthe lacking funding for and poor state of schools and hospitals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite rapid development according to some metrics, many Moroccans feel disillusioned by its unevenness.Officials have denied prioritising World Cup spending over public infrastructure, saying problems facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments.In Morocco’s parliament, the governing majority said it would meet on Thursday to discuss healthcare and hospital reforms as part of a meeting headed by the prime minister.Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham, said the protests had been triggered by economic issues and were happening “in more urbanised areas that are not as deeply authoritarian”.“In general, it is where extremely young populations interact with urbanisation and economic downturn, under conditions where it is possible to protest,” he said.On Thursday, GenZ 212 announced further “peaceful protests”. The demonstrations were scheduled to begin at 1600 GMT, the group said, adding that gathering points would be announced later in the day.Reuters, AFP andAssociated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsMoroccoProtestAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The unrest broke out on 25 September when local councillors were arrested for protesting against water and electricity outages in the capital, Antananarivo. The youth-led protests quickly spread to other towns and cities, fuelled by social media and other “Gen Z protestsin Indonesia and Nepal, wherethe government was toppled.Madagascar is one of the world’s poorest countries, with an average annual income of just $545 last year, according to theWorld Bank. The Indian Ocean island, which has a population of 32 million, was ranked 140 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2024Corruption Perceptions Index.Activists, who are part of Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people, are demanding the resignation of the president; the dissolution of parliament; the replacement of constitutional court judges and electoral commission members and the rooting out of corruption that they say stems from the president andbusinessmen close to him.“When he decided to dissolve the government, we felt like it was a small victory, but we will not stop there … We really want a radical change of the system because it’s the system that maintains the corruption and also maintains the oppression of the poorest people in the country,” said a 26-year-old activist who, like her fellow protesters, asked to remain anonymous for fear of arrest.View image in fullscreenA police officer amid flames on the streets of Antananarivo.Photograph: Mamyrael/APShe added: “After what happened in Nepal, youth really believe that their voices can be really powerful … and that we can actually change things. We don’t have to accept the status quo and we can define our future. We do not have to be sacrificed by this mediocre government.”In a speech announcing the dissolution of the government on Monday, Rajoelina, whocame to power in a coup in 2009after street protests against his predecessor, Marc Ravalomanana, said: “We acknowledge and apologise if members of the government have not carried out the tasks assigned to them.“I understand the anger, the sadness, and the difficulties caused by power cuts and water supply problems. I heard the call, I felt the suffering, I understood the impact on daily life.” He added that that he wanted to create space for dialogue with young people.The 26-year-old activist said the group would engage in talks only if they were public and fully transparent. Some of her fellow protesters rejected talks entirely, saying the president was insincere and trying to create division in their movement.“It’s literally a mafia,” said an 18-year-old protester, who finished secondary school this year and helps to run Gen Z Madagascar’s social media accounts. “They are going to try to speak to us, obviously, but it’s never going to be in our interest.”Gen Z Madagascar members had been learning from fellow young protesters in Asia, he said. They have joined the Nepali movement Discord’s servers and have adapted a flag with the cartoon skull and crossbones from the Japanese anime series One Piece, which has beenflown in Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines. In place of the original straw hat, the skull wears asatrokabucket hat from Madagascar’s Betsileo ethnic group.Similar Gen Z protests have beenraging in Moroccosince the weekend, with two people killed by security forces near Agadir on Wednesday.Malagasy officials have accused the protesters of looting. The president’s spokesperson, Lova Hasinirina Ranoromaro, said in a Facebookposton Wednesday: “We lost our jobs. Our property was destroyed. Our houses were raided … We don’t want a coup d’état.” Ranoromaro did not respond to requests for comment.The Malagasay activists denied young people were responsible for the looting and said they had arranged a cleanup day on 26 September. They added they were determined to remain “constitutional” and avoid a repeat of the 2009 coup.The young people said they were aware and often afraid of the risks they were taking and some of their compatriots had gone into hiding. But they were determined to continue until their demands for complete reform of Madagascar’s politics were met, they said.“I realised if I stop now, who’s gonna stand up again? If I don’t do it, who’s going to do it? If it’s not now, then when?” said a 25-year-old who helps to run Gen Z Madagascar’s social media. “Because it’s been 15 years that this regime has brought people to its knees and right now we’re standing up. So we are the last hope of this generation.”Explore more on these topicsMadagascarAfricaYoung peopleProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Finding 1,000 of them in a single recovery is both rare and extraordinary.”UnderFloridalaw, any “treasure trove” or other historic artifacts “abandoned” on state-owned lands or in state waters belong to the state, though excavators can be permitted to carry out “recovery services”. The law requires that roughly 20% of the recovered archaeological materials be retained by the state for research collections or public display.Explore more on these topicsFloridaShipping industrySpainAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Salvadorian national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the US without proper documentation as a teenager.Following widespread pressure, theTrump administrationreturned himto the US in June. Upon his return, however, he immediately faced criminal charges related to human smuggling, allegations that his lawyers have rejected.Ábrego wasreleasedfrom criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday while awaiting trial. But the Trump administration announced new plansto deport him to Ugandaand then Eswatini.Then Ábrego wastaken into custodyby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) during a scheduled immigration check-in in Baltimore, which was one of the conditions of his release.Ábrego entered the US without authorization around 2011 as a teenager. According to court documents, he was fleeing gang violence.Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Ábrego, repeatedly referring to him as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact that he has not been convicted of any crimes.His lawyers have filed motions requesting a gag order and said Ábrego will not be able to receive a fair trial because of the “highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements” made about him.While the federal judge in Tennessee can order prosecutors there not to make any prejudicial statements about Ábrego, it is unclear whether the judge’s authority extends to the Department of Homeland Security, which posted about the immigration court ruling on X on Wednesday.“His lawyers tried to fight his removal from the U.S. but one thing is certain, this Salvadoran man is not going to be able to remain in our country,” the post said.Since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has launched a massive crackdown on immigrants across the US, including sending federal forces and the national guard to assist US Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in numerous cities, nearly all of them Democrat-run.The actions have prompted outrage from many groups, including Democrats and civic society groups.The Associated Press contributed toreportingExplore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaUS immigrationIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationUS politicsEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

As well as filling it with classic cars andexotic animals– zebras, giraffes and kangaroos as well as the hippos – he installed an airstrip, various swimming pools and a 1,000-seat bull ring. On top of the entrance gate, Escobar also mounted a replica airplane, modeled on the one he allegedly used for his first cocaine shipment to the United States.After Escobar was killed in a rooftop shootout with security forces in Medellín in 1993, his playground was abandoned and fell into disrepair. It was later taken over by the state and leased to local authorities, who for a while opened it as a theme park.Now, part of the estate has been repurposed again, and given to victims of Colombia’s decades-long armed conflict.“We have begun to recover the Nápoles estate for the victims,” Petrowrote on social mediaon Wednesday.The cocaine kingpin’s wildest legacy: what can be done with Pablo Escobar’s marauding hippos?Read moreThe government has said that 120 hectares of the land has been given to local female farmers. Felipe Harman, director of the National Land Agency, called the decision “a historic victory for the women who never stopped fighting”.“It is an immense joy to finally celebrate,” said Millinery Correa, one of the beneficiaries, in a video shared by the state-run National Land Agency. “I feel very happy because today there are women who have hope, who have land for life.”Land disputes have long driven instability in Colombia, with drug traffickers and guerrillas forcibly evicting farmers to expand their territory and cultivate coca, the plant used to produce cocaine.Laura Bonilla, deputy director of the Peace and Reconciliation Foundation (PARES), said that Escobar “bought and seized” the land and sought to make it an “empire almost completely independent from Colombia, with its own laws and even its own ecosystem”.In May, Petro, the country’s first leftist president, proposed returning part of the land to farmers. “That hacienda has so many deaths that it must be returned to the people,”he said, adding that the land’s “genuine owners” were the rural farmers.But some local residents and business owners opposed the plan, arguing it threatened the local economy; the theme park attracts more than 1 milliontouristsannually. A protest later saw about 1,500 people block the Medellín-Bogotá highway.Despite the opposition, the plan has now been set in motion. “What president Petro did on 1 October was to give back the land, and also the dignity, to those who had lost everything,” Bonilla said.Despite the donation of the land, the growing population of feral hippos roam on, trampling crops andattacking nearby villages– a last corner of Escobar’s empire that has yet to be contained.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he was making the video on “behalf of the government of Canada” and acting on official advice.The band, comprising Naoise Ó Cairealláin, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh and JJ Ó Dochartaigh, say they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual. In an online statement addressing the MP, the band said: “Your comments about us are wholly untrue and deeply malicious. We will not accept it.”The veracity of Gasparro’s claim was called into question after officials failed to provide any further information, including if there was a ban, particularly after a British magistrate on Fridaythrew out a terror-related chargeagainst Ó hAnnaidh.On Wednesday the federal Conservative party called on Gasparro to provide clarity. “He either lied or he has no clue how it works. And I find it hard to believe that he has no clue how it works,” the party’s deputy leader, Melissa Lantsman, told Global News.Gasparro told reporters on Friday that he had made the video “based on the information that was available”.Terrorism case against Kneecap rapper Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh thrown outRead moreIn an email, his office said he had no further comment and referred questions to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), which did not respond. The office of public safety referred the Guardian to IRCC.After Gasparro’s statement, the band announced they would take legal action.Kneecap, who are known fortheir support of Palestineand their anti-authority lyrics, were scheduled to play four shows in Toronto and Vancouver this month.After the announcement, several sources from the governing federal Liberal partytold the Hill Timesthey were concerned about the video and expressed confusion over whether the ban would be implemented.The office of the privacy commissioner told the Guardian that Canada’s federal privacy laws did not apply to MPs when they were acting in their capacity as parliamentarians. The office said they had had no discussions with Gasparro on the Kneecap ban.Commenting on Gasparro’s video, Aidan Simardone, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer, said it constituted a “huge privacy issue”. It put the band in a position where they may face difficulties in officially appealing against the ban, he said.“It was everywhere, so I don’t see how an officer at IRCC can now make a fair decision on whether or not to let the band in, given that there’s been this public announcement essentially accusing them of terrorism,” Simardone said.The lack of clarity meant the band were likely to be “stuck in limbo”, he added.Explore more on these topicsCanadaKneecapAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Weeks later, Vanuatu said it planned to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to deepen policing cooperation with China.While Napuat said the two deals were separate, the stalled Nakamal pact and Australia’s recentfailure to sign a defence treaty with Papua New Guineahave dealt a blow to Canberra’s efforts to push back on Beijing’s influence in the Pacific.Albanese went to Vanuatu to sign a $500m agreement – but leaves empty-handed thanks to concerns about ChinaRead moreIn an interview with the Guardian, Napuat acknowledged Australia’s role as a major player in the Pacific region but stressed that “this big partner must also respect the wishes of smaller nations like Vanuatu”.Napuat said Vanuatu must assert itself as a sovereign nation, no longer subject to external pressures or “bullying” by larger countries such as Australia.“These days are over,” he said. “We want the agreement to genuinely represent what we envision for our people tomorrow. This is the primary reason why the Nakamal agreement has been delayed.”Napuat did not provide details of Vanuatu’s specific concerns. But he said leaders were working to ensure “the agreement truly portrays what we believe is best for our people and not an indirect statement of neocolonialism which could negatively impact our people in the future”.“The leaders are open and can sign the agreement as soon as possible,” he said.A spokesperson for the Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Australia “firmly respects Vanuatu’s sovereignty”.“As close partners with a shared vision of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Pacific, we welcomed the invitation from Vanuatu for a Nakamal agreement,” the spokesperson said.“When we partner with our Pacific neighbours, we do so with utmost respect for their sovereignty and their sovereign processes.“Pacific leaders have agreed that Pacific security is the shared responsibility ofPacific Islands Forummembers, and Australia shares that view.”Prof Joanne Wallis, the director of the security in the Pacific Islands research program at the University of Adelaide, said while Australia remained Vanuatu’s major security partner, getting the Nakamal agreement signed and ratified was “always a long shot”.“It didn’t have widespread support at the political level, and Australia should have foreseen this failure given the quiet demise of the 2022 security agreement, which the Vanuatu government never ratified,” she said.As negotiations with Australia on the agreement continue, Vanuatu has moved to deepen policing cooperation withChina.Napuat met with China’s minister of public security, Wang Xiaohong, in Beijing last month and said the two countries hoped to formalise an MoU. Napuat said any deal is separate from the Nakamal agreement and focuses specifically on cooperation in policing and law enforcement – not broader security arrangements.China has supported the Vanuatu police force since 2014, providing training, equipment and infrastructure. The minister said an agreement with Beijing would bring “structure and transparency to a partnership that has been ongoing for over a decade but was never formalised like our MoUs with other countries”.He noted Vanuatu has similar agreements in place with countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom “to better coordinate and manage various areas of partnership in the policing sector with all partners”.Wallis said Australia had a “longstanding anxiety about powers with potentially hostile interests establishing a foothold in its Pacific neighbours”.She said policing assistance from China provided to countries including Vanuatu “could have negative domestic impacts”, such as “introducing authoritarian policing tactics or propping up potentially illegitimate governments”.But Wallis noted Australia still did “exponentially more than any other country in the southern Pacific”.“China is never going to step in to provide the comprehensive security support that Australia does,” she said.Explore more on these topicsVanuatuPacific islandsAsia PacificChinaSouth PacificPacific Islands ForumAustralian foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

In California, 18,000 buildings were destroyed in 2018 causing US$16bn (A$24bn, £12bn) in damage. Portugal, Greece, Algeria and Australia have all felt the grief and the economic pain in recent years.As the headlines, the death tolls and the billion-dollar losses from wildfires have stacked up around the world, so too have the rising temperatures – fuelled by the climate crisis – that create tinderbox conditions.Australia’s horrifying climate future in four charts – and how we can avoid the worstRead moreFor the first time scientists say they have shown unambiguously that the numbers of “societally disastrous” wildfires – the ones that hit economies hard and take lives – have increased around the world as global heating bites.“We’re witnessing a fundamental shift in how wildfires impact society,” said the Australian scientist Dr Calum Cunningham, who led researchpublished in the journal Science. “Climate change sets the stage for these disasters.”Looking at the 200 costliest fires between 1980 and 2023 – pulled from a private database maintained by global re-insurer Munich Re – the trends were clear.View image in fullscreenA man looks on as fire destroys houses in Tondo, Manila in November 2024. Studies have found the weather conditions that promote fires around the world are getting worse, and happening more often, because of global heating.Photograph: Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesOf the 200 most damaging fires since 1980 – that is, the fires with the highest direct costs relative to each nation’s GDP – 43% happened in the last 10 years.Half of the fires that cost US$1bn or more were also in the last 10 years. Over the 44 years analysed, the frequency of fires causing 10 or more deaths tripled while the population only went up by 1.8 times.Temperatures and the dryness of the atmosphere and of the vegetation – all factors promoting fires – all got significantly worse between 1980 and 2023.Half the wildfires happened while local weather conditions were in the worst 0.1% on record for fire danger.Disturbing regularityMany studies have found the weather conditions that promote fires around the world are getting worse, and happening more often, because of global heating.But the last major study that looked globally at the cost of those wildfires and the deaths related to them was in 2016 and found no trends.The period since then had been “punctuated by major fire disasters with disturbing regularity,” the authors said.“We went looking for that study showing things were getting worse. We felt intuitively that they were, but there was no research,” said Cunningham, of the University of Tasmania’s Fire Centre.“Climate sceptics have seized on that gap, so we hope this puts to bed the idea it’s not getting worse. Things are getting worse.“It is unambiguous and it is clear climate change is playing a role. These aren’t just bigger fires, they’re fires occurring under increasingly extreme weather conditions that make them unstoppable.”View image in fullscreenThe Sydney Harbour Bridge is shrouded in smoke haze as bushfires burn in 2021. Air pollution caused by fires can cause premature death due to respiratory problems.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPHe said the results point to the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly, but to also better manage forests close to populations. The public could help by doing maintenance to stop embers getting inside buildings and clearing fuels like leaves.Other unquantified influences that may be contributing to the worsening trend included the numbers of people living close to forests and the abandonment of agricultural areas.The authors said the trends came despite “ballooning expenditure on fire suppression” – US federal spending on fire suppression, for example, more than tripled between 1985 and 2022.“This expenditure is likely limiting (or masking) the fire crisis, but not offsetting it,” they wrote.1:10Firefighters tackle wildfires across southern Europe – videoThe number of deaths from fires was likely a gross underestimate. One database recorded 19 direct deaths from fires in Indonesia in 2015, but the resulting air pollution was implicated in about 100,000 premature deaths from respiratory problems.Roadmap to catastrophic disasterWhen the researchers looked at areas with a high risk of fires close to populations, they found this deadly combination on 10% of the planet’s land surface.Those areas included January’s fires in Los Angeles, with direct losses estimated at US$65bn – “likely the costliest fire disaster in history” – and the 2024 fires in Valparaíso, Chile, that claimed 135 lives.Both those disasters happened after the data analysis was completed, suggesting the methods were able to predict places at risk.“This provides a roadmap for where the next catastrophic disasters are most likely to occur,” said Bowman.Dr Hamish Clarke, an expert on fires and climate change at the University of Melbourne not involved in the study, said: “This is an important new paper that puts some hard numbers on a much discussed topic – global trends in, and drivers, of socially and economically damaging fires.“Unfortunately the news is not good – fires are killing more people and imposing more costs on economies around the world.”Explore more on these topicsWildfiresBushfiresClimate crisisNatural disastersAir pollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

We have no right to do so for reasons of our own security.”“I think no one doubts that Russia’s countermeasures will not be long in coming,” he added, speaking at the Valdai plenary session, an annual gathering of officials and foreign policy experts where Putin often sets out his views on global affairs.His remarks came as45 European leaders gathered in Copenhagenfor a summit aimed at bolstering support for Ukraine and accelerating defence projects intended to ensure the continent is capable of deterring Russian aggression. The meeting followed turbulent weeks in which several European countries reported Russian drone and jet incursions, raising fears that Moscow was testing Nato’s resolve.While threatening Europe, the Russian president struck a conciliatory note towards Donald Trump, despitethe US leader’s recent disparaging remarks about him.In what appeared to be an attempt to win back Trump’s favour, Putin lavished praise on him, claiming that “if Trump had been in power, the conflict inUkrainecould have been avoided” – a line the US president has often used himself in public speeches.Both Moscow andVolodymyr Zelenskyyhave spent months trying to court Trump over the war in Ukraine, as the US leader has repeatedly shifted his stance.In recent weeks, Kyiv appeared to gain the upper hand, with Trump expressing disappointment in Putin for prolonging the fighting and dismissing Russia’s economy and military as a “paper tiger”.US to give Ukraine intelligence on long-range energy targets in Russia, say reportsRead moreAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Trump recently authorised US intelligence agencies and the Pentagon to help Kyiv carry out strikes deep inside Russian territory – a move which would amount to a significant shift in US policy under his leadership.Zelenskyy has also lobbied Washington for Tomahawk cruise missiles, Barracudas and other long-range US-made weapons capable of hitting targets up to 500 miles away.As on previous occasions when criticised by Trump, Putin brushed it off, seemingly counting on the US leader to change his mind.He described Trump as a “comfortable interlocutor” who knows “how to listen” and said Moscow was seeking a “full-scale restoration” of relations with the US, praising Trump’s administration for its “directness and lack of hypocrisy”.Responding to Trump’s “paper tiger” jab, Putin suggested the remark might have been ironic, saying: “If we are comfortable being at war with the wholeNatobloc, but we’re a paper tiger, then what is Nato?”The Russian leader also praised Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza, saying former UK prime minister Tony Blair –expected to play a central role in the initiative– could “make a positive contribution”.Putin then digressed to recall how he once stayed overnight at Blair’s home and the two had coffee together the next morning “in their pyjamas”.The tone was notably harsher when it came to Europe, with most of Putin’s ire directed at the continent, blaming “European elites” for obstructing peace in Ukraine and “whipping up hysteria” in the region.He said: “It turns out that war with the Russians is practically on the doorstep. They repeat this nonsense, this mantra, over and over again … They can’t believe what they’re saying, that Russia is going to attack Nato? They’re either incredibly incompetent if they truly believe it, because it’s impossible to believe this nonsense, or they’re simply dishonest.”Putin also condemned France’s arrest this week of the crew onan oil tanker from Russia’s “shadow fleet”, which was suspected of serving as a launchpad for drone flights that forced Danish airports to close last week.He said: “The tanker was seized without any grounds in neutral waters. This is piracy.”On the war in Ukraine, there was no sign that Putin was seeking compromise or scaling back his maximalist goal of forcing Kyiv’s capitulation.Despite Russia’s modest recent progress on the battlefield, he insisted that his forces were “confidently advancing” along the entire front.Putin also claimed Ukraine was suffering far greater losses than Russia – even though western estimates put Russian casualties at close to a million, higher than Ukraine’s.“Given Ukraine’s losses, Kyiv should think seriously about starting negotiations,” Putin said.Joining European leaders in Copenhagen, Zelenskyy said Russia was “stepping up its destructive actions” and urged Europe to show the “political will” to act without delay.The Ukrainian president said: “We see clearly that only joint action and united efforts can guarantee real security. No country should be left alone against this threat.” He called on Europe to “increase the pressure, and increase the pressure now, so that Russia is forced to end the war and change its policy”.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinDonald TrumpRussiaUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeNatonewsShareReuse this content"

It is built with ephemerality, with aggressive marketing.”But, she added, France’s distaste for the trend went even deeper: “It differs from French culture’s tradition of keeping objects, of savoir-faire – Shein holds a stigma that is moral as well.”Yet despite such outspoken antipathy, and with a Change.org petition to ban Shein in France now having topped 270,000 signatures, the country has not been immune to the brand’s inexorable rise over the past five years.Its model, based on shipping orders of cheap clothes directly from Chinese factories to homes, reportedly brought in $1bn net profit last year, making it not simply a figurehead of “ultra-fast fashion”, but one of China’s most lucrative companies. That is despite criticism overits environmental impactandworking practices, including allegations of forced labour that the company has denied, and cases of child labour that led to supplier contracts being terminated.Its success rests with the mind-boggling speed and volume at which it can produce designs, with 7,200 new items listed on the site every day. “It marks an entirely new way of consuming – everything is multiplied by a hundred,” said Abriat. Between late 2022 and late 2023, the company introduced 1.5m products to the US market – roughly 37 times more than Zara and 65 times more than H&M, according to Reuters.View image in fullscreenA model walks the runway during Shein’s ‘Endless Summer’ show in Paris in 2023.Photograph: Kristy Sparow/Getty ImagesAround the time of the Dijon pop-up opening, the French senate approved legislation aimed at curtailing ultra-fast fashion, specifically platforms such as Shein and its ultra-low-cost shopping rival Temu. It proposed a range of measures, from eco-taxes to a ban on advertising, restrictions on influencer collaborations, mandatory disclosure of production practices, and redirection of taxed revenues towards French sustainable producers.The bill was praised by many as a step in the right direction, but raised eyebrows for distinguishing between “classical” fast fashion (Zara and H&M among others) and “ultra-fast fashion”. The former group faces less stringent constraints. For some, this distinction seems to make high-street labels appear more virtuous by comparison, despite similar supply chains; for others, it is simply regarded as a way of undercutting Chinese competition.Yet France has its own history of fast fashion, rooted in the Sentier, Paris’s historic garment district in the 2nd and 3rd arrondissements. From the 1970s onward, the quarter, alongside other such wholesale districts (including in Marseille), developed a model based on rapid turnaround, small quantities, and short supply circuits, often replenished on demand rather than by seasonal calendars.This fuelled the rise of cult – and affordable – homegrown high street labels, such as Naf Naf, Kookaï, and Jennyfer, which thrived in the 1980s and 1990s, both in France and abroad, before outsourcing production and eventually disappearing or repositioning themselves. By the late 20th century, the Sentier’s system was outpaced by international labels such as H&M and Zara, which delocalised production and scaled up sourcing and stock – a dynamic portrayed in the French film saga La Vérité si Je Mens! (Would I Lie to You?), which is set in the area.On a cultural level, Abriat compared Shein’s reception to that of the arrival of H&M on Paris’s rue de Rivoli in 1998: “It was considered vulgar. The fashion elite saw it [as] devoid of taste or culture.” Today, she said, “they have been worked into actual labels, fully accepted” while Shein has taken on the pariah role.Attracting teenagers, H&M radically shifted its image with Karl Lagerfeld’s collaboration in 2004, which sold out within hours. From then on, France’s fashion establishment began to accept high-street pieces as part of the Parisian wardrobe.Other fast-fashion megabrands sought credibility by working tightly with renowned industry names. Emmanuelle Alt, the former editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris, worked with Zara as a creative consultant, while Suzanne Koller, the co-founder of Self Service magazine and current fashion editor at M magazine, has collaborated extensively with the brand, around fashion direction and styling. The model and Chanel ambassador Caroline de Maigret walked in an H&M runway show, and the model Aymeline Valade has appeared in a Zara lookbook and told W magazine that she shops there, for basics at least.Sophie Fontanel, a writer, influencer, and fashion editor at L’Obs, said: “Here in Paris, it has become common to mix Zara, vintage and luxury, all with a certain knowhow. Parisians don’t go to Zara for statement pieces or counterfeits, but for basics: shirts, jeans, timeless staples.” Few admit to wearing the brand, however. “You don’t say it,” says Fontanel. “Or you say: ‘You won’t believe it, but it’s Zara.’”A key difference with Shein is its online presence, which represents a cultural shift for older shoppers. the French-British influencer and writer Camille Charrière said: “The French still like to shop in stores, with their friends and family, on the weekend. They don’t change outfits radically to go out on the weekend or at night, their purchases are less compulsive.”View image in fullscreenShein has announced plans to open a shop in the BHV store in Paris.Photograph: Antoine Boureau/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty ImagesPart of the appeal of ultra-fast fashion lies in its size inclusivity. The plus-size market is still virtually non-existent in France, particularly among mid- and high-end labels.Ultra-fast fashion has also introduced new ways of consuming: online shopping, skipping fittings, and bulk ordering. Garments are often worn once, then thrown out or resold on secondhand platforms – a drastic shift in pace, durability and building a wardrobe.Charrière stressed that there was a “slow” way of wearing fast fashion: “One shouldn’t torture oneself about wearing fast fashion. I have Zara dresses from five years ago that I still wear. To me the most important thing is to force myself to use what I buy … to commit to wearing it.” While that doesn’t change the supply chain it came from, Charrière may have a point: shaming Shein customers often overlooks the privilege of being able to afford more expensive alternatives.Shein has seized on that tension. In April it plastered slogans such as “Fashion is a right, not a privilege” across billboards and ads. Christophe Castaner, the former interior minister who is now head of Shein France’s communication, accused lawmakers of punishing low-income shoppers with what he called “a VAT on the products of the poorest”, adding: “Personally, I find that pretty disgusting”.Sheinhas saidin response to reports of labour abuses that it works “tirelessly to ensure that these isolated cases are removed from our supply chain entirely”.For Elise Goldfarb, a professor at the Institut Français de la Mode and an active voice in denouncing the use of Uyghur forced labour in fast fashion supply chains, the phenomenon has shed light on the reality of another segment of French society. “Fast fashion speaks to a segment of the population for whom it feels outrageous to be lectured about ecology during a major crisis they are paying for,” she says.Taxation and regulation may be a useful first step, but they leave the core problem of overproduction untouched. The real question is how the industry can be reshaped around the durability and repair of clothes that can be passed down generations, once so central to the French approach.“It’s like a flood of information with no attachment, everything interchangeable,” said Stéphane Popescu, co-founder of a consultancy specialising in ethical fashion. “I see mountains of ultra-fast fashion clothing in vintage stores, and it feels as if the emotional value of things has disappeared, like there’s no time to build memories around items.”Explore more on these topicsSheinRetail industryFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers have been seeking a temporary exemption from the EU tax until the UK and EU align their carbon emission schemes.The Guardian understands that the EU and UK are working on mechanisms that would shield British exporters from the levy’s impact and that a temporary deal is now viewed by both sides as likely.An agreement would represent a boost to businesses that rely on trade with the EU. It comes ahead of the next UK-EU summit, which has been pencilled in for May or June.Atthis year’s summit, in May, Keir Starmer and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed to link the UK and EU emission schemes and unveiled a formal defence and security pact.A deal is expected to conclude within weeks allowing British defence companies to participate in military projects funded by EU defence loans. The first round of applications is due by the end of November.The EU and UK are also in negotiations over a deal to allow thousands of young Europeans totemporarily live and work in the UKand vice versa.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said last week that ministers wanted to agree an “ambitious” youth mobility scheme that would be “good for the economy, good for growth and good for business”.She told the Times that officials were in talks over the number of young people that could take part in the scheme annually, their age range and for how long they would be able to stay.Addressing an EU reception at the Labour party conference in Liverpool on Monday, Stephen Doughty, a Foreign Office minister, said ministers were pursuing “a wider reset with all of Europe”. He said: “This is about Britain back on the world stage, back on the European stage, and a partner for peace, for prosperity and progress.”A Cabinet Office source said: “We aren’t going to get ahead of negotiations, nor provide a running commentary.”Naomi Smith, the chief executive of Best for Britain, which has campaigned for the move since May 2023, said: “Some of Britain’s biggest international investors have warned that divergence between the EU and UK on carbon taxes could cost jobs and investment.“This common-sense move will reduce costs and admin for businesses in the EU and UK while helping to boost economic growth in Britain. The government must now work with our European allies to fully align Britain’s own carbon tax regime to secure these benefits for the long term.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I am onboard the ship Alma. We are about to be intercepted by Israel.”Thunberg and other activists were arrested and taken into custody at the Israeli port of Ashdod.While some of the vessels were boarded by Israeli soldiers, others sailed on towards the Gaza Strip before being intercepted.It was the first time since Israel imposed a naval blockade on Gaza’s waters in 2009 that an unauthorised humanitarian mission has reached closer than 70 nautical miles from the territory.The flotilla put out several videos on Telegram with messages from individuals onboard the various boats, some holding their passports, stating that they had been abducted and taken to Israel against their will and reiterating that their mission was a nonviolent humanitarian cause.Footage broadcast by Sky Italia showed activists on deck being hit by powerful jets of water. Those onboard said they heard loud bangs near several of the boats, believed to be stun grenades dropped from drones.View image in fullscreenA vessel of the Global Sumud flotilla arrives at Ashdod port after being intercepted by the Israeli authorities while carrying aid to Gaza.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPAOne boat, named Mikeno, appeared to have escaped the maritime blockade and to have stopped inside Palestinian territorial waters near Gaza’s coast before being intercepted.Crew members on other vessels in the flotilla said they received a radio message from the Mikeno in which the ship’s captain declared: “We see land.”Ramazan Tunç, a member of the Turkish delegation of the flotilla, told the Anadolu news agency that the Mikeno had entered Gaza’s territorial waters, thereby breaking the blockade.“I want to share with you the joy that we have managed to bring our ship into Gaza,” he said, describing it as an achievement that many had deemed impossible under the heavy restrictions imposed by land and sea.The vessel was reported to be idling about 9 nautical miles off Gaza, where it had been stationary for some time before being stopped.Members of the flotilla will be handed over to the police before being transferred to Ketziot prison, a large facility in the Negev desert. Those who refuse deportation will be tried by a special court of interior ministry officials, rather than a regular court, for illegal entry.Those arrested include nine Irish citizens, including the Sinn Féin senator Chris Andrews, at least two Italian MPs, the French MEP Emma Fourreau, Franciszek Sterczewski, an MP from Poland’s ruling coalition, and a former RAF pilot, Malcolm Ducker, 72, who piloted one of the flotilla’s vessels, called All In.In a phone interview with the Guardian, Ducker’s daughter, Clare Azzougarh, said she was concerned about her father being detained in Ketziot, also known as Ansar III, a high-security prison used primarily to hold Palestinian security prisoners, many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities.“Early in the morning I saw the video of the Israeli commandos coming on to the boat to arrest all the members of my father’s boat and that’s the last I saw him,” Azzougarh said.‘‘My dad joined the flotilla because he was so upset and frustrated about what was happening in Gaza and seeing that no government or international community was really going to take any meaningful action and he couldn’t stand to see all the death, but crucially all the children being starved, and felt that he had to do something.”She added: “I’m very very impressed with how he handled himself yesterday. I know it’s the honour of his lifetime to serve in this mission. He wanted to uphold international law because it’s an illegal blockade.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators clash with police during a protest in Naples after Israel’s raid on the flotilla.Photograph: Ciro De Luca/ReutersSpontaneous protests broke out across Italy in response to the raid. Protestswere also reportedin Brussels, Athens, Buenos Aires and Berlin, while the Spanish government called on Israel to protect the safety and rights of activists.Spain’s labour minister and deputy prime minister, Yolanda Díaz, described the attack on the flotilla as “a crime against international law” and demanded that Israel immediately release those it had detained.Writing on Bluesky, she said: “The EU needs to break off relations with Israel right now.”The British government was “very concerned” about Israel’s interception of an international aid flotilla bound for Gaza, the Foreign Office said on Thursday, adding that it had made clear to Israel that the situation should be resolved safely.Turkey’s foreign ministry said the Israeli “attack” on the flotilla was “an act of terror” that endangered the lives of civilians.Israel imposed the naval blockade in 2009, an intensification of its 2007 blockade of Gaza in response to Hamas seizing control of the territory. The UN has condemned the blockade on numerous occasions, calling it “a direct contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law”.The flotilla argued it was a civilian, unarmed group and that the passage of humanitarian aid was guaranteed in international law.Previous attempts by activists to break the naval blockade on Gaza were stopped by force by the Israeli military. In 2010, 10 Turkish activists were killed by Israeli commandos whoraided the Mavi Marmara shipas it led an aid flotilla towards Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaGreta ThunbergnewsShareReuse this content"

They will say “yes, but we need this and that”, Abusada said.Hugh Lovatt, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said it would be very difficult for Hamas to accept the terms unconditionally. “That is understandable. The text lacks details. But then anything other than total and final acceptance will be used against Hamas by Israel, the Trump administration and possibly the Europeans,” he said.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has accepted the Trump plan, which has incorporated many of Israel’s principal demands and was formulated without consulting Hamas.Israel intercepts aid flotilla but one ship reported to have escaped blockadeRead moreNetanyahu, who is wanted for alleged war crimes by the international criminal court committed during the Israeli offensive inGaza, has said Israel would “finish the job” if Hamas rejected the proposal or slowed their implementation. In March, Israel unilaterally broke a two-month ceasefire, refusing to move to a scheduled second phase that could have definitively ended hostilities.Hamas leaders are divided between Istanbul, Doha and Gaza, which complicates discussions on the group’s response. Turkey and Qatar are putting pressure on Hamas to make concessions.One sticking point is the plan’s demand that Hamas disarm, a source close to the organisation said. The surrender of all weapons would be very difficult for Hamas to accept, especially without any political process or substantial progress towards a two-state solution.“There are different trends within the movement. The membership in Doha tends to be more pragmatic, especially compared to the military leadership in Gaza. There is an obvious need to have the buy-in of the military win, and the rank and file fighters,” said Lovatt.The war was triggered by the Hamas raid into southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. About 250 were taken hostage, of whom 48 remain in Gaza, though fewer than half are still alive.More than 66,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israel’s offensive in Gaza, much of the territory reduced to rubble, and most of the 2.3 million population displaced many times.View image in fullscreenSmoke billows after Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City on Thursday.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPATrump’s proposal will require the militants to release all Israeli hostages within 72 hours of a ceasefire coming into effect, the gradual withdrawal of Israeli military forces to a buffer zone along the perimeter, and a surge of humanitarian aid. It also requires Israel to free more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, many serving life sentences, which Hamas could frame as a significant win.Another concern for Hamas is the vague promise of Israeli withdrawals, though the clear statement that there will be no annexation or occupation of Gaza by Israel was welcomed by one source close to Hamas.Some analysts say divisions within Hamas are often exaggerated.“I don’t think there is a real split between Gaza, the West Bank and the outside leadership. They all agree on opposing the disarmament because the armed struggle is such a deep principle in their nature and identity,” said Michael Milshtein, an expert in Hamas at Tel Aviv University.Hamas has suffered very significant losses in the war. Thousands of fighters have been killed, along with almost all senior military leaders. A report by ACLED, the independent violence monitoring group, found at least 40 commanders and key operatives in Hamas’s military wing had been killed by Israeli airstrikes since March. Their deaths have left only one senior commander from Hamas’s pre-7 October military council still in command, ACLED said.But Hamas continues guerrilla operations and maintains fragments of governance in the absence of any alternative. Humanitarian officials in Gaza said the group still had a strong presence in Gaza City, the “central camps” farther south and the coastal zone of al-Mawasi.Hamas, which was founded in 1987, has recruited thousands of new fighters who, though inexperienced and poorly equipped, can inflict casualties on Israeli forces.Milshtein said that, according to military sources, 90% of Hamas commanders had been killed, 97% of its rockets destroyed or launched, but only 40% of the group’s extensive tunnel network had been destroyed.“Hamas have adjusted to the new conditions. They are active in areas where the [Israeli military] has declared Hamas is totally defeated, but you can’t totally erase Hamas. They have metamorphosed and they have survived,” Milshtein said.Some within Hamas are committed to rejecting the Trump plan outright.“There is a trend from the military wing, especially the younger fighters, which wants to keep fighting,” Lovatt said. “Their view is that Israel is struggling strategically: the mobilisation of reservists is a huge burden, elections are due within a year or so, there is growing international and domestic pressure … So, for them, it’s just a question of who will hold out the longest.”Explore more on these topicsHamasGazaPalestineIsraelDonald TrumpIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It would be part of what officials describe as a necessarily more offensive and unpredictable strategy in the wake of the bombing of its nuclear sites and the European reimposition of UN sanctions.The multi-pronged offensive includes expansion of its missile programme, strengthening air defences, suspending cooperation with the UN weapons inspectorate and on 18 October blocking the establishment of a UN committee to oversee the administration of the reimposed sanctions. Officials remain opposed to reopening talks with the US, believing the talks would fail.The threat to send refugees towards the west as well as the east has echoes of the warning issued by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who threatened to send millions of Syrian refugees towards Europe.Iran has at times had to accommodate as many as 6 million Afghan refugees, but Amnesty International reports that in 2025 a million Afghan refugees have been sent back toAfghanistan, having fled either due to poverty or Taliban rule. Amnesty claimed the mass expulsions had been scaled up in the wake of Israel’s 12 June attacks on Iran’s leadership and nuclear sites. It estimates 500,000 Afghans have been sent back over the border since June.Until March 2025, several million Afghans had been permitted to temporarily legalise their stay in Iran by obtaining a “headcount” document. Those granted this document could access limited services, including access to state healthcare, public education, work authorisation, banking and ability to enter into rental agreements. But the authorities nullified these headcount documents.The Iranian authorities have given different figures about the number of Afghan refugees in the country, but it is thought a minimum of 2 million are in Iran illegally. The UN high commissioner for refugees has predicted that up to 4 million Afghans may be sent back to Afghanistan this year.A broader programme of repair and recovery is under way in Iran, including a discussion about the levers it retains to protect itself in the wake of the Israeli-US attacks in June. Iran has recalled its ambassadors from France, Germany and the UK for consultations at the foreign ministry in Tehran about the crisis. Officials are leaning against leaving the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, partly since the substantive steps have already been taken to end co-operation with the UN nuclear weapons inspectorate.Iranian officials confirm that in discussions with the French at the UN general assembly Iran offered to allow weapons inspectors to visit one bombed nuclear site at Natanz, and also offered to report on its stockpile of highly enriched uranium within 45 days. In return Iran wanted the threat of the return of UN sanctions to be lifted permanently, rather than for three months, the original French-led offer.Iran claims the US refused to engage with these proposals, part of what Tehran believes has become an increasingly erratic and unprofessional US diplomatic operation run by Steve Witkoff, a man that the Iranians regard as either outside the loop or duplicitous. Witkoff, for instance, was sending the Iranian delegation heading to the UN details of a meeting he was intending to hold with Iran’s diplomats, but he then scrapped the meeting altogether.In the next probable diplomatic clash with the US, it is expected that on 18 October Russia, which holds the rotating presidency of the security council, will use its power as a permanent member to block the establishment of a UN committee to monitor and oversee the sanctions the EUreimposed last week.Iran must move its capital from Tehran, says president as water crisis worsensRead moreRussia and China have already written to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to say European countries did not have the right to snap the sanctions back as they did on 28 September, since Europe in their view was no longer a participant in the nuclear deal, and had not exhausted the dispute resolution mechanism.The impasse makes it likely that some countries will not comply with the enforcement of the UN sanctions. Japan, Canada and Turkey have already started to reimpose the sanctions, but countries in the Russian and Chinese orbit will not do so. The Turkish president, Erdoğan, for instance, issued a presidential decree ordering asset freezes on Iranian individuals and entities linked to Tehran’s nuclear programme and major state banks.Officials say the most damaging sanctions on Iran are the existing ones imposed by the US, and by comparison the restored UN sanctions dating back from from 2006-10 are relatively narrow, since they do not cover Iran’s oil programme but instead specific asset freezes, arms limits and bans on missile trade.But Tehran accepts that even the partial return of UN sanctions is having an impact on economic confidence and on the exchange rate. The price of the dollar in Iran’s free market has set a new record.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsRefugeesAfghanistannewsShareReuse this content"

He admitted it had received a lot of criticism, but argued that the accumulating resource crises were so deep that Iran now had an obligation to shift the capital, and no choice but to do so.He made his remarks on a visit to Hormozgan province, which sits on the Persian Gulf opposite Dubai.“This region is located on the shores of the Persian Gulf and provides direct access to open waters and the development of trade and economic relations. If we have a different view of the capacities of this region, we can create a very prosperous and advanced region. It is not good enough to accept the current situation and not design a scientific, accurate and indigenous map for the future,” he said.“The problems the country is currently facing require us to direct the development path towards the Persian Gulf. Tehran, Karaj, and Qazvin are currently facing a water crisis, and this crisis cannot be easily solved.”Tehran has grown to a city of more than 10 million people, and consumes nearly a quarter of Iran’s water supplies.‘We must change’: how drought and overextraction of water has run Iran dryRead morePrevious presidents have raised the issue of moving the capital, including Hassan Rouhani, who even went so far as to draw up a plan with options.Pezeshkian has long sounded the alarm aboutIran’s worsening water crisis. On Thursday he said: “Last year, the rainfall was 140mm, while the standard is 260mm; that means rainfall has fallen by about 50 to 60%. This year, the situation is just as critical.” Some recent estimates put the rainfall in 2025 at just below 100mm.He added: “The reduction in water behind the dams, the drying up of some wells, and the high costs of transporting water from other areas all indicate the need for a change in approach. If we want to transport water from this area to Tehran, the cost per cubic meter will be up to €4”.Tehran’s dams normally provided 70% of the capital’s water, with the remaining 30% provided by underground resources. However, low rainfall and increased evaporation have reduced the dams’ share and increased pressure on groundwater.The president said: “Development without considering the impact on resources and expenditures will result in nothing but destruction. If someone cannot establish this balance, their development is doomed to failure.“In some areas, the land is subsiding by up to 30cm per year. This is a disaster and shows that the water beneath our feet is running out.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaDroughtWaternewsShareReuse this content"

At least nine Palestinians were killed there, including a grandfather, his four sons and a grandson, when the Israeli military struck a food store.Four siblings were killed while collecting firewood in al-Bureij refugee camp in centralGaza. Nine people, most of them women, died when another Israeli strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to medical authorities.Israel is intensifying its invasion of Gaza City, issuing a last evacuation warning for residents on Wednesday and sealing the route to northern Gaza for those living in the south. Israel Katz, the defence minister, said his troops were close to encircling the city and any residents remaining would be considered “terrorists or supporters of terror”.The International Committee of the Red Cross said civilians must be protected under international law whether they stayed or left their homes.Trump’s plan to end the fighting was announced on Monday at a joint press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu.The US president’s spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said on Thursday that the White House expectedHamasto approve the plan. Asked if there would be consequences if Hamas walked away, she told Fox News: “It’s a red line that the president of the United States is going to have to draw and I’m confident that he will.”Trump has threatened that the group would “pay in hell” if it does not sign. Under his 20-point plan, Hamas would disarm, exit politics and return 48 hostages, less than half of whom are thought to be alive. In return, Israel would release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and gradually withdraw its troops from Gaza once a peacekeeping force replaced them. The plan also envisions a surge of aid to Gaza and reconstruction of the territory.The plan lacks a clear pathway to a Palestinian state and Netanyahu later said Israeli troops would still operate in most of Gaza.Hamas said it was consulting its Palestinian partners. Sources close to the group say it will probably request amendments because the blueprint requires a virtually complete surrender, which the group has refused in past rounds of negotiations.France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said on Wednesday that the militant group must accept surrender. “Hamas bears a very heavy responsibility for the catastrophe experienced by the Palestinians. It has lost. It must accept its own surrender,” he told AFP.Three Palestinian armed factions in Gaza initially rejected the proposals but Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally, said on Wednesday that it would request changes.Hamas is seeking guarantees that Israel will not be able to continue conducting operations within Gaza after the deal is signed and that its members will be safe from assassination.Qatar and Egypt, which have been mediating peace talks for nearly two years, say the plan requires further negotiations but have otherwise supported it.Hamas has come under international pressure to respond positively as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.The Norwegian Refugee Council called on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal quickly. “World leaders talk of plans but every day people here bury their children. Words mean nothing without action,” said Jan Egeland, the group’s secretary general.Parts of Gaza are experiencing famine because of an Israeli blockade, while more than half a million people have been displaced south by bombing over the past six weeks. Israel insists there is no famine, contrary to the findings of most global aid bodies.Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 66,200 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000, according to the Gaza health authority. The two-year-old war started after Hamas-led militants carried out an attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelHamasPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was later found to be a fake.Police named the attacker on Thursday night as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent.Greater Manchesterpolice revealed that three other people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – had been arrested “on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism”.It is understood the attacker entered the UK as a young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006.LivePolice declare Manchester synagogue attack 'terrorist incident' – videoThe attack drew widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, with Keir Starmer calling the knife attacker a “vile individual” who “attacked Jews because they are Jews, and attacked Britain because of our values”. Political rivals Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage were among those joining him in showing support for the Jewish community.It happened just days before the second anniversary of the 7 October attacks by Hamas in Israel. Police said there would be heightened security at synagogues and Jewish community centres in coming days. Research published today showed that more than a third (35%) of British Jews said they felt unsafe in the UK, compared with just 9% before the 7 October attacks.The Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council ​said in a statement on Thursday evening that the attack was “sadly something we feared was coming”.They added: “We call on all those in positions of power and influence to take the required action to combat hatred against Jewish people, and will be working with the authorities on a series of additional measures to protect our community over the coming days.”Six minutes of terror: how Manchester synagogue attack unfoldedRead moreStarmer flew back to the UK early from a gathering of European leaders in Denmark to chair an emergencyCobra meetingafter the incident before speaking to the nation from Downing Street..Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: “Israel grieves with the Jewish community in the UK after the barbaric terror attack in Manchester.“Our hearts are with the families of the murdered, and we pray for the swift recovery of the wounded.”In reference to his combative speech at the UN general assembly last week, the Israeli prime minister added: “As I warned at the UN, weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism. Only strength and unity can defeat it.”Police said three people remained in hospital with serious injuries. One was stabbed while another was hit by a car, and a third man “presented himself at hospital with an injury that may have been sustained as officers stopped the attacker”.The Guardian understands the attacker’s last known address was in Manchester. Police said that officers were continuing inquiries as part of their investigation in Crumpsall and nearby Prestwich.In a statement, Greater Manchester police said: “We are now able to confirm that, although formal identification is yet to take place, we believe the person responsible for today’s attacks is 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie. He is a British citizen of Syrian descent.“A suspicious device worn by the attacker during the incident has been assessed and was deemed not to be viable.“Based on what we currently know, our records do not show any previous Prevent referrals relating to this individual.”The statement added: “We are working to understand the motivation behind the attack as the investigation continues.”The investigation is being led by counter-terrorism police.At an earlier press conference, the GMP chief constable, Sir Stephen Watson, said that, thanks to the bravery of worshippers, security staff and the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from entering the synagogue.He said: “There were a large number of worshippers attending the synagogue at the time of this attack.”Witnesses were said to have seen a car driving erratically before a man got out and started attacking people with a knife. When it became clear what was happening, members of the congregation are said to have blockaded the doors to the synagogue.Rob Kanter, 45, a university lecturer with a PhD in Jewish-Muslim relations, was inside the synagogue at the time of the attack. When he first heard the shots, Kanter said he felt “bewildered, because I think the adrenaline kicks in” and then found himself thinking “am I really hearing this?”His first response then was “how are we going to keep ourselves and everyone else safe?” But he said the mood inside the synagogue was “actually relatively calm” as the attack unfolded outside.Kanter said: “I would say the mood among our fellow congregants was very calm, and everyone deals with these things in their own way. Some people get through this in a very quiet way, others like to talk, some people even try to use an element of humour just to keep themselves going.”Kanter said that once they were evacuated by police, the rabbi did his best to continue with the Yom Kippur service.View image in fullscreenAn armed officer at the scene.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAGMP said officers had been called to the synagogue on Middleton Road at 9.31am by a person who said he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and that one man had been stabbed.The force said: “Firearms officers were deployed at 9.34am as police continued to receive further reports from members of the public that a security guard had been attacked with a knife.”It said it declared Plato – the national codeword used by police and emergency services when responding to a “marauding terror attack” – and a major incident at 9.37am.Shots were fired by police firearms officers at 9.38am, with paramedics arriving at 9.41am, the statement continued.Video shared on social media appeared to show police officers pointing guns at someone lying on the ground outside the front of the synagogue. Members of the public could be heard shouting to firearms officers that the suspect had a bomb strapped to him.The Guardian view on the Manchester synagogue attack: a tragic wake-up call for Britain | EditorialRead moreDistressed relatives and friends of those inside the building gathered at the cordon. A woman whose husband was inside the synagogue said she was sick with worry as she had been unable to contact him since the attack.“We’re just waiting for news,” said the woman, who did not want to be identified. “I’ve not even got dressed yet, I just ran out in my pyjamas.”Another woman, who lives nearby, said she had family and friends who attended the synagogue and she had rushed out as soon as she heard the police helicopter.Olivia Gold said: “I’m absolutely distraught. It’s Jewish new year as well and this is the holiest day in the calendar … It would have been very busy, mainly with the men doing the service. It’s a big shul [synagogue].”The UK’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, said on Thursday night: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”He added: “This is not only an assault on the Jewish community, but an attack on the very foundations of humanity and the values of compassion, dignity and respect which we all share.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterUK security and counter-terrorismGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

And he appeared to suggest that he wanted to ensure they did not face a repeat of “practices” he and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, had faced when younger – a possible reference to intrusive press scrutiny that also plagued their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.William said of the “insatiable” media he experienced growing up: “They wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they’d be everywhere.“And if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.”With regard to his change agenda, William said: “I embrace that and I enjoy that change – I don’t fear it. That’s the bit that excites me, is the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical change, but changes that I think that need to happen.”He added: “I think it’s very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this. But, there’s also points where you look at tradition and go: ‘Is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?’”Asked by Levy, star of the hit TV series Schitt’s Creek, if he thought about being king, William replied: “It’s not something I wake up in the morning and think about, because to me, being authentic and being myself and being genuine is what drives me.“And then you can attach whatever labels and kind of roles that come on top of that, but if I’m not true to myself, and I’m not true to what I stand for and believe in – then it doesn’t really matter who you are, it gets lost.“I take my roles and my responsibilities seriously but it’s important, like I said to you earlier, you don’t feel they own you – you have to own them.”Explore more on these topicsMonarchyPrince WilliamTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022, at-home medical abortions were made permanent in England and Wales, after temporary legislationallowed them to take place at homeduring the pandemic. In Northern Ireland, at-home abortion care is not permitted at any gestation.Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) recommending that early medical abortions can occur safely at home in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, legislation acrossEnglandand Wales limits this to 10 weeks.Thestudy, published in BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health, looked at the outcomes of abortions carried out between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy in hospital and at home across NHS Lothian in Scotland, between 2020 and 2025. At-home medical abortions are legal in Scotland up to 12 weeks.During this period, 14,458 referrals were made to the abortion service, and of these 485 women (3.5%) were assessed as being between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy either by the date of their last period or by an ultrasound scan.The researchers found that 97% of abortions were successful for both groups of women.They also found cases of serious complications, such as heavy bleeding or infection, one month after the procedure among those who had opted for a medical abortion at home. But despite this, the researchers concluded it was a rare complication among women who are less than 20 weeks pregnant.“Our study contained a small number of patients, with only one case of haemorrhage that presented one month following abortion with chronic bleeding, and so admission to hospital for [early medical abortion] is unlikely to have altered this,” they said.The researchers concluded that the study showed that at-home medical abortions between 10 and 12 weeks were “highly effective and safe”.The abortion pill is safe. But why should Trump let facts get in the way of his agenda?  | Moira DoneganRead more“In line with WHO guidance, action is needed to extend [early medical abortion] at home up to [12] weeks to women across the rest of the UK and beyond,” they concluded.Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the BritishPregnancyAdvisory Service, said: “This important study from Scotland adds to the already extensive body of evidence that at-home medical abortion between 10 and [12] weeks’ gestation is safe and effective.“Thousands of women each year in the UK are being compelled to attend hospital appointments and undergo surgical procedures when, as this research makes clear, they could be treated at home.”She added: “When the abortion law was first passed in 1967, it was designed to protect and improve women’s health. Nearly 60 years later, this legislation is restricting our ability to innovate and develop services in line with clinical practice.“It is time for parliament to modernise our out-of-date legal framework, and finally allow healthcare professionals to give all women in the UK the best possible care, including the choice of an at-home medical abortion care throughout the first trimester.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAbortionHealthPregnancyWomen's healthWomenEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The ban had been in place for more than a month and had been condemned by Keir Starmer and local MPs.The climbdown came just days after the outlet, owned by Reach,presented the council with a legal lettersetting out further action it was considering taking.View image in fullscreenThe editor of the Nottingham Post, Natalie Fahy, pictured as she hands the leader of Nottinghamshire county council, Reform councillor Mick Barton, a copy of the Nottingham Post ahead of a full council meeting.Photograph: Joseph Raynor/Reach PLCThe company said the council was breaching local government regulations and article 10 of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), which protects freedom of expression and the right to express opinions “freely without government interference”.The ban was imposed by the council’s leader, Mick Barton, after he objected to an article about splits in his group over local government reorganisation plans.A letter from the county council’s team manager for litigation, Geoff Russell, said the restrictions had been the result of some “miscommunication or misunderstanding”.“Nottinghamshire county council confirms that your clients are and remain entitled to attend functions, meetings which are open to the public,” the letter states.Kemi Badenoch expected to announce plan to leave ECHRRead more“In addition, I can confirm that your clients will receive publications to email distributions lists to which they and all other media outlets are ordinarily entitled.”It remains unclear whether Barton is willing to be interviewed by the outlet.Natalie Fahy, Nottinghamshire Live’s editor, said: “I’m pleased this unprecedented ban has been lifted and the situation finally resolved so that we can continue to get on with our jobs as we always have done.“That means asking questions of elected council officials, having access to publicly funded information and events and holding them to account on behalf of our communities in Nottinghamshire.“This sends a firm message that journalists will not back down if our freedoms are attacked.”Fahy had previously said the incident was a troubling sign of things to come should the party form the next government.The ban had already been partly rolled back when it was lifted from a team of BBC-funded local democracy journalists that the paper also manages.

A generic version of mifepristone, which was first approved as a brand-name drug in 2000, is already available on the market.Yet the approval stunned and infuriated foes of abortion, who have spent the three years since the 2022 overturning ofRoe v Wadepressuring the federal government to curb access to mifepristone. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, announced last month his department would review the safety of mifepristone.“FDA had promised to do a top-to-bottom safety review of the chemical abortion drug, but instead they’ve just greenlighted new versions of it for distribution,” Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri and fierce abortion opponent, posted on X. “I have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.”Kristan Hawkins, president of the powerful anti-abortion group Students for Life of America, called the approval “a true failure”.“This is a stain on the Trump presidency,” she added in a statement.To bolster their attack on mifepristone, anti-abortion activists recentlyseized on an April paperby the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a rightwing thinktank, claiming almost 11% of women experience sepsis or other serious complications within 45 days of taking mifepristone. In his letter announcing the review of mifepristone, Kennedy cited the center’s paper.But that paper was not peer-reviewed nor published in a medical journal, andexperts have uncovered multiple flawsin it. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies – wherein an embryo implants somewhere outside of the uterine lining – as a serious complication. Mifepristone does not cause or worsen ectopic pregnancies.Meanwhile, more than 100 studies, conducted across more than three decades and dozens of countries, have concluded thatmifepristone is a safe and effective toolto end a pregnancy.Abortion rights supporters celebrated the news of the FDA’s approval, proclaiming it a victory for evidence-backed medicine.“By expanding generic options, the agency is reinforcing mifepristone’s impeccable safety record,” Kiki Freedman, co-founder and CEO of the telemedicine abortion provider Hey Jane, said in a statement.“At a time when politically motivated attacks threaten to undermine science and restrict care, it’s critical to underscore that the science couldn’t be clearer.”The health department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, a spokesperson for the departmenttold the New York Timesin a statement that “the FDA has very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug”.“By law, the secretary ofHealthand Human Services must approve an application if it demonstrates that the generic drug is identical to the brand-name drug,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationUS politicsRoe v WadeAbortionWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Any institution that resists could be hit with crushing fines or stripped of federal research funding.”“If anyCaliforniaUniversity signs this radical agreement, they’ll lose billions in state funding – including Cal Grants – instantly. California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom,” Newsom said in the statement. Cal Grants is the state’s $2.8bn student financial aid program.Trump’s proposed “compact” was offered to schools that were seen by Trump as “good actors”, May Mailman, a senior White House advisertold the Wall Street Journalon Wednesday, with a president or a board who were, in the Trump administration’s view, “reformer[s]” who have “really indicated they are committed to a higher-quality education”.The “compact”requires universities to eliminate departmentsthat are seen as hostile or dismissive to conservatives, limit the proportion of international students on campus, accept the Trump administration’s definition of gender and restrict the political speech of employees, as well as freeze their tuition fees for five years. It also demands that universities crack down on “grade inflation”, an increase in the proportion of students receiving top marks in their classes, the Wall Street Journal reported.Trump administration must restore $500m in funding to UCLA, judge rulesRead moreThe University of Southern California is a private research university with an$8.2bn endowment. Putting academic freedom aside, some of Trump’s proposals would be economically challenging for the school, the Los Angeles Times reported.More than a quarter of the 2025 freshman class is made up of international students, the newspaper notes, with more than half of international students coming from China or India. The Trump administration’s compact not only limits international student enrollment to 15% of students, but also requires that no more than 5% come from any one country.“We are reviewing the Administration’s letter,” USC said in a statement in response to questions about Trump’s compact. The university did not immediately comment on Newsom’s statement.Most otherUS universitiesfall within the 15% cap, but about 120 exceed it, including USC, Columbia University, Emory University and Boston University, federal data shows.Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaHigher educationTrump administrationWest CoastDonald TrumpUS universitiesUS constitution and civil libertiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The damage could be worth billions of dollars each week, according to analysts.“This isn’t the way to have a discussion, shutting down the government and lowering the GDP,” Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, told the CNBC financial news network. “We could see a hit to the GDP, a hit to growth and a hit to working America.”Prolonged failure to reach a deal would be costly.“We estimate that each week of shutdown would reduce US GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points (ppt) in Q4 (in annualized terms), translating into a $7 billion weekly hit to the economy,” a report by EY Parthenon said, citing the effect of lack of pay for furloughed federal workers, delayed government procurement of goods and services and decline in demand.0:40Trump signals firings, cuts to Democrats' 'favourite projects' if shutdown continues – videoA White House memo by the Council of Economic Advisersobtained by Politicosuggested the economic hit could be even greater, estimating the shutdown could result in a $15bn loss in US gross domestic product every week the shutdown extends, with a monthlong shutdown resulting in an additional 43,000 unemployed workers.The memo estimates a monthlong shutdown would reduce consumer spending in the US by $30bn.“CEA analysis indicates that the shutdown may have wide-ranging economic effects that reduce American prospects through lower growth, higher unemployment, as well as disruptions to social security, air travel, and nutritional support to women with infant children,” the memo states. “These effects will intensify the longer the shutdown lasts.”Travel, national parks and housing: what does the US government shutdown mean for everyday people?Read moreThe EY Parthenon analysis noted that some of the damage would be offset by backpay for furloughed workers and a rebound in activity once the government reopens, but cautioned of lasting effect.“Beyond the immediate macroeconomic consequences, a shutdown would also weigh on financial markets and private sector confidence,” added the analysis. “Perhaps most critically, it would delay the release of key economic data at a pivotal juncture for the economy – complicating the task of Fed policymakers, investors and business leaders who are navigating a highly uncertain, data-dependent environment.”The last government shutdown, a partial shutdown of 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, was estimated tocost at least $11bnto the US economy, including apermanent $3bn loss, according to the congressional budget 0ffice. The report did not incorporate some indirect impacts of the shutdown, such as a halt in federal permits and reduced access to loans.Explore more on these topicsUS economyUS federal government shutdown 2025US federal government shutdownsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the past three days alone, he has posted or reposted calls to cancel Netflix for its content at least 26 times.Musk’s anti-Netflix tirade began on Tuesday, when he posted “this is not ok” while reposting from rightwing activist account Libs of TikTok’s clip of the Netflix show Dead End: Paranormal Park, in which the character Barney says he is transgender.“Dead End Paranormal Park, a show on Netflix, is pushing pro-transgender on CHILDREN. This show is advertised for 7-YEAR-OLDS,” said the Libs of TikTok post, referring to Netflix’s TV-Y7 rating designating the show appropriate for viewers aged seven and older. Paranormal Park ran for 20 episodes in 2022, and was canceled by Netflix the following year. The company is not currently promoting the show.Zach Barack, the voice actor for Barney and the first openly trans actor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, quickly rebuffed Musk’s narrative on X,writing: “you can fear monger all you want, but kids & parents have told me it saved their lives!!”In the days since, Musk has reposted several tweets from other users who claim to have canceled their subscriptions in protest of what he claims is an agenda to brainwash children with content supportive of LGBTQ+ rights.“Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” hepostedon Wednesday while quoting a meme depicting Netflix’s “transgender woke agenda” as a Trojan horse being admitted to a castle labeled “your kids”.“True,” hewroteon Thursday over another user’s tweet claiming: “Transgender propaganda isn’t just quietly lurking in the background on Netflix. They are actively pushing it on users.” He linked to anarticleon Netflix’s Tudum media site titled “Celebrate Trans Day of Visibility with These 16 Movies and Shows”.Musk has also called out pro-trans themes in shows such as The Baby-Sitters Club and Cocomelon, advanced rightwing arguments that Netflix has an “anti-white” hiring process, and reposted false claims, including that 100% of political donations by Netflix employees in 2024 went to Democrats.Additionally, Musk commented “Cancel Netflix” on a Libs of TikTok post about Netflix’s 2023 report on its diversity and inclusion initiatives.Musk is the father of a trans daughter, Vivian Wilson, who haspublicly criticizedher father’s anti-trans vendetta. In her 2022 petition to legally change her name and gender, Wilson wrote: “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.”Musk has sincesaidthat he “lost my son, essentially” and claimed that he had been “tricked” into allowing gender-affirming care for Wilson, whom he claimed was “dead, killed by the woke mind virus”.Netflix, a company whose executives have repeatedly invoked freedom of speech when faced with backlash for content on its platform, has not publicly responded to Musk’s taunts. This is not the first time the company has come under fire from the right; in 2020, outrage over its film Cuties, which depicted underage actors performing sexualized dance routines, led to a spike in US customer cancellations, though it receded within days.In 2021, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos cited free speech when defending comedian Dave Chappelle, whose anti-trans comments in his special The Closer led to an employee walkout at Netflix’s California headquarters. Sarandos has also stood behind the company’s decision to commission three specials from rightwing comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, whose racist comments calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at a Trump rally last year drew widespread consternation.Musk’s calls for mass cancellation of Netflix subscriptions comes on the heels of an unrelated free speech firestorm in Hollywood over Disney’s indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow under pressure from the Trump administration. After backlash from celebrities as well as customers cancelling their Disney+ subscriptions, the company allowed Kimmel back on the air.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskNetflixUS televisionAnimation on TVTelevisionTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Musk owns a 42% stake in SpaceX.Tesla shares fell early this year, hit by a combination of the competitive threat from Chinese rivals, falling sales and doubts over Musk’s focus on the company, amid distractions from his other businesses and his tempestuous relationship with Donald Trump. Musk’s vocal support for Trump and expression of rightwing political views on X, the social media platform he owns, have also damaged Tesla sales,according to analysts.However, Tesla shares have climbed this year as investor sentiment improved on Musk bringing his focus back to his companies. They are now 13% higher since the start of 2025.The Tesla board chair, Robyn Denholm, said last month Musk was back “front and centre” at the company after several months at the White House.Days later, Musk disclosed his purchase of about $1bn worth of the shares in a huge vote of confidence for the future of Tesla as it races to transition from an automaker to an AI and robotics powerhouse.The Tesla board last monthproposed a $1tn compensation plan for Musk, setting out lofty financial and operational targets for the CEO while also addressing his demands for a bigger stake in the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Detroit heads to Seattle for the Division Series with Game 1 on Saturday.The AL West champion Mariners, the second seed, took four of the six regular-season meetings from the Tigers, who were the third wild card.José Ramírez drove in Cleveland’s first run. The AL Central champion Guardians were 15 and a half games back in early July before completing the biggest comeback in division or league play in baseball history.However, they ran out of steam in the best-of-three series as Detroit turned the page after posting the second-worst record in the majors in September (7-17).The game was tied 1-all with two outs in the sixth inning when Dingler got an elevated changeup from Joey Cantillo on a 1-1 count and drove it 401 feet into the bleachers in left-center to put the Tigers on top.It was also the first postseason hit and RBI for the Tigers catcher.Detroit then broke it open in the seventh by sending 10 batters to the plate and scoring four times.With one out and the bases loaded, Pérez lined a base hit to right off Erik Sabrowski to drive in Javier Báez and Parker Meadows. Hunter Gaddis came in and gave up RBI base hits to Spencer Torkelson and Riley Greene, which brought in Kerry Carpenter and Pérez.Kyle Finnegan got the win, retiring all four batters he faced. Cantillo took the loss.The Tigers opened the scoring in the third. With one out and runners on the corners, Carpenter hit a grounder down the first-base line that deflected off CJ Kayfus’ glove when he tried to back hand it. The ball rolled into foul territory near the stands as Parker Meadows scored, Carpenter went to second and Gleyber Torres advanced to third on what the official scorer ruled a doubleThe Guardians tied it in the fourth. George Valera led off with a double to the right-field corner and scored on Ramírez’s base hit to right-center on a knuckle curve by Flaherty on a full count.The single was the 40th hit of Ramírez’s postseason career, making him the fifth player in franchise history to reach that milestone.In the eighth inning, Ramírez reached on missed catch error by Detroit reliever Will Vest to score Brayan Rocchio and Steven Kwan. But Ramírez was thrown out at second.San Diego Padres 1-3 Chicago CubsPete Crow-Armstrong hit an RBI single off a shaky Yu Darvish, and the Chicago Cubs shut down Fernando Tatis Jr and the San Diego Padres for a clinching 3-1 victory in Game 3 of their NL wildcard Series on Thursday.Backed by a raucous crowd of 40,895 at Wrigley Field, Chicago used its stellar defense to advance in the postseason for the first time since 2017.Michael Busch hit a solo homer, and Jameson Taillon pitched four shutout innings before manager Craig Counsell used five relievers to close it out.After Brad Keller faltered in the ninth – allowing Jackson Merrill’s leadoff homer and hitting two batters – Andrew Kittredge earned the save by retiring Jake Cronenworth on a bouncer to third and Freddy Fermin on a flyball to center.Next up for Chicago is a matchup with NL Central champion Milwaukee for a compelling NL Division Series, beginning with Game 1 on Saturday.Counsell managed the Brewers for nine years before he was hired by the Cubs in November 2023, and he has been lustily booed in Milwaukee ever since he departed.It was a disappointing finish for San Diego after it made the postseason for the fourth time in the last six years. The Padres forced a decisive Game 3 with a 3-0 victory on Wednesday, but their biggest stars flopped in the series finale.Explore more on these topicsMLBDetroit TigersCleveland GuardiansBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

While the competition was spirited – especially with the US team’s rally on Sunday afternoon – some fan behavior clearly crossed the line,” Don Rea Jr wrote in an email to PGA of America members. “It was disrespectful, inappropriate, and not representative of who we are as the PGA of America or as PGA of America golf professionals. We condemn that behavior unequivocally.”During last week’s tournament, Europe’s playerswere subjected to vitriolic abuse. An MC at the event resigned after she led chants of “Fuck you, Rory” aimed at Rory McIlroy, the crowd hurled homophobic slurs at golfers and players’ wives were insulted. McIlroy said his wife, Erica,was hit by a beerthat was thrown during Saturday afternoon’s play.Europe won the Ryder Cup on Sundayafter completing a 15-13 victory.US fan ugliness at the Ryder Cup was merely a reflection of Trump’s all-caps America | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreHowever, in a BBC interview on Sunday morning, Rea seemed to minimise the abuse. “You’ve got 50,000 people here that are really excited, and heck, you could go to a youth soccer game and get some people who say the wrong things,” he said. He went on to say the behavior was distracting American players because they had to spend energy helping to control the crowd.The abuse was such that McIlroy began pushing back, telling one spectator to “shut the fuck up” during a foursomes match on Saturday morning.Rea also said during his BBC interview when asked about the abuse hurled toward McIlroy, “I haven’t heard some of that. I’m sure it happened. It happens when we’re over in Rome on the other side, and Rory understands. Things like that are going to happen.”Europe’s Matt Fitzpatrick said about the Rome reference, “It’s pretty offensive to European fans the fact that he said that, really.” Lowry said the level of abuse directed at McIlroy’s wife was “astonishing.”Derek Sprague, the CEO at the PGA of America, said on Tuesday that spectators crossed the line and that he planned to apologize personally to Rory McIlroy and Erica McIlroy, who formerly worked at the PGA.“Rory might have been a target because of how good he is, but the entire European team should not have been subjected to that,” Sprague said on theGolfChannel. “I feel badly and I plan on apologizing to them.”Rea also took heat for an awkward trophy presentation on Sunday in which he mentioned Europe had retained the cup, instead of winning it.On Tuesday, on his LinkedIn page, Rea wrote: “I’m personally taking some criticism right now and that comes with the role and just like when I was an umpire I expect it. However to the students and PGA members that follow me, know this, I am not bothered.”In Thursday’s letter, Rea was more contrite. “What makes our sport great is that we own our bogeys. We certainly own this one,” Rea wrote. “Our CEO Derek Sprague has apologized on our behalf to Erica and Rory McIlroy and to everyone with Ryder Cup Europe. I would also like to personally apologize to them and all of you for not representing our association in the best light with some of my comments in the media during the event.“While it wasn’t my intention, some of my comments were seen in a negative light which reflects poorly on not only myself but also on the PGA of America and for that I truly apologize.”He ended the email, “God Bless and as always Go USA!”The PGA of America announced in 2013 it would bring the Ryder Cup to Bethpage Black, the public golf course on Long Island that had a reputation for its raw comments directed at players. Ted Bishop was the PGA president and Pete Bevacqua was the CEO at the time of the announcement.Bishop was forced out as president in 2014 with a month left on his two-year term for a social media post when he angrily referred to Ian Poulter as a “lil girl.”Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fulham visit the Vitality on Friday, offering Andoni Iraola’s side a presentable chance of recapturing winning ways and going second in the table. After a turbulent summer, Iraola has sought consistency in his team selection. Trailing 2-1 at Leeds, theBournemouthmanager made a triple change to restore three usual starters – David Brooks, Alex Scott and Marcus Tavernier – to his XI and was rewarded with a late leveller. Bournemouth have also maintained defensive stability, conceding just once in four games between the trips to Liverpool and Leeds. Marcos Senesi, often playing in an otherwise brand-new back five, has been key to the team’s continuity. The centre-back earned praise from Iraola for his defensive work and threat at attacking set-pieces – as evidenced by his headed assist for Eli Junior Kroupi’s equaliser at Elland Road.Niall McVeighBournemouth vFulham, Friday 8pm (all times BST)Longstaff key to Leeds’ set-piece threatIf Leeds are to survive and maybe even thrive this season they will need to continue taking mean dead balls. Three of the six league goals Daniel Farke’s side have scored since returning to the top tier have derived from set pieces and they could do with further examples – or at least an example – arriving at Tottenham’s expense at Elland Road on Saturday. Farke has deployed Sean Longstaff as his principal corner taker and, so far, the former Newcastle midfielder is proving highly adept and crucially consistent at the art. This reassignment of on-field duties has also liberated his fellow midfielder Anton Stach to get into the penalty area at set plays and hurl his towering frame at the ball. Back on Tyneside, Longstaff also possessed a knack for making late, almost Frank Lampardesque dashes into the box and scored a few goals from open play. Now Farke could do with rekindling that instinct in a player who lost his way a little at St James’ Park last season but is looking encouragingly renascent.Louise TaylorLeeds v Tottenham, Saturday12.30pmBlack Cats could spell trouble for AmorimWith a trip to Anfield looming after the international break, a home game against promoted opponents is, in theory, an opportunity for Ruben Amorim to lift the suffocating gloom aroundManchester United. In reality, it could be another very difficult afternoon at Old Trafford against an impressive Sunderland side with two core attributes their hosts are sorely lacking: identity and adaptability. Asked how he has been able to build such a cohesive unit from a long list of summer signings, Régis Le Bris, the Sunderland manager, said: “The new lads bring a new energy and style of play … [but] we don’t start from scratch – the identity of the club is already there.” While Amorim remains mired in his own stubborn inflexibility, Le Bris has shown he is willing to adapt. Heading into last season’s Championship playoffs on the back of five straight defeats, he switched to a more reactive style and built the foundation for success in the Premier League. All of this has been achieved while Amorim has essentially taken his United team nowhere, and few would be truly shocked if Sunderland were to push him closer to the exit door this weekend.NMcManchester United vSunderland, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenRuben Amorim is under intense pressure before another tricky fixture for his struggling team.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockArsenal can move on from Hammers defeatsAfter ending their hoodoosaway at Newcastleand at home to Olympiakos in the last two games, next up for Arsenal is a chance to banish memories of two successive defeats to West Ham at the Emirates. Both ended up damaging their hopes of winning the Premier League, withthe 1-0 reverse in Februaryone of the few occasions when Graham Potter had something to celebrate during his ill-fated spell in charge of the Hammers. A promising draw in his first match against Everton will have helped Nuno Espírito Santo settle into his new surroundings and the former Nottingham Forest manager will be keen to build on that on Saturday, having not tasted success against Arsenal since he was in charge of Wolves in 2021.Ed AaronsArsenal v West Ham, Saturday 3pmMaresca may look to Lavia against LiverpoolRoméo Lavia was excellent whenChelsea beat Liverpoolat Stamford Bridge in May. The Belgium midfielder offers elegance on the ball and a fine ability to beat the press. But while he often makes Enzo Maresca’s system look smoother, Lavia’s fitness record remains a problem. The former Southampton midfielder was injured when Chelsea beat Benfica in the last 16 of the Club World Cup in June and has only just returned. Ideally Maresca would be able to ease Lavia back in and give him time to build his fitness. Chelsea, though, are struggling with injuries. Andrey Santos and Dário Essugo will be missing when Maresca’s side host Liverpool on Saturday, heaping the pressure on Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in midfield. Options to rotate are slim. Caicedo and Fernández could do with a rest but are both playing through niggles. It is probably too soon for Lavia to start – he has only made one brief substitute appearance this season – but he will be a useful option on the bench.Jacob SteinbergChelsea vLiverpool, Saturday 5.30pmLack of in-form forwards a problem for MoyesDavid Moyes was particularly touchy on the subject of his struggling strikers when the trials of Beto and Thierno Barry cropped up before West Ham’s visit. “I’m not daft enough to think everything is going to be hunky dory,” he said. “We are still rebuilding.” That is true, but his mood will not have improved after another anonymous showing from the pair in Monday’sdisappointing draw. There are echoes of Moyes’s first spell in charge of Everton at present with a good unit lacking the high-calibre striker necessary to make a difference. Creativity is not a problem for a team with Jack Grealish, Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall but, aside from a crucial purple patch of five goals in four league games in February, Beto has not convinced. His recent body language has not impressed either. Everton felt Barry was one for the future when paying £27m for the 22-year-old this summer but would have expected more from a forward who is yet to open his account. In-form Crystal Palace, aiming to set a new club record of 19 matches unbeaten in all competitions, can prey on Everton’s glaring weakness.Andy HunterEverton vCrystal Palace, Sunday 2pmskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are these teams really capable of juggling their domestic and European commitments? Tactically speaking, is Ange Postecoglou going about silencing his critics in the right way? Will Forest’s Chris Wood score against his old club? Or might Eddie Howe’s star signing, Nick Woltemade, win the battle of the centre-forwards? Could this be the match where Newcastle’s £55m summer signing from Forest, Anthony Elanga, really comes alive down the right wing? There are so many unanswered questions and the responses will determine whether Howe or Postecoglou will need to brace themselves for “crisis” headlines. Both managers, like their teams, desperately need a restorative win.LTNewcastle vNottingham Forest, Sunday 2pmPereira needs Wolves’ recruits to show worth“You sold the team, now sell the club.” Wolves fans could not have been clearer about their feelings during therecent defeat by promoted Leedsat Molineux. There are a couple of things for Vítor Pereira to cling to, though, despite the obvious weakening of his squad byhigh-profile summer departures:a point against Tottenhamthat could so easily have been three and the Carabao Cup win over Everton that was a step towards placating growing anger in the stands. Despite João Palhinha’s stoppage-time equaliser in north London, Pereira pointed to the “spirit” of his players and his old-school methods, includingbonding trips to the boozer, appear to be keeping the dressing-room mood upbeat. Pereira’s preferred tipple is Stella Artois but, with a relegation scrap looming, it remains to be seen whether any of his summer reinforcements prove to be reassuringly expensive.Luke McLaughlinWolves v Brighton, Sunday 2pmEmery has Villa pointing in right directionIf succeeding Arsène Wenger was an impossible job for Unai Emery at Arsenal, stepping into Steven Gerrard’s shoes at Villa Park was considerably easier. “I’m not here to waste my time” – Emery’sinternal mission statementon arrival in 2022 – was one of the more memorable lines from a Premier League manager in recent times. Villa’s improvement since is attributable to appointing a smart tactician and capable motivator whose managerial career path has been an unusual mix. A flat start this season has been the first significant bump in the road during his Villa tenure and the mood has been downbeat; still, Emery’s side were undefeated in 90 minutes across five matches in September, finishing with wins against Bologna and Fulham. Form is a funny thing – just ask Morgan Rogers. But after another encouraging win against Feyenoord, Emery’s solid methods and self-belief are likely to steer Villa through a challenging time.LMcAston Villa v Burnley, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenAston Villa have shown tentative signs of progress after a difficult start to the campaign.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersFoden can ease burden on HaalandAfter six league games Manchester City’s second-highest scorer is Maxime Estevé, the unfortunate Burnley centre-back who notched two own goals at the Etihad last Saturday. It’s not a huge problem with Erling Haaland in such ruthless form having scored 11 goals in all competitions and eight in the league, double any other player’s tally and more than 11 of the 19 other top-flight teams. There was, though, a hint of frustration in Haaland’s post-match interview after defensive lapses cancelled out his two goals in Monaco. “Not good enough,” was his concise verdict on City’s overall display, and Brentford’s set-piece muscle will surely test the visitors’ soft centre again on Sunday. If City cannot keep clean sheets, Haaland will need more help from his attacking teammates. Phil Foden certainly has form at the Gtech, having scored every one of City’s six goals at the venue since 2021. If Foden can add firepower to his improved form, Pep Guardiola’s side might begin to look truly formidable again.NMcBrentford v Manchester City, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool65152Arsenal69133Crystal Palace65124Tottenham Hotspur67115Sunderland63116AFC Bournemouth61117Man City68108Chelsea6389Everton61810Brighton60811Fulham6-1812Leeds6-3813Brentford6-2714Man Utd6-4715Newcastle6-1616Aston Villa6-2617Nottm Forest6-5518Burnley6-7419West Ham6-8420Wolverhampton6-91Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolArsenalCrystal PalaceTottenham HotspurSunderlandBournemouthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But instead Bucs kicker Chase McLaughlin trotted on to the field and calmly belted a 65-yard field goal through the super-heated Florida sky, tied for the second-longest inNFLhistory.McLaughlin later booted a 58-yard field goal to put the Bucs eight points behind with 12 minutes in the game. Philadelphia would escape with a 31-25 win, but Fangio fingered one culprit: the designated kicking balls, or ‘K’ balls, that each team is allowed to prepare for use in games.Chase McLaughlin drills a 65-YARD FG at the end of the half 💥PHIvsTB on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXnxVpic.twitter.com/jP3GPQKJOO— NFL (@NFL)September 28, 2025“In years past,” Fangio said at a news conference Tuesday, “the officials would rub them down or other people would rub them down, and you’d play with them. Now the balls are in-house all week and they kick those balls that they’ve had, and nobody else touches them.”Referring to the Cowboys’ brilliant kicker, Brandon Aubrey, Fangio said: “The guy in Dallas is going to hit a 70-plus yarder this year. You can just book it … I mean, who thought they would hit a 65-yarder the other day? So it has drastically changed the game, the kicking game and the field goal. Guys have longer range than they used to.”The NFL appears to have (successfully) put more of the foot back into American football. With several rules changes in recent years, NFL special-teams play has become a substantially bigger factor in determining the outcome of games. This is seen as a good thing.“The NFL wants more points? There it is,” Michael Clay, the Eagles’ special teams coach, said Tuesday.49ers’ Robert Saleh regrets lead-up to ‘end your life’ confrontation with Jags coach Liam CoenRead moreThose newfangled kickoff formations might still look contrived (the president of the United States himselfis on recordas saying they are “bad for the game of football”), but, with the rules tweaked even more so again this year, they have dramatically resulted in more action. Teams average 23.4 points per game, second-highest in history.Through four weeks, per Pro Football Reference, NFL teams are averaging 103.2 yards in kickoff returns per game, the highest ever – and more thanfour timesthe average of 24.9 yards per team in 2023, after which the NFLaltered its whole kickoff procedure. Only 16.5% of kickoffs in 2025 have resulted in touchbacks, compared with 73% in 2023.Most notably, the league encourages kickoffs dropping in a “landing zone” that stretches 20 yards out from the goal line. As a result, kickoffs are deftly placed, looking much more like coffin-corner punts. There was a time when kickers simply blasted kickoffs out of the end zone for touchbacks – but doing that now results in the ball being placed at the 35-yard line.A week earlier, in a 33-26 victory over the Los Angeles Rams, the Eagles had some serious problems fielding the wobbly, knuckling, bouncing kickoffs launched by Joshua Carty, the Rams second-year kicker, with five Philadelphia drives starting at or inside the 20-yard line.But kickers can’t merely kick ground balls to their opponents and hope for bobbles. Kickoffs must first hit the surface, or be caught, inside that landing zone. After theArizona Cardinalshad tied last Thursday’s game against the Seattle Seahawks with 28 seconds to play, Chad Ryland drilled a kickoff that landed one yard short of the landing zone.The penalty was severe: The Seahawks got the ball at the 40, less than 20 yards outside the range of kicker Jason Myers. After a 22-yard pass completion and a 4-yard run, Myers – who’d earlier missed a 53-yard try – drilled a 52-yard attempt to give Seattle a 23-20 victory.When asked at his post-game news conference what Ryland was trying to accomplish there, Arizona coach Jonathan Gannon said, “Keep it in play. That’s one of the things we talk about late in the game there with the amount of timeouts, time, what they need at the line. We were trying to burn off some time there.”The livelier kickoffs seem to have rubbed off on the rest of the kicking game. There have been 16 blocked punts, field goals and extra points already this year. Dallas blocked an extra-point attempt Sunday in a 40-40 tie with Green Bay, with Cowboys defensive back Markquese Bell returning the ball 80 yards for a safety, or two points for Dallas. That was only the 10th time that has happened since it was first allowed in 2015.Josh Blackwell blocked Daniel Carlson’s 54-yard field-goal attempt with 33 seconds left to enable theChicago Bearsto hang on for a 25-24 victory over Las Vegas. A week after blocking two field goals against the Rams – the second of which could have won the game for Los Angeles but resulted in a game-ending Eagles touchdown – Philadelphia blocked a punt against Tampa Bay and returned that for an early TD.Meanwhile, Eagles veteran kicker Jake Elliott kept pinning Tampa Bay deep with deft kickoffs inside the landing zone. Tampa Bay started six drives after his kickoffs at the average of the 22-yard line. His first kickoff fell in the landing zone and rolled into the end zone for a touchback. Under those conditions, the Bucs had to start from their 20-yard line.“Jake does an unbelievable job in trying to perfect anything he does,” Clay said. “Whether it’s a field goal, whether it’s kickoff, a lot of work goes into it in terms of behind the scenes. We went out there, I know it was raining last Wednesday, but we were still able to go outside and just get a feel for it. Then a lot of it just comes down to confidence. Jake was able to say at the end of the week, ‘I’m pretty confident in this kick.’ That’s all I needed to hear to implement it, but also it’s a good changeup. You saw a couple low liners, then you saw some up in the air.“The kickoff team has done a really good job thus far in the first four weeks of covering. Any way we could get the starting point for the defense inside the 25 on kickoff is pretty good for us, so we’re going to just try and keep evolving it, try to keep getting better at it. Just because of the kick, we have to keep working on our technique and fundamentals from a kickoff-cover standpoint.”To curtail those bone-crushing, full-speed collisions, coverage teams for the so-called “Dynamic Kickoff” line up at the receiving team’s 40-yard line, 25 yards in front of the kicker. So far, only one kickoff has been returned for a touchdown, by New England’s Antonio Gibson.Because of the new kickoff formation, a losing team must declare its intention to try an onside kick, which kind of takes away the surprise factor (although the receiving team has a pretty good idea what is coming). Only two onside kicks have been recovered so far in 2025.On the whole, though, the kicking game has been revitalized. Even extra points, a 33-yard attempt since 2015, are not gimmes, with a success rate of 95.9%, compared with 99.3% in 2014. But, hey, the NFL can always tinker with those rules in the offseason.Explore more on these topicsNFLPhiladelphia EaglesTampa Bay BuccaneersDallas CowboysArizona CardinalsSeattle SeahawksChicago BearsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His mother, Jeanine Girard-Moorman, confirmed the news in posts on social media.“It is with a heavy heart I have to tell you my incredible son Balin Miller died during a climbing accident today,” shewrote. “My heart is shattered in a million pieces.”Pioneering ski-mountaineer Christina Lustenberger on life in a ‘wildly dangerous space’Read moreDetails of the accident remain unofficial, but Yosemite photographer Tom Evans, who chronicled Miller’s progress, said the 23-year-old was attempting to free a haul bag stuck below his anchor. According to Evans, Miller descended his rope without realising it would not reach the bag’s location. He rappelled off the end of the line and fell.The National Park Service has not issued a formal report, though rangers responded swiftly despitethe federal government shutdownthat began the same day. Yosemite averages one to two climbing fatalities each year, often on El Capitan.Rappelling accidents are among the most common causes of death in the sport. The American Alpine Club recorded eight such fatalities in 2023, and in 2019 professional climberBrad Gobright died in Mexicoafter rappelling off the end of his rope.Though only in his early 20s, Miller had already established a reputation as one of America’s most promising alpinists. Known affectionately in Yosemite this season as the “Orange Tent Guy”, he drew recognition for his distinctive campsite at the base of El Capitan and for livestreams documenting his climbs.His achievements included ascents of some of the world’s most formidable peaks, among them Cerro Torre in Patagonia, the West Buttress of Denali and Mount Hunter in Alaska.This spring he spent 53 consecutive days in the Alaska Range, soloing Mount Hunter’s French Connection before returning weeks later to make history on Denali. In June he became the first person to solo the Slovak Direct on the mountain’s South Face: a 2,700m technical route with fewer than 20 recorded ascents. Miller completed the climb in 56 hours, a push faster than the landmark effort by Mark Twight, Steve House and Scott Backes in 2000. Climbing Magazine called it one of the most impressive ascents in decades, while Alaska peers hailed him as “the new king of the Alaska Range”.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

By 12 he had thrown himself into ice climbing, later expanding into Alaska’s ranges, Canada and Patagonia. Friends described him as both intensely ambitious and warm-hearted, quick to share advice with other climbers and equally quick to laugh at himself.His dedication was matched by pragmatism. To fund expeditions, Miller worked seasonally as a crab fisherman in Nome and at a southeast Alaska mine. “He’s had probably one of the most impressive last six months of climbing of anyone I can think of,” veteran alpinist Clint Helandertold the Anchorage Daily Newsin July. Another Alaskan climbing legend, Mark Westman, compared him toAlex Honnoldof Free Solo renown.As news of Miller’s death spread, tributes poured across social media from fans and fellow climbers who had followed his career.

That’s the only place he can escape the reality of his team’s continued slide. United’s latest defeat means the Portuguese manager has now lost nearly twice as many matches (17) as he has won (nine).Under Amorim, United have taken just 31 points from 31Premier Leaguematches, giving him the worst record of the club’s five permanent post-Sir Alex Ferguson managers after the same number of games. The most successful club of the Premier League era are closer to relegation than another title.Firing Amorim, though, would be politically significant. CEO Omar Berrada reportedly pushed hard for his appointment nearly a year ago, as did sporting director Jason Wilcox. Amorim’s hiring was the first major move of the Sir Jim Ratcliffe age and so his firing would raise questions over Ineos’s involvement in all this.Plus, some adjustment time was always meant to be part of Amorim’s process. Last season’s 15th place finish was far from ideal, but a rebuild was always going to be painful and so United willingly endured their worst league campaign for over five decades in the belief it would ultimately lead to the “good days,” Amorim promised.Those good days, however, still seem a long way off. Saturday at the Gtech Community Stadium certainly wasn’t one. Amorim’s refusal to budge from his trademark 3-4-3 system is becoming the defining issue of his tenure, but the truth is there are countless other problems dragging Manchester United down.At some point, United may have to read up on the sunk-cost fallacy.Why did Arsenal’s win at Newcastle matter so much?The celebration police surely raised an eyebrow at how Arsenal reacted to the final whistle on Sunday. Match winner Gabriel Magalhães dropped to his knees. Mikel Arteta tightly embraced his coaching staff. The away support high in the nosebleeds at St James’ Park went nuts.All this for a winthat only liftedthe Gunners to second, still two points behind Liverpool.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s win over Newcastle kicked off intense celebrations.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockVictory in the north-east was about more than three points forArsenal, though. It was a result, and comeback from 1-0 down, that quelled some of the criticism faced by Arteta and his players. If the recent performances against Liverpool and Manchester City were too timid for a team chasing the title, Sunday’s display was anything but.Arsenal beat Newcastle at their own game. They physically matched them. The intensity was there from the start and even more so when Nick Woltemade opened the scoring against the run of play. Other teams would have crumbled, but the visitors were determined to make a point.For Arsenal, being second is nothing to celebrate. That’s where they’ve finished in each of the last three Premier League seasons. Sunday’s full-time scenes were so visceral because the comeback could be a catalyst for a sustained, and ultimately successful, title challenge, Arsenal’s first for over two decades. Not even the celebration police could begrudge that party.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That came just three minutes in when Pulisic skipped past a tackle, surged into the box and picked out a teammate at the back post for a simple finish in a way no other player on the pitch could have replicated.It’s difficult to envision another male American player being able to produce such brilliance at such a high standard on such a regular basis. So the answer to the titular question is simple: No. Pulisic is operating at a level that none of his compatriots have ever matched. Not Landon Donovan. Not Clint Dempsey. No one.View image in fullscreenChristian Pulisic has been Milan’s best player so far this season.Photograph: EPhotopress/ShutterstockOf course, Pulisic has been a high-level performer for Milan for the last two seasons. Even as the Rossoneri fell apart last season, going through three managers in just a few months, the American found a way to consistently impact matches, registering 25 goal contributions in all competitions. He certainly wasn’t to blame for Milan finishing eighth.Now, though, Pulisic has the framework around him to hit even higher heights. Max Allegri is using the 27-year-old as a secondary forward in a role that affords him the freedom to drift. And dribble. And create. And shoot, all of which Pulisic did in a 2-1 win for Milan that marked them out as genuine Scudetto contenders. The best player for the best team in Serie A is an American.Explore more on these topicsFootballUS sportsChristian PulisicPremier LeagueManchester UnitedArsenalRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The inquest in the stands began at half-time, at which point Forest trailed to set-piece goals from Ousmane Diao and Mads Bech Sørensen, formerly of Brentford, and afterwards Postecoglou faced some tough questions.Asked if he still believed positive results are on the horizon, the 60-year-old replied: “Yes, I do, and nothing I saw tonight changes any of that. I get the mood around the place isn’t going to be great, I understand people’s attitude, particularly towards me, but I never worry about that, it’s not unfamiliar territory for me. I really believe that we’re on the right track and when we get through this period of uncertainty that we’ll be on a good path. If we start winning games, the atmosphere will improve.”A week on from the optimism that accompanied Forest’s trip to Seville, where they were held to a draw against Real Betis after squandering the lead late on, the mood has shifted significantly. “I guess it’s the accumulation of things,” Postecoglou said. “It’s not like our goalkeeper is having to make multiple saves, but every time they get near our goal they [the players] get really nervous. If you allow the opposition to score just about every time they get near your goal, it’s going to be very hard to win games.”View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou during Forest’s 3-2 defeat by Midtjylland. Fans chanted “You’re getting sacked in the morning” near the end.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoPostecoglou is the first Forest manager for 100 years to fail to win any of his first six matches, though perhaps he will take encouragement that John Baynes, who did not win any of his first seven in 1925, ended up sticking around for four years. These are different days, though, as Postecoglou acknowledged. “Nothing surprises me in football, it’s the climate we’re in,” he said, when asked about the chants aimed at him. “It seems that’s the way things are going. It’s nothing I can control. The fans are disappointed, they are allowed to have an opinion on it. I heard their opinion.”Postecoglou insisted his players did their homework and knew to expect an awkward assignment but the visitors’ direct “vertical football” proved Forest’s undoing,Midtjyllandtwice scoring from set pieces before Valdemar Byskov Andreasen capped the scoring after Dario Osorio pinched possession from Callum Hudson-Odoi deep in the Danish side’s half. Chris Wood’s stoppage-time penalty after Elliot Anderson, Forest’s best player, was fouled proved merely a consolation.Postecoglou’s Tottenham were vulnerable from set pieces last season – only Arsenal, Southampton and Wolves conceded more from set plays in the Premier League – and it was a recurring problem here. Things got worse when Murillo, back in the starting lineup after injury, limped off before the half-hour mark. There was further alarm for Forest in the first half when Diao comfortably peeled off his man at another corner and directed a header wide of goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tifo in the Trent End was typically brilliant, an image of a Forest campervan with Postecoglou at the wheel and the words: “For a new generation our time has come”. Everything was primed for Postecoglou to register that elusive first win. Perhaps Forest were guilty of viewing this game as a gimme.

But many of those discussing the league denigrate its players while not bothering to watch the action itselfThu 2 Oct 2025 07.18 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 07.19 EDTShare“Under the Trump administration, we will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure, and cheat our women and our girls.”– Donald Trump during the signing of hisKeeping Men Out of Women’s Sportsexecutive order, 5 February 2025“Our girls”. The line lands like parody. Grotesque and striking. A president whosepolicies have regularly harmed women, positioning himself as guardian of “our girls”.That’s the absurd theater of American politics in 2025: women’s sports as shield and sword in a fight that has little to do with athletics. What’s become clear is that the Maga movement doesn’t love women’s sports; it loves them as a proxy. It’s a stage where old fears about gender and power can be reenacted, shorthand in a culture war that has nothing to do with the quality of the hoops being played.And the WNBA – whose finals start on Friday as theLas Vegas Acesface the Phoenix Mercury – keeps getting dragged into the trenches. Players are sick of it. A’ja Wilson said it bluntly: “People love to use us as an example, as a punchline, but they don’t actually watch us play.” Debates over trans athletes, Caitlin Clark getting fouled or “protecting” women’s sports rarely include the voices of the women actually playing.When those voices are ignored, the vacuum fills with nonsense. And rather than protecting women’s sports – or even helping by increasing funding in high schools or social teams – much of the right seems to want to rip it down. Take, for example, rightwing voices such as Clay Travis and Tomi Lahren,who have both backedthe Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports bill. They believe women should be protected in sports,yet laughedwhen sex toyswere thrown on to courtsduring WNBA games this season. (The players did not find it amusing, nor presumably did the 12-year-old girlwho was hit by one of the toys.)No one comes to watch the referees. But in the WNBA, they’re the story | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreTravis is particularly egregious. Despite his concern for female athletes, in 2023he said he’d bet $1mthat a good boys’ high school state champion would “absolutely smoke” the WNBA champs. There was no payout, only noise from a dying radio. That clip was circulated across conservative media and became a talking point, hardening into ideology. This type of discourse doesn’t protect or elevate female athletes, it diminishes them.My regret is that I fell for the poison myself as a kid. My dad – not a cruel man, or some armchair critic (he played ball in New York playgrounds and more than held his own) – held the same views as Travis when it came to the abilities of WNBA players. He’d absorbed it, the way so many men did, and passed it down to me without thinking. This happens everywhere:on message boardsas farback as 2009, when 25,000 anonymous avatars on TexAgs bickered into the void on the subject. My sadness is that my pops diminished the women’s game and didn’t even realize he was repeating someone else’s sneer. The sadness is increased by knowing that the strongest person I knew – physically and mentally – was my mom.Why not just celebrate what it takes to play at the pro level? Judging the women’s game as “less than” simply because it doesn’t look like the NBA or men’s college ball misses the point entirely. The measure should be the quality of execution, the intelligence of the playmaking, the creative ways women bend the game around their skills. When you separate it from those comparisons, you see theWNBAfor what it is: elite hoops, defined by its own standards.Besides, the older I got, the more ball I watched, the absurdity became clear: 90% of high school players are awkward, maladroit, and done with organized basketball after graduation. The WNBA, meanwhile, demands refinement: passing, shooting, dribbling at an elite level. Obviously, men are naturally bigger and stronger on average. But the gap between grown women who play professionally and a teenage team with maybe two decent players isn’t what detractors pretend it is. The difference? A lifetime of work and players that don’t rely solely on strength and height (although there is plenty of that in the WNBA too).While conservatives are stuck rehashing the same tired hypotheticals, the women’s game has been evolving right in front of them. A decade ago, WNBA teams averaged around 15 three-pointers a game;today, many launch closerto 25–30, with efficiency climbing alongside. The three-point revolution has transformed how the league is played, bridging gaps between male and female playing styles and showcasing the league’s malleability.That’s what always struck me about the “protect women’s sports” crowd: they don’t actually watch the games.Gallupfound 90% of Republicans (and 40% of Democrats) say trans athletes should only play on teams that match their birth sex. YetS&P Globalreports a stranger truth: only 18% of adults follow women’s sports, period. Men make up themajority of WNBA viewership, but the ones watching aren’t the ones using it for political dunking. If they were, they wouldn’t denigrate these women like they are.The hypocrisy is astounding, especially by those who constantly call to keep sports separate by gender. As Ebony Dumas, a former Division I college baller, and one of the most incisive voices on WNBA X, told me: “The W has always been rooted in fundamentals and old-school basketball principles – that’s what separates it from the NBA. They don’t rely solely on athleticism. The midrange is still a key part of the game, and the intensity on both ends is non-negotiable.”And people are watching. WNBA viewershiphit a record high this season. The 2024 NCAA women’s finaloutdrew the men’s. Merchandise flew, and screens lit up, proof that the interest isn’t just on TV but in how fans show up for the game. And still,the critics said no one watched. And still,the critics said no one cared.The disconnect between the league’s tangible growth and how it’s still talked about runs deep. Instead of celebrating increased competition, the yapping too often reduces women’s basketball to lazy hypotheticals. Ordismal commentsabout race and sexuality. The charade obscures reality: the WNBA isexpanding to the Bay AreaandTorontoand strikingricher media deals.That’s the backdrop for Trump’s line about “protecting our girls.” It isn’t protection – it’s projection. He isn’t defending the WNBA athletes selling out arenas. He’s defending a chimera, a stage where women’s sports are props in a never-ending grievance play.Meanwhile, the league burns on. The ball is moving, the threes are falling, the athletes are evolving in ways no hypothetical could capture. And the more politicians and pundits posture about “our girls,” the more obvious the gap becomes between their culture-war theater and the women actually out there hooping.There is no “our girls” and “your girls”. There’s just game.Explore more on these topicsWNBALas Vegas AcesBasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Others wereforcedfrom public view while their possessions were trashed.Now, as the city prepares to host the games once more in 2028, civil rights advocates are fearful history will repeat itself, and authorities will again banish unhoused communities in ways that could exacerbate the region’shumanitarian crisis.Karen Bass, Los Angeles’s Democratic mayor, has vowed not to bus unhoused people out of the city and repeat the tactics of 1984,telling the Los Angeles Timesher strategy will “always be housing people first”. But the scale of the problem in LA is larger than it was four decades ago, and the Trump administration’s forceful stance on homelessness could increase pressures on Bass and the unhoused population.LA county ishome to an estimated 72,000 unhoused people, including 24,900 people in shelters and 47,400 peopleliving outsidein tents, makeshift structures and vehicles. In the last two years, Bass and county leaders have reported some progress inmoving people indoors, which they attributed to their strategy of targeting people in encampments with shelter options and resources.But the dramaticshortageof affordablehousingin the region will make it difficult to get tens of thousands of people stably housed in less than three years and stop new encampments from rising up.Meanwhile, Trump, whoappointed himselfWhite House Olympics taskforce chair, has made it clear he wants to see encampments disappear from American cities,signing an executive orderin July to push local governments to clear encampments and making it a point of focusduring the federal crackdown in Washington DC.Combined with asupreme court rulingallowing governments to fine and jail unhoused people when no shelter is available, Trump’s ongoingdeployment of troopsto Democratic cities, significantsupportfrom California residents for tougher policies towards the unhoused, and California governor Gavin Newsom’spushforaggressive sweeps, experts fear the Olympics could force out many of LA’s poorest residents.“The pressures are going to come from the White House, from the state and from local government as we get closer to the Olympics,” said Pete White, executive director of theLos AngelesCommunity Action Network, an anti-poverty group that advocates for unhoused people and is based in Skid Row, a downtown area with a high concentration of homelessness. “My fears come from being an Angeleno and seeing our communities attacked and displaced when major events come our way.”‘I remember the arrests’There is a longhistoryof Olympics host cities trying to get rid of their most disenfranchised communities.In Moscow in 1980, organizerspledgedto “cleanse” the city of “chronic alcoholics” and dumped people outside city limits. In Atlanta in 1996, officials arrestedthousands of unhoused peopleunder anti-loitering and related ordinances. In Rio de Janeiro in 2016, more than 70,000 people weredisplaced. And last year in Paris,thousands of unhoused people, including asylum seekers, were bussed out.The 1984 LA games led to theincreased militarizationof the LA police department (LAPD) and an escalation of racist and aggressive policing that targeted Black and Latino youth, experts say.“I remember the pre-Olympics arrest of my older cousins,” said White, 56, who grew up within walking distance of the Coliseum, a stadium that served as an Olympics venue then and will beusedfor the 2028 opening and closing ceremonies. “Young Black and brown men were afraid to be in the streets, because they were sweeping people up under the pretext of addressing gang violence.”View image in fullscreenOutside the Olympic Village on the University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles on 17 July 1984.Photograph: Wally Fong/APThe games helped LAPD acquire flashbang grenades, specialized armor, military-style equipment and an armored vehicle, which it used a year later toram a homewhere small children were eating ice cream,Curbed LA reported. The Olympics-fueled law enforcement expansion also paved the way for LAPD’s notoriousOperation Hammer, a crackdown that led tomass arrests of Black youth.In 2018, after LA won the 2028 bid, then-mayor Eric Garcetti said the games would present anopportunity to improve homelessness, which he said could beeliminated from the streetsby the games.“Garcetti kept saying: ‘We’ll end homelessness in LA,’” said Eric Sheehan, a member of NOlympics, a group founded in 2017 to oppose the Olympics in LA. “And we have been warning that the only way they can actually end homelessness is by disappearing people.”Increasing sweepsCalifornia, LA and LA 2028 officials have not released plans for a homelessness strategy.But on the streets, there are already fears that sweeps of people living outside are escalating due to the Olympics – and as LA prepares to also host the World Cup next year.In July, the cityshut down a long-running encampmentin the Van Nuys neighborhood in the San Fernando valley, north-west of downtown andvisible from the 405, a major freeway. The site, which residents called the Compound, was across from the Sepulveda Basin where theOlympics is planning events. The sweep displaced roughly 75 people. The city said itoffered 30 motel roomsto the group and other shelter options.Carla Orendorff, an organizer working with the residents, said she was aware of at least 10 displaced people now back on the streets, including several who had been kicked out of the motels, which have strict rules. Residents were dispersed to eight motels, and in one, staff ran out of food and people were left hungry, she said.Those still out on the street “are just forced further underground, in places that are harder to reach, which makes it incredibly dangerous for them”, Orendorff said.Giselle “Gelly” Harrell, a 41-year-old displaced Compound resident, said she lost her motel spot after she was gone for several days. She was temporarily staying in a hostel with help from a friend, but would soon be back in a tent, she said. Before the Compound, she was atanother major encampmentthat was swept.View image in fullscreenA city worker clears a homeless encampment along Interstate 405 in Van Nuys on 31 July 2025.Photograph: Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images“They’re strategically cleaning out the area for the Olympics,” Harrell said. “They’re destroying communities. It’s traumatizing … I wish all that money for the Olympics could go toward housing people … but they are not here to help us.”It was hard to imagine the Olympics taking place in an area where so many people were living outside and in cars, Orendorff added: “The city has all these plans, but our people don’t even have access to showers.”Bassdeniedthat the Compound closure was Olympics-related, with the mayortelling reportersthe site was a hazard. Officials had worked to shelter everyone and keep people together and would aim to transition residents into permanent housing, she said, while acknowledging some “might be in motels for long periods”. “I will not tolerate Angelenos living in dangerous, squalor conditions,” she added.The mayor’s office continued to defend the Van Nuys operation in an email last week, saying an outreach team had built relationships with encampment residents over several months and offered resources to all of them: “Coming indoors meant access to three meals a day, case management and additional supportive services.”Zach Seidl, Bass’s spokesperson, did not comment on the city’s Olympics strategy, but said in an email that since the mayor took office, street homelessness had decreased by 17.5% and placements into permanent housing had doubled: “She is laser-focused on addressing homelessness through a proven comprehensive strategy that includes preventing homelessness, urgently bringing Angelenos inside and cutting red tape to make building affordable housing in the city easier and more efficient.”‘The Trump Olympics’: president vows to host the ‘greatest games’ in LA, a city that’s felt his wrathRead moreInside Safe, Bass’s program addressing encampments like the Compound, has brought thousands of people indoors and “fundamentally changed the way the city addresses homelessness by conducting extensive outreach, working with street medicine providers and offering other supportive case management services while they are in interim housing”, he continued. “This is why she ran for office and this is progress she would’ve made regardless of the Games.”The White House did not respond to inquiries about the Olympics, and a spokesperson for Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (Lahsa), the lead public agency responsible for addressing homelessness in the region, declined to comment.‘Legal restraints are gone’Advocates’ concerns are partly fueled by a supreme court ruling last year that gave local authorities significantly more leeway to criminalize encampments.“The legal restraints are gone, to the extent they were meaningful, and there is broad policy-level agreement by liberals and conservatives that sweeps are an acceptable approach,” said John Raphling, associate director of Human Rights Watch, a non-profit.Heauthored a reportlast year on LA’s policing of unhoused people, which found that unhoused Angelenos were routinely subject to aggressive LAPD crackdowns, misdemeanor arrests and sweeps that destroy their belongings.Homelessness-related arrests and citations, such as anti-camping violations, increased 68% in LA in the six months after the supreme court ruling, a recentCalMatters analysisfound. The crackdowns are happening even as LA hasvowedto not rely on criminalization and has promised a more restrained approach thanother California cities.View image in fullscreenA homeless encampment on S Manhattan Place in the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles on 12 September 2025.Photograph: Carlin Stiehl/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesSheehan said he was concerned LAPD would work with federal authorities to target people during the Olympics, especially after officers aggressivelyattacked protestersandjournalistsduring demonstrations against Trump’s immigration raids in June, inviolation of the department’s own protocols.Newsom, meanwhile, has pushed California cities toban encampmentsby adopting ordinances that make it a violation to camp in the same spot for three days, and advocates fear his presidential ambitions could lead him to continue to push punitive strategies as the Olympics approaches.“We’re already seeing a contest between Trump and Newsom as to who is going to appear tougher on homelessness, with tough being defined as how one responds to visible homelessness,” said Gary Blasi, professor of law emeritus at the University of California at Los Angeles, who co-wrote areportlast year on the 2028 Olympics in LA and the unsheltered population. “There aren’t good signs from either of them. Newsom offers the promise of alternatives he doesn’t identify and Trump offers the promise of some equivalent to incarceration.”In a statement to the Guardian, Newsom said the state has a “strong, comprehensive strategy for fighting the national homelessness and housing crises” and was “outperforming the nation”. “I’ve emphasized that our approach is to humanize, not criminalize – encampment work is paired with shelter, services [and] behavioral health support,” he said, citing hisCare court program, which is meant to compel people with severe psychosis into treatment.“Bottom line: encampments can’t be the status quo. We’re cleaning them up with compassion and urgency, while demanding accountability from every level of government. There is no compassion in allowing people to suffer the indignity of living in an encampment for years and years,” the governor added.Tara Gallegos, Newsom’s spokesperson, said the governor’s approach was distinct from the president’s, writing in an email: “The Trump administration is haphazardly bulldozing and upending encampments without creating any sort of supportive strategy to go along with it. It is about fear, not support … California’s strategy pairs urgency with dignity and care, creating wrap-around services addressing the root causes of homelessness.”An LA 2028 spokesperson did not comment on homelessness, but said in an email: “We work closely with our local, state and federal partners on Games planning and operations, and remain committed to working collaboratively with all levels of government to support a successful Games experience.”Organizers and providers prepareHomelessness service providers and advocates said they hoped LA officials would pursue bold solutions that quickly get people housing and resources without the threat of criminalization.A key part of the region’s strategy during the early pandemic was getting people out of tents and into motels, but those programs are costly and not a good fit for all of LA’s unhoused residents; it can also be challenging to transition participants into permanent housing. Blasi noted that that approach would become even harder during the Olympics when hotels face an influx of tourists.Los Angeles vowed to host the Olympics without breaking the bank and environment. Can it?Read moreBlasi advocated for direct cash payments to unhoused people, akin to the 2020 stimulus checks, which could help some unhoused people get off the streets at a faster and cheaper rate than the traditional process, he argued: “There are a lot of people who can solve their own homelessness if they just have a little bit more money.”Alex Visotzky, senior California policy fellow at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said LA has seen success with rapid rehousing programs that offer people rental subsidies, and that he hopes those efforts can be scaled up: “We know how to move people back into housing and do it quickly. It’s just a matter of whether we can marshal the political will to bring the money to make that happen.”Funding cuts, including from Trump’sslashing of federal homelessness resources, will be a barrier.The Union Rescue Mission, a faith-based group that runs the largest privateshelter in LA, has recently seen an influx of people needing services as other providers have faced cuts, said CEO Mark Hood. Hood, however, said he has had productive conversations with the Trump administration and remained optimistic the Olympics would provide an “opportunity to collaborate with our city, county, state and federal government in ways that we never have before”.He said he hoped the Olympics would lead to increased funding for providers, but was so far unaware of any specific plans.White, the longtime organizer, said he expected grassroots groups to come together to defend unhoused people, especially as mutual-aid networks have grown in response to Trump’s raids: “The kidnappings of immigrants and the attempted clearing of houseless people as we get closer to the Olympics gives us an opportunity to bring various communities together, and that’s when we can build the power necessary to push back.”Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028HomelessnessLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastHousingCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Goals from Daniel Muñoz and the substitute Eddie Nketiah ensured Oliver Glasner’s side marked their first appearance in the main phase of a European competition with a comfortable ­victory over Dynamo Kyiv despite a late red card for Borna Sosa.It was the perfect reward for the 3,500 supporters who had made the pilgrimage from south London to southern Poland as Palace made it 19 games unbeaten in all competitions to establish a new club record that dates back more than 50 years.Against opponents who have enjoyed plenty of famous European nights in their storied history but are no longer the same force of old due to the ongoing war with Russia, there was only ever going to be one winner as Glasner’s side showed they are well equipped to go all the way to the final in Leipzig despite their inexperience at this level.Nottingham Forest v Midtjylland, Feyenoord v Aston Villa, and more: Europa League – liveRead more“I’m proud that we could start theConference Leaguewith a win, away, against very good opposition,” said Glasner. “I don’t think about this run, because this already happened, so for me, it’s important what comes next. And next comes Everton and a new stadium. Really looking forward to this game, great atmosphere, great stadium.”He may have played it down but you have to go all the way back to 1969 for the last time Palace managed to go undefeated for 18 games under their former manager Bert Head when they achieved promotion to the old First Division for the first time in their ­history. These days, the south ­Londoners are an established force in the Premier League and came into this match brimming with ­confidence after their superb performance in the win over Liverpool on Saturday ­courtesy of Nketiah’s late winner.Glasner’s opposite number ­Oleksandr Shovkovskyi rested half of his first-choice side for their league game at the weekend and the veteran former West Ham forward Andriy ­Yarmolenko was one of those recalled. Kyiv’s players emerged from the tunnel before kick-off with Ukrainian flags draped over their shoulders, with a similar number of home supporters in attendance at a ground that is 400 miles from their home.In a competition that they have started as the bookmakers’ favourites, Palace are likely to face a different challenge of having to break teams down rather than hitting them on the break. Aside from a ­dangerous cross from Yeremy Pino that ­Jean-Philippe Mateta just failed to make ­contact with in the 11th minute as he ­celebrated his first call-up to France’s senior squad, they ­struggled to ­create anything meaningful against a ­determined Kyiv defence.Maxence Lacroix required ­treatment after clashing heads with Taras Mykhavko midway through the first half, with the Kyiv defender ­having to be withdrawn after attempting to come back on.

Pino found space down the left flank and drilled a cross to the back post, with Muñoz rising to somehow loop his header into the far corner.

He was forced into another change when Will Hughes went down a few minutes after the restart. ­Nketiah had the ball in the net after being set up by Adam Wharton, only for it to be ruled out for offside. But he did not have to wait long for another chance when Pino wriggled free down the left and the former Arsenal striker volleyed in his cross.Nketiah nearly scored again with a speculative shot from distance that was almost spilled into his own net by Neshcheret as Palace continued to dominate.Sosa’s decision to launch into a tackle on Oleksandr Tymchyk and earn himself a ­second yellow card three minutes after being shown his first could have put a dampener on Palace’s perfect day. But such is the quality of their defence these days that Palace never looked like ­conceding as they kicked off their Conference League ­campaign in style.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueDynamo KyivCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

But the German referee, Tobias Stieler, disallowed the goal and the video assistant Christian Dingert stuck with the decision, despite no handball being evident on television replays.Iheanacho capitalised on a loose pass from a free-kick to charge down a scrambled clearance from the former Celtic defender Gustaf Lagerbielke before slotting home.

The offences spanned three years between November 2021 and October 2024 and involved three girls aged 15, Snaresbrook crown court previously heard.On Thursday, Viccars was jailed for 13-and-a-half years with a further three-and-a-half years on extended licence at the same court. Addressing the referee, Judge Caroline English said: “You did deliberately target these three young victims and you did so on account of their ages at the material time. I am therefore quite satisfied that in all three cases you preyed upon young women that were vulnerable.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The judge said that despite Viccars’s guilty pleas and expressions of remorse, there remained a lack of acknowledgment from the defendant that he had “a sexual interest in female children”. This interest was clear from the contents of messages sent to his victims and a statement from Viccars’s ex-girlfriend, which said he used to ask her to dress up in school uniform.Viccars, who appeared in the dock wearing a dark green sweatshirt, nodded as the judge read out her sentencing remarks. He was an assistant referee at the time of offending and Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) said he was suspended “as soon as the allegations came to light”. Viccars was not considered for appointments after his initial suspension and PGMO has since removed him from the organisation’s list, it is understood.The prosecutor Charlotte Newell KC told the court Viccars had met his victims online through the messaging app Snapchat, telling one girl that talking on WhatsApp was “too risky”. She said Viccars had lied and told one of his victims he was a teacher when they first started communicating and was aware that she was 15 years old.Ms Newell read out the transcript of a voice note sent by Viccars to one of his victims, where he referred to her as “little girl” and himself as “daddy” and “teacher”. Ms Newell added of the victim: “She says effectively that she was lonely and she just wanted someone to talk to. He, it seems, was aware of that and abused it – turning the communication sexual.”The court heard he had abused another of his victims over a period of several years, had taken her to football matches and told others he was “mentoring” her. A scrapbook chronicling the two’s “relationship” that was made by the teenager and given to Viccars was handed to police and formed part of the evidence against him, the prosecutor said.In court, Viccars watched the victim read out an impact statement during which she said he had been her “world” and that she had trusted him “completely” for almost three years. Addressing her abuser, she said he had won her over with “kind words” and “attention” and had isolated her “in plain sight”. “Now I know what you really wanted was someone young enough to manipulate,” she added.Another statement was read out by the prosecutor on behalf of a different victim, in which she said she blamed herself for Viccars’s actions, which had broken her trust in adults. She said: “I struggle to sleep, I have had nightmares. I would have nightmares about what happened – it kept replaying in my head. When I was awake, I would have flashbacks. I kept reliving it again and again. I feel I am never going to find happiness.”Addressing the victims, Judge English said: “You must not allow your lives to be blighted by seeking to shoulder any responsibility for what took place, that would be wholly wrong. You must allow all the responsibility to rest where it belongs and that is entirely with Mr Viccars.”In mitigation, Laura Blackband, defending, said Viccars acknowledged that his behaviour had been “disgraceful”, he had had a “difficult upbringing” and struggled with alcohol issues. Three charges, two of sexual activity with a child and one of engaging in sexual communications with a child, will lie on file, the court previously heard.After the sentencing, the Metropolitan police said they believed there may be other victims of Viccars as he had been “spamming hundreds of girls on Snapchat”. DCI Ross Morrell, who led the Met’s investigation, said: “He began with a profile of ‘sorry I think I’ve added the wrong person’, and then he would go in to lie, manipulate them, and then go on to abuse them.“If anyone thinks they’ve been a victim, then please contact 101, reference this appeal. You will be entitled to specialist care, specialist advice, and you will be believed.”It is understood Viccars did not officiate last season.Explore more on these topicsFootballRefereesCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The attacker asked to be left out of the squad in June, in part because he wanted to refocus by spending some time away from football after a difficult season, and was not picked by Thomas Tuchel for last month’s World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.Foden struggled with an ankle knock during pre-season and has been working his way back to peak physical condition. The 25-year-old has impressed for City in recent weeks, particularly invictories over Manchester UnitedandNapoli, and will hope to be involved when Tuchel names his latest squad on Friday.New signings lighting up the Premier League – and those yet to shineRead moreEngland, who host Wales in a friendly next Thursday and visit Latvia for their next qualifier on 14 October, have plenty of options in attacking midfield. But with Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke ruled out, there is an opening for Foden to come back into the fold. Jude Bellingham is also available after recovering from a shoulder operation.The challenge with Foden, who has scored twice in seven appearances this season, remains finding the right role for him at international level. He has dazzled in flashes but has lacked consistency and competition for places in attack is rising. Tuchel, who also has Bukayo Saka available again, wanted more from Foden when England beat Latvia and Albania in March.Another attacker hoping to be included isJack Grealish, although the Everton winger may be left disappointed given that Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon and Barcelona’s Marcus Rashford have Tuchel’s trust at the moment. Grealish has not played for England since scoring in last year’s win over Finland.The Wales game gives Tuchel a chance to run the rule over a host of hopefuls. There are expected to be further opportunities for Tottenham’s Djed Spence and Nottingham Forest’sElliot Andersonand Morgan Gibbs-White. John Stones could return in defence after withdrawing from the last camp through injury while the absence of the Newcastle defender Tino Livramento gives Tuchel room to look at another full-back.Livramento’s Newcastle teammate Lewis Hall is back in contention and there are calls for Tuchel to consider the Crystal Palace left-back Tyrick Mitchell. An eye-catching move would be to bring the Arsenal defender Ben White back into the England picture. The Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is in good form after pulling out of the September camp with an adductor injury.Explore more on these topicsEnglandPhil FodennewsShareReuse this content"

That sentence alone tells you how exceptional they are, and whichever way you frame the statistics they are daunting. How about “Sonia Bompastor is yet to lose a WSL game after 15 months in charge”, “The Frenchwoman has won 23 of her 26 WSL games without defeat” or “Bompastor is unbeaten in 34 domestic matches since moving to England”? All are true, all sound formidable, and – after four wins from four this term – they are showing no signs of letting up.Who will bring this run to a halt? Eventually, Chelsea will lose a WSL match. It might not be this week, it might not be in 2025, it might not even be this season. Maybe it won’t even be during this parliament, but one day it will happen, and logic suggests that the fixtures where their streak has the highest probability of ending is in one of their away games against their main title rivals, Arsenal, Manchester City or Manchester United. On Friday, the latter of that trio will have their turn, and form-wise they have rarely been better placed to have a go at it.Emma Hayes: ‘I don’t think coaches are always thought about as human beings’Read moreThe top two teams in the early-season table go head to head in Leigh under the lights and, although the WSL season is only four rounds of fixtures old, Manchester United go into Friday’s fixture with the best defensive record in the league. History favours Chelsea though, because the most damning stat of all is perhaps this: Manchester United have never beaten Chelsea in the WSL.In fact they have managed only one draw from their 11 previous WSL meetings. Nevertheless, the home team’s manager, Marc Skinner, wants his team to believe. “It’s by far the most difficult challenge in the WSL right now, of course it is,” Skinner said. “We want to try to break that run when we play them on Friday but it’s difficult.“They’re such a well-oiled machine. They have incredible quality, depth and quality, that they’ve built over many seasons. I expect the toughest of challenges on Friday and we’ve got to be ready.“I really think you can hurt Chelsea with the ball, but you’ve got to be brave in doing that, because it’s higher risk because they’re really good in duels. You have to believe that you can beat them, you have to show Chelsea that you can beat them.”For Bompastor, who oversaw a domestic treble of major trophies last term in her first season in English football, the statistics mean very little. “This story about the unbeaten run is more for the journalists,” she said. “We started this season from zero, we won four games out of four, and we want to go into every game with the desire to win. We are early in the season, we did not achieve anything yet.”View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Melvine Malard (right) has four WSL goals already this season.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAThe former Lyon coach has fond memories of visiting Leigh, because it was where her teamclinched last season’s title on 30 April, with a 1-0 win courtesy of a Lucy Bronze header. This time they face a Manchester United side who have conceded only one goal in four league games and Bompastor said: “United look strong and they’ve had a good start to the season.“In these games, it’s always tough. Maybe you create [fewer] chances than in some of the games and you need to make sure you are clinical and efficient. I think that’s what makes the difference in the highest-level games.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In possession, we have been working hard with her, trying for her to be as successful as she can be in many aspects of her game. Right now, she is really confident [and] that’s great for the team.”It is a cliche in football that the “first goal will be crucial” but it seems especially true here; Manchester United are unbeaten in each of the past 25 WSL games in which they have taken the lead. If they can finally end their wait for a first win against Chelsea, it would be the first major twist in the WSL title race.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester United WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Barcelona v Paris Saint-Germain was the final many wanted last season. Wednesday’s group-stage meeting showed why. The fixturedid not disappoint, even if, with red tape delaying the opening of the renovated Camp Nou, it was played in the less atmospheric Lluís Companys Stadium. Luis Enrique’s young Parisians staged a comeback in Catalonia, thanks to their coach’s expert use of his squad. Senny Mayulu, 19, upstaged Lamine Yamal by scoring the equaliser – Wednesday was the first match this season Yamal had failed to either score or contribute to a goal. Instead, the resurgent Marcus Rashford set up Ferran Torres’s opener for Barça. PSG were shorn of Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, the forward line that claimed last season’s crown. No matter: 23-year-old Bradley Barcola stepped up as the senior forward and ravaged Hansi Flick’s high-line, high-wire defence. The youngsters kept coming for PSG: 17-year-old Ibrahim Mbaye was replaced by another teenager, Quentin Ndjantou, to play alongside the lively Lee Kang-in. In the end, Achraf Hakimi supplied the assist for Gonçalo Ramos, another sub, to score the 90th minute winner and inflict Barcelona’s first loss this season. “If you’re the best team, you have to show it on the pitch, and not talk,” said Ramos, who habitually scores late goals off the bench. “We are the champions of Europe.”Marseille. The French club were the inaugural winners of the rebadged Champions League in 1993, yet they have a troubled relationship with the competition. That triumph carries an asterisk: the club were stripped of their French title the same yearfor match fixing. This season, Roberto De Zerbi’s firebrand coaching could take them on a deep run. Having lost 2-1, and creditably, at Real Madrid andbeaten PSG last week in Ligue 1, Marseille crushed another former winner in Ajax, 4-0 in a raucous Stade Velodrome. De Zerbi’s squad is a mix of waifs and strays, many familiar to Premier League audiences. Against Ajax, Mason Greenwood repeated his influential showing in Madrid. His goal followed Brazilian partner Igor Paixão’s early double. The fourth came from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who is still enjoying his football at the age of 36. De Zerbi, usually a terse taskmaster, was gushing: “I like the way my players work, the fun they have, and the relationship they create with the fans.”Manchester United are nowhere near this season’s competition but Napoli’sRasmus Højlundis the latest player to thrive once no longer weighed down by the red shirt. Two goals from the Dane, banished to the “bomb squad” by Ruben Amorim last season, showed why United paid Atalanta £68m for him in 2023 (and why United will take a £26m hit should his loan toNapolibe made permanent). Another former Manchester resident, Kevin De Bruyne, supplied two laser-guided assists in Napoli’s 2-1 win over Sporting. “Kevin is a legend of this sport and when he has the ball, I know that with his quality he will always put it perfectly for me,” said Højlund.New signings lighting up the Premier League – and those yet to shineRead morePlayer of the weekJens Petter Hauge, Bodø/Glimt.It took a late own-goal to deny Bodo/Glimt the victory over Tottenhamthey probably deserved. Hauge, a star of the Norwegian club’s run to last season’s Europa League semi-final after returning to his home town from spells at Milan and Eintracht Frankfurt, scored twice against Spurs this week. Both goals saw him cutting in from the wing to lash home.They said it“I know I’ve played poorly in some matches, I am aware of it. I’m not hiding … People can say many things about me, but under no circumstances can they say that I refuse to play. I have given everything, and even more, for this club. I’ve played through fractures, injuries, and never once have I complained or asked for a rest. I have a good relationship with the coach, which gives me the confidence to tell him which position I prefer … always, I’ve made it clear that I am available to play in any position, in any away game, and in every match.” Federico Valverde, a non-playing sub in Real Madrid’s win at Kairat, takes to social media to deny rumours of a rift with Xabi Alonso and refusing to play at right-back in the absence of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dani Carvajal.The pundit’s chair“Right now, he needs to come out of the team, Liverpool need to go back to what they were last season, and try to build some confidence and some stability. Right now it looks like a mess.” Jamie Carragher’s takedown of Liverpool summer signing Florian Wirtz on CBS, following their 1-0 defeat to Galatasaray.Looking aheadAmong the teams on two wins from two areQarabag, who beat FC Copenhagen 2-0 in Baku after victory over Benfica in Portugal in their opener. Qurban Qurbanov is a legend of Azerbaijani football, a goal-plundering forward turned coach of the Land of Fire’s serial champions, his reign stretching to 17 years. The club’s first group stage appearance since 2017-18, only their second overall, could hardly be going better. Next up for Qarabag, Athletic Club, who are on zero points after their 4-1 loss to Borussia Dortmund. Can Qurbanov’s men go three for three?Two players coming into form are Arsenal’s Martin Ødegaard, full of creativity against Olympiakos on Wednesday, and Julián Alvarez, who starred in Atlético Madrid’s weekendderby crushing of Real Madrid. The Argentinian scored a late penalty in Tuesday’s 5-1 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt. When Atlético visit the Emirates later this month, there will be a familiar face in the directors’ box. Andrea Berta, the sporting director who signed the players for Diego Simeone’s Atléti dynasty, now heads Arsenal’s transfer business.Real Madrid v Juventus is a history-laden meeting of two of the most haughty members of European football’s elite. The 1998 and 2017 finals were both won by the Spanish club though Juve have won 10 of the 21 meetings in Uefa competition to Madrid’s nine. Madrid won their most recent meeting, 1-0 in Miami, during the summer’s Club World Cup.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChampions League reviewBarcelonaReal MadridMarseilleQarabagNapoliUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s their best start to a top-flight campaign in 70 years. A lot of that success can be attributed to their new signings, none more than the outstanding Mukiele – WhoScored’ssecond-highest rated player this seasonafter Erling Haaland.Signed for just £12m in the summer, the former RB Leipzig, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayer Leverkusen defender was given his chance when Dan Ballard picked up an injury in the second game of the season. The 27-year-old has embraced the challenge, producing a series of standout displays. In his four games,Sunderlandhave picked up eight points and conceded just two goals. His physicality and athleticism have been central to the team’s fast start.He attacks the ball aggressively (he ranks third for clearances per 90 minutes in the league), wins his duels (he ranks ninth for tackles per game among defenders), and is just one of seven players in the league yet to be dribbled past. Sunderland pulled off a coup by landing a player of his pedigree and talent at such a low cost.Mohammed KudusKudus has wasted no time making an impact after his£55m switch from West Ham to Tottenham. Only Jack Grealish (four) has more assists than Kudus (three) in the league this season. Having been moved around the park at West Ham by Julen Lopetegui and Graham Potter, he has been installed on the right of Thomas Frank’s attack and is thriving.One thing that Kudus has carried over from his time at West Ham is his ability in one-on-one situations. He ranks top for successful take-ons (24) in thePremier Leagueand is only behind Kylian Mbappé (25) in Europe’s top five leagues.Despite his relentless attacking, he never forgets his defensive duties. He ranks third in the Spurs side for tackles per game (2.2). If Kudus can add a few goals, Frank might just have a complete player on his hands.Hugo EkitikéOf all the players recruited byLiverpoolin their £450m summer spending spree, Ekitié has stood out. The Frenchman has taken to Arne Slot’s system seamlessly, with five goals and one assist in his first nine appearances.Ekitiké has embodied the idea that price tags are irrelevant on the pitch. He hasn’t been fazed by Alexander Isak’sarrival for a Premier League-record price of £125m. Rather, he has relished the competition, staking his claim to lead the Liverpool attack. “We play in such a big club, and I can’t see any big clubs playing with just one striker in their squad,” he says. “It is good that Alex is here. For me, at my age, I have a lot of things to improve and learn.”Ekitike is sharing a dressing room with a striker who scored 44 goals in the last two Premier League seasons, but he is giving his manager a selection dilemma. That shows just how impressive he has been so far this season.View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitiké has been sensational for Liverpool this season, unlike a few of his new teammates.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAFlorian WirtzThings have not quite gone to plan for Wirtz this season. The£116m signing from Bayer Leverkusenis yet to make his mark in a Liverpool shirt. The German has not scored or assisted in eight games and Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has voiced concerns, saying: “I don’t think the balance of the team is right, and the obvious one that stands out is Florian Wirtz.”There is clearly an issue with Wirtz’s end product, and the 22-year-old midfielder is taking some time to adapt to the speed of the Premier League, often taking too many touches (he has the second-most dispossessions in the Liverpool side). But it’s early days. Wirtz is still adapting to a new league and country while playing a new role in a team that is transitioning, with Liverpool experiencing a 14-player turnover this summer.There are reasons for optimism. He leads the team in shot-creating actions (31) and has created more chances than any other Premier League player this season in all competitions. He ranks second for take-ons attempted (21), and third for carries into the final third and touches in the attacking third. The goals and assists will come.Anthony ElangaThree minutes into his debut against Aston Villa on the opening weekend, Elanga had a great chance to score his first goal for Newcastle. But he was denied by Villa’s new goalkeeper Marco Bizot. That attempt carried an expected goals value of 0.48, and it still makes up the bulk of his Premier League tally this season, which stands at 0.6 xG.Elanga arrived at Newcastle in the summer with no shortage of expectation after his£55m move from Nottingham Forest. His record at Forest was steady: 31 goal contributions in 74 Premier League appearances. So far, though, he has not replicated that output at Newcastle. Nine appearances in black and white have come and gone without a goal or assist.Eddie Howe has been conservative in his use of the club’s third most expensive signing. Despite starting the first two games of the season, he is yet to start another Premier League game, with Jacob Murphy preferred while Elanga settles in his new environment.Like Wirtz, Elanga’s lack of end product does not tell the whole story. He ranks second among Newcastle players for expected assists (xAG) across all competitions. His player-of-the-match display in the4-0 win against Union Saint-Gilloisein the Champions League was a reminder that the output will come.Benjamin SeskoBeing a Manchester United striker is a thankless task as 22-year-old Sesko has discovered early in his time at Old Trafford. One goal in seven appearances fora player who cost £74mis far from ideal, but there is no need to jump to conclusions just yet.Sesko’s lack of output looks more a symptom of United’s wider attacking problems than an individual shortcoming. The new-look front three of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo is yet to click, with the lack of chemistry compounded by poor finishing (United’s xG difference of -7.26 is the worst in the division).Service has been a particular issue. Sesko averaged 34 touches per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga last season, but that figure has dropped to 17.6 at United – and many of them are in areas where he is less effective. His trademark runs in behind are going unnoticed, with teammates slow to spot his movement or execute the pass. That is likely to improve once Ruben Amorim settles on him as a regular starter. The three new signings have only started one game together so far and Sesko has started just four games.He has played just 417 minutes forManchester Unitedso far, and while his start has been slow, it is still early days. He remains the same striker who scored 39 goals in two seasons at RB Leipzig. With more minutes in a settled attack, his output should improve.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsFootballGuardian Sport NetworkPremier LeagueTransfer windowSunderlandLiverpoolNewcastle UnitedTottenham HotspurfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We have to really feel it’Thu 2 Oct 2025 17.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareNuno Espírito Santo believes it will take time for him to build an ­identity and philosophy at West Ham. The former Nottingham Forest manager is adjusting to his latest role after a whirlwind start and is looking to ­connect with his new club’s culture on an emotional level.Nuno, who was appointed ­following thebrutal sacking of ­Graham Potterlast weekend, said that longstanding members of staff have spent the week filling him inon life at West Ham. He smiled when asked for his interpretation of the West Ham way, a concept that means “gung-ho football” to some fans but passion and resilience to others.West Ham tumble in modern football’s vortex, with home now a distant memory | Jonathan LiewRead more“That’s what I’m trying to ­understand every day,” he said. “Every day they tell me this. It’s not about understanding. It goes much further. We have to feel it. I need some time to feel it. I’m starting to understand it, but I really have to feel it. And after we really feel it we have to put it inside of us.“You have to put it inside of you. What makes the difference is the feeling, not only the understanding. If you feel, it goes much further. You’re talking about the philosophy and identity. How far are we from that? It’s not enough to say a ‘West Ham way’. Let’s build it, let’s create it, let’s feel it. Let’s identify ourselves with that.”Nuno, who began his tenure with an encouraging1-1 draw at Evertonon Monday, was asked how far he is from developing an identity. “I think very far,” he said. “It’s so hard to do it. It requires so much effort from ­everybody at the club. But it’s a priority.”There is often a demand from the fanbase for an exciting brand of ­football. David Moyes, the most successful West Ham manager of the modern era, eventually came under pressure because of his pragmatic approach. But Julen Lopetegui and Potter struggled to change the style of play in the post-Moyes era.It falls to Nuno, who played a ­counterattacking style at Forest, to decide whether results are more important than entertainment.West Ham have conceded 14 goals in their first six league games and are languishing in 19th place. “What determines the style of play is not the coach,” Nuno said. “What determines the style of play is the squad. It’s not the coach.“We have to find the balance between the two parts of the game. The defensive part and the ­offensive part. We cannot attack with an ­unbalanced way because we open spaces for our opponents. We have to defend, organise, but always with a priority. When we recover, what are we going to do with the ball?”West Ham could welcome back Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jean-Clair Todibo when they visit Arsenal on Saturday. Nuno also left the door open for a recall for James Ward-Prowse, who was dropped from the squad against Everton. Ward-Prowse briefly played for Nuno at Forest last season but the midfielder was not a regular and his loan spell was cut short in February.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Saints won in dramatic circumstances, scoring the winning try after the full-time hooter had sounded and whetting the appetite not only for the run-in to Old Trafford but also this autumn’s Ashes series.There are two semi-finals, one of which is genuinely unpredictable and one that could yield another huge upset. But as one rugby league historian once said, this great sport never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity.So here we are again, on the eve of a big game, talking about owners not players. It is a recurring tale in rugby league; those in the boardrooms capturing the headlines rather than allowing the focus to be on the game itself. This time, it is the Leigh owner, Derek Beaumont, at the centre of the story, after Wiganclaimed on Wednesdayhe threatened to pull his side from Friday’s local derby.Beaumont’s alleged remark is based around ticket allocations; the Leigh owner publishing a 4,465-word statement that included suggestions of fan protests over their 4,800 tickets, far higher than the usual away allocation of 10% for a playoff tie.There was no definitive confirmation in that statement of the game going ahead but the Guardian understands that the game is on. Thankfully, then, these two great rivals will compete in a game that has all the hallmarks of a classic.Wigan are in pursuit of a third successive Super League title, while Leigh are in the semi-finals for the second time. They are buoyed by their remarkable1-0 win at Wiganin February, their first at their local rivals since 1982. They head across the borough as underdogs, but with a chance of victory after finishing third.“It’s been nice to see us tick boxes along the way as we have done every year,” their coach, Adrian Lam, said. “Finishing higher up the ladder certainly shows the trajectory we’re on as a club. The more of these games we play the better we’ll be.“To be 80 minutes away from Old Trafford two years running asLeigh Leopardsis an incredible story. We want to achieve things we’ve never done as a club. We had our first quarter-final win at home last week, which was one of those.”This has historically been a one-sided fixture but Leigh have emerged as one of Super League’s most competitive sides in recent years. Champions of England only twice, in 1906 and 1982, reaching a first Grand Final would be an historic moment, but standing in their way are a Wigan side in no mood to let their grip slide.View image in fullscreenThe Wigan coach, Matt Peet, praised Leigh for ‘transforming the rivalry’ through their recent improvement.Photograph: AlamyHaving won an unprecedented quadruple last year, Wigan have not quite hit the same heights throughout 2025. But they appear to be producing their best at the right time with a run of five straight wins in which they have conceded only 22 points. They may have finished secondbehind Hull KR, but the Warriors feel like the favourites again.“I think what Leigh have done – they have transformed this into a special fixture,” Matt Peet, the Wigan coach, said. “It’s always had a rivalry that’s based on the geography of the two teams but when we’re meeting each other in semi-finals and highlight games of the season, it just adds to it. They’ve been a consistent competitive team but they’ve also consistently got better and better.”Then to Saturday, where there is a compelling second semi-final for different reasons. Many expected this to be the league leaders, Hull KR, against Leeds but St Helens’ stunning late victory last Saturday means it is Paul Wellens’s side who travel to east Hull to try to halt the Robins’ hunt for an historic treble.The Saints may be riding an emotional high but they will have to improve on what they produced not only last weekend, but throughout this year against Super League’s best sides.In contrast, many expect Rovers to progress to a second straight Old Trafford finale with minimal fuss if they deliver their best form – though unlike Wigan they have stuttered somewhat of late as the finish line approaches.Saints’ win last weekend – and what has happened off the field in recent days – shows that it is perhaps best to prepare for the unexpected.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueLeigh LeopardsWigan WarriorsRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The majority of British & Irish Lions squad members are not being permitted to resume playing for their clubs until next week but the Tigers forward has been given special dispensation.Curtain up for epic rugby tale Exe Men: the best south-west drama since PoldarkRead moreThe 25-year-old was injured for a large chunk of last season and ended up starting only 16 games and featuring off the bench four times. Despite being involved in all three Lions Tests against the Wallabies, the player management load group overseeing the welfare of top players has allowed him to face Harlequins at Welford Road on Saturday.Harlequins, in contrast, will have to do without Chessum’s Lions teammate Marcus Smith who must wait another week before rejoining the fray. Unlike Owen Farrell, who was also sidelined for much of last season and returned forSaracens’ opening Prem game at Newcastle, Smith was involved in 34 matches last season including five non-Test Lions tour games and is required to have a mandatory full 10-week break.Chessum, however, is raring to go and demonstrate that Leicester can prosper this season despite the departure of Michael Cheika and a number of senior players. The Tigers featured in the Prem final last June but Chessum says their thumping 80-12 European pool defeat by Toulouse is the game that has provided their most enduring motivation. “There was just a sense of ‘We are never going to that place again’. Regardless of how we prepare, regardless of how we are coached, regardless of tactics, we are never going back there.“It is the worst defeat in the club’s history and to say you were part of that is embarrassing really. So, it hurts. You will always look back and just make sure you never go through a result like that again. I remember Cheik was almost in tears in the changing room. The reason we were in the final last year was due to what happened after that game in Toulouse. There was a real change in all of us.”Bristol, meanwhile, have revealed they have lost first choice fly-half AJ McGinty for nine months after he was injured in their opening win over Leicester. McGinty has had surgery on his achilles on the same day that his half-back partner Harry Randall required an operation on his hamstring. Randall will be back in the new year while the return for wing Gabriel Itoye, who also injured his hamstring against Leicester and needs surgery is still to be confirmed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Noting that England’s elite clubs had a “bigger share of the world’s best players” from this summer’s record-breaking £3bn spending, Masters said: “Seven of our clubs were net recipients in lots of inter-Premier League transfers. But a lot of that money does percolate out of the big European leagues, a substantial portion of that, and breathes life into their own transfer markets. So I don’t see how it’s suffocating [the European game].New signings lighting up the Premier League – and those yet to shineRead more“I think there is a clear juxtaposition between the amounts of money being spent on the Premier League and the other leagues. But I think that’s a good thing. Provided it’s within the rules, it’s a good thing. It shapes our competition. And it’s an indication that our clubs want to drive supporter interest, and it’s the interest in the audience which drives our media values.”The Premier League’s financial dominance has long been underpinned by its media revenues and Masters, who was speaking at The Summit, part of Leaders Week London, said the competition had seen 27% growth in revenues “term on term” in international markets. He defended the longstanding model of selling deals to broadcasters in individual markets but said the Premier League was also “stepping towards” launching its own one-stop digital broadcast service, with a revamped Premier League Productions set to open new studios in the capital.“Premier League Studios is opening up in Olympia next summer,” Masters confirmed. “So we’re putting ourselves in the supply chain, the content supply chain, principally to serve our international broadcast partners and so that we have stronger control over the content.“But it also gives us the option to go forward, and we have also relaunched our digital platforms this summer with the objective of getting closer to fans. So we’re stepping towards that optionality. I don’t think there will ever be … a switch-on-switch-off moment for the Premier League.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he argued there was no room to further grow broadcast offerings without a shift in the policy. “Our current domestic broadcast arrangements means that we are now essentially licensed to the outer limit,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Antonee Robinson is back for the first time since undergoing knee surgery after the end of the last Premier League season, as does forward Patrick Agyemang after his summer transfer from Charlotte FC to Derby County.The USMNT’s 2025 has been tumultuous, but it deserves an optimist’s view | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreA few notable players will miss the friendlies due to injury, a group that includes Atlético Madrid midfielder Johnny Cardoso, Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder Gio Reyna, and the PSV Eindhoven duo of forward Ricardo Pepi and defender Sergiño Dest.The US will play Ecuador on 10 October at 8.30pm ET in Austin, Texas before traveling north to Colorado to play Australia on 14 October at 9pm ET.Here are Pochettino’s selections and some initial takeaways:GoalkeepersChris Brady (Chicago Fire), Matt Freese (New York City FC), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew), Matt Turner (New England Revolution)Turner returns to the squad after missing out on the last window, and once again he faces a tight competition for the No 1 shirt. This time around, he’ll be competing with NYC FC’s Freese, who was Pochettino’s preferred starter through the Gold Cup over the summer and friendlies afterward. Brady joins after a solid showing against Inter Miami in a wild midweek win, and Schulte will hope to translate another camp appearance into some game time with the first team.DefendersMax Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Mark McKenzie (FC Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati)The returning Robinsons, Antonee and Miles, highlight a group that is largely the same as the last few windows, with the notable exceptions of Tristan Blackmon (through injury) and Noahkai Banks. Fulham’s Robinson has only made scattered appearances off the bench for his club since returning from offseason knee surgery, but is fit enough to join the US squad after his absence this summer. With five center backs (Carter-Vickers, McKenzie, Ream, Richards and Miles Robinson), it seems likely that Pochettino could return to the three-at-the-back formation that worked so well for the US in a friendly win against Japan last time out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His role will be interesting to suss out, especially in the absence of Adams. Morris returns for the first time since Pochettino’s debut international window a year ago, with Sands appearing for the first time. Both have started well for their clubs and could be a depth option come World Cup time with a good showing. Yunus Musah is another notable exclusion after mostly coming off the bench for Atalanta to start the season with his new club.ForwardsPatrick Agyemang (Derby County), Folarin Balogun (AS Monaco), Christian Pulisic (Milan), Tim Weah (Marseille), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Alex Zendejas (Club América)Balogun and Zendejas performed well in their first US call-ups of 2025 last time.

The teams last met in the postseason in 2009, when the Phillies beat the Dodgers in the NL Championship Series for the second straight year.Boone defends pulling ace Max Fried as Yankees risk playoff exit to Red SoxRead more“I know we can win the whole thing,” Betts said. “We’ve got to continue to pitch, timely hitting and play defense, and everything should be OK.”After hitting a franchise playoff-tying five home runs in a 10-5 win in the NL wildcard series opener Tuesday, the Dodgers eliminated the Reds by playing small ball and rapping out 13 hits – two fewer than in Game 1. Mookie Betts went 4 for 5 with three doubles, tying Jim Gilliam in Game 4 of the 1953 World Series for most doubles in a single postseason game in team history.“I think what we’re seeing is winning pitches, using the whole field, fighting and not trying to just slug,” manager Dave Roberts said. “I think we’re taking team at-bats.”After the Reds took a 2-0 lead in the first, Yamamoto retired the next 13 batters.The Dodgers rallied to take a 3-2 lead before the Japanese right-hander wiggled his way out of a huge jam in the sixth. The Reds loaded the bases with no outs on consecutive singles by TJ Friedl, Spencer Steer and former Dodger Gavin Lux.Austin Hays grounded into a fielder’s choice to shortstop and Betts fired home, where catcher Ben Rortvedt stomped on the plate to get Friedl. Yamamoto then retired Sal Stewart and Elly De La Cruz on back-to-back swinging strikeouts to end the threat.“I was just trying to bring my everything out there,” Yamamoto said through a translator.With blue rally towels waving, Yamamoto walked off to a standing ovation from the crowd of 50,465.“Once he got the two outs, I think he kind of smelled blood right there and was able to attack and get the last out,” Betts said.Yamamoto got the first two outs of the seventh before leaving to a second ovation. The right-hander allowed two runs, four hits and walked two on a career-high 113 pitches. It was the most pitches by a Dodger in the playoffs since Walker Buehler threw 117 in Game 5 of the 2019 NLDS.For the second straight night, the fans’ mood soured in the eighth. Reliever Emmet Sheehan gave up two runs, making it 8-4, before the Reds brought the tying run to the plate against Alex Vesia. He got Friedl on a called third strike to end the inning in which Sheehan and Vesia made a combined 41 pitches. On Tuesday, three Dodgers relievers needed 59 pitches to get three outs in the eighth.Rookie Roki Sasaki pitched the ninth, getting three outs, including striking out Steer and Lux on pitches that touched 101 mph.The Dodgers stranded runners in each of the first five innings, but they took a 3-2 lead on Kiké Hernández’s RBI double and Miguel Rojas’ RBI single that hit the first-base line to chase Reds starter Zack Littell.Shohei Ohtani’s RBI single leading off the sixth snapped an 0-for-9 skid against Reds reliever Nick Martinez. Betts added an RBI double down the third-base line and Teoscar Hernández had a two-run double that extended the lead to 7-2.Yamamoto could have had a scoreless first but Teoscar Hernández dropped a ball hit by Hays that would have been the third out. Hernández hugged Yamamoto in the dugout after the Japanese star left the game.Stewart’s two-run RBI single with two outs eluded a diving Freddie Freeman at first for a 2-0 lead. It was Cincinnati’s first lead in a postseason game since Game 3 of the 2012 NLDS against San Francisco.Explore more on these topicsMLBLos Angeles DodgersCincinnati RedsBaseballShohei OhtaniPhiladelphia PhilliesUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It was the first major trophy for the club, which joined Major League Soccer in 2020.TheUS Open Cup, which dates to 1914, is the oldest soccer competition in the United States.“I think it is important for us that we know that we can do it, that we can win a trophy,” said Mukhtar, who has been with the club since they joinedMLS. “It gives us extra confidence for the rest of the (MLS) season.”Mukhtar gave Nashville the early lead with a shot that sailed into the upper corner just out of the reach of Austin goalkeeper Brad Stuver in the 17th minute. Austin had a good chance to equalize less than 10 minutes later after goalkeeper Brian Schwake’s foul on Myrto Uzuni. But Schwake denied Uzuni’s penalty attempt.Uzuni got redemption with a left-footed goal to the far corner in first-half stoppage time and the teams went into the break at Q2 Stadium tied at 1-1.The winning moment came on a corner kick, when Austin’s Dani Pereira was deemed to have fouled Jeisson Palacios in the box, giving Nashville a penalty of their own. Surridge stepped up and converted for his tournament-best sixth goal.

It now displays a Kido logo with “view more” underneath it, but a cybersecurity source said the link did not work – implying that the data has been removed.A Kido spokesperson confirmed the attackers had removed information that they had previously published.The spokesperson said: “Throughout this incident we have followed guidance from the authorities that discourages ransom payments as they only fuel and incentivise further criminal activity. We continue to work closely with families, regulators, law enforcement and our cybersecurity experts to investigate and take active steps to confirm that the data is permanently deleted.”The BBC first reported the deletion and quoted one of the hackers who said: “We are sorry for hurting kids.”The targeting of children was widely criticised, with cybersecurity analysts describing the hack as “appalling” and “testing the boundaries of morality”. One parent whose child is at a Kido nursery inLondonsaid the hackers were “sinking to new depths”.The Guardian has also seen evidence of Radiant gang members on an underground cybercrime forum being told by criminal peers to refrain from attacking children.On Wednesday a member of Nova, a gang that offers hacking services to fellow criminals, told a persona called Radiant on the Russian Anonymous Market Place forum: “reputation important, don’t attack child right”. Radiant replied that they “have disabled any attacks relating to them, is not allowed any more” and added: “Any data relating to under 19s who attended have been deleted.”The leak site and forum posts were screenshotted by analysts at the cybersecurity firm Sophos.Hacking gangs are sensitive to negative publicity, not least because it raises their exposure to action from law enforcement and disrupts relationships within the hacking community.Rebecca Taylor, a researcher at Sophos, said: “Even cybercriminals know some lines can’t be crossed. Radiant learned that stealing data belonging to children doesn’t just attract attention, it burns credibility. It erodes any legitimacy they claim, particularly as they appear to be a newly formed group.”Taylor said “credibility is king” for groups demanding ransoms for stolen data because it gave them leverage in negotiations. The BBC reported that Radiant had demanded £600,000 in bitcoin from Kido to return the data but that Kido had not paid the ransom.“Deleting the data wasn’t an act of kindness, it was damage control. This was a rare moment when morality and self-interest briefly aligned,” Taylor said.However, the revamped Radiant leak site – the term for such portals – appears to be ready for more victims, with a search bar for finding companies that have been hacked by the group, plus details of how to contact the group via Tox, an encrypted messaging service.Although Radiant has shown a proficient command of English in its communications, analysts believe the group could be non-western. Most ransomware groups – groups who encrypt a company’s IT files and steal data – are from states from the former Soviet Union. Radiant appears to be a new group within cybercrime circles, according to analysts.Prior to the deletion, one woman told the BBC she had received a threatening phone call from the criminals who said they would post her child’s information online unless she put pressure on Kido to pay a ransom. Kido has nurseries on 18 sites around London and more in the US, India and China.Radiant had claimed to have sensitive data on more than 8,000 children and their families, including accident and safeguarding reports, as well as billing information. It said all Kido nurseries in the UK were affected.One cybercriminal told the BBC: “All child data is now being deleted. No more remains and this can comfort parents.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeHackingLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Scientists are wary of its effect on creativityJulia Carrie WongThu 2 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 16.09 EDTShareJosh was at the end of his rope when he turned toChatGPTfor help with a parenting quandary. The 40-year-old father of two had been listening to his “super loquacious” four-year-old talk about Thomas the Tank Engine for 45 minutes, and he was feeling overwhelmed.“He was not done telling the story that he wanted to tell, and I needed to do my chores, so I let him have the phone,” recalled Josh, who lives in north-west Ohio. “I thought he would finish the story and the phone would turn off.”But when Josh returned to the living room two hours later, he found his child still happily chatting away with ChatGPT in voice mode. “The transcript is over 10k words long,” he confessed in asheepish Reddit post. “My son thinks ChatGPT is the coolest train loving person in the world. The bar is set so high now I am never going to be able to compete with that.”From radio and television to video games and tablets, new technology has long tantalized overstretched parents of preschool-age kids with the promise of entertainment and enrichment that does not require their direct oversight, even as it carried the hint of menace that accompanies any outside influence on the domestic sphere. A century ago,mothers in Arizonaworried that radio programs were “overstimulating, frightening and emotionally overwhelming” for children; today’s parents self-flagellate overscreen timeandsocial media.‘I want him to be prepared’: why parents are teaching their gen Alpha kids to use AIRead moreBut the startlingly lifelike capabilities of generative AI systems have left many parents wondering ifAI is an entirely new beast. Chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) are engaging young children in ways the makers of board games, Teddy Ruxpin, Furby and even the iPad never dreamed of: they produce personalized bedtime stories, carry on conversations tailored to a child’s interests, and generate photorealistic images of the most far-fetched flights of fancy – all for a child who can not yet read, write or type.Can generative AI deliver the holy grail of technological assistance to parents, serving as a digital Mary Poppins that educates, challenges and inspires, all within a framework of strong moral principles and age-appropriate safety? Or is this all just another Silicon Valley hype-bubble with a particularly vulnerable group of beta testers?‘My kids are the guinea pigs’For Saral Kaushik, a 36-year-old software engineer and father of two in Yorkshire, a packet of freeze-dried “astronaut” ice-cream in the cupboard provided the inspiration for a novel use of ChatGPT with his four-year-old son.“I literally just said something like, ‘I’m going to do a voice call with my son and I want you to pretend that you’re an astronaut on the ISS,’” Kaushik said. He also instructed the program to tell the boy that it had sent him a special treat.“[ChatGPT] told him that he had sent his dad some ice-cream to try from space, and I pulled it out,” Kaushik recalled. “He was really excited to talk to the astronaut. He was asking questions about how they sleep. He was beaming, he was so happy.”Childhood is a time of magic and wonder, and dwelling in the world of make-believe is not just normal but encouraged by experts in early childhood development, who have long emphasized the importance of imaginative play. For some parents, generative AI can help promote that sense of creativity and wonder.View image in fullscreenYing Xu: ‘If [children] believe that AI has agency, they might understand it as the AIwantingto talk to them orchoosingto talk to them.’Photograph: RooM the Agency/AlamyJosh’s daughter, who is six, likes to sit with him at the computer and come up with stories for ChatGPT to illustrate. (Several parents interviewed for this article requested to be identified by their first names only.) “When we started using it, it was willing to make an illustration of my daughter and insert that in the story,” Josh said, though more recent safety updates have resulted in it no longer producing images of children. Kaushik also uses ChatGPT to convert family photographs into coloring book pages for his son.Ben Kreiter, a father of three in Michigan, explained ChatGPT to his two-, six-, and eight-year-old children after they saw him testing its image-generation capabilities for work (he designs curriculums for an online parochial school). “I was like, ‘I tell the computer a picture to make and it makes it,’ and they said: ‘Can we try?’” Soon, the children were asking to make pictures with ChatGPT every day. “It was cool for me to see what they are imagining that they can’t quite [draw] on a piece of paper with their crayons yet.”Kreiter, like all the parents interviewed for this article, only allowed his children to use ChatGPT with his help and supervision, but as they became more enamored with the tool, his concern grew. In October 2024, news broke of a 14-year-old boy whokilled himselfafter becoming obsessed with an LLM-powered chatbot made by Character.ai. Parents of at leasttwo more teenagershavesince filed lawsuitsalleging that AI chatbots contributed to their suicides, and news reports increasingly highlight troubling tales of adults formingintense emotional attachmentsto the bots or otherwiselosing touch with reality.“The more that it became part of everyday life and the more I was reading about it, the more I realized there’s a lot I don’t know about what this is doing to their brains,” Kreiter said. “Maybe I should not have my own kids be the guinea pigs.”[My daughter] knows [ChatGPT is] not a real person, but ... it’s like a fairy that represents the internet as a wholeJoshResearch into how generative AI affects child development is in its early stages, though it builds upon studies looking at less sophisticated forms of AI, such as digital voice assistants like Alexa and Siri. Multiplestudieshave found that young children’s social interactions with AI tools differ subtly from those with humans, with children aged three to six appearing “less active” in conversations with smart speakers. This finding suggests that children perceive AI agents as existing somewhere in the middle of the divide between animate and inanimate entities, according to Ying Xu, a professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.Understanding whether an object is a living being or an artefact is an important cognitive development that helps a child gauge how much trust to place in the object, and what kind of relationship to form with it, explained Xu, whose research focuses on how AI can promote learning for children.Childrenbegin to make this distinction in infancy and usually develop a sophisticated understanding of it by age nine or 10. But while children have always imbued inanimate objects such as teddy bears and dolls with imagined personalities and capacities, at some level they know that the magic is coming from their own minds.“A very important indicator of a child anthropomorphizing AI is that they believe AI is having agency,” Xu said. “If they believe that AI has agency, they might understand it as the AIwantingto talk to them orchoosingto talk to them. They feel that the AI is responding to their messages, and especially emotional disclosures, in ways that are similar to how a human responds. That creates a risk that they actually believe they are building some sort of authentic relationship.”Inone studylooking at children aged three to six responding to a Google Home Mini device, Xu found that the majority perceived the device to be inanimate, but some referred to it as a living being, and some placed it somewhere in between. Majorities thought the device possessed cognitive, psychological and speech-related capabilities (thinking, feeling, speaking and listening), but most believed it could not “see”.Parents who spoke with the Guardian remarked upon this kind of ontological gray zone in describing their children’s interactions with generative AI. “I don’t fully know what he thinks ChatGPT is, and it’s hard to ask him,” said Kaushik of his four-year-old. “I don’t think he can articulate what he thinks it is.”Josh’s daughter refers to ChatGPT as “the internet”, as in, “I want to talk to ‘the internet’.” “She knows it’s not a real person, but I think it’s a little fuzzy,” he said. “It’s like a fairy that represents the internet as a whole.”For Kreiter, seeing his children interact with Amazon’s Alexa at a friend’s house raised another red flag. “They don’t get that this thing doesn’t understand them,” he said. “Alexa is pretty primitive compared to ChatGPT, and if they’re struggling with that … I don’t even want to go there with my kids.”A related concern is whether generative AI’s capacity to deceive children is problematic. For Kaushik, his son’s sheer joy at having spoken with what he thought was a real-life astronaut on the ISS led to a sense of unease, and he decided to explain that it was “a computer, not a person”.“He was so excited that I felt a bit bad,” Kaushik said. “He genuinely believed it was real.”John, a 40-year-old father of two from Boston, experienced a similar qualm when his son, a four-year-old in the thralls of a truck obsession, asked whether the existence of monster trucks and fire trucks implied the existence of a monster-fire truck. Without thinking much of it, John pulled up Google’s generative AI tool on his phone and used it to generate a photorealistic image of a truck that had elements of the two vehicles.When [LLMs are] latching on to negative emotion, they’re extending engagement for profit-based reasonsAndrew McStayIt was only after a pitched argument between the boy, who swore he had seen actual proof of the existence of a monster-fire truck, and his older sister, a streetwise seven-year-old who was certain that no such thing existed in the real world, that John started to wonder whether introducing generative AI into his children’s lives had been the right call.“It was a little bit of a warning to maybe be more intentional about that kind of thing,” he said. “My wife and I have talked so much more about how we’re going to handle social media than we have about AI. We’re such millennials, so we’ve had 20 years of horror stories about social media, but so much less about AI.”To Andrew McStay, a professor of technology and society at Bangor University who specializes in research on AI that claims to detect human emotions, this kind of reality-bending is not necessarily a big concern. Recalling the early moving pictures of the Lumière brothers, he said: “When they first showed people a big screen with trains coming [toward them], people thought the trains were quite literally coming out of the screen. There’s a maturing to be done … People, children and adults, will mature.”Still, McStay sees a bigger problem with exposing children to technology powered by LLMs: “Parents need to be aware that these things are not designed in children’s best interests.”Like Xu, McStay is particularly concerned with the way in which LLMs can create the illusion of care or empathy, prompting a child to share emotions – especially negative emotions. “An LLM cannot [empathize] because it’s a predictive piece of software,” he said. “When they’re latching on to negative emotion, they’re extending engagement for profit-based reasons. There is no good outcome for a child there.”Neither Xu nor McStay wants to ban generative AI for children, but they do warn that any benefits for children will only be unleashed through applications that are specifically designed to support children’s development or education.“There is something more enriching that’s possible, but that comes from designing these things in a well-meaning and sincere way,” said McStay.For an individual child, [AI] might increase their performance, but for a society, we might see a decrease of diversity in creative expressionsYing XuXu allows her own children to use generative AI – to a limited extent. Her daughter, who is six, uses theAI reading programthat Xu designed to study whether AI can promote literacy and learning. She has also set up a custom version of ChatGPT to help her 10-year-old son with math and programming problems without just giving him the answers. (Xu has explicitly disallowed conversations about gaming and checks the transcripts to make sure her son’s staying on topic.)One of the benefits of generative AI mentioned to me by parents – the creativity they believe it fosters – is very much an open question, said Xu.“There is still a debate over whether AI itself has creativity,” she said. “It’s just based on statistical predictions of what comes next, and a lot of people question if that counts as creativity. So if AI does not have creativity, is it able to support children to engage in creative play?”Arecent studyfound that having access to generative AI prompts did increase creativity for individual adults tasked with writing a short story, but decreased the overall diversity of the writers’ collective output.“I’m a little worried by this kind of homogenizing of expression and creativity,” Xu said about the study. “For an individual child, it might increase their performance, but for a society, we might see a decrease of diversity in creative expressions.”AI ‘playmates’ for kidsSilicon Valley is notorious for its willingness to prioritize speed over safety, but major companies have at times shown a modicum of restraint when it came to young children. Both YouTube and Facebook had existed for at least a decade before they launched dedicated products for under-13s (the much-malignedYouTube KidsandMessenger Kids, respectively).But the introduction of LLMs to young children appears to be barreling ahead at a breakneck pace.While OpenAI bars usersunder 13from accessing ChatGPT, and requires parental permission for teenagers, it is clearly aware that younger children are being exposed to it – and views them as a potential market.In June, OpenAI announced a “strategic collaboration” with Mattel, the toymaker behind Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. That same month, chief executive Sam Altman responded to the tale of Josh’s toddler (which went pretty viral on Reddit) with what sounded like a hint of pride. “Kids love voice mode on ChatGPT,” he said on theOpenAI podcast, before acknowledging that “there will be problems” and “society will have to figure out new guardrails.”Meanwhile, startups such as Silicon Valley-based Curio – which collaborated with the musician Grimes on anOpenAI-powered toy named Grok– are racing to stuff LLM-equipped voice boxes into plushy toys and market them to children.View image in fullscreenA child swings on a swing with Grem, a chatbot in the Grok toy line by Curio.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The Guardian(Curio’s Grok shares a name with Elon Musk’s LLM-powered chatbot, which isnotoriousfor its past promotion of Adolf Hitler and racist conspiracy theories. Grimes, who has three children with former partner Musk, wasreportedlyangered when Musk used a name she had chosen for their second child on another child, born to a different mother in a concurrent pregnancy of which Grimes was unaware. In recent months, Musk has expressed interest in creating a “Baby Grok” version of his software for children aged two to 12, according to theNew York Times.)The pitch for toys like Curio’s Grok is that they can “learn” your child’s personality and serve as a kind of fun and educational companion while reducing screen time. It is a classically Silicon Valley niche – exploiting legitimate concerns about the last generation of tech to sell the next. Company leaders have alsoreferredto the plushy as something “between a little brother and a pet” or “like a playmate” – language that implies the kind of animate agency that LLMs do not actually have.‘I love you too!’ My family’s creepy, unsettling week with an AI toyRead moreIt is not clear if they are actually good enough toys for parents to worry too much about. Xu said that her daughter had quickly relegated AI plushy toys to the closet, finding the play possibilities “kind of repetitive”. The children ofGuardianandNew York Timeswriters also voted against Curio’s toys with their feet. Guardian writer Arwa Mahdawi expressed concern about how “unsettlingly obsequious” the toy was and decided she preferred allowing her daughter to watch Peppa Pig: “The little oink may be annoying, but at least she’s not harvesting our data.” Times writer Amanda Hess similarly concluded that using an AI toy to replace TV time – a necessity for many busy parents – is “a bit like unleashing a mongoose into the playroom to kill all the snakes you put in there”.But with the market for so-called smart toys – which includes AI-powered toys, projected todoubleto more than $25bn by 2030 – it is perhaps unrealistic to expect restraint.This summer, notices seeking children aged four to eight to help “a team from MIT and Harvard” test “the first AI-powered storytelling toy” appeared in my neighborhood in Brooklyn. Intrigued, I made an appointment to stop by their offices.The product,Geni, is a close cousin to popularscreen-free audio playerssuch as Yoto and the Toniebox. Rather than playing pre-recorded content (Yoto and Tonies offer catalogs of audiobooks, podcasts and other kid-friendly content for purchase), however, Geni uses an LLM to generate bespoke short stories. The device allows child users to select up to three “tiles” representing a character, object or emotion, then press a button to generate a chunk of narrative that ties the tiles together, which is voiced aloud. Parents can also use an app to program blank tiles.Geni co-founders Shannon Li and Kevin Tang struck me as being serious and thoughtful about some of the risks of AI products for young children. They “feel strongly about not anthropomorphizing AI”, Tang said. Li said that they want kids to view Geni, “not as a companion” like the voice-box plushies, but as “a tool for creativity that they already have”.Still, it’s hard not to wonder whether an LLM can actually produce particularly engaging or creativity-sparking stories. Geni is planning to sell sets of tiles with characters they develop in-house alongside the device, but the actual “storytelling” is done by the kind of probability-based technology that tends toward the average.The story I prompted by selecting the wizard and astronaut tiles was insipid at best:They stumbled upon a hidden cave glowing with golden light.“What’s that?” Felix asked, peeking inside.“A treasure?” Sammy wondered, her imagination swirling, “or maybe something even cooler.”Before they could decide, a wave rushed into the cave, sending bubbles bursting around them.The Geni team has trained their system on pre-existing children’s content. Does using generative AI solve a problem for parents that the canon of children’s audio content cannot? When I ran the concept by one parent of a five-year-old, he responded: “They’re just presenting an alternative to books. It’s a really good example of grasping for uses that are already handled by artists or living, breathing people.”The market pressures of startup culture leave little time for such existential musings, however. Tang said the team is eager to bring their product to market before voice-box plushies sour parents on the entire concept of AI for kids.When I asked Tang whether Geni would allow parents to make tiles for, say, a gun – not a far-fetched idea for many American families – he said they would have to discuss the issue as a company.“Post-launch, we’ll probably bring on an AI ethics person to our team,” he said.“We also don’t want to limit knowledge,” he added. “As of now there’s no right or wrong answer to how much constraint we want to put in … But obviously we’re referencing a lot of kids content that’s already out there. Bluey probably doesn’t have a gun in it, right?”"

Musk owns a 42% stake in SpaceX.Tesla shares fell early this year, hit by a combination of the competitive threat from Chinese rivals, falling sales and doubts over Musk’s focus on the company, amid distractions from his other businesses and his tempestuous relationship with Donald Trump. Musk’s vocal support for Trump and expression of rightwing political views on X, the social media platform he owns, have also damaged Tesla sales,according to analysts.However, Tesla shares have climbed this year as investor sentiment improved on Musk bringing his focus back to his companies. They are now 13% higher since the start of 2025.The Tesla board chair, Robyn Denholm, said last month Musk was back “front and centre” at the company after several months at the White House.Days later, Musk disclosed his purchase of about $1bn worth of the shares in a huge vote of confidence for the future of Tesla as it races to transition from an automaker to an AI and robotics powerhouse.The Tesla board last monthproposed a $1tn compensation plan for Musk, setting out lofty financial and operational targets for the CEO while also addressing his demands for a bigger stake in the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

German troops encircle the scene.The picture taken in today’s Ukraine was long known, mistakenly, as The Last Jew in Vinnitsa, and was for decades shrouded in mystery.The US-based German historian Jürgen Matthäus has for years painstakingly assembled the puzzle pieces and, with the help of artificial intelligence, is confident he has identified the killer.Nazi Germany imposes Nuremberg Laws stripping Jews of citizenship –archive, 1935Read moreAccording to findings, he has now published in the respected academic periodical Zeitschrift für Geschichtswissenschaft (Journal of Historical Studies), the SS carried out the massacre on 28 July 1941, most likely in the early afternoon, in the citadel of Berdychiv.The city was for centuries a thriving centre of Jewish life. It is located 150km south-west of Kyiv and about 90km north of what is now known in English as Vinnytsia, which had long been considered falsely to be the site of the killings.The Einsatzgruppe C commando, one of several mobile units deployed in the newly occupied Soviet Union, had been engaged in clearing the region of “Jews and partisans” days before a visit by Adolf Hitler.Among them was Jakobus Onnen, a French, English and gym teacher born in 1906 in the German village of Tichelwarf, near the Dutch border.Matthäus described an “incremental process” of traditional digging in dusty archives, lucky breaks, input from peers and the trailblazing involvement of volunteers from open-source journalism groupBellingcat.“The match, from everything I hear from the technical experts, is unusually high in terms of the percentage the algorithm throws out there,” Matthäus said.Preliminary research published last year allowed Matthäus to reveal the date, location and unit involved in the mass shooting, generating media coverage inGermany.View image in fullscreen‘Digital tools in the humanities have massively increased in use, but it’s usually for the processing of mass data, not so much for qualitative analysis,’ Matthäus said about the potential for the use of AI in his field.Photograph: MetropolA reader came forward and said he believed, based on correspondence from the era in his family’s possession, that the gunman could be his wife’s uncle, Jakobus Onnen.Relatives had destroyed letters from the eastern front from Onnen in the 1990s. But they still had pictures of him, which the Bellingcat volunteers were able to use for an AI image analysis.“The AI experts tell me that this being a historical photo makes it more difficult to arrive at a 98 or 99.9% [match]” as often yielded in contemporary forensic work, Matthäus said.But its strong likeness, combined with a mountain of circumstantial evidence, lent him credibility to publish.“Digital tools in the humanities have massively increased in use, but it’s usually for the processing of mass data, not so much for qualitative analysis,” he said about the potential for the use of AI in his field.“This is clearly not the silver bullet – this is one tool among many. The human factor remains key.”Onnen, who had joined the Nazi party before Hitler took power in 1933, came from an educated family and in his youth enjoyed “travelling, studying languages”, Matthäus said.“Then comes his deployment in the east and obviously here he stands,” he said. “Motivation is one of the most difficult questions to answer. The reason I think why he is posing there, the way he depicts himself – I think is meant to impress.”Onnen was never promoted beyond a relatively lowly rank and was killed in battle in August 1943.“Participating in a killing like that was taken for granted and didn’t give you any kind of bonus points in these murder units,” Matthäus said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he noted that the relative who had come forward about his suspected identity had read them decades before and described them as “banal”.The origins of today’s conflict between American Jews over IsraelRead moreMatthäus was, until this spring, head of the research department of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, where he had worked since 1994.His most recent book, Gerahmte Gewalt (Framed Violence), examines the photo albums compiled by Germans on the eastern front during the second world war.He said it was “fairly certain” the image of the Berdychiv massacre, of which there are several prints, was taken by a fellow soldier and noted that such snapshots were seen as “trophies” from civilian bloodbaths.Of the estimated 20,000 Jews in Berdychiv on the Germans’ arrival in 1941, only 15 remained in early 1944, according to the news outlet Der Spiegel, which reported on the new research.“These mass executions in this format continued until the very last day of the German occupation in the east,” Matthäus said.“I think this image should be just as important as the image of the gate in Auschwitz, because it shows us the hands-on nature, the direct confrontation between killer and person to be killed.”View image in fullscreenJakobus Onnen, who had joined the Nazi party  before Hitler took power in 1933, came from an educated family.Photograph: MetropolHe said extensive visual and written evidence sent home by German soldiers debunked the myth that the population at home was unaware of the genocide happening in their name.Matthäus’s project also involves hunting for the identity of the victim in the Berdychiv photograph. He is collaborating with a Ukrainian colleague, Andrii Mahaletskyi, using Soviet-era records of local communities.AI may also prove useful in this detective work, he said, if comparable images of the man in the suit can be found.He acknowledged the difficulty of the task, noting that while the Nazis recorded names of those deported from westernEuropeto their concentration camp deaths in zealous detail, the majority of victims murdered in the east still remained nameless eight decades on.“There were more than 1 million victims in the occupied Soviet Union,” he said. “Most of them are unknown, just as the killers intended.”Explore more on these topicsSecond world warGermanyNazismArtificial intelligence (AI)PhotographyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The button I have to press to summon her is right next to the button I need to press to heal my samurai during a fight and I often fumble with my thumb and call her straight into a chaotic seven-on-one brawl. Mochizuki frequently gallops full pelt into an arrow or catches a sword-swipe from one of my outlaw enemies as I roll out of the way. Sometimes she stands on the edge of the skirmish, calmly waiting for me to finish disembowelling bad guys so that we can resume our picturesque adventures across the region of Ezo.Ghost of Yōtei is the follow-up to American studio Sucker Punch’s reverent samurai action gameGhost of Tsushima, from 2020. Most of the time it looks exceptionally well-directed, no matter what you’re doing: tense standoffs against formidable swordsmen, following a golden bird or a sprinting wolf across the landscape to find a secret natural spring or shrine, scaling a mountain to sneak your way into a tightly guarded fortress. But no open-world game’s dignified framing can survive the addition of a wayward player, and so sometimes I make it look entirely ridiculous by accidentally calling my horse into a fight, or setting myself on fire by mistake.View image in fullscreenAlong for the ride … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentI found Ghost of Tsushima to be extraordinarily beautiful, but also shallow and oddly dour. Its protagonist Jin couldn’t stop talking about how dishonourable he found the whole business of sneaking around and cutting Mongol invaders’ throats to save his island. Yōtei’s hero Atsu, meanwhile, is much more comfortable in her role as vengeful mass-murdering spectre. The story itself is hardly groundbreaking – Atsu’s family is murdered by a group of masked outlaws called the Yōtei Six, and she vows to track them down and bury them one by one – but star Erika Ishii gives such a good performance here as a stony-faced killer that I was fully drawn into Atsu’s bloody quest. No matter how many other characters sombrely remind her of the consuming of vengeance, she just keeps slicing up her enemies. You get the impression that she rather enjoys it.And honestly,Ienjoy it. The fighting in Ghost of Yōtei is deliciously brutal. Though you can carve your way through Ezo with a basic understanding of evasion, parrying and well-timed sword strikes, the frequent fighting is enlivened as you learn how to use dual katana, a spear, a bow and the oversizedōdachisword. The set-piece standoffs particularly never lost their challenge, as Atsu circles imposing generals twice her size, knowing that a few strikes are enough to finish her off. I play a lot of challenging action games, from Monster Hunter to Elden Ring, and I often find the combat in free-roaming games such as this rather unexciting. But after more than 20 hours of duels and free-for-alls, I’m still not so powerful that my foes fall before me with barely any effort – and therefore, I’m not bored.View image in fullscreenComfortable in combat … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony/Sucker PunchAlongside this year’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows (also set in historical Japan), Ghost of Yōtei is the most graphically beautiful game I have ever seen. There is such veneration in this digital tribute to Japan’s natural beauty, in the ginkgo trees and distant mountains, the sparse plains, rivers teeming with fish (you can spear them for your supper). This is a world built to be admired: you navigate with your eyes and your ears rather than an on-screen map. The wind shows you where to go to continue the story, but I truly felt free to wander, and it’s in that wandering that you find succinct side stories and moments of quiet. Charmingly, you can use the PS5’s controller to roast fish over a fire, play the shamisen or daub strokes of ink on canvas; returning to Atsu’s memories in familiar locations lets you relive her life before it was overtaken by violence.The music, which marries old west-style rhythms and traditional Japanese instruments, reminds me that this is 1600s Japan through an American lens. There’s probably more action and blood and death-defying climbing than in any samurai movie, but is that a bad thing? If anything Ghost of Tsushima was held back by its slavish devotion to a sombre tone that was at odds with the game’s very high body count. Yōtei does not overcomplicate things, as Assassin’s Creed Shadows does, with too many distractions, things to collect or people to recruit or bases to build. It is endearingly straightforward, and I found it very easy to enjoy. Whenever I was bored of pursuing one target, it was easy to find something else to do.View image in fullscreenPart of the landscape … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony/Sucker PunchAs Atsu’s legend grows, the people of Ezo start leaving offerings for the vengefulonryō(bloodthirsty ghost) tearing through the land’s oppressors. As you travel Ezo, you do begin to feel part of it, as Atsu is, joined in battle by wolves and pursuing scampering foxes to find hidden places in nature. I started to wonder what would happen to Atsu once her vengeance quest was complete: she can envision no life afterwards, and I wondered if she would simply melt into the wind that had guided her.This might be a straightforward tale at heart, but it has absorbed me more than any other historical action game. Even hours and hours in, I still feel a flicker of excitement whenever Atsu purposefully draws her sword at the beginning of a battle. I will be sad to see the end of it.Ghost of Yōtei is out now, £69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesFighting gamesAction gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The case against him is flimsy – but that’s cold comfortThu 2 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 08.42 EDTShareIn 1931, an exceptionally talented young Berlin attorney named Hans Litten summonedAdolf Hitlerto testify in a criminal case. Litten represented four victims of a brutal assault perpetrated by members of Hitler’s Sturmabteilung, or SA, on a dance hall frequented by leftist workers; by the time the assault ended,three people were dead. At trial, the defense sought to portray the SA as a disciplined political organization, under orders from Hitler to use force only as self-defense.In his three-hour cross-examination of the head of the Nazi party, Litten managed what precious few dared to attempt. Hitler had expected the young lawyer to be intimidated; instead, Litten aggressively and skillfully dissected him under oath, reducing the supposedly gifted orator to a stammering rage. In trapping Hitler in contradictions and exposing him as an inveterate liar, Litten also made clear the Nazis’ goal of destroying the Weimar Republic. Hitler left the witness stand rattled and humiliated, henceforth forbidding Litten’s name to be uttered in his presence.Hitler’s revenge came two years later, barely a month after he had been installed in power. In the wake of theReichstag fire– an arson attack on the parliament building – and relying on a hastily drafted emergency decree for the “protection of people and state”, Hitler ordered the arrest and “protective custody” of numerous perceived political enemies, including Litten. Over the next five years, as he was shuttled from concentration camp to concentration camp, Litten was repeatedly beaten and tortured. In 1938, with no prospect of release, he took his own life. His crime: trying to protect the role of law and a constitutional democracy from a would-be authoritarian.The United States in 2025 is not Germany in 1933. That said, Litten’s experience has a disturbingly familiar ring. Last week, the US attorney’s office for the eastern district of Virginia (EDVA) announced that the former FBI director James Comey had been indicted for allegedlylying under oath to a congressional committee. The case against Comey is so flimsy that Erik Siebert, Trump’s hand-picked chief federal prosecutor for the post, balked at filing charges. Siebert’sfair assessment predictably earned him the ire of the president. “I want him out,” Trump fumed, and soSiebert resignedbefore he could be fired, vacating the position he had occupied for barely eight months.Trump hastily named a replacement: Lindsey Halligan, a member of Trump’s coterie of personal lawyers who now occupy some of the most pivotal positions within the Department of Justice. Never mind that Halligan hasno prior prosecutorial experienceand that the head of the EDVA oversees the prosecution of many of the nation’s most complicated and sensitive cases involving national security and financial crimes; Halligan’s great qualification was apparently her willingness to do what Siebert would not: indulge Trump’s hankering for revenge. Her indictment of Comey, handed down scant days before the five-year statute of limitations on the alleged crimes was to expire, only confirmed Siebert’s doubts. Law students invariably learn the old canard that any decent prosecutor can get a grand jury “to indict a ham sandwich” – but maybe not Halligan: the grandjury refused to indicton one of the three counts that the prosecutor submitted.Trump greeted the news of the two-count indictment by crowing on Truth Social: “JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” – which might be an apt, if inadvertently Orwellian, description of the present state of the rule of law in our nation. The case is certainly about score-settling, but it’s also far more disturbing than that. Let’s assume for the moment that Trump was unfairly targeted for investigation during his first term; it would still be unseemly for a sitting president to respond to one injustice with another. But the fact is that the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election – the source of Trump’s crusade against Comey – was not a politically motivated “witch-hunt” (Trump’s favorite go-to term of impugnment to discredit attempts to hold him to account). Instead, it revealed a “sweeping and systematic” campaign to interfere with the 2016 election.Comey’s true “crime” recalls Hans Litten’s. He dared to show fidelity to his office and to the law, and not to the Great Leader. This is not to say that Comey risks sharing the fate of the intrepid German lawyer. In publicly declaring Comey “guilty as hell” and in transparently interfering in the legal process, Trump has handed the judge a reason to simply dismiss the case as an exercise in vindictive prosecution. Should Comey go to trial, the case’s obvious weaknesses might well result in an acquittal. And even if Comey were to be convicted and sent to prison, the US does not, at present, operate a system of concentration camps where political opponents face systematic torture.But that is cold comfort. The fact remains that Comey is being persecuted, not prosecuted, for putting service to the nation above obedience to a man. As if following a script from the authoritarian playbook, Trump is making Comey pay for his act of constitutional fidelity. What should disturb all Americans is the ease with which Trump, aided by his craven and opportunistic legal lackeys, has turned the proudly independent justice department into a tool of authoritarian consolidation.Lawrence Douglas teaches at Amherst College.

But many of those discussing the league denigrate its players while not bothering to watch the action itselfThu 2 Oct 2025 07.18 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 07.19 EDTShare“Under the Trump administration, we will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure, and cheat our women and our girls.”– Donald Trump during the signing of hisKeeping Men Out of Women’s Sportsexecutive order, 5 February 2025“Our girls”. The line lands like parody. Grotesque and striking. A president whosepolicies have regularly harmed women, positioning himself as guardian of “our girls”.That’s the absurd theater of American politics in 2025: women’s sports as shield and sword in a fight that has little to do with athletics. What’s become clear is that the Maga movement doesn’t love women’s sports; it loves them as a proxy. It’s a stage where old fears about gender and power can be reenacted, shorthand in a culture war that has nothing to do with the quality of the hoops being played.And the WNBA – whose finals start on Friday as theLas Vegas Acesface the Phoenix Mercury – keeps getting dragged into the trenches. Players are sick of it. A’ja Wilson said it bluntly: “People love to use us as an example, as a punchline, but they don’t actually watch us play.” Debates over trans athletes, Caitlin Clark getting fouled or “protecting” women’s sports rarely include the voices of the women actually playing.When those voices are ignored, the vacuum fills with nonsense. And rather than protecting women’s sports – or even helping by increasing funding in high schools or social teams – much of the right seems to want to rip it down. Take, for example, rightwing voices such as Clay Travis and Tomi Lahren,who have both backedthe Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports bill. They believe women should be protected in sports,yet laughedwhen sex toyswere thrown on to courtsduring WNBA games this season. (The players did not find it amusing, nor presumably did the 12-year-old girlwho was hit by one of the toys.)No one comes to watch the referees. But in the WNBA, they’re the story | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreTravis is particularly egregious. Despite his concern for female athletes, in 2023he said he’d bet $1mthat a good boys’ high school state champion would “absolutely smoke” the WNBA champs. There was no payout, only noise from a dying radio. That clip was circulated across conservative media and became a talking point, hardening into ideology. This type of discourse doesn’t protect or elevate female athletes, it diminishes them.My regret is that I fell for the poison myself as a kid. My dad – not a cruel man, or some armchair critic (he played ball in New York playgrounds and more than held his own) – held the same views as Travis when it came to the abilities of WNBA players. He’d absorbed it, the way so many men did, and passed it down to me without thinking. This happens everywhere:on message boardsas farback as 2009, when 25,000 anonymous avatars on TexAgs bickered into the void on the subject. My sadness is that my pops diminished the women’s game and didn’t even realize he was repeating someone else’s sneer. The sadness is increased by knowing that the strongest person I knew – physically and mentally – was my mom.Why not just celebrate what it takes to play at the pro level? Judging the women’s game as “less than” simply because it doesn’t look like the NBA or men’s college ball misses the point entirely. The measure should be the quality of execution, the intelligence of the playmaking, the creative ways women bend the game around their skills. When you separate it from those comparisons, you see theWNBAfor what it is: elite hoops, defined by its own standards.Besides, the older I got, the more ball I watched, the absurdity became clear: 90% of high school players are awkward, maladroit, and done with organized basketball after graduation. The WNBA, meanwhile, demands refinement: passing, shooting, dribbling at an elite level. Obviously, men are naturally bigger and stronger on average. But the gap between grown women who play professionally and a teenage team with maybe two decent players isn’t what detractors pretend it is. The difference? A lifetime of work and players that don’t rely solely on strength and height (although there is plenty of that in the WNBA too).While conservatives are stuck rehashing the same tired hypotheticals, the women’s game has been evolving right in front of them. A decade ago, WNBA teams averaged around 15 three-pointers a game;today, many launch closerto 25–30, with efficiency climbing alongside. The three-point revolution has transformed how the league is played, bridging gaps between male and female playing styles and showcasing the league’s malleability.That’s what always struck me about the “protect women’s sports” crowd: they don’t actually watch the games.Gallupfound 90% of Republicans (and 40% of Democrats) say trans athletes should only play on teams that match their birth sex. YetS&P Globalreports a stranger truth: only 18% of adults follow women’s sports, period. Men make up themajority of WNBA viewership, but the ones watching aren’t the ones using it for political dunking. If they were, they wouldn’t denigrate these women like they are.The hypocrisy is astounding, especially by those who constantly call to keep sports separate by gender. As Ebony Dumas, a former Division I college baller, and one of the most incisive voices on WNBA X, told me: “The W has always been rooted in fundamentals and old-school basketball principles – that’s what separates it from the NBA. They don’t rely solely on athleticism. The midrange is still a key part of the game, and the intensity on both ends is non-negotiable.”And people are watching. WNBA viewershiphit a record high this season. The 2024 NCAA women’s finaloutdrew the men’s. Merchandise flew, and screens lit up, proof that the interest isn’t just on TV but in how fans show up for the game. And still,the critics said no one watched. And still,the critics said no one cared.The disconnect between the league’s tangible growth and how it’s still talked about runs deep. Instead of celebrating increased competition, the yapping too often reduces women’s basketball to lazy hypotheticals. Ordismal commentsabout race and sexuality. The charade obscures reality: the WNBA isexpanding to the Bay AreaandTorontoand strikingricher media deals.That’s the backdrop for Trump’s line about “protecting our girls.” It isn’t protection – it’s projection. He isn’t defending the WNBA athletes selling out arenas. He’s defending a chimera, a stage where women’s sports are props in a never-ending grievance play.Meanwhile, the league burns on. The ball is moving, the threes are falling, the athletes are evolving in ways no hypothetical could capture. And the more politicians and pundits posture about “our girls,” the more obvious the gap becomes between their culture-war theater and the women actually out there hooping.There is no “our girls” and “your girls”. There’s just game.Explore more on these topicsWNBALas Vegas AcesBasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s cheap humour, rage bait – and now, it seems, US government policyRobert TopinkaDonald Trump’s White House reveals a new ‘portrait’ of Joe Biden – and in his world, if you don’t laugh, the joke’s on youThu 2 Oct 2025 06.31 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 11.25 EDTShareOn 24 September, a White House communications adviser posted a video on X of a new presidential Walk of Fame, captioned: “Wait for it”, with a pen and eyes emoji. The video pans over a succession of presidential portraits to reveal – in place of Joe Biden’s portrait – a framedphotograph of an autopensigning his name. The sight-gag references the Maga conspiracy theory that, unbeknownst to “Sleepy Joe”, unscrupulous aides used the autopen to sign pardons in his name. The post delighted supporters and outraged critics, which only further delighted supporters.And that was precisely the point. This combination of cheap humour and rage bait is the province of the shitpost, a genre oflow-effort social media contentdesigned to amuse insiders and annoy outsiders. Like so much of internet culture, shitposting was pioneered on the message board 4chan – but Donald Trump is a natural. On the 12th anniversary of 9/11,he tweeted: “I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th.” The shitpost forces a choice: undermine public decorum by laughing along, or get offended, outing yourself as a hater and a loser.The deliberate impropriety of the shitpost makes good-faith engagement impossible. Like a children’s game of made you look, responding means either sinking to the level of the shitpost or looking ridiculous by responding earnestly to a low-effort provocation, which only proves the shitpost has had its intended effect.Refusing to abide by discursive norms can signal a refusal to abide by political norms. After Trump dubbed him “Low Energy” Jeb Bush during the 2016 Republican primaries, the more professorial younger brother of George W Bush made the mistake of arguing that he was, in fact, dynamic and busy, as if Trump were making a political claim that could be contested. But this was nicknaming as shitposting. Instead of clever metaphors, Trump’s nicknames are low-effort direct literalisms. From “Little Marco” Rubio to “No Talent” Jimmy Kimmel, their purpose is not to make a substantive claim or offer an accurate description of reality, but to titillate allies and bait enemies.Unencumbered by the establishment strategists who urged decorum during his first administration, Trump has elevated shitposting to a national strategy in his second term. Two days before the Walk of Fame announcement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)posted a videoof masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents hauling civilians into unmarked vans, cut to the opening credits of the Pokémon television series. As the theme song’s refrain has it: “Gotta Catch ’Em All”.On 4chan, home to the small but significant crossover ofanime fans and the extreme right, posters debated whether the video was “based” (internet slang meaning authentically cool and irreverent) or “cringe” (shamefully straining for the approval the “based” attain with ease). But the real target audience was liberals outraged not only by state violence but by its shameless public celebration. If the right dominates meme culture, it is less because the “left can’t meme” than because it is far easier to “own the libs” who remain committed to rational political discourse. Where liberals seek earnest debate, the shitpost offers a polemic without a point, an opportunity to indulge in cruelty.At best, shitposts function as satire. Thehopecoregenre on TikTok combines motivational speeches with slideshows of mountain lakes and island sunsets over a soundtrack of atmospheric strings and lo-fi guitar scales.Hopeless coreshitposts adopt the same format but with comedically clumsy speeches that render the inspirational slideshow absurd, mocking the vacuousness of online inspo culture. A day after the Pokémon shitpost, the DHS turned hopeless core satire into a schoolyard taunt, posting a clip ofpodcast broTheo Von saying, in his trademark laconic style, “Heard you got deported dude – bye” followed by Ice arrest videos cut to a soundtrack of reverb-soaked introspective guitar scales. The DHS deleted the post over Von’s objections, but just as “Low Energy” Jeb’s protests guaranteed his nickname would stick, Von’s complaint only attracted more attention to the video.In recent days, the vice president, JD Vance, hascalled oneprominent liberal pundit a “dipshit” and told critics to “go straight to hell”. Vance is too much of a try-hard to succeed as a shitposter, but his comments revel in the chaos shitposting creates. This chaos can have dire consequences. The 2019 Christchurch mosque shooter described his attack as moving fromshitposting to effort posting,by which he meant from trolling to taking meaningful action. But political violence itself has begun taking the form of the shitpost. Charlie Kirk’s assassin inscribed a furry memeto bait newscastersinto reading it aloud, and friends of the Dallas ICE facility shooterdescribed him asan “edgelord” and speculated that he signed a bullet “anti-Ice” as an irony-poisoned provocation. Liberal encomiums to civil discourse can feel pious, but as shitposting stretches public decorum to breaking point, what remains is an incoherent politics of cruelty that licenses outrage for its own sake.Robert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of LondonExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsInternetTikTokDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

They should use itRobert ReichThe government has effectively been shut down since Trump returned to office, as officials clamp down on work they opposeThu 2 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 12.24 EDTShareThe United States government is officially closed.Starting on Wednesday at 12.01am Washington time, the federal government ran out of money.Agencies and departments designed to protect consumers, workers and investors are now officially closed, as are national parks and museums.Most federal workers are not being paid –as many as 750,000could be furloughed – including those who are required to remain on the job, like air-traffic controllers or members of the US military.So-called “mandatory” spending, including Social Security and Medicare payments, are continuing, although checks could be delayed. The construction of Trump’s new White House ballroomwon’t be affected.Shutdowns are symptoms of a government off the rails.I’ve been directly involved in two, one when I was secretary of labor. It’s hard for me to describe the fear, frustration and chaos that ensued. I recall spending the first day consoling employees – many in tears as they headed out the door.There have been eight shutdowns since 1990. Trump has nowpresided over four.But this shutdown is different.For one thing, it’s the consequence of a decision, made in July by Trump and Senate Republicans, to pass Trump’s gigantic “big beautiful bill” (which I prefer to term “the big ugly” bill) without any Democratic votes.They could do that because of an arcane Senate procedure called “reconciliation”, which allowed the big ugly to get through with just 51 votes rather than the normal 60 required to overcome a filibuster.The final tally was a squeaker. All Senate Democrats opposed the legislation. When three Senate Republicans joined them, JD Vance was called in to break a tie. Some Republicans bragged that they didn’t need a single Democrat.The big ugly fundamentally altered the priorities of the United States government. Itcut about $1tnfrom healthcare programs, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, meaning that health insurance premiums for tens of millions of Americans will soar starting in January.The big ugly also cut nutrition assistance and environmental protection, while bulking up immigration enforcement and cutting the taxes of wealthy Americans and big corporations.Trump and Senate Republicans didn’t need a single Democratthen.But this time, Republicans couldn’t use the arcane reconciliation process to pass a bill to keep the government going.Now they needed Senate Democratic votes.Yet keeping the government going meant keeping all the priorities included in the big ugly bill that all Senate Democrats opposed.Which is why Senate Democrats refused to sign on unless most of the big ugly’s cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act were restored, so health insurance premiums won’t soar next year.Even if Senate Democrats had obtained that concession, the Republican bill to keep the government going would retain all the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations contained in the big ugly, along with all the cuts in nutrition assistance, and all the increased funding for immigration enforcement.There’s a deeper irony here.As a practical matter, the US government has been “shut down” for more than eight months, since Trump took office this second time.Trump and the sycophants surrounding him, such as Russell Vought, the director of the office of management and budget, and, before him, Elon Musk, have had no compunction about shutting down parts of the government they don’t like – such as USAID.They’ve alsomoved to fire, furlough or extend buyouts tohundreds of thousands of federal employeesdoing work they don’t value, such as those working at theConsumer Financial Protection Bureauand theCorporation for Public Broadcasting.They’veimpounded appropriationsfrom Congress for activities they oppose, ranging across the entire federal government.On the first day of the shutdown, Vought announced that the administrationwas freezing $18bnthat Congress had appropriated for funding infrastructure in New York City (home to the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and the House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries).All of this is illegal, but it seems unlikely that courts will act soon enough to prevent the administration from harming vast numbers of Americans.Vought threatened to permanentlyfire more federal employeesif the Democrats didn’t vote to continue funding the government. But nothing stopped Vought from doing it before the shutdown, and the shutdown presents no greater opportunity for him to do so.In fact, the eagerness of Trump and his lapdogs over the last eight months to disregard the will of Congress and close whatever they want of the government offers another reason why Democrats shouldn’t have caved in.Had Democrats voted to keep the government going, what guarantee would they have had that Trump would in fact keep the government going?Democrats finally have some bargaining leverage. They should use it.If tens of millions of Americans lose their health insurance starting in January because they can no longer afford to pay sky-high premiums, Trump and his Republicans will be blamed.It would be Trump’s and his Republicans fault anyway – it’s part of their big ugly bill – but this way, in the fight over whether to reopen the government, Americans will have a chance to see Democrats standing up for them.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Their leaders urgently need to face reality, tooThu 2 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 04.46 EDTShareFascism is supposed to look a certain way: black-clad, uniformed, synchronised and menacing. It is not supposed to look like an overweight president whocan’t pronounce acetaminophenand who bumbles, for a full minute, about how he would have renovated the UN’s New York headquarters withmarble floors, rather than a terrazzo. But as Umberto Eco remarked in histimeless essayon identifying the eternal nature of fascism: “Life is not that simple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises.”Historians,scholarsandeven some insidersfrom the first Trump administration have seen through the comedic quality of the disguise. They appear to have seen in Donald Trump himself and those around him, Eco’s core criteria: the call to tradition and the rejection of reason, the fear of difference, the hostility towards disagreement, the ressentiment, the machismo, the degradation of language into newspeak, the cult of a “strong” leader. Almost a year ago, the historian Robert Paxton, in explaining why he hadchanged his mindabout employing the word to describe Trumpism, remarked: “It’s bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that’s very much like the original fascisms. It’s the real thing. It really is.”Since then, the Trump administration has deployed the US military and National Guard to cities against the will of their state governors. It has put pressure on state legislatures todisenfranchise opposition votersin extraordinary ways, and floated the idea of disenfranchising all voters residing outside the US by ending mail-in voting. It has used the power of the state tocensor books, bully the media and “cancel” comedians who regularly make fun of Trump. It hasseized executive powerin alarming and potentially illegal ways, including the use oftariffs, immigration policy and targeted exemptions to generate subservience among powerful corporate actors.An over-fixation on whether actions are legal or not misses the forest for the trees: constitutionality is, practically speaking, whatever the supreme court decides. If the supreme court acquiesces to fundamental changes in the nature of what the US is, that is merely one more sign of how deep the rot goes. And fromconcrete policyto the decision topublicly venerate the Confederacy, the intended direction of travel is clear.The disguise dropped a little bit more, in the aftermath ofCharlie Kirk’s murder– one more tragic datapoint in the merging of the US’s epidemic of gun violence and its growingpolitical violence. At his strange funeral-rally-spectacle, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, gavea speechdripping with everything Ecosought to warn us against, raging against a diffuse “they” who “cannot conceive of the army they have arisen in all of us”. “You are nothing,” Miller continued. “You have nothing. You are wickedness. You are jealousy. You are envy. You are hatred. You are nothing. You can build nothing. You can produce nothing.”In the past year, as Trump and those behind him have dismantled the institutions of US democracy with incredible speed, the European conversation finally moved from denial to attempts at bargaining, with some acceptance of US disengagement and disinterest going forward. But there has been almost no space for a high-level, public conversation about what to do when the US government is, for the foreseeable future, in the hands of actors hostile to the EU’s basic raison d’être and its values.I understand why European leaders don’t want to have this conversation openly with voters. They fear that alienating Trump, even slightly, will lead him to drop US support for Ukraine. The cleverest think they can buy time by flattering Trump, manipulating him just long enough to find a better footing, while the blindly optimistic look to the 2026 midterms as an inflection point, and some sort of “return to normal”. But the midterms will not save us. As the Democrats’ elections attorney Marc Eliaslaid out in detailfor The New Yorker, the 2026 elections will probably not be wholly free and fair, and even where they are, Trump’s prior history of insurrection indicates that the results very well might not be honoured. And Trump is already laying the groundwork to drop Ukrainefully into Europe’s lap.During the first Trump administration, we heard, ad nauseam, that he should be taken seriously, but not literally. It was a mistake then, and it’s a mistake now. When Trumpsays, “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them”, we in Europe (“a foe,”remember?) should take him literally. The radical authoritarian agenda the Trump administration is pursuing domestically matters to Europe.

Not least, because the Trump administration is engaged ina culture war against Europe, promoting forces that seek to destroy it as it currently exists.European voters are out in front of the politicians on this one. Thespring Eurobarometer surveyshowed that large majorities of citizens want the EU to protect them from crises and security risks, think the EU needs more financial means to do so, and support that new funding coming from the EU as a whole, rather than member states alone. A survey of the EU’s five biggest states, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland,foundthat 52% think the EU was humiliated in the recent trade deal with the US. They blame the commission for not “defending” Europe more ardently, witha strong minority of 39%wanting the bloc to become more “oppositional” to Trump.Timothy Garton Ash recently gave Americans400 days to save their democracy.

You also won’t meet someone whodoesn’tgo to the theatre regularly who doesn’t have an opinion on theatre etiquette. We all love to police the behaviours of others in any space we come together in.WhenPatti LuPonetold off a patron for using their phone in the theatre, the news reverberated around the world. When the stage musical Wicked was adapted into a movie, there was a movement on TikTok ticking off fans who dared to sing while watching.In my own networks, when theatre etiquette is mentioned I’ve discovered that everything from opening a lolly to daring to wear jeans is among the grievances of the theatre police.The end of Meanjin after 85 years is as sad as it is infuriating | Ben WalterRead moreI’m a playwright. Most of my living is earned from a percentage of tickets sold to see my shows, which means bums on seats is everything. The more bums on seats, the more likely I am to not have to call the bank that month and ask for an extension on my mortgage payment.I want everyone to feel welcome, and comfortable, in the theatres my plays are on. I don’t care what they wear. If they need to suck a lolly to get through the play? Go for it. I’d prefer if you turned your phone off in the first place, but if you forget and it goes off … just turn it off now, please, so it disturbs as little of the performance as possible. No one’s going to die because Janet’s husband’s calling her to find out where his glasses are.See, opening a Mintie or a phone going off is the least of theatres’ worries.For those of us on the inside of making theatre, there’s before the pandemic and after the pandemic began. We haven’t recovered the audiences, and the costs of making theatre have increased and so have tickets.During the pandemic lockdowns – which technically was years ago – we were forced to stay inside and consume our entertainment on our phones and laptops. Lying under a doona, you could wear a tracksuit and open the loudest lolly bag there is and no one turned around and shushed you. Hell, when you’re watching something at home you can scroll on your device while on a loudspeaker call without fear of LuPone snatching the phone out of your hand.This, and the cost-of-living crisis, means leaving the house is a big deal, and an expensive one: paying for a ticket, paying for dinner, paying for a babysitter, negotiating where to find a parking spot near the theatre that won’t incur a fine.I haven’t always been as chilled a theatre-maker. But everything changed for me because of A43.A43 is a seat in the front row of the theatre most of my plays have started their lives in. EnsembleTheatreis a small artistic enclave within a pretty well-heeled part of Sydney. I’ve always wondered if there’s some sort of magical dust from the lighting rig above A43 because whoever is sitting in the seat will fall asleep, into a slumber Snow White and the manufacturers of sleeping pills would be envious of. Curse the dark magic that puts people to sleep in A43 (we’re a superstitious lot, we theatre people).Any reasonable gig-goer knows that dancing is part of the show. So why are some people such anti-boogie bummers? | Zoya PatelRead moreThen came a summer matinee where everything changed.I was sitting on the opposite seating bank to A43. A woman limped into the seat. There was no way to tell her age but what I could tell was that she was really sick. Her face was pale and she moved very, very slowly. She looked as if she didn’t have a lot of time left. She took her seat, A43.And, as with anyone who sits in A43, she fell asleep. She woke up every now and then, enjoyed a bit of the show, and fell asleep again.I watched her for the whole show and, when the show ended, she woke up and applauded with all she had. And with that, she’d made a different theatre-maker out of me.When I’m sick, I can’t be bothered going to the lounge room and switching on the telly. This woman had got out of bed on a 35C day, had a shower, put some nice clothes on and got herself to the theatre. She’d made a huge effort to be there. And to me, that’s everything.So while we can bitch and moan about what someone’s wearing, complain when they accidentally leave their phone on, and when they loudly chew some Smarties, I’m absolutely stoked they’ve made the effort to be there.Most people are at home scrolling through their phone.Melanie Tait is a playwright and journalist living in SydneyExplore more on these topicsStageOpinionTheatrecommentShareReuse this content"

Collapses in popularity, huge dilemmas about public spending, foreign policy emergencies, poll surges by opponents and the prospect of losing office: all can persuade even previously cautious administrations to change their direction and rhetoric – or simply say more clearly why they are in power.Politicians sometimes enjoy being bolder. Commonly seen as always calculating and never spontaneous, some are in fact relieved to stop filtering their public words and finally speak their minds. At theLabour conference this week, fringe meetings were refreshingly, sometimes startlingly, full of ministers, MPs and recent government advisers talking frankly about the government’s problems and the toxicity of modern politics.Even the business secretary, Peter Kyle, usually slick and studiedly unflustered, admitted at an event hosted byLabourTogether that “the public know that we have a big problem in the economy”, and that “our politics is going through turmoil”. After 15 months of governing as if it had enough time and public attention to be understated and methodical, Labour is switching to a more urgent, potentially more realistic approach.The most renowned example of a British government using crises to reinvent itself remains Margaret Thatcher’s. At a similar stage in its life, in 1981, it had lostover a thirdof its original support. Like Keir Starmer’s government, it was struggling to revive the economy, control inflation, raise taxes and prevent riots. Then Argentina recklesslyinvaded the Falklands in 1982, and Thatcher was handed an opportunity to relaunch her premiership as a shameless but powerful patriotic project.While there were endless flags and patriotic phrases at Labour conference, a conveniently symbolic and winnable war feels unlikely in today’s more heavily armed and geopolitically chaotic world. And Starmer is arguably in an even bigger hole than Thatcher in 1981. It’s constantly pointed out far how Labour’s poll ratings have fallen since the election,from 34%toabout 20%, yet it’s less remembered that during the campaign’s first days, in May 2024,Labour was at 45%. Its decline may well be unprecedented, in rapidity and scale, in the history of elected British governments.Was this Starmer’s best speech? Yes. But he’ll need a new battle plan to convince a doubting Britain | Martin KettleRead moreLabour’s crisis of electoral, moral and financial credibility is now causing what used to be a heavily disciplined party to criticise itself, in ways that could help save the government – or hasten its end.Andy Burnham’s callfor a more leftwing but also more broad-church administration dominated conversations in the queues for conference events, despite all the confident assurances from Starmer loyalists that the mayor of Greater Manchester had blown his leadership chances.Yet away from his packed fringe appearances there were many other, more surprising, would-be tellers of home truths. The recently elected MP for Bassetlaw, Jo White, called the energy secretary Ed Miliband’s promise that clean power would reduce energy bills within a few years “complete nonsense” – ignoring his high standing with environmentalists and Labour members.At the same event, Peter Hyman, until last year a key Starmer adviser, said that the current “age of insecurity” could not be countered by a government offering “security” – a political theme long favoured by Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves – because voters no longer believe politicians can provide it. Instead, Hyman argued, the government should ensure that voters were “tooled up” with the skills to cope with an ultra-competitive, unstable world.Fringe speakers elsewhere offered more leftwing diagnoses and solutions. The MP for Pendle and Clitheroe, Jonathan Hinder, part of the socially conservative, economically interventionist Blue Labour group, said that the government should stop “the looting of our common assets” by privatised utilities and private contractors for public services. “Working-class voters have leftwing economic values,” he said, and the government should favour “labour over capital”. Even during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, supposedly erased from Labour’s consciousness, it was rare to hear such blunt pro-worker language.What might emerge from the party’s candid and confrontational new mood? The belated but welcomeattacks on Reform UK by Starmerand his ministers suggest that the switch is not just a fleeting fashion from the conference fringe. But there is a risk that the new mix of policies and stances – more egalitarian economic rhetoric, yet continuing deference towards the financial markets; anti-racism, yet growing authoritarianism towards immigrants – will simply produce a mess.As someone who arrived in the intensely tribal House of Commons relatively late in life, whose personal history features both deprivation and privilege, and who believes in competence rather than ideology, Starmer has a tendency to be both leftwing and rightwing at the same time. That’s not necessarily a weakness. Many voters haveeclectic and contradictory politics. But often, “to govern is to choose”, as the 1950s French prime minister Pierre Mendès-France pithily put it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another will be next May’s elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and many English mayoralties and councils, when the party’s remaining strongholds will need a coherent and highly focused Labour campaign if they are not to fall. “Across this country,” saidthe new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, in her conference speech, “people feel like things are spinning out of control.”If Labour fails to produce such a campaign in only seven months’ time, then panic may set in, and the ferment at this week’s conference fringe may turn out to have been the first phase of a post-Starmer age. As well as Burnham’s leadership ambitions, the conference was also shadowed by the likely aspirations of Mahmood, Kyle, the health secretary,Wes Streeting, and Angela Rayner, whose fall from prominence already feels temporary.Whether under Starmer or someone else, it’s possible that more frankness and open-mindedness will save the government, rather than make it look fatally divided. This week at least, his premiership seems energised. Labour does have some decent policies, and most of his potential successors are strong communicators. With the Conservatives weaker than for decades, and Reform with no experience of waiting for and then contesting a general election as favourites – as its thin-skinned response to Labour’s attacks is showing – it may be less difficult for Labour to get re-elected than seems the case now.But after 14 years of often disastrous Tory government, and with many voters still wanting a broadly left-of-centre country, squeezing back in for a second term would not be a triumph for Labour.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025OpinionKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

He must assert himself – and goThu 2 Oct 2025 09.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 11.12 EDTShareNo sooner has Keir Starmer reshuffled his cabinet, pronounced on Reform’s racist policies andmade his party conference speech, than another key decision comes hurtling towards him. But this one concerns the future of the world. The issue is whether the prime minister attends the UN climate summitin Brazil next month.You may think this would not require too much thought. Two years ago, Starmerattacked Rishi Sunakfor not going to a much less significant climate meeting and said that, were he prime minister, he would definitely attend.TheCop30 leaders’ summitin the Amazonian city of Belém on 6-7 November is the most important since the historic Paris Cop of 2015. But thelatest reports suggestthat Starmer’s political aides do not want him to go. They apparently think that Labour’s Reform-minded voters do not care much about the climate crisis and feel he spends too much time abroad. Meanwhile, Starmer’s foreign policy advisers point to Donald Trump’s mendacious attack on climate change science and policy at the UNlast weekand say it would look terrible for Starmer to stay away.With Kemi Badenochhaving vowedto scrap the 2008 Climate Change Act – one of the last Labour government’s greatest achievements, copied all over the world – Starmer cannot afford to go soft on his own oft-expressed climate commitments.President Lula of Brazil has deliberately called this leaders’ summit a few days before the start of the conference, with the express purpose of getting governments to renew their commitment to multilateral climate action.Lula knows he has a problem. Cop30 is one of those once-every-five-years moments under the Paris agreement when countries must bring their new climate targets, so-callednationally determined contributionsor NDCs. But we already know that the NDCs are not strong enough to achieve theParis goalsof holding global warming to 1.5C or 2C above preindustrial levels.Last week the world’s largest carbon polluter, China,announced its new targets. President Xi Jinping said China would cut its emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035. But this is far from thecut of 30% over 2021 levelswhich analysts believe would be consistent with a global path to net zero after 2050. For the EU, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, confirmed that the EU will cut its emissions by somewhere between 66% and 72% on 1990 levels by 2035 – but opposition from key member states left her unable to commit to the higher figure.The UK’s NDCwas announced a year ago at Cop29 by Ed Miliband. Aiming to cut nationally produced emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels by 2035, the UK’s target is one of the few which analysts say is consistent with a global 1.5C pathway.After Cop30, the UN will publish an official assessment adding up all the NDCs. But after China’s announcement, we know that the world will be heading for much more than 2C of warming –probably closer to 2.5C. And we know that at these temperatures there will be catastrophic impacts on species extinctions, sea level rise, water scarcity and extreme weather events.So Cop30 has a huge task: to get the world back on track to 1.5/2C. The only problem is that it can’t do this. The Paris agreement was a compromise between collective agreement on climate goals and “nationally determined contributions” to achieve them. The clue is in the name: these are not subject to scrutiny or criticism by anyone else. The “emissions gap” will not even be on the formal conference agenda. China, India and Saudi Arabia are insisting that the Paris agreementforbids negotiatorsfrom discussing it.This is why the leaders’ summit is so crucial. Lula and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, want leaders to acknowledge that their NDCs are collectively not enough.Lula has some specific proposals. He wants to create a more streamlinedUN climate council. He has put forward an innovative scheme for financing ahalt to tropical deforestation. His team is working on a UN-mandated “roadmap” to show how an annual $1.3tn (£950bn) of climate finance for developing countries can be achieved by 2035. None of this will happen if leaders don’t even attend the summit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Setting out a vision of uncurtailed US power, he shunned the UN principle of multilateral cooperation to tackle shared problems. Yet action on the climate crisis perhaps most demands this principle. Not just because global warming knows no boundaries, but because the Paris agreement is one of the few examples of successful UN action.Before Cop15 in Copenhagen in 2009, the world was on a path to around6C of warming. Due to the commitments made there, by Cop21 in Paris in 2015 this was down to around 4C. Since then, after 10 years of astonishing reductions in the cost of solar and wind energy and electric vehicles, it is nowcloser to 2.5C. That is huge progress – because countries do follow the decisions they make together under the UN system, and because a global green energy transition is already under way. It is not enough progress – but it is quite wrong to say that the UN system is not working.But it now faces its biggest ever challenge. Time is rapidly running out to get back on a 1.5C/2C pathway. If world leaders cannot agree in Belém, this will not just be a diplomatic disaster. The world’s business and finance leaders will conclude that governments are not after all serious about climate action. So they will scale down their decarbonisation plans, just as they did after the perceived failure of Copenhagen in 2009. Emissions reductions will slow. The whole global effort to arrest the process of climate change, painfully constructed over the past quarter-century, could begin to unravel.Trump will not be in Belém. But you can be sure he will be posting messages on social media throughout the summit. If leaders do not show up, he will gleefully boast that without even being there he has defeated the Paris agreement and the entire, woke “con” of the so-called climate crisis. It would be odd if Starmer decided to support him by also staying away.Michael Jacobs is professor of political economy at the University of Sheffield and a visiting senior fellow at the thinktank ODI GlobalExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionCop30Climate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

Now, I’m doing it again,and it’s Charing Cross police station. Again. I appeared on the BBC PanoramaUndercover in the Policeprogramme. I thought long and hard about taking partin this documentary, after the hatred and threats I received last year after I spoke as part of another BBC documentary.But I felt that, given the programme’s importance and everything it was trying to uncover, I just had to take part. Plus, I couldn’t let the haters win.Three years ago, I was director for London at theIndependent Office for Police Conduct, where my teams had done an incredible job investigating misconduct inside Charing Cross police station. The subsequent report uncovered victims of racism and abuse who were themselves serving officers. It also uncovered a toxic culture of misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, homophobia and ableism. Yes, really.Alongside the recommendations we made to the Met to ensure this didn’t happen again, I made the decision to publish theWhatsApp messagesunredacted. That wasn’t an easy decision, but I wanted to ensure that members of the public and other serving officers understood what discrimination actually looked like – and what their colleagues suffered. This became a global news story, andeventually led to the resignationof the Met’s commissioner, Cressida Dick.Why am I telling you this now? Because three years later the BBC’s undercover reporting shows that nothing has changed. Nothing. This is a catastrophic failure of leadership at the highest levels by the Met. I am unapologetically scathing because of all the work, all the recommendations that had been made previously. Everything had been agreed upon and supposedly implemented. So how could this possibly happen again?Thirty-one years after the murder of my son Stephen Lawrence, I can forgive his killers – but not the Met | Neville LawrenceRead moreThat’s the question that must be thoroughly explored so we know where accountability sits for this failure. What is so dispiriting, and what this documentary proved, is how some officers think and behave when they feel safe. It is a clear reflection of the extent to which far-right thinking is creeping into our public services. It’s also a confirmation of what some communities inLondonhave always feared, of what institutional racism and misogyny actually looks like in reality. If that reflection stings a bit, just consider again the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim hatred we saw in the documentary, alongside the copious examples of misogyny.I’m still processing the documentary. I was at the National BlackPoliceAssociation (NBPA) conference this week, where we were thinking hard about this.In the programme, my amazing colleague,Sue Fish, who was Nottinghamshire’s senior officer and who has worked so hard to confront misbehaviour and to make misogyny a hate crime, said what I said three years ago: this isn’t just the case of a few rotten apples. It’s about the barrel. It always was.So what next? The first thing they have to do is ask themselves, how did this happen again. How did it happen at all in the Met, but specifically how did it happen at Charing Cross, given everything they knew about the station there and its culture? This goes deep, because much was done at the station last time to move officers and disband units, but the problem is still there. This is almost a case study in failure. You can’t fault current Met commissioner Mark Rowley’s rhetoric. There is a whole body of work they are doing to have a new Met. But if, after three years, this is where we are, how can we say it is working?One thing they need to do is to repair the relationship with the NBPA. They also need to bring in people whose views will be challenging and thus are difficult to hear, but who need to be heard. The whole thing now is too internal. After theMacpherson reportfollowing the inquiry into police failures after the death of Stephen Lawrence,they had lay advisers who did provide challenge and a proper critique, but that has dissipated to nothing.They must also create conditions so that frontline officers who want no part in this feel confident in being able to speak up and that they will be supported when they do. In the programme, we saw a female officer who knew what was being said was wrong, but didn’t feel she could do anything about it because the male officer involved was senior to her. That problem must be urgently addressed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What view will she take of this?This has gone on for too long.

And now, with his nation’s finances in chaos: silenceThu 2 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 07.37 EDTShareSo you really want to know how Prime Minister Farage would pan out? Well, speculate no longer. An excellent test case is unfolding right now, in a country that just so happens to be run by one of Nigel’s heroes.Javier Mileiis “amazing”, said the CEO of the private company he calls Reform. “Cutting and slashing … doing all the things he’s done … that’s leadership.”You may know some of this story, about how a political outsider took power in Argentina. You’ve seen photos of El Loco, the self-styled madman, in a black leather jacket, with sideburns like hedges and wielding a giant red chainsaw – all the better to slash the public sector with.Taking over Latin America’s second-largest country made Milei the poster boy of the international hard right. Elon Musk: “I love Javier Milei.” Kemi Badenoch: “Javier Milei is the template.” Donald Trump: “My favourite president.” In office, he was lionised by Wall Street and the international commentariat. Milei’s economy was declared by no lesser sage than Niall Ferguson as a “man-made miracle”.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with Javier Milei at the UN general assembly in New York last month.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APYet over the past few weeks,Argentinahas gone into freefall. Investors have yanked billions out of the country, and the peso has dropped like a stone. A few days ago Trump was forced to pledge $20bn (£15bn) to prop up his friend, in addition to a rescue loan from the IMF. Later this month, Milei faces midterm elections that will serve as a referendum on his presidency and the results are expected to be bad. “We are seeing in real time how a government can melt in front of our eyes,” Alejandro Bercovich, a leading Argentine TV and radio journalist told me this week. “I never thought they would collapse this quickly.”It’s not only Milei’s administration melting away; so too are his once-packed international throng of cheerleaders and wolf-whistlers. Farage, Badenoch, Musk and all the rest are maintaining a red-faced silence. Curious, that. But the rest of us should find out a bit more about how the great “libertarian success story” of this decade, to use Ferguson’s term, is now also its biggest libertarian flop. It makes for quite a parable.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: XMilei’s true value lies in his demonstration of how the attention economy can propel the hard right into power. Like Farage and Trump, he is no creature of the party system but had come from economics and TV punditry. Combining those two disciplines means he can turn his guru Milton Friedman into viral content. Climate change is a “socialist lie”, he’d opine, or the poor should be “free” to sell their organs. Oh, and the state is “a paedophile in the kindergarten”. Three years before taking office, Milei had already stormed TikTok.At its core, his message is extremely rightwing, but Milei can wrap it in leftwing phrases, swiped from the Peronists of Argentina and further afield. Among his most popular targets isla casta, Argentina’s corrupt political elite. “La casta tiene miedo!” he roared on election night:The elite is afraid!It was thesame slogancoined in the 2010s by the socialists of Spain’s Podemos. It was also language off limits to the exhausted centrists of both right and left, just as Farage today can promise to renationalise water companies.Broadcast to an electorate tired of a failing economy, Milei reached voters other rightwing politicians just couldn’t reach. “He got into power by attracting votes from the poor and the young – the first non-Peronist to do so,” says Maria Victoria Murillo, an expert in Latin American politics at Columbia University.View image in fullscreenJavier Milei and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, at the inauguration of Donald Trump, Washington DC, 20 January 2025.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersMilei’s big achievements came in his first few months in office. Inflation plunged and the economy stabilised. But the Chicago fanboy who once promised to jettison Argentina’s domestic currency and move it on to the US dollar (which would have been economic suicide) then began boasting about his “super peso”. More seriously, he offered no real solutions for Argentina’s chronic problems of an undeveloped industrial sector and addiction to income from selling basic commodities. Meanwhile, the arch-enemy of the corrupt elite has himself been caught up in a corruption scandal, with his sister – “the boss”, as Milei calls her – accused oftaking kickbacksof 3% on government drug contracts. The president’s response to the allegations was first silence, then to claim they were faked by AI, then to argue that 3% was risibly low.All he had was chainsaw economics: slashing government departments, stripping back social welfare and laying off public servants. It was the same recipe as Musk tried at Doge, but with wild-eyed intensity and disregard for the human and political consequences. Half of Argentina’s workers cannot eke out their pay for a whole month, according to one survey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marching into what he termed a “life-or-death battle” in elections in Buenos Aires, he was pelted with stones by angry voters and then handed a resounding defeat. While Buenos Aires is historically Peronist, the Peronists did far better across the province than they had for years. “The people thought this guy would make them better off,” says Murillo. “Now they’re deserting him.”View image in fullscreenJavier Milei and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the UN general assembly last month.Photograph: Argentina’s Presidency Press Office/AFP/Getty ImagesThen came the currency crisis. Argentina’s central bank – which Milei once promised to abolish – threw billions into the market to keep the peso from collapsing further against the dollar. Trump tweeted his support, then his treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, stepped in against the “speculators” – an odd phrase, given Bessent made his name as George Soros’s lieutenant when they broke the pound in the early-90s European Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis. Milei once posed as an outsider who could do the emergency surgery to fix his country; he is now beholden to the same institutions he once scorned and reliant for support on a foreign power to the north and the wealthy elites at home who have raked off so much of Argentina’s wealth.“They want to do what?” said the journalist Bercovich, when I told him that Farage and Badenoch had claimed to be keen students of Mileinomics. “No, no, no. People in Britain must know: this has been a disaster from which it will take us years to recover.”Which makes the blushing quiet over this historic debacle all the stranger.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJavier MileiOpinionArgentinaAmericasEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

Amid that sensory storm, one corner was always a riot of colour and sound: traders hawking cages crammed with budgerigars.“Budgies”, as I would later learn to call them, were auctioned off in the sticky heat of Friday mornings. It was the time when Pakistan was still observing Friday as the weekly day off. The bird’s popularity was unmatched: hardy, inexpensive and adorned in flashes of yellow, green and blue, they were the undisputed crowd favourites.For me, a teenage refugee fromAfghanistanwandering through the market, they stood out as more than mere merchandise. Their sound was striking, bright, insistent, almost defiant against the din of bargaining voices and clanging metal cages. Something in their restless chatter and bursts of flight fascinated me.‘So tiny and so vulnerable’: what chance will one of Australia’s smallest birds have against a rocket launchpad?Read moreIn Pakistan, keeping budgies was more than a pastime. It was a quiet, bold act of creating life and beauty in cramped homes, a way of softening the edges of hardship. Families who had little else would hang a cage by the window or under a tree somewhere. Children were taught to feed and care for them and, in doing so, they learned tenderness, patience and responsibility. I remember a neighbour’s son, no older than 10, proudly naming his pair after Bollywood stars – Shah Rukh and Kajol.Time swept me far away. Years later, in Germany, I saw no budgies at all. It wasn’t until I returned to Afghanistan that the familiar sight reappeared. In Kabul’s old bazaar, there they were again: lively, quarrelling, impossible to ignore. The cages were different this time – not the tiny metallic contraptions of Karachi but larger enclosures woven from sticks, sometimes decorated with beads or scraps of fabric, as if the cage itself needed to be as pretty as the birds it held.But grown-up me noticed something else. These were no longer just “cute” birds. In Afghanistan, the tradition of weaving folklore around animals is rich – nightingales as symbols of eternal love, falcons of courage, crows of mischief. The budgerigar was not a central figure of legend but somehow it carried echoes of those grand tales. Kabul friends would share stories where budgies slipped into the narrative as comic relief, small but persistent characters.One story has stayed with me: a petty thief broke into a food shop one night, not for money but to “liberate” his favourite budgies. He ended up locked inside. By morning, the shopkeeper found him having eaten all the biscuits and smoked all the cigarettes, shouting in mock indignation about being “kept waiting” for the shop to open. The story was told with laughter – not to mock the thief so much as to marvel at the grip those little birds had, even on people living at the edges of society.Rainbow lorikeets can be such bruisers, but this pair turns me into a cartoon princess | Johanna Roberts as told to Alyx GormanRead moreAnd then, time spun me yet again, carrying me to Melbourne. Here, for the first time, I encountered budgerigars and many other Australian birds as they were meant to be: wild, social, free. On my daily walks through the leafy suburbs of Casey, I often pause to watch some of them dart overhead – small colourful comets against a vast sky. Their calls weave through the eucalyptus-scented air, stitching together a soundscape utterly unlike the claustrophobic markets of Karachi or Kabul. No cages, no bargaining hands reaching through bars – just wide, sun-drenched skies with room to play, to squabble, to belong.This contrast between the captive budgies of my childhood and the wild flocks of my new home has become more than an observation. It is a lens through which I understand migration, freedom and belonging. It seems, just like me, the birds had different lives in different geographies: bartered and caged in one, woven into street lore in another and, finally, here, unshackled, their wings stretching fully into the air they were born for.The budgies are for me fragments of memory – of Karachi’s crowded markets, Kabul’s storytelling alleys and Australia’s open skies.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian bird of the year 2025OpinionBirdsAfghanistanWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

Taxi (1998)In her breakout film, modern greatMarion Cotillardsupplies annoying-girlfriend comic relief for Samy Naceri’s gallivanting Marseille taxi driver. The spunkiness and sultriness she gives out in every scene is small beer for her – but you’ve got to start somewhere. There are worse places than in this French box office ram-raider, which spawned a franchise.19. Innocence (2004)View image in fullscreenBeguiling … Innocence.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyA little-seen, highly beguiling Lucile Hadžihalilović drama in which a group of schoolgirls emerge from coffins and are inculcated into a mysterious boarding school you might call “femininity”. As dance instructor Mademoiselle Eva, Cotillard is more of a vibe than a character: a smiling stringency. Her utterances, such as “Obedience is the only path to happiness”, feel right out of a fairytale.18.Big Fish(2003)Cotillard’s first English-language film part: a supporting role as the pregnant wife who accompanies Billy Crudup to visit his dying father (Albert Finney) in Tim Burton’s fabulist drama. She gets a nice bedside scene as the ailing Finney spins another yarn; with those limpid eyes, there’s no one better for credulous reaction shots. An importantentréefor what, by Gallic actor standards, has been an unusually fruitful Hollywood career.17.Little White Lies(2010)Another French mega-hit, a deluxe version of the bourgeois-holiday comedy written and directed by Cotillard’s former long-term partner, Guillaume Canet. Repairing to Arcachon with a group of friends fretting over a missing member who’s in hospital, she layers laid-back melancholy into the mix. Laid-back, that is, until her so-called chums subject her to a tubing ordeal behind a boat – and she unleashes a virtuoso swearing display.16.Nine(2009)Take It AllRob Marshall’s spin on 8½ travesties Fellini something rotten. But, among a stacked cast of cinematic doyennes, Cotillard earns her keep in the pivotal role: the sidelined wife played by Anouk Aimée in the original, the sacrifice on the altar of Daniel Day-Lewis’s director’s egotism. Going one up on the revenge dress, her revenge Broadway showstopper, Take It All, is where her grace ignites into rancour.15.Assassin’s Creed(2016)Not quite as challenging a use of Cotillard’s talents as Lady Macbeth for her second collaboration with director Justin Kurzel. As the chief Templar scientist responsible for regressing people into the memories of long-dead killers, she doesn’t get to do any parkour, unlike the rest of the cast. Instead sheis the movie’s still centre, emanating sadomasochistic chill as she skewersMichael Fassbenderon the time-travelling gizmo.14.A Good Year(2006)View image in fullscreenLove among the vines … Cotillard and Crowe.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Allstar“McDonald’s is in Avignon, fish and chips in Marseille” – Cotillard’s cafe owner serves up Gallic sauce straight to Russell Crowe’s expat trader straight in this Peter Mayle-esque jolly. DirectorRidley Scott, who owns a Provencal vineyard, gives full rein to his Provencal vineyard-owning fantasies as Crowe – over for a quick property deal – woos the local beauty. Cotillard is the sparring partner a slugger like Crowe needs if he is to stay light on his toes in thispastisscrewball.13. Pretty Things (2001)A Cotillard deep cut, adapted fromenfant terribleVirginie Despentes’ 1998 novel Les Jolies Choses. The actor shows her range, expertly differentiating extrovert party girl and buttoned-up introvert twin sisters. When the former kills herself and the latter hijacks her budding rock-star career, Cotillard turns out to have hypnotic mic presence that proved handy in future jobs.12.A Very Long Engagement(2004)Cotillard sports an excellent bird fascinator during a scene in which her vengeful sex worker, Tina Lombardi, assassinates one of the army officers responsible for her soldier boyfriend’s death in the first world war. She is similarly eye-catching in Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s film; an implacable foil to more benign lead actor Audrey Tautou, dipping into a well of darkness she later used so effectively on big-budget canvases.11.Annette(2021)Another demanding singing role for triple-threat Cotillard after La Vie en Rose and Nine – as the soprano partner of Adam Driver’s renegade standup comedian. This time, she had to belt out her numbers live on set, occasionally while Driver pops up from between her legs during cunnilingus. Perhaps by this stage she was a little typecast as a doomed women, or – as in Inception – the projection of an out-of-control male psyche. But it’s still another effortlessly supple turn.10. Little Girl Blue (2023)View image in fullscreenAlmost unrecognisable … Little Girl Blue.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA fascinating memory film that gives a fleeting glimpse into Cotillard’s process; the actor aids director Mona Achache in her quest to comprehend her late writer mother, Carole, by incarnating the latter. It’s a meditation on grief, motherhood and generational abuse, with an unrecognisable Cotillard at its centre. Her sketches of this bohemian firebrand are also a reminder that acting – in seeking to recapture the past – is another form of compulsion.9.The Dark Knight Rises(2012)Her death scene as villain Talia al-Ghul was subject to a bit of an internet pile-on – and Cotillard later admitted she botched it due to being stressed on set. But she is highly effective elsewhere, first as Bruce Wayne’s classy ally Miranda Tate, then unmasking herself and administering the “slow knife” with lethal politesse. Thank God someone – unlike Batman and Bane – could enunciate nicely.8. Love Me If You Dare (2003)View image in fullscreenHigh-concept fluff … Love Me If You Dare.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyIt didn’t get anywhere near as much overseas love as the likes of The Fifth Element or Amélie – but this French romcom, bringing together future real-life couple Cotillard and Canet, is surprisingly sophisticated. It’s pure high-concept fluff: they play the grownup versions of childhood friends whose games of dare continue into adulthood. Cotillard grounds it, handling her soulmatemanquéwith a brisk and downbeat frankness.7.Public Enemies(2009)Michael Mann tried to shake up the period gangster film free of established mores in this biopic of John Dillinger – and Cotillard’s emotional dexterity made her a perfect fit for his raw-looking digital photography. She feels utterly fresh in the role of Dillinger’s girlfriend Billie Frechette, initially wary but charmed by his sense of destiny; less a cliched moll than a flesh-and-blood woman swept up in the hurricane of the great American now.6.La Vie en Rose(2007)Often cited as Cotillard’s finest hour – in part because of the association with sacrosanct French icon Edith Piaf. Her performance is a fine technical achievement, with her nailing la Môme’s cramped body language, repertoire of grimaces, and earthy putdowns across multiple decades. But it feels as if Cotillard is hemmed in by biopic conventions and only fleetingly allowed to – as Piaf’s mentor orders – “live the song”. The bravura sequence when the singer segues from the agony of her boxer lover’s death straight to the stage is one such opening.5.Inception(2010)In just a handful of minutes, Cotillard has sledgehammer impact as “Mal” (geddit) – the pea in Christopher Nolan’s oneiric mattress-stack. Chief dream infiltrator Leonardo DiCaprio can no longer be trusted to construct his alt.realities for fear of being invaded by the guilt-ridden revenant of his dead wife. Cotillard brings a malefic charge to this solipsistic femme fatale in a part all the more powerful for existing chiefly in the mind’s eye.4.Rust and Bone(2012)There is something faintly preposterous about Jacques Audiard’s melodrama – amateur kickboxer romances orca-training amputee?!? – but not about the performances. Cotillard’s gift for wordless communication comes to the fore here as Matthias Schoenaerts’ bruiser tries to coax her back to the land of the living. Shades of shame, detachment, rage and bitterness cascade out of her.3.Macbeth(2015)View image in fullscreenTenderness … with Fassbender in Macbeth.Photograph: Dmc Film/AllstarCotillard and Michael Fassbender surely qualify as the best-looking Macbeths in history. Ultra-grim Australian director Justin Kurzel exploited Cotillard’s Frenchness to cloak her Lady Macbeth in something otherworldly; there is a spacey, dissociative air to her scheming that marks her version out from the usual angry harangues. The tenderness with which she delivers her repentance speech to a vision of her dead child is harrowing.2.The Immigrant(2013)James Gray’s slow-burn drama dwells on the flipside of the American Dream: the oppressed and the exploited on whom the Michael Corleones and the Tony Montanas trample as they march upwards. As a Polish New Yorker forced into prostitution, Cotillard’s performance is a miracle of naturalism. Her natural Romantic style curbed by her character’s wariness, she plays the role with an entrancing delicacy. As her ordeals and forbearance pile up, her face starts to look like that of a religious icon.1.Two Days, One Night(2014)View image in fullscreenAnxiety rollercoaster … Two Days, One Night.Photograph: Les Films Du Fleuve/Sportsphoto/AllstarCotillard harnessed the sense of gnawing inner dismay that gives her such believability in femme fatale roles to devastatingly realist ends in this Dardenne brothers’ tour de force. She plays a depressive worker at a solar panel factory who, over one weekend, must persuade her colleagues to forgo the €1,000 bonus they’ve been offered to work longer hours, so her company can fire her. Ever attuned to her character’s emotional somersaults, Cotillard not only excels at her trademark expressiveness – but also the reverse: this beleaguered woman threatening to shut down completely. In what writer David Graeber might have called a “bullshit jobs” thriller, or what we can call a capitalism redemption story, Cotillard’s anxiety rollercoaster renders it all the more heartening when she pulls out of this nosedive at the last minute.Explore more on these topicsRankedMarion CotillardTim BurtonMichael FassbenderRidley ScottÉdith PiafChristopher NolanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her two-yearEras tourestablished her as the defining entertainer of her generation, and after herrecent engagementto American footballer Travis Kelce, one of its biggest celebrities. Now, after an unexpectedly brief hiatus, Swift returns with her 12th album in yet another guise: a showgirl.Swift made The Life of a Showgirl with Swedish super-producers Max Martin and Shellback while touring Europe last year. Shedescribed the projectas a tribute to her “joyful, wild, dramatic” life as an entertainer, and a look “behind the scenes” of the Eras spectacle. Album imagery by fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott shows Swift bejewelled with diamantes, fishnet tights, fur and feathered headdresses.“Swift has crafted a different persona for pretty much every album, so it’s not such a surprise that we’re seeing a new side of her,” says Drew Nobile, an associate professor of music theory at the University of Oregon. But why a showgirl – and why now?It is not as much of a clash with Swift’strademark girl-next-door relatabilityas it may seem. “She’s leaning into the idea that her public image is a gilded fantasy,” Nobile says, allowing her to present herself as both “the billionaire pop star who dazzles arenas every night, and the same old girl beneath the costumes. It would ring hollow if she just came back with a down-to-earth album of personal songs, as if the Eras tour never happened.” Even the title The Life of a Showgirl, he says, “seems to be suggesting that behind the sequins is a real woman.”Swift isn’t the first pop star to draw from the 19th-century showgirl tradition. For her Man! I Feel Like a Woman! video,riffing on Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love, Shania Twain donned a top hat and tuxedo jacket to transform the original’s sleaze into sex appeal and female empowerment. Lady Marmalade, from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack, emphasised showgirls’ solidarity. Kylie Minogue chose tocelebrate her“long-term relationship” with fans with her art deco-inspired Showgirl tour of 2005; Lady Gaga acknowledged her debt to cabaret at last year’s Paris Olympics. Among pop’s new generation, Sabrina Carpenter’s skits draw from vaudeville while Addison Rae often wears sequins, tulle and lingerie-inspired looks.View image in fullscreenArt deco inspired … Kylie Minogue performing on her Showgirl tour, 2005.Photograph: Maurice McDonald/PAFor pop stars such as these, the showgirl offers both stage-ready looks and historical context – but she has never been mere spectacle, argues Alison J Carr, the Sheffield-based author of Viewing Pleasure and Being a Showgirl. Each showgirl extends the tradition and reflects the “pleasures and anxieties” of her time, she says. “There is no original showgirl: she’s always a quotation.”The iconic showgirl emerged from 19th-century social change: industrialisation and the shift to the city, the birth of nightlife and women’s increasing visibility in public. After emerging in Parisian music halls and cabarets, the style spread to England, where John Tiller’s legendary troupe popularised what was called “precision dance”.The “kickline” of performers standing shoulder-to-shoulder, and their synchronised can-can dances, all seemed to reflect the dawning machine age and cast women as symbols of modernity, Carr says. “Forms of progress, for ill and for good, [were] showing up in what the showgirls were doing.”Introduced to the US, the showgirl was quickly absorbed into the emerging entertainment business and “became part of Americana”, Carr says. Producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr developed the revues’ winking mix of sex appeal, glamour, comedy and theatrical performance. But by the 1970s and second-wave feminism, showgirls had been spurned along with beauty queens as creations of the male gaze, “dehumanising and objectifying”, Carr says.There was little acknowledgment of showgirls as skilled professionals. Yet many were classically trained dancers, and performed in 2-3in heels and wore costumesweighing as muchas 22lbs (10kgs). Most shows required them to be 5ft 8in or taller, so as to not appear swamped on stage; strong legs, back and core muscles were a must. “There’s a lot of steps, the dancers are running up and down … it’s incredibly physical,” says Carr.View image in fullscreen‘It’s incredibly physical’ … a dancer poses in front of the Moulin Rouge, Paris.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/ReutersWhen animated by the performer, however, the costumes’ glitz and glamour actually serve to highlight her humanity and talent, Carr says. “All that embellishment is saying that you’re important, you deserve to be seen, you’ve got something to say.”Carr recalls seeing a troupe in Los Angeles, made up of women with different looks and builds. “You could see that all of them had just decided: ‘I’m going to be that beautiful woman in the kickline.’ It’s not contingent on what you look like, what you’re wearing – it’s that inner commitment ... You’re audacious because you know you’re that good.”That would certainly seem to appeal to Swift, known for her formidable work ethic and ambition to be the biggest and the best. To prepare for the Eras tour and three-hour shows night after night,Swift sang the entire setlist aloudwhile running on a treadmill, daily, and did three months of dance training.That professionalism, and commitment to putting on a stellar performance, defines the showgirl, Carr says. “You’ll see recordings of performers, and films, but this is the ephemera – the show is really the live encounter.” Likewise, Swift’s Eras Tour film was pitched as a way to relive the experience, not as as replacement; many fans attended more than once.But what does a real showgirl think of Swift’s self-coronation? “She absolutely looks like a showgirl,” says Lou Anne Chessik. Over her 12-year career, Chessik performed in Jubilee! – the longest-running revue in Las Vegas and the inspiration for this year’s Pamela Anderson dramaThe Last Showgirl– as well as other extravaganzas in Vegas, Reno and Tokyo.“I loved being a showgirl, wearing all the amazing costumes, our camaraderie backstage,” says Chessik. But it was demanding work. Chessik worked six-month contracts, performing six to seven nights a week and two shows a night (three on Saturdays). She was even limited in how much time she could spend outdoors: “We could not have tan lines … but it probably saved my skin,” she says.In 2007 Chessik founded the Showgirl Legacy Foundation to preserve those performers’ historic significance. She was delighted to see Swift posingin one of the original ensemblesfrom Jubilee!, designed by Bob Mackie for the show’s “Jewel finale”. The bra, undergarments and armbands are described as French wirework, with set stones and nude fabric backing for a “nude illusion”. (Carpenterhas also worn Mackie’svintage designs.)View image in fullscreen‘I loved being a showgirl’ … former cast members from the show Jubilee! performing at a benefit show in 2017.Photograph: Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images“I love that Swift appreciates the art of costuming from our era,” says Chessik. She also looks the part in the album artwork, between her 5ft 10in height and her “perfect” red lipstick, just like that worn by Chessik and her colleagues. But, she adds, “our hair was always pinned up and pulled back … and we never sat in our costumes.”More than her stature or styling, Swift embodies the showgirl essence, Chessik says: “She is professional, charismatic, talented. ” She points to Swift’s comic timing in the Shake It Off video (“it reminds me of I Love Lucy”), the storytelling to her shows, and the hard work that goes into them.She has “absolutely” earned the right to call herself a showgirl, Chessik concludes, along with Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and other contemporary entertainers. “They are the top performers of their time and genre – like we were.”Certainly the “big showgirl spectacle”, at least, now belongs to stadium pop, Carr agrees. Showgirls still exist, often in coalition with drag, cabaret and burlesque performers, but performance opportunities and venues tend to be small-scale, independently run and as such vulnerable to closure. “The contemporary showgirl has a bit of precarity to her,” she says.View image in fullscreenLou Anne Chessik at the Lido de Paris, the Stardust hotel, Las Vegas, in 1981.Photograph: Courtesy: Lou Anne ChessikThe same cannot be said of Swift, who is on her way to her second billion. If anything, Carr suggests, her wealth complicates her claim to the showgirl, who is typically self-made and anti-elitist. “To become a showgirl is not something that you’re born into – you become it, you opt into it.”With so many present-day performers “labouring in the margins” and showgirl history at risk of being lost, Swift might consider putting resources towards protecting the tradition, Carr suggests. Without that extra step, she risks coming across as simply “showing off”.After all, most showgirls performed alongside dozens of others. Former chorus girls have told Carr of feeling empowered by “having many sisters”. Chessik recalls performing in casts of more than 100; even when there were leads, “not many people knew them by name”.As “the lone showgirl”, Swift has skipped solidarity and gone straight to commanding the stage solo. “She is crowning herself, coronating herself, because she’s got everything that this era wants,” Carr says.But, she adds, anyone can learn how to embrace their power and embody the showgirl’s spirit. Indeed, relative to the goddesses and queens to which female pop stars are often compared, she is closer to earth and even accessible. “It does take talent, panache, charisma, refining your craft, all of those things … but you don’t need to be a billionaire.”Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockCabaretDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The show’s superfans open up about the nonstop controversyIsobel LewisThu 2 Oct 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 16.44 EDTShareAsk fans of Strictly Come Dancing to describe the show, and the same buzzwords come up. For Poppy, 25, a Strictly diehard whomakes videos about the show on TikTok, those are “sparkly”, “camp”, “joyful”. “It’s escapism,” she says .Strictly recap bloggerAriadne , 30, echoes this – to her, it’s “feelgood television”. For more than two decades , the dance competition has presented itself as the nicest show on telly; a supportive, progressive environment on set, and a bright and soothing viewing experience at home.But are Strictly fans buying it? While past controversies have largely slipped off the show like water off a duck’s back, the show’s pristine image has taken a beating in recent years. There was the major misconduct and bullying investigation in 2024 that led to two popular pros, Giovanni Pernice and Graziano di Prima, leaving the show. In the lead-up to this year’s series – and alongside the continued fallout from Wynne Evans’s 2024 appearance – further controversy has followed. Strictly has been hit byclaims of drug use on set, plus reports thata male star of the show (not from the current series) was arrested on suspicion of rape.“And then they go and putThomas Skinnerin,” says Siân, 33, who regularly posts about the show on Reddit. “The mind boggles.”A self-proclaimed “non-political” former Apprentice contestant (who has nonetheless aligned himself with the right by wearing a Maga hat and posing for pictures with JD Vance), Skinner has majorly divided the dance competition’s fans. Poppy had been sharing her real-time reactions to the 2025 cast on TikTok. In the video where Skinner’s name was called, her nervous smileimmediately droppedto an expression of deadpan horror. “Strictly, babe, this is a mistake,” she said. “This is not inclusive. Bad move.”Calls for Skinner’s removal followed, along with counter-arguments to the tune of “so much for the tolerant left” from his supporters. The latter group, Poppy says, may be more concerning than Skinner himself. When she voiced her own disappointment at his casting on the official Strictly Instagram, she received “some horrible things back” from his fans. “These are the people you’re drawing into the show,” she argues. Judging by his stompy week one pasodoble, it seems unlikely that the former pillow salesman will make it through the competition on talent alone. Yet there are concerns that Skinner’s supporters will vote to keep him in – à la Farage on I’m A Celebrity – to support him and annoy the show’s more progressive viewers.For fans, Skinner’s casting jars with Strictly’s public commitment to inclusivity and representation. There was barely a dry eye in the house when Chris McCausland, the show’s first blind contestant, lifted the glitterball trophy in 2024; the class of 2025 includesEllie Goldstein, a model with Down’s syndrome, and RuPaul’s Drag Race starLa Voix, the first drag performer to compete on the main series; and numerous same-sex partnerships having thrived in the format in the past.View image in fullscreen‘Public commitment to inclusivity and representation’ … Ellie Goldstein and Vito Coppola during their appearance on the live show of Saturday’s Strictly Come Dancing show on BBC1.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PAThe tonal shift between their casting and Skinner’s, Ariadne says, “muddles” the show’s messaging: “[It] does feel like Strictly wants to have its cake and eat it with casting someone who will create controversial buzz around the show, but then say, ‘We’re uplifting people from minority backgrounds, the LGBTQ+ community, disabled folk.’” Viewers see Strictly as an escapist fantasy; for Siân, Skinner’s casting overshadows that. “This is the one programme I get to watch to escape all the negativity I see online, and now I have to sit and watch this guy,” she says. Some fans have declared that they’ll be skipping the show altogether in protest at Skinner’s involvement, although Poppy is more diplomatic: “It does mean there’s a place to have a loo break.”Most fans I speak to express surprise that Strictly would risk casting such a polarising figure after the battering it took last year. The misconduct investigation hung in the air in 2024 and wrapped a few weeks into the live show, with six of the 17 complaints made against Pernice by Sherlock star Amanda Abbington upheld. More shocking to many were the revelations about fellow Italian dancer Di Prima that also emerged. Seemingly from nowhere, it was revealed that Di Prima had engaged in misconduct that same year, and had evenkicked his partner, Zara McDermott, in rehearsals.For the first time, fans were given a proper peek behind the velvet curtain (beyond the usual rehearsal footage and social media content), and realised that Strictly wasn’t always so sparkly. “It did feel like betrayal,” Ariadne recalls. “I was disappointed.” In Pernice, or in the show? “In the show,” she says; it was hard to know “how much of it was covered up and how much was actually known about”. Xav, 25, is another Reddit fan, and remembers his own upset at the revelations about Di Prima. “I just didn’t expect that,” Xav recalls. “I get the pros are athletes, and this is their passion, this is their life, but [I didn’t] expect one to go that far.”View image in fullscreen‘I was disappointed’ … Amanda Abbington and Giovanni Pernice in Strictly 2023.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBCXav speaks to a tension at the show’s core: Strictly’s desire to present as eternally optimistic, despite everyone knowing that hard work is required to turn non-dancers into semi-professionals. Contracts require the celebrity contestants to complete at least 12 hours of training a week, but for many, it’s closer to 12 hours a day. Like many fans, Siân – a former dancer herself – heard Abbington’s allegations and found herself caught between wanting to believe a woman who was speaking out, and hoping Pernice was simply a “harsh, critical teacher who wanted the best out of his pupil”. “I think two things can be true at the same time,” she reasons. TheBBCinvestigation, which confirmed claims of verbal bullying and harassment but dismissed claims that Pernice was physically aggressive or made threats towards his partner, reached a similar verdict.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The introduction of chaperones was a highly publicised positive measure, although fans such as Cal, 21, were surprised it hadn’t been done sooner, “given #MeToo and all that stuff. I feel like it shouldn’t have taken something that bad to happen for them to have people in the room,” he says.Nobody wants to think that the star of their favourite show is having a horrible time – that’s a given. But there are a lot of fans for whom Strictly is Saturday night entertainment and nothing more. Even for more clued-in viewers, preserving the Saturday night show is seen as paramount. Addressing the scandals on air would feel strange, and could threaten the all-ages appeal that, for many, is one of Strictly’s greatest strengths. Siân’s Strictly-themed WhatsApp group allows her to speak to family members she otherwise wouldn’t have contact with; at a time when generational divides feel greater than ever, Strictly is one of very few shared points of connection I can talk about with my own grandmother.Some fans’ love of the show has led them to greet the news of alleged drug use with ambivalence. “Obviously it’s not harmless in a wider context of drugs, but it’s comparatively not as harmful [as the bullying allegations] in my head, anyway,” Cal says. Many have taken the same stance as Xav: “There’s people in showbiz doing drugs? Who cares?”After a scandal-stricken few years for Strictly, Poppy says that fans have mostly learned to take headlines “with a pinch of salt”. Nobody wants to downplay the severity of the more serious allegations, and few would argue that they haven’t hurt the show’s image. Still, scrutiny – from fans, from the press – may just be the trade-off for popularity, and Strictly remains very popular. “When you brand yourself as family friendly, you leave yourself open to people looking for ways in which the show, or what’s going on behind the scenes, isn’t,” Cal says. “People are always going to look – I think the family-friendly image makes people want to look harder.”Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingTelevisionEntertainment TVBBCReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The people, the industry and the critics spoke with united voice, all of them basically retching.Actors were especially fast out of the gate to condemn a concept that is – obviously – depressing, dystopian and (if the tech behind it has ripped off real-life faces) dodgy. It is also plain shonky: my colleagueStuart Heritage has saidperhaps all there needs to be said about Tilly’s indeterminate dentistry, but there are clearly teething problems here that mean she’s far from ready for her closeup.Still,on TuesdayUS union Sag-Aftra – a whoppingly powerful organisation – hit back at this little skit that screened at a conference in Zurich by saying it believed creativity was, “and should remain, human-centred. The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics”.Natasha Lyonne and Emily Blunt urged agencies not to sign the likes of Tilly to their books. “Deeply misguided and totally disturbed,” said Lyonne. “Not the way. Not the vibe.” Blunt meanwhile, tolda Variety podcast: “Good Lord, we’re screwed. That is really, really scary … Please stop taking away our human connection.”‘It’s too late to be scared’: readers on the controversial rise of AI ‘actors’Read moreTo which one can only reply: hear, hear! And also: eh? Because such cheerleading for naturalism can feel increasingly iffy. Actors may say they are committed to human connection and emotional truth telling. They may indeed believe that they are. Yet both the movies and the decisions many of them make tell a different story.This season, at least four female actors, all A-list, none older than early 40s, appear to have had cosmetic work done on their face that renders what many of us might consider their greatest asset devalued, or at least changed, for ever.Cheeks have been smoothed, jaws tightened and lips plumped. Looks are now standardised, homogenised, blandified – no CGI or AI necessary!None have confirmed such work, and any such procedures are of course their own business. Except that that business is plausibly portraying everyday people, while trading on the affection and association audiences have fostered for them over a number of years in which they looked … different.The other week I watched an intense new drama starring one of these actors and was totally thrown by these abrupt changes to her face: subtle, yet still substantial enough to be unsettling.In the past, that face was one of the aspects of her appeal that meant I was happy to watch her reel off any old junk – and frequently had. Instead, I spent two hours feeling distanced, mournful and faintly frightened: not feelings that encourage submission to a fiction.Presumably the pressures on female actors to fight the passing of time are considerable enough to mean many make this kind of leap – for which, my sympathies. Yet changing your face to try to reject the inevitable does make protestations of commitment to gritty reality harder to swallow.It’s not just the women, of course: theirs is simply the most visible incongruity. Sometimes the entire entertainment climate feels like a vacuum of vanity. We are living in a golden age of self-absorbed cinema, in which many of the key movies of the season serve to feed the egos of their leads rather than cater for the audience.Tilly Norwood: how scared should we be of the viral AI ‘actor’?Read moreJay Kellystars George Clooney as a Clooney-esque movie icon, and is filled with commentary on the pain and glory of superstardom. Other movies which may strike the deepest chord with those who have a personal publicist include Is This Thing On?,Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,The Smashing Machineand Song Sung Blue – the latter three further fruits of Hollywood’s insatiable appetite for entertainment biopics.Elsewhere we haveDie, My Lovethe definition of an actors’ movie, in which Jennifer Lawrence (particularly) and Robert Pattinson (a bit) are allowed every opportunity to chew scenery while looking really hot, as well as Daniel Day-Lewis’s self-scripted comeback,Anemone, and Leonardo DiCaprio’s adorably scrappy dad inOne Battle After Another.Some of these are nonetheless good movies. Some, even, are superb. But if actors want to not alienate audiences, to help illuminate life as most people experience it, they might consider broadening the scope of their scripts. And they definitely need to stop surgically turning themselves into – well, into Tilly Norwood.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTilly Norwood (AI character)Artificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

The former anti-ballistic missile military facility, constructed during the cold war and only operational for six months before being decommissioned, was his destination: specifically, its brutalist concrete radar tower resembling an Egyptian pyramid without an apex.Warhol, Haring, Basquiat: exhibition remembers pivotal 80s New York artistsRead moreFor the next two days, while James car-camped in a field to photograph the radar tower in different lighting conditions with his 4x5 camera, he became transfixed by the pyramid’s uncanny nature as a “purpose built ruin … unmoored from time”.It was here, among the pyramid’s energetic resonances, that James realized the photographs of pyramid-shaped buildings he’d been capturing – from an office complex in Indianapolis to a Mormon church in Utah, a science museum in Denver, a Walmart in British Columbia, and numerous private residences – were a series that would lead to a book. A decade – and over 75 pyramids in nearly 20 states – later James has released Pyramids: Special Economic Vortex Zones of North America.View image in fullscreenPyramid Sports Complex in Phoenix, Arizona.Photograph: Ian James / Special EffectsJames’s desire to document US pyramids was born out of a new age music radio show he hosted on KCHUNG radio featuring independently produced cassettes ornamented with pyramid motifs that would have originally been found in crystal stores or massage parlors – before he sourced them from eBay.During his travels on a veritable pilgrim’s trail to these sites, James hypothesized that the intersection between new age beliefs and pyramid-buildings across the US is reflective of what he terms “capitalist metaphysics” – the impulse to channel the pyramid’s ancient, eastern, energetic properties toward the manifestation of American values and, as he puts it, create a“space for the ‘religion’ of laissez fair capitalism in the US”.The Bass Pro Shops pyramid in Memphis, which James photographed for multiple days but never entered – despite its promise of“an immersive retail adventure”complete with a hotel, indoor swamp, archery range, restaurant and overlook deck – is a prime example. Conceived in the 1950s as a series of three buildings named the Great America Pyramids, in a nod to the city’s Egyptian namesake, the lone structure was built in 1991 and has served many functions: including a concert venue inaugurated by the Grateful Dead and a stadium for the Memphis Grizzlies NBA team. It’s also garnered the name “tomb of doom” due to booming echos of fans’ cheers and the highly inauspicious removal of a crystal skull placed in its apex by the owner of the Hard Rock Cafe to channel mystic powers.View image in fullscreenThe Bass Pro Shop at the Pyramid in Memphis, Tennessee.Photograph: Ian James / Special EffectsVacant for nearly a decade, the owner of Bass Pro Shops reluctantly struck a deal with the city in 2008 to renovate the site (using $100m of taxpayer money in exchange for 2% of the store’s gross sales or, at minimum, $1m paid to the city in rent each year), but only if he caught a catfish in the Mississippi River. The universe delivered him the fish, but questions remain as to whether the city has ever received their full 2%. The superstitious events and overly lenient governmental-fiscal policies that have allowed Bass Pro Shops to flourish are an apt embodiment of a “pyramid which has been emptied of meaning” and instead become, what James calls “the raw synthesis of the blood of American capitalism.”Ironically, he notes, even when pyramid sites are dedicated solely to religious or spiritual practices “you can have these sacred structures in the US but they have to be generating income or tickets or financial sustainability.” The American spiritual experience is largely profit-driven.In order to photograph the pyramid at the Church of Shambhala Vajradhara Maitreya Sangha, a Buddhist monastery in northern California, James underwent “soul therapy” treatments in 2019 – wherein he lay inside a large plastic pyramid wrapped with copper wire while a nun pointed brightly colored lights at different organs in his body.Run by the Buddha Maitreya, who declares himself the second coming of Jesus Christ and the long-prophesied Medicine Buddha, the monastery is home to monks and nuns. They run Shambhala Healing Tools, which sells head pyramids, pendulums, meditation systems, welded dodecahedrons and vajras to visitors and devotees, sustaining their collective way of life – which is set to the perpetual soundtrack of the Buddha Maitreya’s music.View image in fullscreenMaitreya Buddha Pyramid.Photograph: Ian James / Special EffectsPrivate homeowners that James has visited also believe in the energetic power of their structures and similarly, he says, “aspire to ascend the ladder economically and spiritually”. James’s experiences with such individuals have varied widely. The home of a record producer in Paynes Creek, California, could only be photographed from outside their expansive property, as the owners were known to fire shots at anyone approaching.Others, however, will occasionally invite James inside. A woman in Why, Arizona, wished to learn more about his project and have him experience the “strange type of magnetism” exuded by her house. Over strong coffee and banana bread, she told him of her cross-country travels with her husband in a school bus and their decision to permanently settle in the area after discovering the pyramid house for sale. It was a sign.“I too feel a metaphysical connection to all of these places,” James said. “Seeing a pyramid rise over the horizon, how do you not respond to that?”Pyramids: Special Economic Vortex Zones of North America is out nowExplore more on these topicsArtArchitectureDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What would you ask him?Rich PelleyThu 2 Oct 2025 04.58 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 04.59 EDTShareOn paper, is sounds like any other British gangster film: “In the hard and gritty streets of London, one man wants to rule all the drugs gangs. This man will need to work his way to the top from a lowly drug dealer to the king of the jungle.” It’s a genre you’d associate with people like Guy Ritchie and Jason Statham, and characters called things like Brick Top and Rocky Goldfingers.What makes it surprising is that Fall to the Top stars Paul Chuckle – 77-year-old beloved slapstick children’s entertainer from 292 episodes of CBBC’s ChuckleVision between 1987 and 2009 – as The Jackal. No, that’s not a printing error, or someone mucking with Wikipedia.‘To me, to uzi’: why Paul Chuckle as a gangster isn’t such a dramatic career changeRead more“Having Paul in a darker role is something truly special,” says director Pete Hirst. “He’s known for his comedy but in Fall to the Top, audiences will see a completely different side to him that will leave them astounded.” Indeed, watching Chuckle feed someone to the pigs, or dump a body tied with weights into the Thames is a far cry from watching him as a hapless window cleaner.To celebrate the film’s upcoming release, Chuckle will be here to take your questions: from winning Opportunity Knocks in 1967 to coming first on Celebrity Coach Trip andcollaborating with Tinchy Stryder– all with his real life brother Barry. (Their two older brothers, Brian and Jimmy, performed as comedy duo The Patton Brothers, and would often turn up in ChuckleVision.) And, since Barry’s death in in 2018, there’s his appearance on MasterChef and choosing English football clubs as his specialist subject on Mastermind to – as we’ve discovered above – reinventing himself as a drug-dealing gangster. Please get your questions in by 6pm on Tuesday 7 October and we’ll print his – to me, to you – answers here in Film&Music soon.Fall to the Top is coming to streaming platforms this monthExplore more on these topicsCultureFilm & Music reader interviewComedyChildren's TVCrime filmscalloutShareReuse this content"

How Tribe of Frog became the UK’s trippiest, happiest club nightPlaying the oft-reviled subgenre of psytrance, this Bristol event is celebrating its 25th year. Amid the UV paint and crochet frog hats, we find out why it’s thrivingKyle MacNeillThu 2 Oct 2025 05.39 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 08.59 EDTShareSaturday’s sunset has long gone, but there’s so much UV paint glowing in Bristol nightclub Lakota that I feel I might end up with a tan from it. A throng of ravers throw shapes while a shamanic selector, flanked on stage by two dancers, pumps out squelchy beats. Colourfully daubed faces light up with joy and arms swirl into spacey lasers, ready to break through into a different dimension. For one night only, I am an initiated member of theTribe of Frog, a Bristolian club night that’s been putting on mind-boggling parties like this for the last 25 years.To mark the occasion, the team has gone mad as a box of proverbial amphibians with the kaleidoscopic decor, but the soundtrack is the same as ever: psytrance. This is a 135bpm-plus, four-to-the-floor, knowingly melodramatic, multi-layered offshoot of trance with mesmerising refrains and epic drops. Tristan Cooke, a DJ and legend of the scene who speaks to me a week before the party, explains that it “grew out of partying on beaches and nature,” specifically amid the trance scene in Goa, India, in the early 1990s. He says that psytrance enhances the effects of LSD. “It’s about attempting to achieve a peak experience. In a nutshell, it’s spiritual raving.”View image in fullscreenTribe of Frog co-founder Chris Rana on the decks.Photograph: James Gardner at TinyTogChris Rana, co-founder of Tribe of Frog, never made it to Goa but he did travel across Thailand in the 90s, where he and his late wife Donna (whose artwork continues to adorn the night) fell in love with psytrance. “For the first time in our lives, we found this feeling of freedom,” he says in the Tribe of Frog green room.Back inBristol, they started a nightlife decor business called Wildfrogz together. Why frogs? “It’s always considered a mystical animal because it can exist in two worlds, in the water and in the air,” Rana says. They met Jason Frog, as he’s known, on a job. “You can get into this plateau of bliss, where you’re dancing to this synchronised rhythm,” Jason says of his beloved genre, while munching his way through a bunch of bananas. After getting a gig kitting out a psytrance party in London called Enlightenment, they decided to throw their own.Tribe of Frog was born, with its opening night taking place in August 2000. “Every inch of wall space is covered in psychedelic banners, projections, lights and all that is just simulation to trigger the overload of the senses,” Cooke says, adding that even as a veteran DJ, playing Frog still smacks his gob: “It’s about creating a Garden of Eden in a club.” Transcendent outfits were also encouraged from the outset, with Jason explaining that “the concept has been that if you create a super-real environment, people forget their worries because they’re in this other world that their mind creates for them”.View image in fullscreen‘People forget their worries because they’re in this other world’ … Frog-costumed dancers in Lakota.Photograph: Timothy JonesSince then, Tribe of Frog has hopped across the globe and spawned a residency stage at Hampshire’s Boomtown festival. At a pub round the corner from Lakota, before the night begins, I bump into a group of twentysomethings in hand-crocheted frog hats who all met at Boomtown as solo punters. “If you put that much care and dedication into making something a tradition, you’re going to create a following,” says Matthew Sarrington, as another friend pulls up his sleeve to show a frog tattoo.Despite its widely dispersed fandom, though, Tribe of Frog is still somehow quintessentially Bristol. It’s true that it lacks any of the edge of the drum’n’bass, trip-hop or dubstep that seemingly wafts out of every concrete orifice and car window in Stokes Croft. Yet it encapsulates the left-field spirit of the city, in one way or another.View image in fullscreenA particularly colourful Tribe of Frog dancer.Photograph: James Gardner at TinyTogFor other people, however – who are obviously not here tonight – psytrance is a relentless headache, even musical torture.Dance musicfans often file it next to other oft-scorned niche genres such as happy hardcore and donk, seeing psytrance as a woo-woo scene beloved by crusty ravers sporting harem pants and scarfing too much magic mushroom chocolate.“Psytrance has always been the black sheep of the dance music fraternity,” Cooke admits. “They see it as a bunch of unclean-dreadlocked, culturally appropriating hippies. But it’s becoming part of the mainstream.” It’s true that psytrance, now far removed from its roots and attracting tens of thousands of revellers to festivals such as Boom in Portugal, hasfaced criticisms of cultural appropriation, amalgamating and whitewashing eastern iconography.But it’s an intricate issue. “Some criticisms remain valid, but every instance of ‘cultural appropriation’ should be carefully scrutinised,” says anthropologist Graham St John, the author of Global Tribe: Technology, Spirituality and Psytrance. “Sometimes, the othering in question is primitivist and even outright exploitative. Other times the borrowing and recognition is respectful and mutually beneficial.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s not just about hearing it, it’s about feeling it’ … on the floor at Tribe of Frog.Photograph: Timothy JonesFor those who aim at creating the latter, it’s a way of life, and there are always new tadpoles to join them. In the smoking area, I bump into Francesca Stevenson, an emerging psytrance selector (as Cheska Onyx) who won a competition to play tonight. “It’s not just about hearing it, it’s about feeling it,” she says, connecting psytrance’s local appeal to the south-west’s ley lines.Elsewhere, freshers-week students with constellations of glitter and gap-year tunics abound, many telling me, wide-eyed, that this is paradise. “The Frog has always just had this bottomless pool of young people,” Rana says. He also says that there have been many “frog unions” over the years – I’m told that Cliff, who plays the drums at Tribe of Frog, met his partner at Tribe and is bringing their daughter along for the first time tonight.View image in fullscreenOverloading the senses … two of the most outlandish dressers at Tribe of Frog.Photograph: James Gardner at TinyTogAround the club I overhear talk of trust funds, and discourse around the psychedelic drug 2C-B, and all of this – plus of course the psytrance itself – may put people off. But there are genuinely no posers or chinstrokers at Tribe of Frog. Mad, fun dancing is encouraged and there are multiple generations all going for it under one roof. “It’s a cool, funky, safe, amazing place … people are not going there to try and get laid. It’s about partying together,” Cooke says.The mind expansion, and sense of community, has been a lifesaver for some people. “It healed me. It brought me out of my shell. You get a better perspective on yourself,” Jason says. But while there can be individual catharsis, it’s always about the collective. Rana’s mantra, shared with me earlier, echoes in my mind as I float out of Lakota back towards Bristol coach station: “Here, you always drop your ego!”Explore more on these topicsClub cultureDance musicBristolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s crass, dull and utterly lacking in actual jokesLucy ManganThu 2 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 2 Oct 2025 00.01 EDTShareAfortysomething alpha male, a sad sack, a playboy and an intellectual walk into a German sitcom. Eight episodes of Dudes ensues. I do not speak German and can only hope it plays better in the original. In fact, the original-original is a Spanish comedy called Machos Alfa. That is now into its third season, which suggests it at least had a charm that has become lost in translation.The alpha here is Ulf (Tom Beck). He is tall, dark, handsome, high-earning, married to an increasingly influential influencer, and he and his immaculate facial hair are on the verge of promotion to CEO of the magazine publishing company he has worked at for the last 20 years. But what’s this? He is denied his dues by the advent of Vanessa (Jaëla Probst), a hot-in-all-senses businesswoman brought in from outside by the boss to shake things up. I have never seen this setup before. I hope it doesn’t cause him to quit in a childish rage and jeopardise his entire lifestyle, re-employment prospects and marriage. Oh.The sad sack is Andi (Moritz Führmann), who is stressed at work, balding and always too tired for sex – a groundbreaking comedy trifecta if ever there was one – despite his wife Silke’s (Franziska Machens) keenness to initiate it with his stressed, balding self. The hilarity.Playboy Erik (David Rott) meanwhile has almost the opposite problem. He is ready to give up his lover and get engaged to his long-term fiancee Kim (Marleen Lohse), the lucky girl. But she wants to open up their relationship! This revelation plays out over a dinner date in which he has – oh, the comic innovation gets everywhere! – hidden the engagement ring in her favourite pudding, but ends up having to eat it himself. Later, he has to poo it out. Try to contain your hysterical laughter. You may have had some practice already. If not, there is a scene coming up in which Andi uses a butt plug on Silke and the kids burst in, which should amply provide.Intellectual Cem (Serkan Kaya) is divorced and his 16-year-old daughter has just announced that she is moving in with him. She puts his profile on dating apps and starts overseeing his love life to a degree that I consider worthy of the involvement of social services, but I am not a writer of a dismal sitcom purporting to examine life for middle-aged men in a glorious feminist age, so what do I know? Maybe there really are swathes of teenage girls out there telling their fathers they need to “fuck at least 10 women properly otherwise you’ll never move on”, but if so there shouldn’t be. Stop it. Put some boundaries in place, stay in your parent/child lanes, return life to its proper order and just stop it now.Anyway. You will never guess who his first date is – only Ulf’s nemesis Vanessa! And you’ll never guess whether he panics and tells her he’s a widower instead of divorcee or not!On and on we go, watching boring, idiotic characters do boring, idiotic things and ticking off set-pieces as we go. Silke getting drunk at a dinner party with all the friends and ranting about Andi’s lack of libido. A shrink doodling inattentively while Cem pours out his troubles. Nobody cares about men any more, you see. Ulf hitting up his contacts for work and getting nowhere (“Too old? Seriously?”, “Too manly? For real?” These are lines someone has written). He returns to the office to ask for his job back but ends up humiliating himself again. The football team they all play for keeps losing. Ah,einemetapher. A visit from Erik’s parents stymieing Kim’s wish to go to a sex party that night. Until his parents have to leave early to go to a concert. So Erik and Kim go to the sex party. You’ll never guess who they meet there. Andi and Silke are called to their children’s school because thekinderhave brought the butt plug in for – well, I was going to say shits’n’giggles, but perhaps I shouldn’t.It’s dull, it’s crass, it pulls every punch it could possibly land, it has no insight, no subtlety, no grace, no jokes – it has things that sound like jokes, are formatted like jokes and are delivered like jokes, yet are not jokes – and it makes you feel sorry for actors. And maybe Germans. I don’t know if this is the quality of television they are used to, or that they want – again, it depends on whether much is missing in translation. But I suspect not much.Dudes is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTV comedyComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Mughals always regarded it as a much more refined place than India and looked to it as the source of the region’s greatest poets and artists, calligraphers and miniaturists, architects and tile makers. As recently as the early 1970s, at the height of the hippy trail, asAfghanistanfilled with travellers “high on weed and low on cash”, Kabul was still known as the Paris of the east. Memoirs of the time describe a world of miniskirts, jazz clubs, bowling alleys and ice-cream parlours. This world was linked to a poor but extremely beautiful rural hinterland where life revolved around the vine harvest and the annual arrival of nomad caravans from the Wakhan corridor.A quick flick through guidebooks of the time reveals an Afghanistan unimaginably different from today: of royal levees and fashion shows and apres-ski restaurants. Facing a photo of a gargantuan mound of melons – “delicious Afghan fruits are a treat for travellers” – you’d see a picture of “a tourist and his hunting party in the Pamir mountains with a Marco Polo sheep”. Most poignant of all are images of the priceless treasures of the Kabul Museum, almost of all which are now missing or destroyed, after looting during the mujahideen takeover of Kabul in the 1990s and the smashing up of what remained by the Taliban in 2001.In such guidebooks, there was only one place to stay: the InterContinental. This is “the finest hotel in Kabul” of foreign correspondent Lyse Doucet’s charming and often surprising memoir. “The Intercon”, as it was known, was a beacon of sophistication where Paris couturiers opened fashionable boutiques and Italian coiffeurs competed with their rival salons. Celebrated Afghan singing stars such as Ahmad Zahir (the “Elvis of Afghanistan”) lolled by the pool while his Afghan Vogue-model girlfriend shimmied past in her bikini. In the evening, guests could choose whether to drink Afghan brandy in the Nuristan cocktail lounge, dine onescargotsin the Pamir supper club or attend the annual Miss Afghanistan contest in the ballroom, followed by dancing to Gloria Gaynor in the basement discotheque.Doucet acknowledges that the Kabul InterContinental, “a white box of cement and steel”, was always, from its opening in 1969, “an iridescent bubble floating above the city’s cares”. She even hints that the kind of libertine western modernity that the hotel represented, and the corruption that financed it in what was still one of the poorest countries in the world, was partly responsible for stirring up resentments that eventually led to catastrophic and violent reactions – first Marxist, then Islamist. Nevertheless, Doucet succeeds in making the hotel an oddly successful frame for a sweeping social history of Afghanistan over the last half century and a moving symbol of its remarkable ability to endure whatever horrors fate has thrown at it.The book opens soon after President Biden has pulled the plug on US military assistance, with a description of the tragic disintegration of a 2021 wedding feast in the hotel. The news arrives that President Ashraf Ghani has fled the country and the Taliban are at the city’s gates. Guests scatter as a Taliban pickup is spotted trundling up the hill to the hotel; the bride bursts into tears and Naeem, the banquet manager, tells the groom: “Comfort your bride! If you don’t show courage today you will always disappoint her.”Doucet then doubles back to the 1969 opening during the glory days of the Zahir Shah monarchy, as Kabul pullulated with nightclubs and the InterContinental played host to black-tie dinners in the only cold war capital where western and Soviet diplomats routinely invited each other to their parties. We follow the hotel through two successive coup d’etats, the assassinations of three presidents in two years, the Soviet invasion, the successful mujahideen counterattack and the rise of the Taliban. Somehow, throughout it all, the hotel manages to remain open.What sustains the book is Doucet’s focus on the ordinary Afghans who keep the place going despite the shelling, rockets, suicide bombs and occasional massacres of both staff and guests. These are terrible affairs: during the era between the two Taliban governments, three successive suicide squads broke through rings of hotel security to maraud along the guest floors, shooting diners, throwing grenades down stairwells after fleeing staff, peppering cupboards full of hiding waiters with machine gun fire.Today, despite everything, the hotel remains a monument to Afghan resilience and to the bravery and persistence of its staff. In Doucet, and her witty, observant and sometimes heartbreaking book, they have found a worthy chronicler.The Finest Hotel in Kabul by Lyse Doucet is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£25).

There’s a fair bit to enjoy here, although perhaps it’s best experienced on TV over Christmas in a Quality Street stupor. GoldenEye was the first to starPierce Brosnanas 007, the first to see Judi Dench as M, and the first film to challenge its own franchise identity. As M crisply says to Bond: “I think you are a sexist, misogynist dinosaur and a relic of the cold war” – although her criticism of her star agent begins and ends with that description.The film gamely attempts to reposition itself in the new post-Soviet world, with a key scene (and some of the opening sequence) taking place among the discarded, crumbling statues of Soviet heroes. Perhaps even more gamely, it revives the memory of theLienz Cossackswho were chillingly repatriated to the Soviet Union after the war by the British to be slaughtered by Stalin.There are other historical points of interest: like many 90s films, it is waking up to the possibilities of the online world, with blocky computer graphics of Microsoft Internet Explorer vintage and quaint Chicago font.Alan Cummingplays a figure who was to become an almost indispensable staple of drama-thrillers for decades to come: the geeky, nerdy computer hacker who can conveniently perform near-magical feats inside a plausibly realist scenario. And yet from the current vantage point, this film, not yet entirely dominated by digital effects, looks like a 1960s-vintage second world war film.The story begins as Bond infiltrates a Soviet military facility in the 80s alongside fellow agent 006 (Sean Bean), an adventure which ends in spectacular disaster. Fast forward nine years to the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall and Bond finds himself up against a rogue Russian mob planning to steal a Soviet space weapon called GoldenEye and use it to destroy the banking system, after removing all the money from it … or something. In fact, the exact point of stealing the GoldenEye system seems a bit sketchy. James comes into contact with super-sexy dom Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), sweetly romantic Natalya Simonova (Polish-Swedish star Izabella Scorupco) and corrupt Russian General Ourumov (Gottfried John).Robbie Coltranecould have been given more to do as Russian spy turned gangster Valentin Zukovsky, or indeed entrusted with the actual villain role, and Joe Don Baker is good-ol’-boy CIA man Jack Wade.In truth, I was never quite persuaded of Pierce Brosnan as 007, personable though his post-Bond career has proved to have been; he seems to be very close to the Roger Moore model, with elaborately tailored suits and self-aware cuff-shooting sophistication privileged over fisticuffs and action, and yet he is not given much actual on-screen humour.

But this rereleased 1957 Hammer shocker from the screenwriter Jimmy Sangster and the veteran director Terence Fisher, shows the way it should be done – with unpretentious energy and sly macabre gusto. In vivid Eastmancolor, it’s a film electrified with its own melodramatic crassness, unencumbered with good taste and certainly uninterested in making either Frankenstein or his creature in any way tragically sympathetic.Peter Cushing plays the brilliant and fatally hubristic scientist Victor Frankenstein; the young Melvyn Hayes has a notable juve-lead role in flashback as the supercilious young Victor. Working with his sorrowingly reluctant colleague and former tutor Paul (Robert Urquhart), Frankenstein secretly constructs a new human from gruesome body parts, robbing gibbets and bribing charnel house attendants in the process; he drops surplus anatomical items into his acid bath, a horrible item that inevitably plays a homicidal role later.The resulting Homo sapiens is to be the tall and rather distinguished-looking Christopher Lee. But Dr Frankenstein needs a top-quality brain from the kind of high-calibre individual unlikely to be found on the gallows, so the movie ingeniously contrives for him to set upon a bizarre murderous plan, involving a gasp-inducingly effective stunt and a vision ofRembrandt’s painting The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp, which Frankenstein is incidentally supposed to have bought. And to top it all off, this Dr Frankenstein is no romantic hero; he is cheating on his delicate fiancee Elizabeth (Hazel Court) with his smirking maidservant Justine (Valerie Gaunt) – and both women are to receive a terrible fate at the malformed hands of this lumbering monster.The creature himself is not a tragically pained or unhappy figure: he is simply violent; and the whole story is crisply told at a racy 83 minutes – making it suitable for a double-bill, of course – and yet it is delivered with absolute seriousness and conviction. The spinning wheel that channels the electricity might have inspired the design for the time machinein the Rod Taylor moviethat came three years later.The Curse of Frankenstein is in UK cinemas from 2 October, and on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from 13 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsFilm adaptationsChristopher LeePeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But in Asia, the 71-year-old works all the time, still doing his own stunts, as well as working as a producer and fight choreographer.This Macau-set cops-and-robbers thriller even has a little fun by introducing him as a “retired” cop turned dog walker called Wong, surrounded by a motley pack of pooches that he marshals expertly through the streets. Once the best surveillance man on the force, Wong’s observational skills have not faded a jot, as he proves by recounting exactly which of his doggie charges pooped in what order. More importantly, he can still take on young ruffians a third of his age, and as expected he ends up doing battle with a variety of unlikely props in peculiar settings, such as a hotel laundry room and the crawlspace above a restaurant.It’s Chan’s fisticuff scenes that make this watchable, with quite a bit to savour in a film that’s never more than 10 minutes from a fight or a shootout. Unfortunately, the connective narrative tissue is a bore, an overly complicated yarn about a criminal mastermind called the Shadow (Tony Ka Fai Leung) and his duplicitous team of thieves who steal a whatsit that allows them to access crypto, all discussed in rapid-fire dialogue that will challenge the subtitle-reading skills of viewers who don’t speak the language.The cops, meanwhile, are overly reliant on AI supercomputers to solve crimes, which is why they need Wong to teach them how to do surveillance the old way. Likable Zifeng Zhang co-stars as a young policewoman who can pack a killer punch, and who happens to be the daughter of Wong’s now-deceased partner, killed in the line of duty because of Wong’s mistake. The sentimental flashbacks further distend a way-too-long running time, but it’s always a treat to watch Chan, even if he’s looking a little rough around the edges these days.The Shadow’s Edge is in UK cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsThrillersJackie ChanHong KongAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

We are all children of someone, many of us parents too, and she finds it odd that so few representations of such a common experience exist.In her 2011 novelNight Waking, she combines the story of Anna, an Oxford academic worn ragged by bringing up her boys, Raphael and Moth, with a historical investigation into infant mortality. It is set on a deserted Hebridean island, where her neglectful husband Giles – so lightly drawn, he is scarcely a character at all – is preoccupied by tracking the declining puffin population. The novel juxtaposes the messy business of 21st-century child-rearing with speculations on the parental attitudes of an even messier past.Universal though child-rearing may be, one parent’s sleep-deprived night is much like another’s. On the page, Anna’s attempts to pursue a career while catering to the demands of a needy toddler and a fatalistic seven-year-old, although repetitious and familiar, do at least gather a sort of delirious intensity. On the stage, by contrast, the lack of tonal variation is wearing.This is especially the case given the decision by writer Shireen Mula and director Rebecca Atkinson-Lord ofAn Tobar and Mull Theatreto adapt the book for a single actor. There is some sense in this: the novel is told entirely from Anna’s put-upon perspective. But however sharply actor Nicola Jo Cully marks the transitions from character to character – and she marks them very sharply indeed – it is a laborious way to tell a story.Against Hugo Dodsworth’s large-scale projections of island landscapes, Cully captures the stresses and insecurities of a multitasking mother, but a production that seems to want to make a point about rural deprivation comes across as a more trivial tale of self-absorption.Touring until 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTraverse theatreSarah MossreviewsShareReuse this content"

Well, most of the time there weren’t, although this exhibition does introduce you to one. From the Old Kingdom to the time of Cleopatra, the ancient Egyptians expected very much the same things of their artists, in a style that barely changed. An extraordinary limestone stela, or engraved slab, that was lent to the Fitzwilliam by the Louvre shows how young Egyptian artists were taught to see in the “correct” way, to make nature conform to the official style. A square grid demonstrates how to calculate proportions to render, for instance, a cat in a perfectly still profile, like a little feline god, an abstraction that was to be repeated for millennia.Yet Made in Ancient Egypt strives to take you beyond the sublime formal facade to glimpse the artists or, as it calls them more cautiously, “makers” behind the golden coffin portraits and pharaohs’ statues. “Who built the seven gates of Thebes?” asked Bertolt Brecht in his poem A Worker Reads History. Here they are, the metalworkers, woodworkers, weavers. In a wooden model made about 4,000 years ago, female workers seated on the ground weave on a loom while others stand spinning thread. You can see a fine example of such women’s handiwork, a white dress made 4,500 years ago. It hangs up, spooky as hell.View image in fullscreenCommemorative stela of the faience maker, Rekhamun, 1295-1186BC.Photograph: © National Museums ScotlandBut it was the one famous artistic genius here who held me most. A sculpted head of a girl in red quartzite, her eyes now empty almond-shaped holes, has a tiny face but a huge bald dome of a head, out of proportion with her delicate features. It comes from a period when Egypt’s cultural continuity was radically interrupted by the reign of Akhenaten from about 1353 to 1336BC. He revolutionised religion and encouraged artists to go wild, go real. The girl is probably one of his daughters, exuding eerie beauty. But there’s more. Found at Akhenaten’s capital Amarna, this masterpiece comes from a house near that of the star sculptor Thutmosis, whose home and workshop was discovered by German archaeologists in 1912. It has his style. He also created Egypt’s most famous work, the bust of Nefertiti. This anything but sensationalist exhibition leaves you to deduce that the two are probably by the same artist: the ancient Egyptian Leonardo.But this was a world in which art was too important to be sold and auctioned, exhibited and criticised. It was part of a religion dedicated to life after death and most ancient Egyptian art comes from tombs, where it had magical purposes. Even here, individual creators made their mark – often literally. In a frieze between two gods, an artist has scratched a now illegible name. Another maker has left a handprint beneath a clay “soul house”, a home for the dead.Documents hint at working conditions, which weren’t too bad. Ancient Egypt seems not to have been the oppressive slave-society stereotypes suggest. On this evidence, it was a land of skilled craftspeople who could make demands on employers. A record of work absences from the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings, inscribed on limestone almost 4,000 years ago, records the entire workforce taking two days off for a colleague’s funeral. You imagine it was a beer-fuelled sendoff.View image in fullscreenSheer skill … Glass Bottle in the Form of a Bunch of Grapes, 1295-1069BC.Photograph: Maurice et Pierre Chuzeville/© Musée du Louvre, Dist. Grand Palais Rmn. Photo Maurice et Pierre ChuzevilleThese skilled people – “hemut” – could be so successful they got fancy funerals, the aspiration of all ancient Egyptians, and put up monuments that record not just individuals but their families, for talents such as working with bronze, which were passed down, just like craft skills would be around the world for millennia to come.A block-like model here shows artists how a sphinx should be made, but ultimately this fascinating quest for the hands that carved the Great Sphinx is quixotic. There is an ineffable mystery to ancient Egypt. Where it succeeds is in making you look at Egyptian art beyond the magic and mythology to admire the sheer skill: wooden chairs with animal-feet legs, a glass bottle in the form of a bunch of grapes, an exquisite copy of the Book of the Dead. You marvel at the precision, passion and playfulness of ancient Egypt’s creators.Every artist leaves an autobiography, in their dedication and flamboyance, even in the skills passed on through Egypt’s history, which came together in this culture’s great collective work – the commemoration and preservation of the dead. The wooden board that lay over the mummy of a man who died 3,000 years ago resembles a spaceship designed to take him to the stars. On the inside, there’s a gold painting of a solar boat in which he might journey through the sky. This is art for eternal life’s sake. But it is also art that preserves the name of a worker, for the deceased is Nespawershefyt who had risen to be an overseer of craftsmen at a temple. His team saw him off in style, with a golden visage as fine as a pharaoh’s.“The books are filled with names of kings,” complained Brecht’s history-reading worker. But Nespawershefyt’s name survives through art.Made in Ancient Egypt is atThe Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, from 3 October to 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtCambridgeExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not to mention the newly restored baronial estates where you can stay for the price of an average British B&B. This region, known as Kurzeme, is almost the size of Yorkshire (population: 5.5 million) but with a mere 240,000 inhabitants.Kurzeme (also known by its German name, Courland) has 180 miles of undeveloped coastline and a good proportion of Latvia’s 1,200 castles and mansions, as well as the ancient valley of the Abava River, listed by World Monuments Watch as one of “100 endangered unique cultural monuments”.It also boasts Kuldīga, a Unesco world heritage town, and Liepāja an upcoming European capital of culture (2027) – full of languishing art nouveau architecture, and enough former Soviet collective farms, KGB watch towers and military barracks to remind us that history really is just a breath away.View image in fullscreenLiepāja’ St Nicholas’s Orthodox Naval Cathedral overlooks ramshackle Soviet apartments.Photograph: Petr Maderic/AlamyThe Latvian bus system is excellent and extremely cheap but I rented a car for a few days to maximise my time. My tour began in Sabile, a town on the River Abava – whose crystalline, beaver-filled waters flow from Kandava to Kuldīga (Sabile is also home to several vineyards where Latvian wine can be tasted). Here, one misty cacophonous morning, I casually flipped open my Merlin birding app. Within minutes it had identified 25 birds including sedge warblers, golden orioles and spotted fly catchers and I had seen marsh harriers. Apparently such a wide variety is perfectly normal: Latvia’s bogs, wetlands, coastal lagoons and ancient forests (53% of the country is woodland while 5% is wetlands) make it one of northern Europe’s best birding sites.Just a few minutes’ drive outside town is thePedvāle Art Park, a 100-hectare nature reserve where storks pick their way through swathes of wild lupins and 195 contemporary sculptures from across the world. Founder Ojārs Feldbergs told me the Abava valley is home to 800 species of plant and animal, as well as crusader castles and Viking graves. “It was once a trading route for amber,” he tells me. “The Baltic Sea is the world’s richest source of Baltic gold, which was transported to St Petersburg and the east through this valley for centuries.”Later, the bucolic beauty and clean waters of the Abava valley, along with its therapeutic sulphur springs, attracted hundreds of German aristocracy, giving the region a disproportionate number of baronial estates. Though these fell into disrepair during the Soviet era when they became collective farms, tractor houses and pig farms, in the past decade many have been painstakingly restored as boutique hotels.View image in fullscreenOld wooden staircase leading dowm toJūrkalne beach and the Baltic Sea.Photograph: Regina Marcenkiene/AlamyAtKukšu Manor(guided tour €5), I gawped at lavishly painted ceilings and jaw-dropping frescoes. Here, for €185 for a double room, anyone can live, fleetingly, as a Baltic baron. Just north of the valley, I strolled in the walled gardens, vineyards and frescoed state rooms ofNurmuiža Castle and Spa, an elegantly restored estate where you can dip in a wild swimming lake as cranes and storks fly overhead, and double rooms cost from €80. Alternatively, atPadure Manornear Kuldīga, a reconstruction-in-progress often used for film sets, €40 will buy you a bedroom and access to the musty Soviet library that came with the house.The high street – not a single chain store in sight – includes a needle museum, a merchant’s house, and craft shops where I splashed out on handknitted socks for my kidsKuldīga itself, a charmingly dusty town, became Unesco-protected in 2023, thanks to its 17th-century wooden architecture and striking location above Europe’s widest waterfall, the Venta Rapid – crossed via Europe’s longest brick road bridge.

With its lush parks, sandy white beaches and strollable streets of gently decaying baroque and art nouveau buildings, Liepāja makes a great base for exploring the south-west corner of Kurzeme. I stayed in the historicArt Hotel Roma(doubles from €80 a night which includes access to the hotel’s art collection) and ate as often as I could at an exquisitely restored lodgings once frequented by Peter the Great:Madame Hoyer’s Guest House.

Today, it’s a ghostly swill of pristine coastline, brutalist architecture and graffitied Soviet watch towers, with the gold-encrusted domes of the Russian Orthodox St Nicholas Naval Cathedral gleaming, surreally and extravagantly, from its midst.To fully grasp Latvia’s extraordinary, violent history, I took a guided tour of Karosta prison, one of only a few former military jails in Europe open to visitors. Here, windowless cells once housed revolutionaries, miscreant soldiers and officers of the tsarist army, the Soviet army, the Latvian army, as well as deserters of the German Wehrmacht and “enemies” of Stalin – many of whom had used their metal buttons to scratch their initials into the concrete walls. A little unusually, Karosta prison offers all-night stays (ranging from €15-60 a night) for anyone not averse to paranormal activities – it’s been voted the most haunted place in the world by Ghost Hunters International. I opted, instead, for a recuperative beer from one of Liepāja’s burgeoning microbreweries, mulling over an intriguing part of the world, far from the usual tourist haunts.The writer travelled independently using the extensive network of Kurzeme’s tourist information offices and with help fromlatvia.travel.

It is also one that, until a shamefully short time ago, I attributed to Albert Einstein, because it turns out it’s apparently enough for me just to see a quote in cursive text overlaying a black-and-white photo of a famous person for me to believe it was said by them.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Anyway, now that summer is over, most of us are left feeling that most of the year’s drinking is safely out of the way. Autumn is the hangover of the calendar year. Spring is the pre-drinks, summer the big blow-out and winter is the enormous, restorative takeaway. And when I think about hangovers, I often think of the bloody mary. It’s one of those drinks whose origins are shrouded in mystery, but the most commonly received wisdom is that it was created byFernand Petiotin the 1920s, when he was working atHarry’s New York Bar in Paris(which, at the time, was simply called the New York Bar).The International Bartenders Associationrecognises the drink as a mix of vodka, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, celery salt and pepper, which is how stickler devotees might enjoy it. And I am one of them. If you’re making bloody mary from scratch, you’re instructed to stir all these ingredients over ice, then pour them into a tall glass filled with fresh ice. This means it’s passed through ice twice before drinking, but I like my bloody marys for their, ahem, blood-like viscosity, so I stir only very sparingly.Bloody mary purists look away now: I’ve also been seeing a rise of interest in bloody marias, or bloody marys made with tequila, mezcal or another agave spirit. So I asked Pritesh Mody, creative director atThink Drinks, why this might be: “Good quality tequila and mezcal naturally have contrasting bright and vegetal notes that complement tomato juice,” he says. “Mezcal, in particular, touches on the zeitgeist for smoky flavours and, with the continued ‘premiumisation’ in spirits, those with provenance are eroding the vodka market, which is probably why we’re seeing this switch.”And, if your body doesn’t mind further assault, getting back on the proverbial horse with one or three bloody marys may be as good a salve as any – though I’m not entirely sure of the science behind that one, sorry.Four bloody mary premixes for sore headsBloody Drinks classic bloody mary£3.50 (250ml) Sainsbury’s, 6.3%.

Seeing it for the first time, when it was published in 2012, I remember thinking how daring it was to produce a book with a stripped-away spine, leaving its binding and pea-green stitching exposed. This choice was a practical one, however, because it allowed the book to open completely, meaning it lies (or leans) absolutely flat, which makes it feel like the most obliging book, with no threat whatsoever of it flipping closed at precisely the moment you need to check an instruction while your hands are covered with dough.The page that didn’t flip closed last week was 62, Russell’s basic pizza or pizzette dough, which is a great and effective recipe that I have made on and off since 2012, and a recipe that not only survived the scrutiny of the cooking teacherCarla Tomasi, but was even endorsed by her. (Although she did apply her way of kneading the dough: working in the bowl with wet hands, rather than on a floured board, so as not to incorporate more flour, and using a series of folding pulls that create more elasticity.) Russell and Carla, stretching together.The two also gave much the same advice on quick-to-make, quick-to-bake small pizzas and pizzette: you make them, you eat them, you get on with it. And you also top them however you want, although I highly recommend Russell’s combination of courgette, mozzarella, parmesan and mint.Pizzette with courgette, mozzarella and mintMakes1215gfresh yeast, or 7g fast-action dried yeast500g strong white bread flour,plus extra for dusting15g fine salt2 tbspolive oil,plus extra for greasing200gwell-drained mozzarella, thinly sliced50g grated parmesan24 mint leaves1 courgette, thinly sliced (a mandoline is useful here)Extra-virgin olive oilChilli flakes,to serve (optional)Working in a bowl or jug, measure in 320g tepid water, then stir in the yeast and wait for a few minutes.Put the flour, salt, the water and yeast mix and the olive oil in a large bowl and, using your hand like a dough hook, gradually bring it all together into a rough ball. Rub the dough from your hand, then rub both hands with a little water or oil. Still working in the bowl, knead the dough with a folding movement, bringing the edges up and over so the it smooths into a ball. Cover and rest in a warm place until it has doubled in size, which will take an hour or two, depending on room temperature.Tip the risen dough on to a lightly floured work surface and cut it into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then arrange on a lightly floured tray or tea towel, cover and leave to rise for 30 minutes. (The balls can also be stored in the fridge for up to 24 hours, just remember to pull them out 30 minutes before baking.)Heat the oven to 250C (230C fan)/490F/gas 9½, and put a flat baking tray inside. Working on lightly floured surface, roll the balls into discs about 20cm across. Working with a couple of pizzette at a time, top the dough first with a couple of bits of mozzarella and some parmesan, then a few bits of torn mint, and a few rounds of courgette. Sprinkle with salt, zigzag with olive oil, then use a pizza paddle or similar to lift the pizzette on to the hot baking tray. Bake for six to eight minutes, then serve topped with a bit more good olive oil and some red chilli flakes, if you like.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodPizzaCheeseVegetablesHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"
