He is preparing for battle against the ‘enemy within’Fri 17 Oct 2025 12.51 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 17.55 EDTShareDonald Trump had better hope the members of the Nobel committee are not paying attention to what’s happening inside the United States. If they did take a look, they’d notice a jarring pattern. While the US president likes to play the peacemaker abroad, at home he is Trump, bringer of war.It’s easy for the first fact to conceal, or divert our attention away from, the second. This week was a case in point. It began with Trump travelling to Israel, where he was hailed as a latter-day Cyrus, a mighty ruler whose name would be spoken of for millennia to come, the man who had brokered what he himself boasts is an“everlasting” peace.Never mind that Trump’s success, for which he certainly deserves some credit, was in pushing Hamas and Israel to agree a ceasefire and release of hostages and prisoners, a fragile arrangement that does not address, let alone solve, the underlying Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He presented it as a triumph of the ages and one more notch on his peacemaker’s bedpost, taking the tally of wars he claims to have ended to eight.Indeed, buoyed up by his success, he is having another go at the one he thought would be easy but which, to his irritation, has proved as complex as all the hated experts and deep state naysayers warned it would be: Russia’s war on Ukraine. On Thursday he announced his plan to meet yet again with Vladimir Putin, this timehosted by Viktor Orbánin Budapest (which has the happy side-benefit of trolling the EU).Unfazed by the failure of their last meeting in Alaska, and by his own failure ever to stand up to Putin, Trump clearly believes he has pacific momentum and that the healing magic his touch brought to Gaza will similarly unite Moscow and Kyiv.But what undermines this new, Nobel-ready look of Trump’s is not only the absurd braggadocio, or even the confusion of the style and optics of peacemaking for the substance and hard graft it requires. It is the fact that he is fomenting war at home on his own citizens. I am not speaking metaphorically. Increasingly, serious analysts not prone to hyperbole are warning that Trump seems bent onprovoking a second American civil war. The evidence is piling up.The most obvious is Trump’s deployment of US troops on the streets of America’s cities. He claims that his original decisions to send in the National Guard to Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, Portland and Memphis were motivated solely by concern over crime. In his telling, these places were “overrun” by violence and local police needed his help. But that doesn’t stack up.The data showsthat most of the cities Trump has targeted havelowerrates of violent crime than other large cities that have remained untouched. (Of the 10 major US cities with the biggest crime problems, Trump has hit only one: Memphis.) So why would Trump be sending in the troops?One explanation is that he lives in such a closed filter bubble, his sources of information so narrow, that he is not in possession of the actual facts. Earlier this month, he described Portland, Oregon as a “burning hellhole”, adding that “You see fires all over the place. You see fights, and I mean just violence. It’s just so crazy.” The people of Portland – cycling or taking their kids to the park, as normal – were bemused. It seemedTrump had been watching Fox News, confusing footage from the riots of 2020 with today.But none of this is a mistake. For what the likes of Chicago, LA and Portland have in common is not imagined rates of runaway crime but something that angers Trump much more: they are Democrat-run cities in Democrat-led states. (The giveaway is that Cleveland, Ohio and Kansas City, Missouri have higher rates of violent crime but are under Republican governors. So they have been left alone.)This is a political act by Trump, designed to intimidate potential strongholds of opposition. Some critics suspect the administration hopes to provoke violence from those whose cities now feel like occupied territory. Perhaps a riot or an attack on the military that can be instantly spun, as the assassination of Charlie Kirk was, as an act of leftist terrorism that merits a further crackdown, seizure of emergency powers or suspension of liberties.Others believe this is about normalising the presence of troops on the streets before next year’s midterm elections, a crucial contest that could see Republicans lose the House of Representatives, handing Democrats a serious check on Trump’s power. In this view, troops will be in place either to scare away minorities and others who might usually vote for the Democratic party, or for the battle after polling day, to enforce an attempt by the White House to void results that don’t go their way. Think of a re-run of 6 January 2021 – except this time with the armed forces on hand to ensure Trump’s will is done.The obvious objection to this scenario is that the US military would surely refuse to let itself be used as a partisan political instrument. But that is to miss what Trump and Pete Hegseth – now rebranded not as secretary of defence, but as secretary of war – are doing to the US military. Witness last month’s jawdropping meeting of hundreds of top US admirals and generals, gathered from across the globe. Trump could not have been clearer, instructing them that they now faced an “enemy from within”, that their job was to deal with “civil disturbances” and that they should regard America’s “dangerous cities as training grounds”. At one point, Hegseth said that any officer who disagreed with the new, Trumpian conception of the US military should “do the honorable thing and resign”.All of this comes in the context of a president who is nakedly using the justice system to punish his critics – notethe indictment issued on Thursdayagainst his former national security adviser John Bolton – whose chief adviser called the Democratic party a “domestic extremist organisation” even before the Kirk killing; that sends masked agents to snatch people, including US citizens, off the streets; that is using the government shutdown to eliminate “Democrat agencies”, meaning those pockets of the independent civil service that might act as a restraint on presidential whim, while cutting funds to institutions, from the universities topublic broadcasting, that might do the same; and that is imposing ideological orthodoxy on the entire federal bureaucracy, with the FBI’s firing of an employee who haddisplayed the pride flagonly the latest example.Trump likes talking the peace talk when it comes to Palestinians and Israelis or Russians and Ukrainians. But inside the US, where red meets blue, he does not see a contest between rivals but rather a conflict with an enemy headmits he hates– one that has to be fought by any means necessary, even to the very end.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s got the perfect meet-cute (boob, crashed car, injured dog); the perfect combination of realism and romance (especially for non-romantics like me); the perfect heroine (neither the hot mess nor the manic pixie dream girl we are so often forced to accept); the perfect hero (laid-back but not lazy, older but not creepy, patient, not a pillock) and perfect writing.View image in fullscreenLike real life with all the good lines jammed together  … Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer in Colin from Accounts.Photograph: Joel PratleyIn my reviewI said it was like real life with all the good lines jammed closer together and I stand by that. It depicts ordinarily messy lives and every moment – funny, sad or any point in between – feels true. And then theydid it all again for a second series. Matchless. The fact that the writers and stars, Harriet Dyer and Patrick Brammall, are actually married is the icing on the cake. Imagine such joy being out there in the real world.Lucy Mangan, Guardian TV criticLast Tango in HalifaxView image in fullscreenA masterclass in romance … Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi in Last Tango in Halifax.Photograph: Album/AlamyOnly Sally Wainwright could give us a love story groaning with arthritis and chuckling with glee. It uses the simplest of plot devices – simplicity is hard – a letter that was never delivered 50 years ago. I bet lots of romcom stars on this list are glowing and shiny and young, but step back kids to watch Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi give a masterclass. Most romcoms are short, sharp bursts, as if happiness can’t last and we need to hit the end credits before the arguments start. But Last Tango has already run for five seasons, with incredible invention putting that central love story to the test. It’s even possible to imagine that Anne Reid’s Celia would be voting Reform now, and that’s a season I’d love to see. My favourite scene has to be the end of the very first episode, where the two lovers meet and ignite almost immediately, with both their daughters hot on their heels – two women destined to become endless enemies. Look at the amount of story in that!And who says it’s over? More please, Sally.Russell T Davies, creator of Queer As Folk and It’s a SinFeel GoodView image in fullscreenGiddy … Mae Martin and Charlotte Ritchie in Feel Good.Photograph: Channel 4There is plenty of both rom and com inFeel Good, though the title offers a promise of cheer that it has no intention of delivering, at least in any conventional form. Mae Martin plays a comedian called Mae Martin, who gets together with George (Charlotte Ritchie), AKA “Dangerous Mary Poppins”, who has previously only dated men. The giddiness of the falling-in-love part is done briskly, mostly via montage. What follows is a funny, tender and sensitive look at obsession, trauma and the hard work that goes into a long-term partnership, when the bright flash of falling hard for someone has subsided. Its two seasons are warmly human, bittersweet and quite lovely.Rebecca Nicholson, TV criticHim & HerView image in fullscreenNailing it … Sarah Solemani as Becky and Russell Tovey as Steve in Him & Her.Photograph: Guy Levy/Big TalkStefan Golaszewski’sHim & Heris a love story set in a bedsit inhabited by Steve and Becky (Russell Tovey and Sarah Solemani), who are both drowning and stewing in their own domesticity. It features two of the funniest and warmest performances in comedy history, Russell nailing many moments of physical comedy in a subdued setting, making us root for him in every scene, while Sarah’s subtle yet hilarious glances toward her desperately trying boyfriend make it one of the most authentic romcoms ever. The show gradually sprawls outward into the lives of horrendous bridezilla sister Laura, her sweet victim Shelly, closeted-himbo Paul and the cringe-inducing tagalong Dan, and constantly proves that a really good comedy only needs one little shithole flat and perfectly drawn characters trying to see past each others’ flaws.Jack Rooke, creator of Big BoysLovesickView image in fullscreenTotal recall … Antonia Thomas as Evie and Johnny Flynn as Dylan in Lovesick.Photograph: Brian SweeneyLovesickhad the rockiest of births – it was canned by Channel 4 after a single season, perhaps because it aired under the legitimately disastrous titleScrotal Recall– only to flourish on Netflix as one of the smartest, sweetest comedies of the last decade. When Johnny Flynn’s Dylan is diagnosed with chlamydia, he’s forced to contact everyone he has ever slept with, offering him a chance to re-examine old relationships and grow as a person. All of this edges him closer to Evie (Antonia Thomas), the old university friend with whom he’s secretly in love. Cleverly structured, perfectly executed and sincere in its emotions, Lovesick deserves its place in the pantheon.Stuart Heritage, Guardian writerInsecureView image in fullscreenDeliciously funny … Issa Rae and Jay Ellis in Insecure.Photograph: Raymond Liu/Warner MediaIssa Rae’sInsecureis easily my favourite romcom of all time. Not only was it great, not only was it hella Black, it was deliciously funny and compelling. As a millennial, Insecure was one of the first shows that felt completely relatable as someone trying to navigate adulthood, friendships and love. I loved how honest and flawed every character was, yet you rooted for everyone. This led to the most juicy storylines and plot twists. It’s no secret that this series was a major inspiration for my seriesDreaming Whilst Black.Adjani Salmon, creator of Dreaming Whilst BlackCatastropheView image in fullscreenRings absolutely true … Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney.Photograph: Channel 4When Rob finds out that Sharon is pregnant after their week-long transatlantic fling, he unforgettably declares: “A terrible thing has happened. Let’s make the most of it!” Over its four seasons, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney’sCatastrophetries to do just that – and ends up with them married with two kids and pregnant with a third. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill first love romcom; it’s a brutal, truthful depiction of the endless endurance test that is parenting young kids while trying to carve out a happy-enough existence with a partner. It deals with the big ​stuff life throws at you increasingly as middle age marches on – addiction, strokes, ​death, affairs – ​but, God, it has beautiful moments in between all the hilarious barbs. Sharon and Rob’s last act – jumping in for a spontaneous dip while their kids nap in the car despite the “danger: rip currents” sign on the beach – seemed more tragic than romantic (are they floating through life together or drifting to certain death?) but it did ring absolutely true. It also gave us one of the greatest TV endings ever.Kate Abbott, Guardian TV editorNobody Wants ThisView image in fullscreenDelightful … Kristen Bell and Adam Brody in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixIt’s often said romcoms stand or fall on the charm of the leads, and Kristen Bell as sex-dating podcaster Joanne and Adam Brody as “Hot Rabbi” Noah are a casting coup for the millennial audience. They share an easy chemistry, one of the most perfect first onscreen kisses in memory and, while Noah isn’t completely unproblematic (wasn’t the offhand treatment of his ex a little brutal?), it’s a genuine relief to crush on a male love interest who isn’t dark or twisted – but justquite delightful. Did I mention his beard?Mhairi McFarlane, author of romantic comedy novel Cover StorySex and the CityView image in fullscreenRevolutionary … Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City.Photograph: HBOSex and the Citywas the blueprint for everything that has come since, but I wonder if we’ve collectively forgotten how revolutionary it was back then. Based on Candace Bushnell’s New York Observer column (and later book), her trials of dating in New York were given heart and structure by gay men (Darren Star and Michael Patrick King). After a decade of sexual puritanism necessitated by the Aids crisis, Star and King were able to put uninhibited sex back on the agenda through the lens of metropolitan singletons Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte. They have become the archetypes; they are iconoclasts. One was romantic, searching for her Big romance; another was career driven; Samantha was a sexual conquistador; and Charlotte was bound by old-fashioned dating rules. Much of what has followed owes a great debt to SATC. No longer is a woman defined by the man she ends up with; she’s defined as the woman she had to become in readiness for meaningful love. Though let us never speak ofAnd Just Like That.Juno Dawson, author and creator of Sex and the City podcastSo I Got to ThinkingStarstruckView image in fullscreenA gift to single people … Rose Matafeo and Nikesh Patel in Starstruck.Photograph: Album/AlamyRose Matafeo’sStarstruckwas a gift to single people deprived of sex and intimacy when it first aired as we came out of lockdown. Not only was it a very funny nod to the romcoms we grew up on: a will-they won’t-they with cinema worker Jessie (Matafeo) and movie star Tom (Nikesh Patel). But it made the potential to date and fall in love feel tangible again – along with all the awkward, painful and thrilling moments. Take the glorious scene where Jessie leaves a one-night stand on a barge and is so ecstatic that she dances to Return of the Mack in the sun along Regent’s Canal in London (there is something extra-romantic about a love story playing out in the city you live in). The most wonderful moment, though, is when Jessie purposely misses her bus stop at the end of series one, because she wants to stay with Tom and give it a go. They nervously stare out of the window, smiling – then turn towards each other and launch into a massive snog. A real joy for all of us who know, oh so well, that tummy-flipping feeling of desperately not wanting a bus to come at all after a great first date.Hollie Richardson, Guardian assistant TV editorQueer As FolkView image in fullscreenGroundbreaking … Craig Kelly and Aidan Gillen in Queer As Folk.Photograph: Channel 4It’s not strictly a romcom. But it is funny. And romantic. And sexy. And sex positive (take that now mythic rimming scene between Charlie Hunnam and Aidan Gillen in episode one). In an era when, before it aired, MPs were debating cancelling EastEnders because it showed two men kissing,Queer As Folkmade being gay seem cool. Glamorous even. Which was groundbreaking even when I watched it as a teenager in the 2000s on a DVD box set bought at our local Oxfam.Alex Lawther, star of Alien: Earth and Leonard and Hungry PaulThe Office (US)View image in fullscreenSo special … John Krasinski as Jim and Jenna Fischer as Pam in The Office (US).Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIt’s not a traditional romcom, but there are a couple of romances in the US version ofThe Officethat I love. Jim and Pam are so clearly in love with each other, and watching it you want it to happen so much – because their relationship is just so normal, but also so special. There’s also Michael and Holly. It’s not a traditional romance. He’s so pathetic and needy, and sometimes his behaviour is so worm-like, until he meets Holly, who is basically the female version of him. She’s silly and dorky, but also really sweet and completely in love with him, despite who he is. Suddenly Michael relaxes as a person, he just has this peace, and I think that’s really beautiful. It is so pure and wholesome. Watching it, you’re just overcome with absolute joy.Harriet Kemsley, co-host of Single Ladies in Your Area podcastEver Decreasing CirclesView image in fullscreenLove as it really feels … Richard Briers as Martin Bryce, Peter Egan as Paul Ryman and Penelope Wilton as Anne Bryce EverDecreasing Circles.Photograph: BBCDig beneath the 1970ness of it and you’ll find the first attempt in sitcom to reflect love as it really is, as it really feels, without the trinkets and the fakery or the emotional bleach of gags. Penelope Wilton stands at the centre of it, giving a performance of profound truth. She transforms the flat, bloodless sitcom wife role into a nuanced portrait of love, frustration and endurance.Stefan Golaszewski, creator of Him & Her, Mum and MarriageSpacedExquisite … Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes in Spaced.Spacedis mainly remembered for splicing the sitcom form with nerdy pop culture parody and bottling gen X social mores in the process. Really, it’s a heartstoppingly romantic comedy. We kick off with a meet-cute in a greasy spoon: Jessica Hynes’s wannabe journalist Daisy is flat-hunting via a copy of Loot (the year is 1999) and starts chatting toSimon Pegg’s wannabe comic book artist Tim. Yet the pair’s instant soulmate energy is quickly sublimated into comic shenanigans when they pose as a couple to secure a dream rental. It takes a maddeningly long time for life to imitate the lie. Luckily, the interim is stuffed with ingenious jokes and giddying stylistic invention. And we get to hang out with Daisy, perhaps the most recognisably human female protagonist in romcom history (and definitely the funniest and most likable). The whole thing ends with exquisite understatement: a 45-degree head tilt and one of the greatest needle drops ever. It’s more than worth the wait.Rachel Aroesti, Guardian TV writerTryingView image in fullscreenHappily ever after … Esther Smith and Rafe Spall in Trying.Photograph: Colin Hutton/Apple TVIf anyTryingfans don’t know, they won’t be surprised at all to learn that Rafe Spall and Esther Smith became a couple while filming Andy Wolton’s gorgeous Richard Curtis-ish comedy. They are Jason and Nikki, who cannot have kids, wish to adopt, and have eccentric friends and family. All that’s fine … but the magic is in the chemistry between the two leads, which is right in that golden zone between enviable and relatable. She’s a worrier and he’s a joker, but she’s emotionally braver; he seems to calm her nervous excesses but probably needs his partner’s reassurance more. They interlock so neatly and so sweetly.Jack Seale, Guardian TV writerBlueyView image in fullscreenSurely the greatest tale of canine love … Chilli and Bandit in Bluey.Sure,Blueyis most frequently seen as a kids show, given that it’s: a) a cartoon b) a cartoon about dogs and c) definitely a kids show. But, like all great TV for children, inside lurks something that only parents can appreciate: a heartwarming spot of romance. Behind the wildly creative tales of childhood development lies the love of Chilli and Bandit. We see them bicker, make up and express a level of patience for each others’ foibles that is borderline superhuman – despite having to deal with two high-energy kids. One entire episode is based on Bandit trying to give Chilli some alone time, another around how lifelong love looks past a partner’s grosser habits to keep passion burning – or, as the show poignantly puts it, want to “smoochy kiss”. They’re kind, considerate, tender and so in love that they’ll sideswipe you with a touching expression of desire while role-playing robots – all the classic romantic tropes. Frankly, if it weren’t so damn aspirational, it would be annoying. Surely the greatest tale of romance ever conducted between blue and orange canine.Alexi Duggins, Guardian deputy TV editorEmily in ParisView image in fullscreenKeep believing … Lily Collins as Emily and Lucas Bravo as Gabriel in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Stephanie Branchu/NetflixYou might considerEmily in Parisas merely an annoying Netflix series in which an American speaks too much English to a load of French people and which – at least initially – ticked off the good people of l’Hexagone. Not only is it not so annoying any more I just prefer to think of it as more of a performance art piece these days) it’s also my favourite TV romcom. As well as the very French menage a trois enjoyed by her boss, Sylvie, the show has also long dangled the possibility of romance between Emily and Paris’s top chef Gabriel. It has simmered away like a fine soupe à l’oignon for four seasons now, regularly hindered by miscommunications and other suitors. Such is the ridiculousness of the show, I can barely remember what happened at the end of its last season. But I do know that Emily is in Rome and that she has a new love interest, Marcello, who I’m sure will absolutely not get a well-rounded story arc in season five. Emily will be back in France before we know it, and surely reunited with Gabriel. It may be the city where she speaks her own language loudly and slowly but, well, Paris is also the city of love.Hannah J Davies, Guardian TV writerShare your favouriteYou can tell us your favourite TV romcom using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But it remains the weakest cabinet in decades and could be toppled at any moment if opposition parties join together to oust it. France faces a brutal two-month battle in parliament to achieve what once seemed the most basic element of governance: passing a budget.Political analysts argue that that the figure most damaged by the current crisis is the centrist president.The pro-Europe, pro-business Macron wasfirst elected in 2017,vowing to revolutionise politics andlisten to voterslike no one had done before. He promised a “pragmatic” cherrypicking of ideas from left and right to liberalise the economy, create jobs after decades of mass unemployment and end inequality. Crucially, he said he wanted to stop the rise of the far right by ensuring citizens hadno more reasonto vote for extremes.There were crises: thegilets jaunes(yellow vests) anti-government revolt, followed by the Covid pandemic and then the war in Ukraine. And when he was re-elected in 2022, Macron no longer had an absolute majority in parliament.But his woes deepened considerably when he gambled on calling asudden and inconclusive snap parliamentary electionin June 2024, at a time when Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (NR) was at a historic high after itsEuropean election win. Parliament is now split between three blocs: the left, the centre and the far right, which has increased its vote. No bloc has an absolute majority. Meanwhile, Macron’s centrist base has begun to fragment.“The crisis inFranceruns very deep,” said Rémi Lefebvre, a professor of political science at the University of Lille. “The problem is there are actually several crises mixed together. There’s a financial crisis of [public] debt, a social crisis of inequality, a weakness of political parties, and then there is the rise of the far right. Macron is not the sole cause of the crisis; it’s all those different factors, but Macron has accelerated those factors.”To prevent the government being ousted this week, Macron and his centrist ally, the new prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu, appealed to the Socialist party. The government offered a highly symbolic suspension of the only major change of Macron’s second term: the 2023pensions lawthat introduced a gradual rise in the retirement age from 62 to 64.Lefebvre said Macron’s second term risked looking “chaotic” and ineffective. His choice not to appoint a leftwing government last year – when aleft alliancewon the greatest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority – had been seen as damaging democracy, he said.Stewart Chau, the director of polling at Verian Group, said: “If there’s one political personality or political movement that emerges extremely weakened from the sequence which began with the snap election of July 2024, it’sEmmanuel Macronand his centrist party, Renaissance. That is clear in every study.”Polls this month have shown that only about 14-16% of voters have confidence in Macron. Even his global presence, which once boosted his image at home, no longer lifts his ratings. “His popularity has constantly declined in recent months, despite a significant international news cycle,” Chau said.Support had dropped among Macron’s voters because he was seen as lacking empathy for people’s daily concerns, Chau said.“One of Macron’s biggest promises as president had been his vow to block the path of the far-right National Rally, saying that no one would ever have reason to vote for them again,” he added.But since Macron became president, more people have voted for the RN and view the party as a credible alternative.“That is a real shift,” Chau said. “Previously, some people had voted for extremes, saying it was a protest vote. Today, a lot of French people think it’s no longer simply a protest vote, it’s an alternative – and Macron is, perhaps, responsible for that.”The political historian, Jean Garrigues, said Macron’s image was now probably the worst of any president since France’s current political system, the Fifth Republic, began in 1958.“He has dropped to an exceptional level of unpopularity but, above all, an exceptional level of hatred,” Garrigues said. “[His Socialist predecessor] François Hollande also experienced record unpopularity but didn’t experience the same level of being detested as Emmanuel Macron.”Garrigues said this public rejection had roots that ran deeper than the current crisis. Macron arrived in 2017 amid strong hope and expectation built around a kind of mythology of the “man of the moment”, he said, but disappointment followed when voters felt his promises to work with all political sides and “permanently listen to citizens” were not materialising.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeThe far rightanalysisShareReuse this content"

His clients include Jane Fonda andAndie MacDowellWhich bargain product do you swear by?I swear by a microfibre towel, or even a soft cotton T-shirt, to dry your hair. Most people don’t realise how much damage a regular bath towel can do, especially to silver or chemically treated hair. This one small change can really reduce frizz and breakage. Another inexpensive must-have is a wide-tooth comb, to use in the shower. It protects the hair while detangling and helps maintain the integrity of the strands, especially after lightening.Which product or treatment is worth splurging on?A professional-grade heat styling tool – ceramic or tourmaline, with smart temperature control. Silver and light-coloured hair can yellow or burn easily without the right iron.Which hair trend or treatment would you never recommend?DIY bleaching. Social media makes it look easy, but the reality is it’s one of the riskiest things you can do to your hair. I’ve seen people melt their hair, break it off or end up with bands of colour that are nearly impossible to correct. I also don’t recommend keratin or permanent straightening treatments on bleached or silver hair. These chemical systems are often too aggressive for already fragile strands and can cause long-term damage or discoloration.What’s the most common mistake you see in your salon?People using the wrong products for their hair type or colour. Some overuse colour-correcting purple shampoo until their silver or blond hair looks flat and dull. Others rely too much on high-protein masks and end up with stiff, brittle hair. The other major issue is heat styling without protection. If you’re using flat irons, curling irons or blow dryers without a protective product – especially on pre-lightened hair – you’re going to see yellowing, dryness and breakage.Which product, treatmentor supplement would you recommend for hair loss?Hair loss needs a multilayered approach. Topically, minoxidil is still one of the most effective treatments. I also recommend scalp serums with caffeine or peptides to stimulate circulation and support follicle health. Using a scalp detox shampoo weekly helps clear out buildup and allows treatments to work more effectively. Supplements such as Nutrafol or Viviscal Pro have also shown great results. They support the body from the inside out by addressing hormonal imbalances, stress and nutritional deficiencies.For people looking for something more advanced, PRP therapy – where your own platelet-rich plasma is injected into the scalp – can be effective. That said, I always suggest seeing a dermatologist or trichologist first. Hair loss is often tied to underlying health issues, and it’s important to get to the root cause rather than chasing surface-level fixes.View image in fullscreenAnabel KingsleyTrichologistandbrand president of Philip Kingsleyclinics and product ranges for hair lossHow often do you get your hair cutand coloured?I get my hair cut every 10 to 12 weeks, but will trim off splits at home every two weeks to keep my ends healthy, and have highlights done every eight weeks.Which bargain product do you swear by?Toppik hair fibresare absolutely amazing if you have areas of scalp visibility. The fibres cling electrostatically to your own hair, and it comes in a variety of shades, making it virtually undetectable. I used it myself in the postpartum period when I had a lot of hair fall – and also currently as I’m going through some significant shedding after having awful flu a few months ago. As hair isn’t an essential tissue, it’s the first part of you to suffer when your diet is lacking, so I would also recommend a balanced, nutritious diet.Which productor treatment is worth splurging on?If you have female pattern hair loss (FPHL), I’d say prescription hair-loss topicals. For excessive daily hair shedding, AKA telogen effluvium (TE), buying an over-the-counter product is fine, but for FPHL you really do need medicated treatment to see the best results. In my opinion, minoxidil compounded with other hair-supportive actives – such as hormones, anti-androgens and/or anti-inflammatories – works best.Which hair trendor treatment would you never recommend?Rosemary oil for hair loss. It doesn’t work. The whole thing stems from one small study done in 2015 that compared the effects of 2% minoxidil to rosemary oil. A 2% strength minoxidil isn’t enough to do much for male pattern hair loss, so the study is basically saying they work as little as each other.Also, high-dose biotin. Hardly anyone is biotin deficient, so taking it is unlikely to do your hair any good, and it can skew thyroid readings in blood tests.View image in fullscreenModel: Charlotte G at Body London. Hair and makeup: Emily Dhanjal at Arlington Artists.Photograph: Martina Lang/The GuardianWhat’s the most common mistake you see?I think the term “hair washing” should be changed to “scalp cleansing” – because the real aim of shampooing your hair is to rid your scalp of old oils, dead skin cells, sweat and environmental pollution. I see people avoiding shampooing as they think it’s bad for their hair, when in fact the opposite is true – especially if you have dandruff, which is worsened by the presence of excess oils. If oils are left on your scalp, they break down and become inflammatory.Unfortunately, what your scalp needs and what your hair likes don’t always align, so it’s a balancing act. But as long as you are gentle when you shampoo and handle wet hair with care, it won’t be damaging to your strands.Which product, treatmentor supplement would you recommend for hair loss?For FPHL, your core treatment should be minoxidil. It has the most robust evidence behind it and tends to work best when compounded with other hair-supportive actives. If you then want to try other things to support minoxidil’s effect, or you simply don’t want to or can’t use it, you could try microneedling (see a dermatologist), and perhaps PRP or low-level laser therapy.For TE, you need to do some detective work. Excessive daily shedding occurs in response to an internal factor. Sometimes, the cause is transient – such as flu, Covid or a period of intense stress – and it will resolve on its own. In other cases, thyroid imbalances or vitamin/mineral deficiencies are the driving factor – the most common being ferritin (stored iron), vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiency – and to treat the hair loss you need to treat the cause, whether that’s with supplements, dietary changes or medications. You will need a blood test to point you in the right direction. Scalp drops containing peptides, caffeine and melatonin can also help speed up recovery. Do not use minoxidil for TE. It will worsen your shedding and simply isn’t necessary in most cases.If you can, I would recommend seeing a trichologist or sympathetic dermatologist. It can be hard to determine what type of hair loss you are experiencing, and different types can also coincide.View image in fullscreenCharlotte MensahFounder of Hair Loungeand thefirst black woman to be inducted into the British Hairdressingawardshall offame. Her clients include Zadie Smith,Janelle MonáeandMichaela CoelHow often do you get your hair cutand coloured?I’m embracing my natural grey hair, so I don’t colour it. I do get regular trims to maintain the shape and health of my style – micro trims are important to prevent breakage, as split ends can travel up the hair shaft and cause further damage.Which bargain product do you swear by?A silk or satin scrunchie. The smooth, soft material significantly reduces friction, making it much gentler on the hair than traditional hair ties. This helps prevent breakage and split ends. It also maintains hairstyles for longer by minimising kinks and creases.Which product or treatment is worth splurging on?Aveda Nutriplenish deep moisture conditioneris absolutely worth the money – it’s deeply nourishing and hydrating. The formula is enriched with a vegan superfood blend of potent plant butter and oils, leaving your hair visibly hydrated and smooth.Which hair trendor treatment would you never recommend?I wouldn’t recommend the rice water rinse, especially for those with dry or brittle hair. While it’s praised for promoting protein in the hair, the problem lies in the amount of protein it introduces. Too much protein can actually make damaged hair worse, leading to increased dryness and breakage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The most effective approach is to listen carefully to what the client wants, while clearly guiding them towards what is achievable. This not only builds trust but ensures better outcomes for both the stylist and the client.Which product, treatmentor supplement would you recommend for hair loss?I’d suggest a combination of internal and external support. Viviscal hair supplements are a great place to start. They’re clinically formulated with key nutrients that promote healthy hair growth from within and help to strengthen existing hair.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tobias RegellJohan HellströmCEO of sustainable haircare brand Björn AxénHow often do you get your hair cutand coloured?I get my hair cut about every six weeks to keep it fresh and polished. I don’t colour my hair, but I keep my greys cool and unwanted yellow tones away with a silver shampoo that works perfectly for my grey hair.Which bargain product do you swear by?Coconut oil – it’s natural, affordable and multifunctional. It’s perfect as a quick hair mask or to tame frizz.Which productor treatment is worth splurging on?A really good hairdryer with ionic function. It makes a big difference for both styling and hair health, reducing frizz and drying hair faster, and causes less damage than more basic models.Which hair trendor treatment would you never recommend?At-home bleaching treatments. It can really ruin your hair if done incorrectly. Always let a professional take care of lightening your hair.What’s the most common mistake you see in your salon?People using the wrong products for their hair type. For example, in pursuit of glossy, healthy-looking hair, many use hair oil. But if you have fine or thin hair, this can backfire, as the hair can’t absorb the product so ends up looking greasy. What works wonders for thick hair might overwhelm finer strands.Which product, treatmentor supplement would you recommend for hair loss?I would start by reviewing your diet and stress levels – it has more of an impact than you may think.View image in fullscreenLarry KingFounder of his eponymous haircare line and London salons. His clients include Jared Leto,Gigi Hadid,Karlie Kloss, PoppyDelevingne,Florence Welch, Chris Hemsworth, Zayn Malik, Tom HollandandDavid GandyHow often do you get your hair cutand coloured?I get it cut every six to eight weeks, I probably leave it slightly longer than I should as I’m always so busy. I usually do it just before I have something important on where I want to look sharp, such as an event. I don’t get it coloured as I am embracing the grey.Which bargain product do you swear by?Leave them on the shelf. Invest in good-quality products and tools. Your hair will thank you for it.Which productor treatment is worth splurging on?A really good haircut makes such a difference. Pick the top stylist you can afford, so you get the right style for you. It’s something I recommend investing in, if style is important to you.Consider a mullet carefully ... hairdressers on 12 ways to avoid a salon disasterRead moreWhich hair trendor treatment would you never recommend?I would not recommend cutting your own hair. I know it’s all over TikTok, especially cutting your own fringe. Trust me, leave it to the professionals. Hair disasters can take a such a long time to come back from. Yes it will grow back, but it’s better for it to grow back looking good.What’s the most common mistake you see in your salon?Do not use box dye, as it is so hard to come back from, becomes a nightmare for your colourist to work with and will end up costing you more.Which product, treatmentor supplement would you recommend for hair loss?My biggest recommendation would be go to a specialist to take a DNA test. They do a deep-dive blood test that can either show you what you’re lacking, or whether it is a pre-existing DNA issue. That can tell you which treatment or vitamins can benefit you.

The results are on display at an exhibition in London.Giant’s Causeway, now and visualisedGiant’s Causeway, now and visualised. By Alex GriffithsMark Maslin, a professor of earth system science at University College London, used climate modelling to examine the low-end and top-end damage at each location. His findings were interpreted by a group of artists for the show at the Last Shot Gallery by Back Market. The artistic works are not intended to be taken as literal predictions of what will happen in these locations, but to raise awareness of the threat posed by climate breakdown.Maslin said the environmental impact of tech consumptionwasestimated to account for 6% of the human-driven climate crisis; double that of the aviation industry.“There is a lack of awareness that all the gadgets people are using and replacing are contributing to overconsumption, huge pollution and climate change,” he said. “We are trying to raise that awareness. I don’t think people using their phone every single day have any idea of its impact on the planet.”Moraine Lake in Canada, now and visualisedMoraine Lake in Canada, now and visualised. By Hugh JardineThe climate damage caused by fast tech stems from the mining of materials such as tantalum, cobalt and tin – a process with serious social and environmental repercussions – and the disposal of e-waste, which releases harmful greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide, when incinerated or pollutes soil and water with toxic chemicals from improper landfill disposal.He said legislation to curb built-in obsolescence was being introduced by the EU, including rules for universal chargers rather than the plethora of wires and plugs that piled up in people’s homes.Tech companies are pushing back, accusing the bloc and other legislators of interfering in the free market. The EU adopted a directive in June 2024 that mandates repairs for a wider range of products, extends legal guarantees and prohibits manufacturers from blocking third-party parts.Iguazu Falls, now and visualisedIguazu Falls, now and visualised by Osman GThe UK has had regulations since 2021 that apply to certain appliances,but there are concernsover their effectiveness.Luke Forshaw, the head of brand and marketing at Back Market, a global marketplace dedicated to refurbished technology that produced the exhibition with Maslin, said: “Our research shows that while people recognise the changes happening around them, too many still don’t see how their everyday choices, particularly around tech, connect to the bigger picture.”Venice – now and visualisedVenice – now and visualised. By Archie McGrath and Josiah NaguarIn 2022, a record62m tonnes of electronic waste was produced, making it one of the world’s fastest-growing waste streams. According to Forshaw, there has never been a more critical moment to rethink our relationship with technology and choose longevity over landfill. “Making sustainable options more affordable, accessible and transparent is key to bridging that gap,” he said.Five ways you can reduce carbon emissionsView image in fullscreenYour mobile phone contains reusable precious materials.Photograph: Maksym Yemelyanov/AlamyFind a piece of tech you are comfortable with and keep it.Remember that your mobile phone contains precious materials that should be reused rather than thrown away.Sell your old phones and devices to reputable reuse shops or via peer-to-peer sales.Keep your phone battery at between 20-80% for optimal life.Keep your device clean and remove dust from charging ports.The exhibition is at theLast Shot Galleryin Fitzrovia, central London, on 17 October.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGadgetsSmartphonesMobile phonesWastePollutionTelecomsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Victory lifted Louis van Gaal’s team to fifth, and sank Jürgen Klopp’s team to ninth. Yet by the summer the Dutchman was sacked despite May’s FA Cup final triumph after United finished fifth, missing out on fourth on goal difference. In June Klopp, who guided Liverpool to eighth in his first part season in charge, signed a new six-year deal. “His leadership will be critical to everything we hope to achieve,” said the club.View image in fullscreenWayne Rooney (left) celebrates  with Morgan Schneiderlin after scoring the only goal of the game in January 2016, the last time Manchester United won at Anfield.Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images/Reuters14 Oct 2016: Liverpool 0 United 0José Mourinho, Van Gaal’s successor, administered a classic smothering job as Ander Herrera stymied the threat of Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho, and David de Gea made two fine second-half stops from Emre Can and Coutinho. Mourinho oversaw a 35% possession count – United’s lowest since records began – and said: “That was probably the quietest Anfield I had.” Klopp said: “No one will show this game in 10 or 20 years but we could have played better.”Liverpoolfinished the season fourth, United sixth.14 Oct 2017: Liverpool 0 United 0The De Gea show as Liverpool rained 19 unsuccessful shots down on the unmoved No 1’s goal – his best save with his left foot at close range from Joël Matip. After being held for a second year in a row before their own fans, Klopp eschewed any niceties. “I’m sure if we played like this, you could not do this at Liverpool. Obviously for United it is OK. I think United came here for the point and they got it. We wanted three points and didn’t get it.” United’s second-place finish of 81 points was hailed by Mourinho as one his finest achievements. Liverpool ended up fourth.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Phil Jones watches as David de Gea makes a save from Liverpool’s Joël Matip in October 2017.Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images/Reuters16 Dec 2018: Liverpool 3 United 1The defeat that precipitated Mourinho’s axing came via Xherdan Shaqiri, who came on in the 70th minute at 1-1 (after Jesse Lingard equalised Sadio Mané’s opener). Ten minutes later, he had put Liverpool 3-1 up with a double before a jubilant Anfield. A delighted Klopp said: “Over the moon about the performance. The way the boys played tonight was outstanding.” Mourinho said: “The strongest team won, but they won in the period when they were not stronger than us.” After 17 games United were down in sixth with 26 points, 19 behind Liverpool. Two days later Mourinho was sacked and replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who guided United to sixth, Liverpool finishing second despite collecting 97 points, with Manchester City on 98.19 Jan 2020: Liverpool 2 United 0Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah were Liverpool’s scorers but the star was the team in a victory that pulled Klopp’s side 26 points ahead of City on the way to ending a 30-year title drought. In Solskjær’s first visit to Anfield in the United dugout, his XI included Harry Maguire, whose £80m price was a world record for a defender, plus Daniel James, Andreas Pereira and Brandon Williams. Klopp’s verdict: “If our fans were not in a good mood now that would be really strange.” United were 30 points behind their hosts, and would end the Covid-interrupted season in third.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Harry Maguire attempts to contain the threat of Mohamed Salah in Liverpool’s 2-0 victory in January 2020.Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images/Reuters17 Jan 2021: Liverpool 0 United 0A heady day for United as Solskjær’s unit arrived as Premier League leaders on 36 points, one ahead of Leicester, and three ahead of their hosts. Yet the fixture ended in a third goalless draw since 2016. Klopp fielded the midfielders Jordan Henderson and Fabinho at centre-back because of injuries and Alisson was Liverpool’s star man, repelling Bruno Fernandes and a late Paul Pogba effort. Klopp said: “The performance was good enough to win it but to win a game you have to score goals.” Solskjær tried to be positive. “I’m disappointed but, still, a point is OK if you win the next one,” he said. They did, at Fulham 2-1, but then lost 2-1 at home to lowly Sheffield United and would finish second, 12 points behind City, although five better than third-placed Liverpool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Erik ten Hag, officially confirmed as the Norwegian’s successor three days later, here was proof of the caretaker manager’s declaration that United required “an operation of the open heart”. Cristiano Ronaldo was absent because of the death of his newborn son, and Phil Jones was handed only a second Premier League start in two years. Liverpool’s scorers were Luis Díaz, Salah (two) and Mané.

Klopp: “The start of the game was super-dominant and super-flexible. A lot of moments in my mind where we were waiting for the right moment.” A terse Ten Hag declared: “It’s a really unprofessional performance and unnecessary. You have to do your jobs and we didn’t.” Yet United finished the season third, Liverpool fifth.17 Dec 2023: Liverpool 0 United 0A fourth goalless result since 2016 featured Diogo Dalot’s late red card for two pieces of dissent before a bumper 57,158 crowd, the largest since Liverpool’s FA Cup clash with Burnley in February 1963 due to the opening of the Anfield Road Stand’s new upper tier. For Ten Hag and United the result was a relief after the previous season’s humiliation yet by the following October the Dutchman was gone.

In a seesaw second half, Lisandro Martínez scored first for the Portuguese’s team, Gakpo equalised, and a 70th-minute Salah penalty gave Arne Slot’s side the lead before Amad Diallo’s leveller 10 minutes later. The draw prevented United suffering a fourth consecutive league defeat for the first time since 1979. “I’m happy for the performance, not happy with the result but am really mad with the other games,” said Amorim referencing the previous losses to Newcastle, Wolves and Bournemouth. Slot said: “In the end we could have lost it with the Maguire chance [a skied shot in added time].” Liverpool ended as champions in Slot’s first season to draw level with United on 20 titles; United ended in a record low of 15th.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.“With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.”Technically, Andrew will retain the dukedom, which can only be removed by an act of parliament, but he will not use it. The title, in effect, remains extant but inactive, like the HRH (His Royal Highness) honorific.It is understood the decision was taken in close consultation with his brother, King Charles, and in recognition of the fact that his personal issues continued to be an unwelcome distraction from the work of the wider royal family.The king is understood to be glad of the outcome. The Prince of Wales was also consulted, along with other family members.Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, will also not use her title and be known simply asSarah Ferguson. The titles of their two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will remain unaffected.The agreement was made after high-level meetings at Buckingham Palace as aides were said to have finally reached a “tipping point”.There was understood to be “concern” and “anxiety” within the royal household about the continual headlines causing serious reputational risk to the monarchy.Allegations about Andrew concern his relationship with the late child sex offenderJeffrey Epstein, and recent details of his relationship with a prominent figure involved in the China spying case.This week the Guardianpublished extractsfrom the posthumous memoir of Andrew’s accuser Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, aged 41. In the book she claimed the prince “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”. Andrew has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre when she was 17, and settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.In her book, due to be published on Tuesday, Giuffre describes meetings with Andrew. In one passage, she recounts what she said happened in London one evening.“Back at the house, [Ghislaine] Maxwell and Epstein said goodnight and headed upstairs, signalling it was time that I take care of the prince. In the years since, I’ve thought a lot about how he behaved. He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.“He seemed in a rush to have intercourse. Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent. In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.“The next morning, Maxwell told me: ‘You did well. The prince had fun.’ Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called ‘Randy Andy’.”Late on Friday Giuffre’s family said the decision about Andrew’s titles was “vindication for Virginia”.“We, the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, believe that Prince Andrew’s decision to give up his titles is vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere,” they said in a statement.They added: “Further, we believe it is appropriate for King Charles to remove the title of Prince.”It has also been reported that Andrew held meetings in 2018 and 2019 withCai Qi, a member of China’s ruling politburo. Cai wassuspected of being the recipient of sensitive informationallegedly passed to China by two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing.The case against Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash wasrecently dropped by the CPSand both have denied wrongdoing.Andrew has already been stripped of his military titles and charity affiliations and banned from using his HRH honorific.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”He is said to have signed off with: “A, HRH The Duke of York, KG.”Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.In 2008 he pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, for which he served time in jail.Also late on Friday, documents were released in the US showing Prince Andrew took flights on Epstein’s private jet on four occasions.The prince is listed on flight logs as having flown from Luton to Edinburgh on 1 September 2006, with the convicted sex trafficker Maxwell, as well as a flight from 12 May 2000, where he is named as travelling with Epstein, Maxwell, the celebrity chef Adam Perry Lang, a bodyguard and three others.Two further flights from 1999 also displayed the name “Prince Andrew”, alongside the royal protection officer Steve Burgess.The wife of the disgraced former New Jersey senator Bob Menendez, Gwendolyn Beck and a woman named Claire Hazel are also listed on one of the 1999 flights – with Epstein and Maxwell travelling on both.The flight logs surfaced after the US House oversight committee published hundreds of further documents from Epstein’s estate on Friday.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchySarah FergusonKing Charles IIIJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

And that should be it. Stop right now at the battle line. I told that to President Zelenskyy. I told it to President Putin.”The Ukrainian leader was frank, telling Trump that Ukraine has thousands of drones ready for an offensive against Russian targets, but needs American missiles.“We don’t have Tomahawks, that’s why we need Tomahawks,” he said.Trump responded: “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks.”Later, Trump reiterated that he wants the United States to hold on to its weaponry. “We want Tomahawks, also. We don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country,” he said.Trump’s doubtful tone on the cruise missiles follows a surprise phone call withVladimir Putinon Friday during which the Russian leader told Trump that supplying the Tomahawks would damage US-Russian relations.His position on supplying Ukraine with weapons has changed a number of times since he returned to office in January, often after negotiations with Putin or European backers of Ukraine.During the White House meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also discussed plans to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin in Hungary, saying it was “to be determined” whether Zelenskyy would join but that he would inform him of the discussions.“There is a lot of bad blood,” Trump said.After the talks on Friday, the US president issued a stern call to both sides on social media to “stop the killing, and make a DEAL!”.“They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!” Trump posted on Truth Social.Zelenskyy told reporters he did not want to talk about long-range missiles, saying the US did not want escalation, and he was “realistic” about his chance of getting them.The Ukrainian president, who spoke by phone with European leaders after the meeting, said he was counting on Trump to pressure Putin “to stop this war”.The Kremlin’s top aide, Yuri Ushakov, earlier said Putin had initiated Thursday’s conversation with Trump, during which the Russian leader urged his US counterpart not to supply Ukraine with the Tomahawks.Trump says he plans to meet Putin in Budapest as Zelenskyy prepares to make missiles case at White HouseRead more“I did actually say: ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple of thousand Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him. I said it just that way,” Trump said, recounting the conversation.“He didn’t like the idea. You have to be a little bit lighthearted sometimes.”Ushakov told reporters in Moscow that Putin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with Tomahawks “won’t change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries”.It was the eighth known call between the two men since Trump began his second term in January, and followed a familiar pattern in the complex and often confusing contest between Putin and Zelenskyy for Trump’s ear.On previous occasions, when Trump had seemed ready to tilt towards Kyiv and its European allies, a call from Putin was often followed by a sudden softening in the US leader’s tone towards Moscow.‘The key to success is in the sky’: the Ukrainian defenders struggling to stem Russia’s air assaultRead moreA flurry of activity was also set off with Trump’s announcement after the call that he was planning to meet the Russian president in the Hungarian capital on a date still to be determined, in an effort to end the war.Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Friday morning said that the summit could take place “within two weeks or later”.Peskov said Putin had already discussed the planned meeting with Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister. Orbán – an outlier among European leaders with warm ties to Trump and Putin – said he had also spoken to Trump about the summit, writing on X: “Preparations for the USA-Russia peace summit are under way.”It remains unclear how Putin would travel to Hungary, given EU sanctions and airspace restrictions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the fact that he is wanted by the international criminal court (ICC). As a signatory to the ICC, Hungary would be obliged to arrest him, though Orbán has previously said this would not happen.When asked about the logistical challenges, Peskov said the route was “so far, of course, unclear”.Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said on Friday that Putin would be able to enter and leave the country. “There is no need for any kind of consultation with anyone, we are a sovereign country here. We will receive [Putin] with respect, host him and provide the conditions for him to negotiate with the American president,” he told a press briefing.Trump and Putin last met in Alaskain August, which did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough. Trump added that fresh high-level talks between Washington and Moscow would be held next week, led on the US side by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, before a presidential summit in Budapest.The latest conversation, which lasted more than two and a half hours, appears to have sapped the momentum Zelenskyy had built with Trump, with the US leader now unlikely to show significant support for Ukraine before meeting Putin.“Zelenskyy must be pulling his hair out. Today’s meeting with Trump is now completely overshadowed and overtaken by the Budapest meeting,” said John Foreman, a former British defence attache to Moscow and Kyiv.Trump also has hinted that talks between Putin and Zelenskyy may need to take place indirectly, contradicting Zelenskyy’s longstanding aim of meeting Putin face to face to end the war.“They don’t get along too well, those two,” Trump said. “So we may do something where we’re separate. Separate but equal.”Zelenskyy, who touched down in Washington on Thursday and met US defence contractors before his White House visit, has not commented on the Putin-Trump call, though few in Kyiv are likely to view it positively.Some Ukrainian officials tried to put a positive spin on the call, saying that Putin’s outreach underscored the Russian leader’s fear of new Ukrainian weapon supplies.“Today’s call between US President Donald Trump and Putin demonstrates how even the discussion about Tomahawk missiles had already forced Putin back into dialogue with America,”Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, wrote on X. “The conclusion is that we need to continue with strong steps. Strength can truly create momentum for peace.”.While Moscow has repeatedly claimed it is ready to end its invasion of Ukraine, Putin has shown no indication he is seeking compromise or to scale back his maximalist goal of forcing Kyiv’s capitulation.Despite Trump’s typically upbeat rhetoric that peace may be within reach, the US vice-president, JD Vance, struck a more cautious note on Thursday, saying that “the Russians and the Ukrainians are just not at the point where they can make a deal”, and that a settlement “remains possible but will require a lot more work”.In an interview with the conservative network Newsmax, Vance spoke of what he called a “misalignment of expectations”, saying “the Russians tend to think they’re doing better on the battlefield than they actually are”.Additional reporting by Jennifer RankinExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They downplayed the idea of reducing the eligibility criteria for Motability cars, but said the option of scrapping the VAT and insurance premium tax exemptions was “more likely”.Another change under consideration is the idea of removing luxury brands such as BMW and Mercedes from the scheme, under which a minority of claimants top up with an advance to get a more premium car. These premium brands only make up 40,000, or about 5%, of the 800,000 Motability cars.Adding VAT and insurance premium tax to the Motability car’s price tag would mean more claimants would need to make an advance payment for their cars. Estimates suggest it could bring in about £1.2bn, although Whitehall sources suggested it would not be likely to raise as much as that.Although not a direct cut to the benefits bill, further attempts to reduce tax exemptions for the Motability scheme would still be controversial, with critics warning the Treasury to listen to the concerns of disabled people.James Taylor, the director of strategy at the charity Scope, said it could “heap extra costs on to disabled people all over Britain”. “Motability is a cost-effective way for disabled people to be able to use adapted cars. Often these cars need to be able to accommodate equipment, carers, and disability related aids,” he said.“Life costs more if you are disabled. Energy and day-to-day living costs remain stubbornly high across the board. The government shouldn’t be looking to ramp up costs on disabled people. They could leave more disabled people isolated, and less able to get into work.”Emma Vogelmann, the co-chief executive of the disability group Transport for All, said: “As disabled people we often find public transport is unusable – broken pavements, nonexistent bus routes, and packed stations we can’t navigate. A Motability car changes that – it allows us to work, shop, and do the school run. Scaling back the scheme would lock disabled people away from daily life. Does the chancellor want to take away our freedom?”Cuts to the Motability scheme have previously been backed by the Conservatives. Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said on Friday that the chancellor was “following our lead”.“I’m glad she’s been keeping an eye on our welfare announcements, but the government should be doing much more to fix welfare and reform the Motability scheme,” she said.“Motability should be there for people with serious disabilities. That’s why the Conservatives would stop people with low-level mental health problems and neurodiversity – like mild depression and ADHD – getting free cars. We would also put an end to taxpayers funding luxury cars on Motability, instead ensuring every penny goes towards supporting genuinely disabled people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scheme is run by a private company, overseen by a charitable foundation, that buys new cars then leases them to claimants for three years before selling them on.Rachael Maskell, a Labour MP who was one of the strongest critics of the government’s abandoned disability cuts, said the “government must adopt a process of co-production [involving disabled people] and then follow the evidence … Random top-slicing or cuts often cost more in the long run”.A Treasury spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation around changes to tax outside of fiscal events.”While Labour’s attempts to cut disability benefits were largely abandoned earlier this year, government sources suggested the chancellor continues to believe the system is unsustainable in its current form and in some cases disincentivises people from seeking work.Reeves is expected to introduce a significant package of tax increases and spending cuts in her 26 November budget to offset a downgrade in the Office forBudgetResponsibility (OBR) forecasts for economic growth.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said on Thursday that the chancellor could be forced to look again at welfare savings alongside tax rises. The IFS said options could include scrapping the pensions triple lock, a fresh drive to cut health-related and disability benefits, and limiting growth in spending on special educational needs.The OBR reviewed its forecasting model over the summer and is expected to say the public finances look £10-20bn weaker than it believed at the time of Reeves’s spring statement. The chancellor has expressed irritation at the timing of this review, which she believes would have been better done immediately after last year’s general election or in 2023.As well as tackling this deterioration, the chancellor must also deal with the £7bn cost of the U-turns on winter fuel and welfare. Reeves is hoping to build up more “headroom” against her fiscal rules, to avoid being buffeted by the bond markets.Government borrowing costs fell to their lowest level since July on Friday after Reeves’s comments on tax and spend appeared to reassure investors.Explore more on these topicsWelfareLabourBenefitsBudget 2025BudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

We are exploring what additional resources and support are required so all fans can attend.”West Midlands police had said on Thursday they had classified Aston Villa’s home fixture against Maccabi Tel Aviv as “high risk” based on intelligence. The force also highlighted violence that occurred during a 2024 Uefa Europa League match betweenAjax and Maccabi in Amsterdam.However, Keir Starmer and the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, condemned the ban, saying it was wrong for the Israeli team’s football fans to be excluded.Starmer said: “We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets. The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”Senior cabinet ministers, including Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, were trying to “find a way through”, with the possibility of extra resource to help the police.Simon Foster, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, a Labour politician, also said on Friday he had requested a review of the decision, the operational plan, the assessment and evidence that led to it.Foster said he wanted to determine “whether or not this decision and recommendation is appropriate, necessary, justified, reasonable and a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim” and whether “all and any suitable alternative options have been considered”.The Campaign Against Antisemitism said on Friday it was notifyingBirminghamcity council and West Midlands police of its intention to bring a judicial review against the ban, which it said was “pernicious” and had “angered the whole country”.View image in fullscreenMaccabi Tel Aviv supporters hold flags at Dam Square before the Europa League match with Ajax in 2024.Photograph: Jeroen Jumelet/ANP/AFP/GettyA report by Dutch police into the disorder during the 2024 Amsterdam match found Maccabi fans had torn a Palestinian flag down from a local building and burned it, shouted: “Fuck you, Palestine,”and vandalised a taxi. Maccabi fans were also taped chanting: “Olé, olé. Let the IDF win, fuck the Arabs.”After the match there were what the Amsterdam mayor called a series of “hit-and-run” assaults on Maccabi fans, which led to five people being taken to hospital. A further 20 to 30 were injured. Sixty-two people were arrested, mainly for public order offences. Four local people weregiven short jail termsfor the violence against Maccabi fans.John Mann, the government’s adviser on antisemitism, challenged the police’s position, saying: “The police and Birmingham council have ignored my advice. Unlike them, I spent three days investigating the incidents in Amsterdam. Both clubs want all fans there and have fully cooperated in making this happen.”It is not unusual for away fans to be banned from travelling to away games but as a Uefa-mandated punishment. The organisation recently forced Romania to play a game behind closed doors after racist behaviour from its supporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Khantold BBC Two’s Newsnight on Thursday: “We cannot conflate [this issue with] antisemitism when we look at what some of these fans did in Amsterdam in 2024 … We’re talking about violent fans and I think the prime minister should stay out of operational matters.”Starmer called the move “the wrong decision” and Badenoch said it was “a national disgrace”.The former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron described the ban as racist: “‘We can’t have Jews watching football, people might get violent towards them’ – are we seriously saying that we are incapable of protecting football fans from racism? I’m flabbergasted. This is shameful.“‘We’re not banning them because they’re Jewish, it’s because they’re hooligans … ’ is the risible defence for the ban from people who know nothing about football or hooliganism, but are desperate not to acknowledge or admit their own racism. This is a stain on Britain.”Uefa, the governing body of European football, has urged local authorities to allow Maccabi fans to travel. The organisation said in a statement: “Uefa wants fans to be able to travel and support their team in a safe, secure and welcoming environment, and encourages both teams and the competent authorities to agree on the implementation of appropriate measures necessary to allow this to happen.”Jack Angelides, the chief executive of Maccabi Tel Aviv, said he had not been told formally that the club’s fans would not be allowed to attend the game. He said the team had played a game against Turkish opposition recently without incident – though that gamewas moved to Hungaryand played without any fans in the stands.“You’re talking about a very small number of people in stadiums such as Villa Park,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday. “Stadiums around the world have managed to accommodate much larger groups of away fans.”Andrew Fox, the honorary president ofAston VillaJewish Villans supporters’ club, said: “It’s obviously about much wider issues surrounding the Gaza war, and that sends a really worrying message about British society: that we aren’t civilised enough to have a debate over this without it descending into football violence or violent attacks on fans who are coming from another country just because we disagree with that country’s policies.”In contrast, the Green party deputy leader Mothin Ali said there should be a “sporting and cultural boycott of all Israeli teams, like we saw for South African teams under apartheid” because of the war in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsWest MidlandsPoliceMaccabi Tel AvivPolice and crime commissionersBirminghamAston VillaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he did not “recognise any claims of commitments or assurances”.Conservative MPs have accused ministers of breaking the law by giving China private assurances that they would wave through the proposed complex, which at 20,000 sq metres would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead.Oliver Robbins, the head of the Foreign Office, is in China this week discussing the embassy application and the refurbishments Britain wants to carry out on its own embassy in Beijing. The Guardianrevealed last yearthat China was refusing to let the works go ahead while the fate of its own embassy is being decided.Starmer has been keen to improve relations with Beijing as he seeks foreign investment to help build big infrastructure projects in the UK. But those attempts have faced multiple hurdles, including the two recent rows over spying and the proposed new embassy.Beijing bought the site of the prospective embassy near the Tower ofLondonfor £255m in 2018. Tower Hamlets council refused permission for the project in 2022, prompting wrangling over whether it could go ahead.China resubmitted its application shortly after Labour came to power and Xi Jinping raised the matter directly with Starmer in their first call in August 2024.Starmer told Xi on the margins of the G20 summit in November 2024: “You raised the Chinese embassy building in London when we spoke on the telephone. We have since taken action by calling in that application.”Angela Rayner took over the decision last year in her role as housing secretary, but was replaced by Reed days before a decision deadline of 9 September. That deadline was pushed back until 21 October after China redacted large portions of its plans for what it said were security reasons.Downing Street this week said the decision had been delayed again in the midst of a separate controversy over two British citizens accused of spying for China. The case against the pair, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry,collapsed last month, prompting accusations that the government had intervened in order to preserve diplomatic ties with Beijing.Parliamentarians wrote to Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, Matthew Collins, his deputy who drafted the government’s evidence in the case, and Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, with a series of questions on Friday night.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since then, more than 2,000 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for allegedly supporting Palestine Action, most for holding signs reading: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.”As well as dismissing the Home Office’s appeal, Carr said the court of appeal was granting two further grounds on which to challenge the legality of the ban, in addition to the two already granted by Chamberlain.Ammori said: “The court of appeal has rightly rejected [the former home secretary] Yvette Cooper’s attempt to block a legal review of her absurdly authoritarian ban – while granting us additional grounds on which to challenge it.“This is a landmark victory: not only against one of the most extreme attacks on civil liberties in recent British history, but for the fundamental principle that government ministers can and must be held accountable when they act unlawfully.“The ​government’s effort to avoid judicial scrutiny of its blatantly anti-democratic proscription – branding a protest group as ‘terrorists’ for the first time in British history – has backfired spectacularly, and we now head into the ​judicial review in ​November with an even stronger legal footing.​”The Home Office argued atlast month’s appeal hearingthat parliament had specified the route to challenge proscription, which was to apply to the home secretary, who has 90 days to make a decision, and then, if necessary, appeal to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission (POAC). It described judicial review as “a remedy of last resort”.But Carr and her fellow judges said the mechanism designated by parliament was intended to bring proscription of a group to an end rather than to challenge the lawfulness of the initial decision to ban it.Echoing Chamberlain’s concerns about the position of those who have been arrested since the ban, Carr said in her written judgment that the process of appealing to POAC “does not provide for the removal of the consequences, including criminal convictions, where the [proscription] order was unlawful from its inception”.“We consider that the fact that judicial review would be a more expeditious means of challenging the order, given the public importance of the issues raised, and, in particular, the fact that persons were facing convictions for acting in ways made criminal as a consequence of the order, justified using judicial review rather than the process of applying for an order to remove Palestine Action from the list of proscribed organisations,” she said.“There is merit in ensuring that there is a swift method of authoritatively determining whether the order, and the proscription of Palestine Action, was lawful or unlawful.”Chamberlain had granted Ammori permission for judicial review on the basis that it was reasonably arguable that the proscription order amounted to a disproportionate interference with the rights to freedom of speech and protest. The second ground he deemed arguable was that Cooper had breached a duty to consult by not consulting Palestine Action before proscribing it.The further grounds that the court of appeal said could be argued at judicial review were whether the home secretary failed to have regard to domestic public law principles and whether she applied her own policy.On the latter point, Ammori’s lawyers had argued at appeal that the home secretary failed to “adequately assess the proportionality of the proscription”. Documents released during the legal proceedings showed that, on the home secretary’s assessment, only three of the Palestine Action’s 385 actions would meet the statutory definition of terrorism.A Home Office spokesperson said​ it would consider the implications of the court of appeal ruling, adding: “Palestine Action has conducted an escalating campaign. This has involved sustained criminal damage, including to Britain’s national security infrastructure, as well as intimidation, alleged violence and serious injuries.“Palestine Action remain a proscribed group and those who support them will face the full force of the law. Everyone should remember: supporting Palestine and supporting a proscribed terrorist group are not the same thing.”The high court hearing is scheduled for three days beginning on 25 November. It is the first time that an organisation banned under anti-terrorism law has been granted a court trial to challenge proscription.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policyPoliceProtestHome OfficeCourt of appealnewsShareReuse this content"

Our standards across the board are elite, uniform, and sex neutral because the weight of a rucksack or a human being doesn’t care if you’re a man, a woman, gay, or straight.”Boots: the Netflix sleeper hit that’s a stunning indictment of military homophobiaRead moreHe added: “We will not compromise our standards to satisfy an ideological agenda, unlikeNetflixwhose leadership consistently produces and feeds woke garbage to their audience and children.”The Guardian’s Stuart Heritagecalledthe show, which is currently the sixth-most-watched show globally on the platform, “incredibly powerful”. The Hollywood Reportersaid the show was“critical of the military’s 1990s-era anti-gay policies” yet “also respectful of the military in many ways and is rather positive about the brotherhood aspects of enlisted life”.Miles Heizer, a gay actor who plays the lead role,recently spokeabout the show’s relevance. “When the show started filming [in 2023], I don’t think we intended to have this message that’s so relevant to serving today,” Heizer said. “But then of course as we’re making it, all these things started happening. It’s very interesting that Boots shines a light on what’s actually happening now, even though the show is set in 1990. It’s upsetting.”The reaction comes as many on the right have been criticising Netflix for its diverse content. Earlier this month, Elon Muskled an attemptto get users to cancel their subscriptions over a resurfaced clip showing a transgender character in the animated series Dead End: Paranormal Park. Musk, who has a transgender daughter, called on his 227 million X followers to cancel for the “health of your kids”.Zach Barack, the trans voice actor for the character, responded bywriting: “you can fear monger all you want, but kids & parents have told me it saved their lives!!”Netflix remains the overwhelming market leader in streaming, with 301.6 million paid users in more than 190 countries.In June,former Fox News punditHegseth, now the US secretary of defence,orderedthe US navy to remove the name of gay activist Harvey Milk from one of their ships. The decision was due to Hegseth “re-establishing the warrior culture” of the military.Sean Penn, who led the Oscar-winning biopic Milk, and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black bothcriticised the move. “These guys are idiots,” Black told the Hollywood Reporter. “Pete Hegseth does not seem like a smart man, a wise man, a knowledgeable man. He seems small and petty. I would love to introduce him to some LGBTQ folks who are warriors who have had to be warriors our entire life just to live our lives openly as who we are.”The news also comes as the Pentagon isunder firefor insisting reporters sign a new set of policies that would limit the quality and trustworthiness of their work. In response, many leading news organisations handed in their badges.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionPete HegsethNetflixUS militaryTelevisionDramaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It cannot be used in any other context at all, and when the scene has been edited it must be deleted on all formats.”Williams pointed to vague clauses in contracts that appeared to give studios wide-ranging rights over a performer’s likeness “on all platforms now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe in perpetuity”.A renewed debate over the impact of artificial intelligence on actors has been prompted by widespread condemnation of the creation of anAI actor known as Tilly Norwood. Actors fear the data could be used to train AI models on their likenesses or poses, paving the way for the technology to eventually take away work.Performing and supporting actors, as well as stunt performers and dancers, have told the Guardian they have been “ambushed” into undertaking the body scans while on set. Several said they had no time to agree how the data produced would be treated, or whether it could be used to train AI models.Williams said she had tried and failed to have wide-ranging clauses removed from her contracts. She also investigated how to own her own body scan data to license it for limited use, but lawyers advised her the law was too unclear. Legal fees for her attempts to reclaim her data proved too high.“I don’t necessarily want to be paid any more money for the use of my likeness,” she said. “I just don’t want my likeness to appear in places where I haven’t been, doing things I haven’t done, saying things I haven’t said.“They make up the law as they go along and no one is stopping them – creating a precedent, reinforcing the precedent. I sign it, because if I don’t, I lose the job.”Williams said she was speaking out for the sake of young actors who faced little choice but to go through the scans, with few guarantees about what would happen to the data. “I have known a 17-year-old who was persuaded into a scanner – and like the child-catcher scene in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, she obliged,” she said. “She was a minor, so her chaperone had to give consent. Her chaperone was her grandmother, unaware of the law.”The issueis the subject of talks between Equity, the UK performing arts union, and Pact, the UK screen sector’s trade body. “We’re demanding that AI protections are mainstreamed in the major film and TV agreements to put consent and transparency at the heart of scanning on set,” said Paul W Fleming, Equity’s general secretary.“It is within the industry’s reach to implement basic minimum standards which would be a gamechanger for performers and artists working in UK TV and film.”Pact said in a statement: “Producers are well aware of their obligations under data protection law and these issues are being considered as part of the collective negotiations between Pact and Equity. As the negotiations are ongoing, we cannot comment in any detail.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Olivia WilliamsActingComputingTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The soldiers didn’t arrive. Tamir and his friends held them for two hours.At 8.26am, 14 minutes before they were overcome, Tamir sent a text message to his wife: “Don’t open the door. Even if it’s me.”Badly injured, Tamir was initially left for dead. A second Hamas wave that brought the total number of gunmen up to 500, took him back to the southern city of Khan Younis in Gaza. His death that day was confirmed in January last year.“Now we’re we’re sitting here two years later and I have more details, but we didn’t know anything for three months,” Nir said.View image in fullscreenNir Adar’s brother, Tamir, was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen at the kibbutz where he lived with his family.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianNir lived opposite his brother and next door to Shiri Bibas, 32 and her sons Kfir, nine months, and Ariel, four, who also died in Gaza. After the return of the remains, Israel said a forensic analysis showed the children had been killed with “bare hands” in November 2023. Hamas said the family had died in an Israeli airstrike.Nir’s grandmother, Yaffa Adar, then 85, was abducted by Hamas on a golf cart from the kibbutz. She was returned a month later.Nir is sure he only avoided his own slaughter and that of his two young daughters by holding “strong and quiet” on the door handle of his safe room as the intruders tried to force their way in.Israel celebrated on Monday as the final 20 living hostages held in Gaza were returned as part of a ceasefire dealheralded by Donald Trump as the end of the war. Before introducing Trump at the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, its speaker Amir Ohana had symbolically removed his yellow hostage pin.But of the 28 deceased hostages, also part of the deal,18 remain missing– including Tamir.“We feel like we have been betrayed,” said Nir sitting at the kitchen table in his new home, a flat in Tel Aviv. “On 7 October morning, my brother was one of the first people in Israel who went out to the borders of Israel to fight to save lives.“Maybe if he and his friends had not done it, these terrorists could go to other settlements deeper in Israel. They saved Israel. My family is paying the price. My brother gave his life to this country, but today, the country is not bringing him home.”Without a body his mother has not given up hope that Tamir is alive, said Nir. “All of our family is kidnapped in Gaza.”Late on Friday night, Israel confirmed it had received the coffin of another missing hostage, handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas. The person was not named publicly.The last week has opened up a fresh schism in Israeli society. Exhausted by the war, many desperately just want to turn the page. But others feel that the end goal has not been achieved. “Nobody should be removing their yellow ribbons or other displays of solidarity until all of the victims have been returned,” the Jerusalem Post said in an editorial on Friday. “The war is not over.”Nir said he believed that Israel should not fulfil its side of the ceasefire deal if Hamas continued to stall. “If Hamas is breaking the deal, the deal is now stopped. Israel should stop anything that Hamas wants in return, such as fuel, the Rafah border crossing [to Egypt] opening, anything.”Hamas has said that it does not know the location of the remains orcannot retrieve them.Nir described this as “more terrorism” from Hamas. Ruby Chen, the father of the Israeli-American hostage Itay Chen, who was just 19 when he was killed by Hamas in his tank and taken to Gaza on 7 October, said he agreed.He said he had been waiting for the “most difficult phone call you will ever get in your lifetime”, informing him of the return of his son’s remains.“And when the day ends and you don’t get it, you feel disappointed. Now, how sick is that? It doesn’t feel like two years. It feels like a continuous day that hasn’t ended.”Itay’s commander, Daniel Perez, 22, was returned by Hamas this week and laid to rest.“You would assume, if they were taken together, and they knew where Daniel was, how did they not know where Itay is?” Chen said.Trump’s peace plan is just about holding together, but may be unravelled by two unresolved issues | Rajan MenonRead moreA quietly spoken New Yorker, and joint US-Israeli citizen, Chen has met with both Joe Biden andDonald Trumpover the last two years, urging them to pull out all the stops to bring the hostages back. Before the ceasefire talks, he told the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, of his concerns.Chen, speaking from a park in Netanya, said he continued to hold out hope, noting that Witkoff also lost a son, Andrew, who died at the age of 22 of a drugs overdose.“My wife told him something that I hope very much resonated with him by saying: ‘When you feel sad or you need to be with him, you have a place to go to’,” Chen said. “That gap is a very significant one.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaGazaHamasPalestineDonald TrumpJoe BidenShareReuse this content"

But his importance outstrips even his senior title, because as the Chinese leader’s de facto chief of staff, he is also effectively the gatekeeper and right-hand man to Xi himself.Unlike other top CCP officials, Cai shuns the black hair dye. He is said to speak with a heavy Fujian accent, rather than the standardised Mandarin that Beijing promotes across the country. His rapid ascent through the CCP ranks has made it clear to observers of Chinese politics that he is deeply trusted by Xi.On Wednesday, in a bid to fight back criticism that Downing Street had sabotaged the trial of two men accused of spying for China, the governmentreleased in fullthe witness statement written by a deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).The statement confirmedprevious reportingby the Guardian that Cai was suspected to be in receipt of intelligence about British politics that came from Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, through Christopher Berry, a teacher who lived in China.Cash and Berry were to stand trial this month but the case was suddenly dropped by the CPS on 15 September, a move that hassparked enormous controversy. Cash and Berry have always maintained their innocence.View image in fullscreenThe CPS dropped charges initially brought against Christopher Cash, left, and Christopher Berry last month.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesIn 2022, at the time of the alleged spying, Cai was the Communist party secretary for Beijing, the highest ranking post that a CCP official can hold in China’s capital. Cai was promoted to that role in 2017 after serving just a few months as the mayor of Beijing, a transition that normally takes at least five years.He and Xi have worked together for more than two decades, both serving in the coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang earlier in their careers. Cai also serves in the National Security Commission, a secretive body established and led by Xi.Cai’s role in Xi’s inner sanctum is all the more surprising considering he was once known for his outspoken views and support of more transparent governance. Previously an avid poster on Chinese social media, he once reportedlycomplained about Facebook being blockedin China.Cai is someone who is “very calculating, obviously very strategic [and] a high-level operator,” said Kerry Brown, the director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London, who was due to be a defence expert at the now-abandoned trial.Collins’ statement reveals that Cai was suspected of meeting Berry in July 2022. Berry is alleged to have told Cash about the meeting, to which Cash replied: “You’re in spy territory now.”Berry denies that he ever met Cai. In a brief statement this week, Berry said: “My reports were provided to a Chinese company, which I believed had clients wishing to develop trading links with the UK. Those reports contained no classified information.“I do not accept that, in so doing, I was providing information to the Chinese intelligence services, nor is it tenable that the provision of such material could, in any sense, be considered for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state.”The Guardian understands that Berry believed at the time that he had met Cai, but has since concluded that the meeting in question did not involve a senior CCP official.In a statement this week, Cash said that the allegations in Collins’ statement had been taken out of context and that it was “inconceivable to me that [Berry] would deliberately pass on any information to Chinese intelligence”.“I have been placed in an impossible position. I have not had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence, and I should not have to take part in a trial by media,” Cash said.A Chinese embassy spokesperson said that the allegations in Collins’ statement “are nothing but sheer fabrications made out of thin air”.The Guardian view on UK national security: a case of state failure | EditorialRead moreSeveral China experts expressed scepticism that someone of Cai’s rank could have met someone as junior as Berry. It is very rare for members of the Politburo standing committee to have meetings with foreigners.Around the time of the alleged meeting in Hangzhou in July 2022, Cai attended several public meetings in Beijing, approximately a two-hour flight away.Someone who Cai is confirmed to have met is Prince Andrew, who has already been the subject of China-related controversy owing to his relationship withYang Tengbo, a businessman accused of being aChinese spy.In a statement at the time, Yang insisted he was not a spy and had done “nothing wrong or unlawful”. Cai and Andrew met several times in 2018 and 2019 in the UK and China.Explore more on these topicsChinaEspionageXi JinpingCrown Prosecution ServicePrince AndrewfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Surrounding them are their families, who sing and grip their hands as they lay still under the needle and weight of the sacred – and usually private – ceremony.The artists are in the process of creating tā moko – traditionalMāoritattoo – which has become increasingly visible in New Zealand. The ceremony held this month was opened to the public to mark new research that examined ancient preserved Māori heads, or toi moko, for insights on how traditional tattoo masters worked. Over three days, hundreds of people gathered to witness the rare event.New Māori queen brings hope for New Zealand in first speech: ‘Being Māori is forever’Read more“Our people have taken up moko by storm,” says Tamahou Temara, the general manger for arts organisation Toi Māori Aotearoa.“You wouldn’t see this 20-30 years ago – now moko is everywhere.”View image in fullscreenA traditional Māori tattooing event held at Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum, in October.Photograph: Erica Sinclair PhotographyData about tā moko is scarce, but a 2018 Stats NZ study into Māori wellbeing suggested roughly 18% of the Māori population now wears traditional tattoo – a 3% increase on its first collection of the same data in 2013.Not only is tā moko becoming more prevalent in communities, it is slowly becoming more conspicuous in mainstream culture.Theco-leaders of Te Pāti Māori, the Māori party, wear tā moko, as did the former Labour foreign affairs ministerNanaia Mahuta. In 2022, Oriini Kaipara – now an MP – was the first woman with a moko kauae, or chin tattoo, to host mainstream prime-time television news.Insights from ancient practiceFuelling a new era of tā moko artistry is recent research into 200 ancient preserved Māori heads, each detailed with intricate tattoos. The heads, which cultural protocol restricts from being shown, are held in a private atmosphere-controlled room at Te Papa, the national museum. The creation of toi moko predates European contact and it is unclear exactly how old the heads are.Toi moko acted like a photograph of a loved one and, in some cases, the heads of enemy chiefs were preserved as trophies of war. They were often placed in hard to access areas like caves, and brought out on significant occasions. The heads were occasionally traded between tribes, but trade ramped up with the arrival of settlers, who then carried them across the globe as curiosities and objects of scientific interest.Sustainedrepatriation efforts over decadeshave brought many of them home and the research – led by contemporary tattoo masters and Te Papa – into the heads’ markings has unlocked insights into their histories, genealogies and the artistry of traditional Māori tattooing.Sir Derek Lardelli, one of the master tattooists at the Te Papa event, says the research had “shaped our thinking around our own delivery as moko artists”.View image in fullscreenTattooing in progress. The ancestral tattoo artists were ‘extreme artisans’ who travelled widely, Lardelli says.Photograph: Erica Sinclair PhotographyThe artists discovered previous generations showed “a total understanding” of human form, using the movement of skin and facial muscles to inform the placement of their tattoos, Lardelli says.They would have also had to establish close, trusting, relationships with those receiving their tattoos.“You had to go to another space to get to that level of excellence – they weren’t just impregnating skin with ink, they were at times lacerating, cutting and incising,” Lardelli said.The ancestral tattoo artists were “extreme artisans” who travelled widely, he says. Not only have their “signatures” – or distinct and personal marks - been found on toi moko heads, they appear in expert carvings of the time.Examining toi moko has compelled the contemporary artists to become more careful and deliberate in their markings “for the sake of the art and for the people that are wearing our art forms”, Lardelli says.Raniera Warren received a moko kanohi, or full facial tattoo, after master artist Raniera McGrath offered him a coveted chance to be tattooed.View image in fullscreenRaniera Warren at the event at Te Papa.Photograph: Erica Sinclair PhotographyWarren’s moko tells the story of his journey to learn his Māori language later in life, so he can pass the language on to his five children. Also included in his markings are designs found on the ancestral heads.“The tattoos were all designed to bring those [markings] back, so they wouldn’t get lost,” he says. “It was a beautiful experience to be a part of.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandMāoriTattoosAsia PacificSocial trendsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since their successful relaunch, they have rowed with calloused hands around the clock, averaging 50 nautical miles daily. By the end of their trip they will have rowed an estimated 8,300 nautical miles (15,300 km) while raising money for theOutward Bound Trust.A map showing the route from Lima, Peru to Cairns, Australia‘We keep plodding along’: UK pair two-thirds of the way through 8,000-mile charity rowRead moreOvernight, they switch out every two hours, sleeping in shifts inside their small cabin while the other rows, using lightweight towels for bedding.Their survival kit includes 400kg of food, 80% of it freeze-dried, “salty” the water desalinator, “dumpy” the loo bucket and, when a critical pipe failed, a pair of cut up underwear for repairs. A supply of leaves and micro greens are also harvested from an onboard growing unit, and occasionally they catch a fish on the line.From a cramped rowing station (also know as “the office”), they have faced down 30ft waves, navigated shipping lanes and battled storms that silenced their electronics. They have persisted under star-filled skies and had close encounters with sharks,whales, dolphins, turtles, sea lions and birdlife.The sun is a crucial ally, providing energy via solar panels. A system fault that led to the onboard solar-powered batteries discharging too quickly was a critical challenge.A video loop of the women rowing in the oceanPayne and Rowe crossing the South Pacific Ocean in their nine-metre vessel, Velocity.Nick Rowe, Jess’s dad, says they have to be extremely cautious with power, especially since the electrical systems run their vital water generator.For much of the journey, the rowers had to switch off most other electronics due to the battery failure, including the chartplotter – a navigation device – and the beacon that alerts passing ships. This turned their rowboat into a “ghost ship,” adding constant manual navigation and lookout to their already exhausting schedule.Their final approach to Queensland, Australia is proving as challenging as the crossing. Originally bound for Brisbane, stubborn headwinds forced a course change in August.View image in fullscreenJess Rowe (left) and Miriam Payne, who are rowing across the South Pacific Ocean from Peru to Australia on board their boat Velocity.Photograph: Seas The Day Ocean Rowing TeamThey are now navigating a new route, requiring guidance from Cairns fisher Alec Dunn, to weave through islands and theGreat Barrier Reef.The pair say they are keen for a “long-awaited pizza” when they arrive at Cairns Marlin Marina, which is expected to be any time between noon and 2pm AEST on Saturday. There, they will face the next physical challenge of regaining their “land legs”.Buoyed by letters from schoolchildren in their final approach, the duo credit their success to “stubborn determination from start to finish” during their time “spent in the wild in our teeny tiny rowing boat”.Once settled in Cairns, they want to invite children to visit them in the local marina for tours and hear “tales of the high seas”.Rowe and Payne are among a small cohort of peopleto have crossed the Pacific in rowing boats, either individually or in teams.View image in fullscreenThe British pair are expected to arrive in Cairns, Australia between noon and 2pm AEST on Saturday.Photograph: Seas the Day Ocean Rowing TeamThey say they will be setting a new record as the first all-female pair to row across the South Pacific Ocean non-stop and unsupported.Another group of adventurers took on a similar challenge recently, with aScottish trio of brothersrowing nonstop from Peru to Cairns, where they arrived in August.The perilous nature of such journeys was highlighted in March when Lithuanian man Aurimas Mockus attempted a solo 12,000km Pacific Ocean crossing from San Diego andhad to be rescuedafter he was caught in turbulent waters due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred.There have been other close calls – in 202324-year-old Australian Tom Robinsonset out to row from Peru to Cairns but was rescued by a cruise ship after his boat capsized. There have also been tragedies – in 2020, the AmericanParalympic rowing star Angela Madsen diedwhile attempting a solo journey from California to Hawaii.In 2023, AustralianMichelle Leebecame the first woman to row solo across the Pacific Ocean non-stop and unsupported, rowing from Mexico to Port Douglas in Queensland.At the time,Lee told the ABCher journey had been a “privilege”.“You’re just experiencing and witnessing Mother Nature in all her runway-ready, take-me-as-I-am, natural beauty,” she said.Explore more on these topicsRowingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We follow the blaring soundsystems to meet the DJs and MCs facing off in waltzer battlesDaniel Dylan WrayFri 17 Oct 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 12.01 EDTShareThe smell of fried onions wafts across the pink glare of candy floss, as lights pop, smoke billows and songs play simultaneously at deafening volume: walking throughHullFair is a sensory overload.Stretching across 16 acres and more than 300 attractions, it is one of the largest travelling fairs in Europe and will pull in around 600,000 people during a week-long run that ends on Sunday. However, despite the myriad thrills, including the UK’s tallest fairground ride, there’s one attraction that remains king: the waltzers. When this year’s event was officially opened by the lord mayor, it was via a ceremonial bell ringing on one of these rides.Not only do the waltzers spin people into a state of dizzied nausea but they are also home to a genuine musical subculture, where DJs spinning high-speed dance music – hardcore, donk, bounce and more – join forces with MCs to throw whopping parties on the rides, with hugely impressive sound and lighting systems. “It feels like you’re in a mini-rave or a mobile nightclub,” says Hannah Taylor, who DJd on the Hell-Blazer waltzers last year, calling it a “bucket list” moment. “I grew up in Warrington from a working-class background. When the fair was on, the waltzers had the best music. That’s the music that I grew up listening to, and that I now play.”View image in fullscreenHull Fair from above.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThere are eight different waltzers at Hull Fair this year and stepping up to Hell-Blazer, you can hear it before you see it. Thundering beats pump out as an MC freestyles over the top, with a liquid flow, interspersing his bars with classic “oggy oggy oggy, oi oi oi” call and response shouts. “It’s unique what we do,” says the man behind the mic, MC Willy G, with a voice that sounds coarse and gravelly from a schedule of performing for up to 11 hours a day. “There’s real showmanship involved.”With the fair being free entry, this is an accessible place where young people, or those without means, can hear live DJs and MCs put through a chest-pounding system – Willy G claims theirs is 70,000 watts – and encounter something akin to a club atmosphere. People flock to the rides and crowd around them, as even non-riders bounce along to the pummelling tunes. “All of us working here were brought together by music,” says Willy G. “When the lads are spinning those cars, and we create the atmosphere that we do, people get goose bumps, chills, and hairs stand up on the back of their neck. This ride is the fastest and the finest.”So, it’s fair to say there’s fierce competition to be the best ride and party on site? “Oh, there’s competition …” says Willy G, before Joe, who also works on the ride, chips in: “ … but there’s only one winner.”Over at Albert Evans’ Atmosphere Creator, I swing by to check out some competition in the waltzer sound system wars. “We’re all friends,” Evans says. “But as soon as we put that generator on, that’s it, we are no longer friends for the next 12 hours.” And the claim that Hell-Blazer is the fastest? “A load of nonsense,” says Evans. “Have a go on each one and make your own mind up – and I say that with confidence. Listen, nobody wants to be second best. We’re all striving to be the best, and we all think we’re the best, but someknowthat we are and somethinkthey are.”View image in fullscreenI Jordan outside Atmosphere Creator at Hull Fair.Photograph: I JordanThe vomit outside Atmosphere Creator certainly suggests it is fast, but people are increasingly coming for the DJ lineups as well as the thrills now. As part ofHull arts festival Unthinkable, I Jordan – a critically acclaimed house and techno artist who tours the world – was booked to play the ride. Far from being a novelty gig, it was of great meaning and significance. “I grew up in Doncaster and funfairs were absolutely my introduction to hardcore and donk music,” they say. “You would go on the waltzers just to hear these tracks.”For Jordan, this is a vital corner of dance music culture that resonates with a lot of communities who are rarely focused on. “It’s probably often overlooked because of classism,” they say. “But it’s really important to raise the profile of these sorts of things.” They selected “in-your-face, loud sounds” for their waltzer DJ set, “but there are only certain parties I would do that kind of set for. I think it’s basically a northern thing.”Eat, sleep, rave, ribbit! How Tribe of Frog became the UK’s trippiest, happiest club nightRead moreIt ended up being a really moving set for Jordan. “I saw so many kids when I was DJing who were looking at my decks and were mesmerised and taking videos and photos,” they say. “I was thinking: ‘This was literally me 20 years ago.’ It felt really special and I was quite emotional at times. It feels really full circle to reconnect with it as this is basically where it all began. So I’m hoping I planted some seeds for those kids.”Everyone I speak to has a deep, sincere love for this potent yet niche corner of electronic music and the role it can play in people’s lives. “What we do takes people away from the pain and sorrows of life,” says Willy G, passionately. “It’s like a big wonderland. And if we can create that for people … what more can you do?”Explore more on these topicsDance musicElectronic musicHullYorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are countless ways to fuse the two or play them off against one another, especially when musicians and dancers are physically sharing the stage.In a UK premierefor Dance Umbrella festival, here is a 400-year-old piece of music, Carlos Gesualdo’s Tenebrae Responsoria, and six singers from baroque ensemble Les Arts Florissants entwined with four dancers choreographed by Senegal-born, France-based Amala Dianor. They are not obvious bedfellows – a Muslim choreographer who started out in hip-hop, alongside sacred vocal music on the Passion of Jesus from 1611 – and the unexpected coupling brings consonance and dissonance.At first the performers move as one unit, singers and dancers together in slow procession. All are dressed in black except Damiano Bigi’s Jesus, in white. The musicians are agile of voice, measured in movement, their sound never losing its refinement even when, for example, they’re called to sing lying on the floor.View image in fullscreenThe dance does not always bow to the music … Gesualdo Passione.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDianor leans into iconic imagery: Judas’s kiss, the crucifixion, Jesus’s body cradled by soprano Miriam Allan, a proxy Mary. There are some exquisite moments. Musical sections recur, so when they first sing of Christ’s last breath, the singers are kneeling around Jesus’s folded body. When the phrase is repeated, the singers return to their places but the body has disappeared, and a mystical tingle hangs in the air.The dancers, as they break from the pack, have heavy human bodies, not heavenly ones. There’s urgency in their controlled convulsions. But the dance does not always bow to the music; it follows its own unsentimental mode and is rhythmically independent, especially when the dancers begin to stomp their feet in a pulsing pattern, infiltrating the spacious resonance of the music.When the singers line up along the front of the stage and face the audience, there’s a relief in being able to focus on the music’s own movement, to see who is singing each part, bringing clarity to the ever-shifting harmonies. Meanwhile, Xavier Lazarini’s lighting turns dancers into silhouettes, like shadow puppets. He also makes columns of light flicker like glowing torches, creating a sacred space to hold this music of Holy Week. But in terms of choreography, perhaps passion is the missing connection.Dance Umbrella festivalcontinues until 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageDanceClassical musicBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

One hundred per cent this. Heart emoji. Slay, king. This is not just the best part of sport. It’s the only real point.“Now is the time to ease tensions, set aside political difference and focus on the football,” Khan concluded, scattering flowers of all shades, fluttering his fingers to release a cascade of butterflies, and opening his arms to embrace, personally, brothers and sisters of every caste and clime.Starmer condemns ‘wrong decision’ to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from Aston Villa gameRead moreExcept it turns out Khan also wants to bansupporters of an Israeli team from watching a football match in Birmingham. He wants to do this because in this case, and in this case only, it’s too much bother, and because this is all about love.But wait. We’ve still got Zack Polanski, who released a video this week specifically about Birmingham, who believes in tolerance and diversity above all things, and who quoted sections from the Benjamin Zephaniah poem The British to make the point that Birmingham is not, repeat not, a no-go area for any group.As Polanski says, it is instead time to “be cool”, to prioritise unity and understanding. So of course Polanski will now be speaking out urgently against the banning of Israelis, taking the opportunity to rise above division, because this is the absolute best of Britishness, the one non-negotiable principle of this mixed and porous island at the jumping-off point between the continents.Except, it seems he won’t be doing that. The Greens’ Polanski has so far resisted this temptation, and is instead the only leader of a major political party not to questionthe decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fansfrom attending the Europa League tie against Aston Villa at Villa Park next month.In isolation this does seem jarringly out of character. What about the coolness? And the unity? Zack! Are you OK, Zack? Is the internet down? It is true that the video of love was not an entirely clear lens, containing a lingering closeup of only one flag, the flag of Palestine, because borders only divide us and unity is all.And, yes, Polanski also appeared to believe at one point that you can make your tits bigger with a course of paid hypnosis, as first trailed in pick-up artist bible The Game, a book about how to say things people want to hear in order to get them to agree with you.View image in fullscreenThe Green party leader, Zack Polanski, released a video about Birmingham this week.Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty ImagesEither way, the decision is now out there. It remains at the time of writing unreversed. Supporters ofMaccabi Tel Avivwill be barred from watching their team play at Villa Park on 6 November due to safety concerns identified by West Midlands police and ratified by the Birmingham Safety Advisory Group. There may yet be a messy volte face, as the government brings its pressure to bear. It may emerge that the safety concerns override any other argument, that there is a genuine terror threat that makes the rest of this debate fade into nothingness.But as things stand the British authorities have decided for the first time that overseas sports fans will not be welcome in this country, that it is simply too hard to police, and that this needs to happen in the name of peace and unity.It shouldn’t really matter what your views are here, as long as your views are even vaguely consistent with the laws and principles of the territory. It doesn’t matter what you think about the bloodshed in Gaza, which presents its own distinct case for atransparent and properly leveraged sporting boycottof Israel, and of anyone else involved in violent acts of war.This is just a terrible decision. Not to mention a depressing and alarming decision. And also an insultingly mendacious one as long as we’re going to pretend it’s about safety and nothing else.On a sporting level it makes no logical sense. Who are wenotgoing to ban now? How are the England team, source of vastly inflated police bills around the world, going to get away with showing their face anywhere if this is the standard? How about Paris Saint‑Germain, whose Champions League celebrations led to mass arrests and death on the streets? Or any trip to Napoli, a city-wide parkour of buttock-stabbing rage?But no. We will instead draw the line at a few hundred Israeli supporters. This is based, as far as anyone knows, onsome serious unrestlast season during the trip to Ajax, where 62 people were arrested, 10 of them Israelis, 49 of them Dutch or residents in the Netherlands.View image in fullscreenMaccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam last November.Photograph: Jeroen Jumelet/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockEven without hard evidence that Maccabi fans want to start trouble, the idea this could be seen as an act of de-escalation is basically nuts. What do we think is going to happen now, even if this act of peace‑keeping is reversed? That the game is going to pass in a doe‑eyed spirit of love for all? That it will be less, not more, contentious as a result of this act of heavy-handed prohibition?It’s a terrible moment for Birmingham, which might be better off worrying about the huge rise in reported antisemitic hate crimes in theWest Midlands, quite a feat given how few Jewish people actually live there. Most obviously it is an alarmingly feeble admission of inadequacy on the part of the British police, whose entire job description is to preserve order while upholding the law.These are the same police who spend every weekend permitting, as they should, gatherings of all tones, who have in the past walked through flying bricks to preserve the right of a few hundred National Front supporters to march provocatively through south London, and done so as a mark of pride, because this is the thing about living in a liberal democracy.Mainly it is just a terrible decision for the country, and for what we should now expect. It gives a horribly open door to those who want to plug their own line of political division, to claim that there really are mid-90s-Mogadishu-style no-go zones. This is votes in the bank, pure political capital. Is Nigel Farage going to conclude: “Hmm, no real need to appear in Birmingham in a union flag frock coat eating tripe out of a Beefeater helmet?” Or that he might on balance decide to show up and do that?There are so many ways of making a statement out of this event if you want to. Stay away. Turn your back. Protest and be protected. Instead, here we have sport once again being marched about in a headlock, a propaganda Tannoy for the loudest voice, and wreathed as ever in the platitudes of tolerance and unity.Sadly, Polanski’s video left out the key part of Zephaniah’s poem, the coda at the end that states “all the ingredients are equally important” and “treating one ingredient better than another will leave a bitter unpleasant taste”, an unfortunate piece of editing given the week’s events. For now the fix on the hoof for this particular note of division is obvious enough. Examine the details. Reverse it if possible.Policeit robustly. And then go out there and model something better.Explore more on these topicsMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillaPoliceWest MidlandsBirminghamIsraelcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a ridiculous question, obviously; a loaded assumption that women spent years clambering out from under. Mothers have worked long and hard to dispel the myth that anyone should be able to single-handedly juggle a job, children, a happy relationship and a meaningful life without ever breaking sweat or (more pertinently) needing help.And to some extent we have succeeded, judging by a survey of 5,000 UK fathers published this week by the charity Working Families which foundthree-quarters now saythey genuinely want to share the parenting load equally with their partners. Except, it seems, the outside world has yet to catch up.One in five men said they had been asked, when requesting time off work for family reasons, where their wife or partner was. Translation: isn’t thatherjob? And perhaps, sotto voce: if in your house it’s not her job, what kind of man does that make you? Most of the other hurdles men reported – such as being challenged on whether the family crisis was really so urgent, or worrying that their boss would think less of them for asking – will be wearily familiar to most working mothers. But I’ve never been asked why I can’t just get my husband to do it all, in a way that implies there must be something wrong with me if not.Working fathers’ battles are both the same and also subtly different from those of working mothers, and therein lies the faint air of suspicion lingering between two camps essentially fighting the same war. (The lazy assumption that mothers are the default parents, the ones who just have to down tools if a child is sick or the school calls, is toxic for both sexes because it undermines women’s careers and also men’s attempts to be good fathers.) Yet it can be hard to see the similarities at work when you’re fighting each other at home, locked in competition over who is most exhausted, or whose turn it is to trudge off to soft play. Where were you when we were doing the hard yards?, women think grimly to themselves, when they hear a certain kind of man talking loudly about how he prides himself on being really present for the kids. Ohnowmen are interested in flexible working: now the pandemic has completely normalised working rather agreeably from home, and it’s just a matter of actually using the legal rights that women once fought like tigers for? When some of the new intake of male Labour MPs started campaigning vigorously for better paid paternity leave and being upfront about taking it themselves, they didn’t always endear themselves to female colleagues who’d been on those barricades for years, though fathers stepping up was always the last piece of the equality jigsaw.But someone has to show men it can be done. The lesson from the introduction of shared parental leave – which means couples can in theory split up to 50 weeks of leave between them in their child’s first year – is that many fathers don’t feel comfortable taking up new rights they’re given because they still feel pressure to be the main breadwinner. The government has already pledged a review of parental leave more broadly, and this summer the cross-party Commons equalities committeeargued in a reportthat more generously paid paternity leave should be a priority (currently many men are stuck with the statutory minimum, frozen in time at less than half the national living wage). But even that won’t be a gamechanger unless men feel they can take it without being punished.One solution offered at this week’s Equal Parenting conference in London, where the Working Families research was discussed, was a campaign for men to “parent out loud” by taking their full whack of leave and openly putting nursery pickups in their office calendars, instead of pretending to be leaving early for some mysteriously important meeting. If nothing else, that might open a conversation about the stresses some men appear to be bottling up.For the dads are not, it seems, necessarily all right. An in-depth survey of British men’s attitudes to masculinitypublished this weekby YouGov paints a heartening picture in many ways, noting that – contrary to popular belief – young men are not all angry misogynists radicalised online. (Only 13% of Gen Z now holds a positive view of notorious influencer Andrew Tate, though arguably that’s 13% too many.) But it suggests a surprising streak of bitterness in millennial men, the group now well into their 30s and 40s who are most likely to be in the knackered toddler-wrangling years. They’re the age group now most liable to say that women have it easier in society than men, or that women’s gains in recent decades have been at men’s expense. Though these are still minority views, embraced by less than a quarter of millennials, YouGov finds a widespread belief across generations that life was better for men 25 years ago.Perhaps these are just the voices of the romantically left behind, scarred by years of dating-app rejection. (Millennials were also the age group most likely to say that women are only interested in high-status men.) But could at least some of them be men caught between partners furious that they’re not pulling their weight – which frankly some still aren’t, judging by statistics showing men stillspend only two-thirds of the timewomen spend on unpaid childcare – and the fear of professional failure?The Working Families survey certainly suggests many young fathers feel torn, to an extent their own fathers may not have been. They worry about missing milestones in their children’s lives, but also about being a burden to their colleagues if they take time off. A third hadn’t taken as much paternity leave as they would have liked, and almost two-thirds regularly felt judged at work for putting family commitments first. Almost eight in 10 thought the resulting tensions were putting strain on either them, their partner or their child’s welfare.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On multiple ethical and political grounds, Lisa Nandy must think hard before nodding any deal throughFri 17 Oct 2025 07.52 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 14.00 EDTShareDoes anyone, outside its longsuffering former and current employees, still care about the Daily Telegraph? The vexed and long-running saga over who owns theTelegraph Media Group, which last week landed back on the desk of the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, may leave Guardian readers cold, but it goes to the heart of the transparency and independence of the media industry.The US private equity group RedBird Capital, whichfinally submitteddetails of its £500m takeover plans to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport last week, two years after emerging as a potential buyer, is a key part of an increasingly globalised and opaque media business. Its bid connects the 170-year-old newspaper of retired British colonels to the tech billionaires of the west coast with some of the most storied news organisations in the US.By publicly backing the notion of creating the “New York Times of the right”, RedBird’s founder, Gerry Cardinale, has also sought to place the Telegraph at the forefront of efforts to shift the mainstream media narrative from an supposedly overly liberal viewpoint towards the right. Secrecy and political influence has long been a factor in media ownership – but, unlike theprevious ownersof the Telegraph, the RedBird consortium appears to have the money to change all of our lives, not just its own.Nandy inherited this mess from the last Conservative government. RedBird’s original bid as the standalone entity RedBird IMI caused a political firestorm: 75% of this was paid for by International Media Investments (IMI), a companyowned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City and a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, caused a political firestorm. The Gulf state’s terrible track record on press freedom made its land grab for the erstwhile house bible of the Conservative party embarrassing for the then government.So it would be understandable if Nandy, closely watched by Downing Street overseers keen to avoid any more rejections of a cash-rich Gulf state, simply wanted to move on without further public interest regulatory reviews. But this would be a terrible mistake. Both for reasons of editorial independence and control, Nandy should call for a further, immediate, regulatory review into this deal. And if it does pass muster, RedBird should commit to maintaining editorial independence, perhaps with its own board. The previous history of such boards suggests such commitments do not always guarantee independence from proprietorial interference, but they’re a start.View image in fullscreenSheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan with Donald Trump in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 13 October 2025.Photograph: Yoan Valat/ReutersQuestions remain about how the new Telegraph ownership will work. With IMI forced to limit its stake in the Telegraphto 15%under the new foreign state interference regime, RedBird will become what it calls “the sole controlling owner”. Cardinale has not used the word “proprietor” to describe his fund’s debt-backed stake, but then who is? Other minority investors include the billionaireLeonard Blavatnik and the Daily Mail group, with about 10% each.Some of these questions were raised in a letter to Nandy by across-party groupof parliamentarians this summer. They have so far gone unanswered.RedBird has far bigger fish to fry. It knows all about outcries over editorial influence, even if one step removed. It is the second largest investor in this summer’s blockbuster deal – the new $8bn (£6bn) media powerhouseParamount-Skydance, which brought together the Hollywood film studios and storied US news channel CBS.Paramount, led by David Ellison (the son of the Oracle founder and Trump superfan, Larry) and backed by RedBird, has caused outrage for taking over CBS News and installingBari Weiss, a woman who famously left the New York Times for oppressing her, as its head. The group alsowants to buy Warner Bros, which will add CNN to its list of possessions.CBS and the Telegraph are very different media beasts. If CBS is known as the “Tiffany network” because of its perceived quality, the once-great Telegraph, starved of funding and support first by heavily indebted owners and then an ongoing ownership limbo, is in danger of becoming the Ratners of broadsheet titles.Cardinale made encouraging noises about the future of the title earlier this year when he first mooted the idea of the “New York Times of the right”, a paper in which Pulitzer prize-winning news coverage sits alongside wildly popular recipe and games apps.Trump’s anti-truth crusade is not just an attack on facts – it’s an unravelling of the Enlightenment | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe media analyst Alice Enders told me this slogan had the “credibility of a peanut”. Yet Cardinale made good on this promise in part last week when he appointed an award-winning, 27-year veteran of the Financial Times, Matthew Garrahan, asoperating partner at RedBird, responsible for “news and entertainment”. Garrahan’s arrival suggests a renewed focus on trusted journalism for a paper that needs a new strategy, with an old and dying readership and little loyalty among digital subscribers if churn rates are to be believed.While the talk may be big, huge investment would go against the known behaviour of private equity groups. The fear is that RedBird follows other media owners, from Richard Desmond to Reach, andslashes cost and journalismin order to improve profits.It is unlikely that the UK government will care much about the future of the Telegraph. There is precedence for Labour governments treating the paper as an internecine struggle for the other side. The Blair administration allowed the Barclay brothers to buy the newspaper group without a fullpublic interest investigationin 2004.The world is different now.Newspapersbought for influence, and ideological and financial ends are as old as print. But at a time of existential crisis from disinformation and bot-produced nonsense, independent, ethical journalism matters more than ever, and full transparency is the best place to start.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group. She writes in a personal capacityThis article was amended on 17 October 2025 because an earlier version suggested that IMI is a backer of RedBird Capital’s funds, which it is not.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The young folk, you see, have taken to …unboxing conkers on the interweb. It is, I am told by people hundreds of years younger than me and yet still not quite young enough to be participating themselves, the latest trend on TikTok. Instead of opening up their latest purchases or freebies on the platform (or is it a channel? Zoetrope with notions?), they have taken to easing conkers out of their spiny cases and marvelling at the beauty within.On the one hand, how wonderful, how wholesome is this! That the ancient tradition, the profound sense of connection with nature, of appreciation of the wonders it performs, endures within human beings in the year 2025, despite what we might fairly describe as “everything”.On the other hand, shouldn’t they be doing this face to face by a hedgerow or playground? And shouldn’t they really, really not be referring to them as “nature’s blind boxes” (blind boxes: packaging that does not give away precisely what you have bought) or “nature’s Labubus” (collectible, terrifying homunculi sold in blind boxes as a testament to the infinite gullibility and acquisitive urge of mankind that will ultimately doom us all) as they do so?I don’t know. Answers on a postcard or video clip to the usual address, please.TuesdaySpeaking of the acquisitive urge that will doom us all: I have discovered TV merch. What a rush! I no longer have to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine on a loop as my sole remaining refuge from life’s cares and woes – I can now wear a T-shirt showing The Nine Expressions of Holt (they’re all the same picture of his face), drink my coffee out of a Jake Peralta mug with “Cool cool cool, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt” written all over it and rest my weary head on a cushion bearing the legend “Chills, literal chills” above a picture of the I Want It That Way line up (if you know, you know)! And – here’s the thing – all WHILE watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine on a loop as my sole remaining refuge from life’s cares and woes! You know where I, Jake, Amy, Terry, Rosa, Charles and Raymond are if you need us.WednesdayPsychologists – they’re always so busy, aren’t they? – think they have discovered the reason for Ikea’s success. It’s not the revolutionarily potent combination of great design at affordable prices, it’s the quirk of human nature that leads us to value things we have made ourselves more highly than stuff bought ready-made.This has, of course, led to the traditional slew of jokes about the assembly of flatpack furniture and the impossibility/aneurysm-burstingness thereof. And, as ever, I feel I must step in. For I, a certifiable idiot in all matters practical and dextrous, have put together a vast array of Ikea furniture in my time, from the simple Billy bookcase to the eight-drawer Hemnes chest of drawers without any more than the occasional exasperated sigh. I have got divorced several times while in-store buying them with my hitherto beloved, but that’s a separate issue. Ikea’s instructions are matchlessly clear. All you have to do is stay humble. You do not know better than the people who created the furniture or who wrote those things for you. If you rush at it, you will go wrong. If you follow step by step, you will not. If you take care to distinguish one length of screw from another, as they show you how to do, you will arrive at your goal without incident. There is a reason those instructions contain each step they do. Every line in every diagram means something. Ignore them at your peril. Accept that you do not know best. Give yourself up to a higher power. Know peace. And sturdy storage solutions.View image in fullscreen‘So, this is a hand, Keir, yes? Next we will move on to the difference between “arse” and “elbow”.

For it is my very strong feeling that the world does not need a book about conscious uncoupling from Gwyneth Paltrow. In fact, I will go further.

A ceasefire is in place. Humanitarian trucks have begun to roll in. Hostages and prisoners are being exchanged. Israel has begun a first-phase pullback from the territories it controls, and under Trump’s plan its troops will eventually be deployed in a buffer zone along Gaza’s land border.Given these developments – all part of the opening phase – dismissing the momentous changes in Gaza is to deny reality. There have already been disputes over the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages, but there are unresolved longer-term problems that could derail the ceasefire and imperil the rest of the Trump plan.One concerns Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza. Even after the IDF’s first pullback, it will control more than half of the territory, including thePhiladelphi corridoradjacent to Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has insisted it must relinquish. The next withdrawal is supposed toreduce Israel’s military presencein Gaza to 40%, followed by another that cuts it to 15%.Disputes over the extent and pace of the IDF’s withdrawals could jeopardise the ceasefire. The plan heightens this risk by failing to specify a timeline for the IDF’s remaining disengagements – or who will ensure their implementation, and how.These aren’t trivial omissions.Hamashad long insisted that Israel must leave all of Gaza as part of any ceasefire deal. Its negotiators settled for less because of intense pressure from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, enlisted by Trump for that purpose.If Israel balks at additional withdrawals, Hamas can’t count on Trump to act as enforcer. It doubtless remembers that in March Israel walked away from the multi-stage15 January agreement, which the US supported, once it came time to negotiate a timetable for the departure of its troops – even though hostage releases remained incomplete. The White House did nothing in response, not even after Israel also imposed athree-month blockadeon aid deliveries.More recently, Hamas watched Benjamin Netanyahu ignore Trump’s call earlier this month forIsrael to haltits bombing, issued after Hamas’swritten responseto his plan convinced him that its leaders were prepared for peace. Again, the US stood by as Israel continued its offensive in Gaza City,killing dozensof its inhabitants, including children, within a day of Trump’s appeal.The Trump plan prohibits Israel’s occupation or annexation ofGaza. That proviso doesn’t, however, rule out an open-ended Israeli military presence – portrayed as temporary and justified by allegations that Hamas hasn’t met its disarmament obligations. But the more Hamas believes that Israel is seeking to delay its departure, the more likely it is to stall on disarmament.Though the plan calls on Hamas to surrender its weaponry and permit the destruction of its underground tunnel network and weapons production centres, it lacks monitoring and verification provisions.This omission could give Israel leeway to delay withdrawing troops by citing Hamas’s non-compliance and provide Hamas room to deny the charge. How will the veracity of Israel’s claims and Hamas’s rebuttals be verified? How will Hamas’s obligations be enforced, and by whom?Given the complete lack of trust between Hamas and Israel, the plan’s vagueness makes disputes over disarmament all but inevitable – and potentially fatal to the ceasefire.This isn’t a far-fetched scenario. Yechiel Leiter, Israel’s ambassador to the US,said recentlythat Israel would remain in Gaza until Hamas disarms fully, and shortly after his cabinet approved the ceasefire plan, Netanyahu vowed to resume the war if Gaza wasn’t “demilitarised”. What’s more, Israel hasnot promiseda total military withdrawal even if those conditions are met.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also worries that the IDF will then have greater freedom to remain in parts of Gaza that lie beyond the buffer zone or to demand that the zone extend deeper into Gaza. Tellingly, Hamas’s statement accepting the ceasefire did not mention disarmament. Moreover, on Saturday, one of its senior officialsstatedthat, “The demand that we hand over our weapons is not up for negotiation,” adding that disarmament was “out of the question”.Another problem with the Trump plan is theinternational stabilisation force(ISF), which it says will be composed of troops from regional states and other Muslim countries, and will assume responsibility for Gaza’s security after the IDF hands over the areas it leaves. The plan offers no details on the size of this peacekeeping force, the scope of its responsibilities and the means it will use to contain disorder, whether from clashes between Hamas and Israel or violence pitting Hamas against armed groups (some rival clans, othersbacked by Israel), something that hasalready occurred. Plus, thougha fewstates have signalled their interest, none has yet committed to providing troops for the ISF – perhaps because of these looming dangers.And assuming that Israel will countenance a robust peacekeeping force in Gaza – where it has acted without constraint since seizing the territory during the 1967 six-day war – is a leap of faith. Should Israel continue to intervene in Gaza, citing threats to its security, it’s hard to imagine the ISF resisting, particularly if the IDF goes further and reoccupies parts of the territory.Gaza’s ceasefire isn’t fated to fail, but its foundation is fragile.

Nonsense: speech is only free when it is anchored in truthFri 17 Oct 2025 04.10 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 11.24 EDTShareFacts are becoming less sacred by the day in Donald Trump’s US, where many of his supporters now deny the very existence of truths. To them, inconvenient evidence is by definition “bias”. His followers and those who fear his fist are falling into line: media, universities and that infamous regiment of tech zillionaires who stood right behind him on inauguration day. The day after Trump’s election victory was certified by an electoral vote tally in Congress, Meta’sMark Zuckerberg announcedthat, starting with the US, the company would “get rid of factcheckers and replace them with community notes similar to X”.A similar hammer blow has just struckFull Fact, the exceptionally valuable UK factchecker whose word is a gold standard for honesty. Google has pulled its £1m funding. Along with the possible ending of sizeable donations from Meta, the charity tells me this amounts to a loss of a third of its funding.Full Fact’s CEO,Chris Morris, says: “We think Google’s decisions, and those of other big US tech companies, are influenced by the perceived need to please the current US administration, feeding a harmful new narrative that attacks factchecking and all it stands for. Verifiable facts matter and the big internet companies have responsibilities when it comes to curtailing the spread of harmful misinformation.”Morris pioneered the BBC’s reality check, now calledBBC Verify, charting the BBC’s perilous course through the Brexit and pandemic years. As a member of the European governance body of the European Fact-Checking Standards Network, Full Fact has shared its falsehood-finding AI tool with factcheckers in more than 40 countries.The “community notes” system that replaces factchecking atGoogle, Meta and X abandons a notion of objective truth verified by science or evidence. Instead, it crowdsources any comments on a piece of content and the algorithm finds a “consensus”: the Earth could be flat if most people say so.Googlerecentlydropped its ClaimReview, a tagging system that lets search engines, apps and social media platforms find fact checks and display them with the original factual error: Google used to boast it reached billions of users. When I asked why it had gone, a spokesperson directed me to the company’s statement that it is “simplifying search results”, and pointed out that it also continues to offer dedicated tools such as Fact Check Explorer, “for people who specifically want to explore claims that have been reviewed”.The anti-fact ideology was proclaimed in JD Vance’s full-throated assault on Europe in February in Munich, when he warned that European democracy was at risk from the enemy within. (Many might identify a different enemy.) He claimed that Joe Biden’s administration “threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation”.He described “misinformation”as an “ugly Soviet-era word” and suggested anyone using it doesn’t like the idea that “somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion”.Vance seems to think factchecking is censorship. Full Fact responds that it “doesn’t restrict debate: it strengthens it by grounding it in truth”. The checkers never ask to remove or censor content from the internet. In its now at-risk partnership with Meta, it would simply attach a label to a post suggesting that readers might want to see what Full Fact says about it before sharing it further. Among the things Full Fact checks are harmfulfinancial scams, false andmisleading medical informationthat damages people’s health, and online videos that encourage suicidal thoughts among teenagers.The word “misinformation” is now all but banned among any in the US relying on government approval: the US National Science Foundation, for instance,terminated grantsworth many millions it had awarded to researchers studying misinformation. But asFull Fact says, “debating the language risks missing the real issue: our online information environment is under greater threat than ever before.” This dispute is also at the heart of debate on the UK’s Online Safety Act, designed to protect children and others from the worst harms. Nigel Farage pledged to abolish it on his trip to the US Congress last month wherehe said of UK free speech: “At what point did we become North Korea?”A long list of distinguished institutional and charitable funders back Full Fact. It is free to use and, like the Guardian, relies on individual supporters, who relish, as I do, avalanches of daily checks. Here’s a sample: No, the UK hasn’t pledged£40bn to Gaza’s reconstruction. No, James Cleverly didn’t (quite) say about China whatKeir Starmer claimed he didin PMQs. No, policedid not sayimmigrants are eating swans. No,immigration didn’t increase four-foldunder the Tories, but it doubled. There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that London isunder sharia law. A picture of beautiful Epping mums protesting in pink against an asylum hotelis an AI fake(but there were mums there). Itsrolling government trackeris compelling: 59 out of 86 pledges happened or are in progress.In her conference speech, Kemi Badenoch quoted Margaret Thatcherclaiming that “the facts of life are conservative”, a dangerous line of thought when JD Vance seems to believe that facts belong to Trump. The critical value of independent checkers is to hold on to the truth that facts belong to no one. Right here, this is one of the Enlightenment’s frontlines against the gathering storms of unreason.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just a bunch of fibers sprouting out of your skin, yet we make a massive fuss over it. Those with it, flaunt it. News anchors, fashion models, that damned Jeremy Allen White. Boy, does he love to show off. His hair should be nominated for an Emmy, just on thickness alone. What did he do to deserve that floppy mess on top of his head? I thought this country was a meritocracy? Nope. He’s obviously benefited from a family history of thick locks.Call me greedy if you must, but I don’t just wantsomehair – the sad remnants of a life in decline – I wanta lot of hair. I want so much hair that I have to employ a live-in barber to trim me up twice a day just to keep it all from consuming my entire face. I want people in the streets screaming at the top of their lungs. “Look at that hair! The guy under it isn’t so bad, either!”I wouldn’t dare classify myself as bald, though. Thinning? Sure. Most people are not tall enough to see my bald spot, nor can they clearly see the nearly imperceptible retreat of my hairline. Unless they spend even a second comparing photos of me today to my Guardian author photo, which is from nine years ago. You might not notice, but I do. I have to carve out an extra 20 minutes every morning just to fuss over my bald spot. I summon what little hope I have left to comb and fluff the thin area at the top of my head, praying I can figure out the cheat code for hiding my darkest shame. Eventually, I surrender – the rage over my metaphorical windmill subsiding as I accept reality.‘The worst of all time’: Trump rails against ‘super bad’ Time magazine coverRead moreUnfortunately, for some, being angry and indignant is a prominent part of their personality. Donald Trump’s latest tirade is, at its core, about his own battle with the ravages of time. Literally and figuratively. Once again, Trump has come face to face with what he actually looks like, which would terrify and enrage just about anyone. When he’s notobsessing over the afterlife, Trump spends an inordinate amount of time kvetching about his appearance. First, it was apainting that made him look like a time-traveling Tudor monarchwho just got kicked out of a Sizzler buffet line. Now, he’s directed his ire at Time magazine, which put him on the cover in tribute to his efforts to broker peace in Gaza. The headline, “His Triumph”, cements the fawningly positive positioning.The staff at Time probably thought they were going to get a gentle kiss on the cheek from Daddy (the owner of Time is the billionaire Marc Benioff, who has recentlycome out as a Trump supporter), but instead they received a digital tongue lashing for the cover photo – shot from underneath, Trump’s obscene neck crease filling the frame. At the top of the cover, Trump’s signature metallic yellow wave of hair looks thin and wispy, like someone dumped a handful of dry angel hair pasta on his head as a college prank.As is his right as an American with the power of free speech as enshrined in our constitution, Trumpused Truth Socialto register his displeasure. “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”Maybe Ice got a hold of his hair and refuses to disclose its whereabouts. As for the crown, you’d think he’d appreciate the honor, but gratitude is not a Maga virtue. I understand the thing about the angles, though. Who wants to be photographed from underneath besides models for an obscure fetish blog and professional wrestlers?I recognize that the natural first reaction to realizing you’re losing your hair is to be angry about it. Surely, it must be someone else’s fault. It’s the angles or the lighting. The reality is what it is, though, and it’s better to live in the world than to imagine it as something else. The man is nearly 80. Hair loss at that age seems inevitable, unless you’re an obscure Kennedy cousin or a member of the Rolling Stones. But there have never been more ways to solve the problem of thinning hair.There are transplant procedures, the tried-and-true Rogaine method, spraying Krylon paint on yourself and praying the temperature doesn’t rise above 70F, and various magical pills that supposedly offer painless hair regrowth. I was watching the Major League Baseball playoffs recently, which is a treasure trove of ads for bizarre medical treatments, alcoholic beverages and sitcoms no one watches. One of the ads was for a product called Nutrafol, which is a pill that promises to regrow hair “from within” – not exactly where I want hair to grow. I’m not looking to grow an afro in my colon, so maybe they should rethink their marketing strategy.The Nutrafol website looks like you should be able to order Sweetgreen from it – bland fonts, tasteful product shots, and random photos of people looking up to the sky like a 747 is about to crash into their barn. The pills contain a variety of natural-sounding ingredients like “horsetail” (horses have beautiful hair!), kelp (not much hair down in the ocean, but sure), and something called “tocotrienol complex”, which sounds like the name of a synth band from the late 1980s.I can’t in good conscience endorse such a product in my position as a credible journalist, but you know who can? The president of the United States. The Trump administration has already vaporized most norms and rules of decorum for the highest office in the land, so why not reach a little bit deeper into our collective pockets for some more loose change? Spin this negative into a positive and let Trump – who has already successfully sold his fans hats, steaks, fake college educations, wine and an imploding economy – endorse a pill for bald guys. From pain comes profit.

The demonstrations come as former intelligence and national security officialswarnthat the country is sliding towards “competitive authoritarianism”, in which elections and courts survive but are systematically manipulated by the executive.The justice system is not a nice addition to democracy but a core, constitutive element of it. This is now imperilled not only by Mr Trump’s stacking of the judiciary, pardoning of January 6 rioters who assaulted police, and ignoring of rulings that restrain the executive’s actions, but also by its abuse for political ends. The US is descending fromrule of lawtowardsrule by law: from law as the restraint upon the executive, applied without fear or favour, to law as its weapon.Thursday saw the announcement of theprosecution of John Bolton– the third high-profile political target of Mr Trump within a month to be criminally charged.Letitia James, the New York attorney general who successfully sued Mr Trump for fraud, was indicted for alleged mortgage fraud; the former FBI directorJames Comey, under whose watch the bureau investigated Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, for analleged false statementto Congress. Both deny all charges.Mr Trump said the quiet part out loud in asocial media postapparently publishedunintentionally, which urged Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to take legal action against Ms James, Mr Comey and the Democratic senator Adam Schiff: “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”The indictment of Mr Bolton for alleged mishandling of classified information – he denies the charges and drew parallels to Stalinist purges – issomewhat different. The other indictments followed the installation of a former personal lawyer for Mr Trump as prosecutor. This case was pursued under the Biden presidency and a career prosecutor signed off the charges.Yet the administration shrugged when the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,shared details of planned military strikeswith relatives and a journalist via a commercial messaging app. Mr Trump has repeatedly made plain his enmity for Mr Bolton, a former national security adviser turned outspoken critic, including byaxing his security detail. He regularly calls for the jailing of opponents, including judges who obstruct his administration, as well asJB Pritzker, governor of Illinois, and Brandon Johnson, Chicago’s mayor,after the Democrats opposed the deployment of troops to the city.Mr Trump has sold personal vindictiveness as political righteousness, campaigningwith the words“I am your retribution”. He has been remarkably successful. In a recent survey, a third of Republicansbacked the ideathat American citizens who oppose the president should be deported.The administration has already presented Saturday’s protestsas a threat to order. Mr Trump’s political triumph has been built on invoking crisis to distract from or justify the erasure of democratic safeguards. This is an old playbook, and no less frightening for its familiarity. It is the weaponising of a fundamental part of US democracy that is the real emergency.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS supreme courtJohn BoltonLetitia JamesJames ComeyPete HegsetheditorialsShareReuse this content"

Ever since Colin Firth’s Mr Darcy waded out of the lake in awet shirtin theBBC’s 1995 Pride and Prejudiceadapted by Andrew Davies, we have expected the undercurrents of novels to be writ large on screen: the novel is dripping in sexual tension – who knew? No one objects when Jane Austen’s couples kiss on TV, although it never happens on the page. But we are reluctant to imagine more troubling historical realities, such as maternal mortality, or where the fortunes behind the big houses came from.As part of the 250th celebrations of Austen’s birth, Davies shocked audiences at the Cliveden literary festival last week withrevelationsthat he is working on versions of Emma and Mansfield Parkthat will include death, debauchery and slavery. Spoiler: Emma dies in childbirth.The89-year-old screenwriteris right to say that such darkness can be found in Austen’s novels – they are not all “light & bright & sparkling” as she wrote of Pride and Prejudice. The perception that external events like the Napoleonic wars are ignored is equally untrue. From Edward Said’s 1993 essayJane Austen and Empireto a recentpieceby the novelist Lauren Groff, critics have debated the role of slavery in Mansfield Park.Elsewhere, another reboot favourite, Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, has caused a stir with the release of thetrailerfor next year’s hyper-eroticised film directed by Emerald Fennell (whose earlier hitSaltburnmight be regarded as a risque take on Brideshead Revisited). The trailer contains much straining of stays and plausibility, but it is the ethnicity of Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff, described in the novel as “a dark-skinned gypsy”, that has provoked a backlash. There have been many onscreen Heathcliffs, including Laurence Olivier and Ralph Fiennes, but few have been actors of colour. James Howson and Solomon Glave – in Andrea Arnold’s2011 adaptation– are exceptions.The film’s casting director, Kharmel Cochrane, defended accusations of “whitewashing”, by arguing that“It’s just a book … It’s all art”.For many this is heresy. Wuthering Heights, like Austen’s novels and other cherished titles, is never “just a book”: these stories are part of our cultural identity; Emma and Heathcliff are more than just characters. These are masterpieces, not franchises.But this does not mean that they should not be touched. Without fictional reimaginings we would not have Wide Sargasso Sea, Jean Rhys’s 1966 prequel to Jane Eyre, now a postcolonial and feminist classic in its own right, or the 1995 filmClueless, which transports Emma to a Beverly Hills high school. Whether an adaptation sticks faithfully to or plays fast and loose with the original, our appetite for more is seemingly endless, with new screen versions ofPride and PrejudiceandSense and Sensibilityalso being released next year.Far from being acts of literary grave-robbing, adaptations can be a way of keeping novels alive. With reading now anendangered pursuit, any spin‑offs that lead people back to the books are to be welcomed. Purists need not fear: the reputations of Austen and Brontë will remain unsullied. We should rejoice in the fact that they have sparked social media storms. Their work continues to be part of our cultural conversation – not confined to classrooms and lecture halls. We are still asking: “Who is Heathcliff?” “Does Emma live happily ever after?”Explore more on these topicsJane AustenOpinionEmily BrontëNetflixCluelessAndrew DaviesEmerald FennelleditorialsShareReuse this content"

What’s most revealing is that few seem to care, 12 October).I see this every day in my role as CEO of the youth charity OnSide. Whether it’s watching a teenager celebrating with their youth worker after scaling the climbing wall or proudly sharing a meal they’ve cooked in the centre’s kitchen with their friends, our network of youth clubs – known as youth zones – build the real-life connections and social skills that teenagers need to thrive.Austerity led to the closure of hundreds of youth clubs and the loss of thousands of youth workers, which devastated communities. Our experience of building a network of 16 youth zones, supporting 50,000 young people a year, has shown us that government funding alone is not enough to replace what was lost.Instead, our model brings together public investment, philanthropy and business support, alongside hundreds of volunteers, to create a sustainable and growing network. In the next 18 months we’ll open another six youth zones in towns including Grimsby, Crewe and Barnsley. As Harris argues, youth clubs aren’t a faded throwback, they’re essential parts of a community.Jamie MasraffCEO, OnSideJohn Harris is right to draw attention to the unacknowledged importance of youth clubs and the damage done by austerity. Anyone who works with teenagers will know that one thing they want in their lives is a “third space”, a place which is neither home nor school where they are in charge of their own time. How can we expect them to grow up if we don’t give them a place where they can practise being autonomous adults?But it’s also worth saying that, because these are staffed and managed spaces, cuts to youth clubs have a particular impact on teenage girls. The only other third spaces available to teenagers are outdoors and unmoderated, which means that all too often they end up being dominated by boys.Over 90%of the outdoor facilities for teenagers in the UK are either a fenced pitch, a skatepark or a pump track and these are on average 90% used by boys and young men.Girls tell me and other researchers over and over again that they hate the “bedroom culture” but they have nowhere else to go. So yes, we do need to invest a lot more in youth clubs, but we also need to build better public spaces that are safe and welcoming for all teenagers.Susannah WalkerFrome, SomersetYoung peopleare becoming adults amid a mental health crisis, growing economic inactivity, and social isolation and division. How to address these problems? Evidence shows that youth work is key. Youth clubs and trained youth workers reach young people in ways that formal education, with a rigid curriculum and exam focus, cannot. The UK has the Scouts and the Guides, but the uniformed movements are not right for everyone. The starting point of skilled, professional youth workers is to listen to children, understanding their complex lives and context.At youth clubs, teens turned off by school learning can explore creativity, ideas and skills at their own pace or set their own agenda. The government and local councils need to see them as a precious generative resource, not an economic drain.Vivienne JacksonWalthamstow, LondonAlmost everything John Harris writes about youth clubs could also be said aboutSure Startchildren’s centres, which were crushed under George Osborne’s austerity boot. The “need for connection” that he refers to is our universal evolutionary heritage, something that well-funded councils can restore. What we now have is the privatisation of childhood and youth, a lonely and miserable condition.Dr Sebastian KraemerLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The land the Sámi live in is “quite big”, just as the Turbine Hall is in Jones’s words, but the Sámi do not take over the entirety of their landscape. They live within it.The “fort” is not a place to “hide”. That is a city-boy reading rather than a deeper understanding of the ancient methods that Sámi families use for herding reindeer in the vastness of their lands, combined with the political realities that surround them. Jones is too close to playgrounds and not close enough to the realities of the Sámi and northern political history.My Finnish Sámi grandmother often spoke about her approach and reaction to the vastness of Sápmi, bordered as it is between the Russians, the Swedes, the Finns (and the Germans), who have historically brutalised and bullied the Sámi peoples. MyAitiwas never afraid of the landscape, but acutely aware of the hostility of those from the outside. In order to survive, one had to be able to quickly move to places of safety and invisibility. No one can disappear into the landscape better than Sámi matriarchs with their children.Jones criticises the installation’s “coolly decorative” arrangement of “washed and clean” reindeer hides. Reindeer hides have long been appropriated as decorative, but every Sámi home has a clean one – for babies, for warmth, for sleep, for dying on. Not bloody enough for western appetites, perhaps. Certainly not enough for Mr Jones, who suggests that butchering and serving reindeer meat as part of the installation might have improved it.Lynne SuoLondonI was appalled by Jonathan Jones’s review. Has he ever visited any of the Nordic countries or gone north of theArcticCircle? My husband, who is Finnish, my daughter and I immediately recognised the representative art of the soul of an Arctic village.There is something incredibly unique and, in the end, pristine about existence in these Nordic villages. Maybe it is the ultimate quiet that falls upon the forests at times. Everyday life is not silent, but the forest silence after a day’s work is peace. Is art not art unless it includes some gore, an exhibit of violence? The artist has captured the ordered existence necessary for survival in harsh conditions and the peace that comes from living with nature rather than against it.Margaret Sumner-WichmannQuesta, New Mexico, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The piece concludes with Flowers stressing: “It’s never just one person in one place” – teamwork and collaboration are key. This is even truer than the article might imply, when it says “subsequent models” of Colossus “included many new features and innovations”, as if these had been the result of Flowers working alone, just upgrading his design. Quite the contrary.It is well documented (for example, in the 2006 book Colossus by B Jack Copeland and others) that the Bletchley Park codebreakersJack GoodandDonald Michienot only utilised Colossus to help break the codes, they enhanced the computer; it was these developments that were so successfully incorporated by Flowers in subsequent machines.This was teamwork between Flowers the engineer and the codebreakers, who came from a range of disciplines, from mathematics to the humanities. Hence the need to teach a whole range of subject areas, rather than what might appear the most useful.But this goes far beyond the importance of teamwork. It’s a dramatic demonstration that it’s quite wrong to think that a new machine X will increase output by Y. The actual impact will depend on those working on the new machine. Hence the need to go beyond just training for today’s skills. We need people with the capabilities to work with new technologies they have not come across, let alone been “skilled” for, and the motivation to put those capabilities to good effect. For this, we need broad-based, lifelong learning as a permanent national necessity.Prof Jonathan MichieUniversity of OxfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The main man stepping on to centre stage yet again. Liverpool need him to stay there.There are numerous reasons why inconsistent, unconvincing performances have been the common thread running through Liverpool’s start to their title defence, whether they produced seven straight victories or, before Manchester United’s visit to Anfield on Sunday, three consecutive defeats. The upheaval from so many summer changes, Arne Slot’s search for his best XI,Diogo Jota’s death; Salah has felt the effect of them all during his uncharacteristically subdued opening to the campaign.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreSunday’s showpiece occasion could provide the spark for the source of a record 16 goals in 17 appearances forLiverpoolagainst United, who are paying their 100th visit to Anfield and have not won at their fierce rivals for more than nine years. Salah will present Slot with another unforeseen dilemma, however, should he remain lost in the disruption much longer.Liverpool’s head coach must have recognised the irony of Salah’s first goal against Djibouti last Wednesday. Swept first time with the outside of his left foot inside the near post, Salah’s eighth goal of Egypt’s World Cup qualifying campaign came from an almost identical spot to his costly missagainst Chelseabefore the international break.Had that right-foot effort been converted moments after the restart at Stamford Bridge we would still be eulogising Florian Wirtz’s first sublime assist in the Premier League. Inquests into Salah’s dip and Liverpool’s rare losing run might also have been postponed. Instead, Wirtz’s wait continues while Slot stews over a third away defeat in succession, two inflicted by last-minute winners and one the result ofa debatable penalty. Small margins, as Slot reiterated on Friday, but they do not camouflage bigger issues.Salah was instrumental in propelling Liverpool towards a record-equalling 20th league title last season while uncertainty over his future rumbled in the background. “We brought almost the maximum out of Mo this season,” said Slot when his leading striker signeda new two‑year contract in April.There has been a noticeable drop-off on an individual and collective level since. The team, not the terms of a contract, are responsible.Comparing Mohamed Salah’s first seven Premier League games from this season and lastThe 33-year-old’s output in terms of goals and assists is down 50% on the corresponding stage last season, from a combined eight in the first seven league games of 2024-25 to four (two goals and two assists) this term. His number of shots has fallen from 22 to 12 while shots on target have dropped from 15 to five, contributing to a sharp decline in shooting accuracy (excluding blocks) from 78.9% to 55.6%, Opta’s statistics show.One attribute that has held more steady is Salah’s chance creation. With 12 chances created, compared with 14 at the same stage of last term, his figures remain among the best in Europe and up in the company of Lamine Yamal and Arda Güler, his juniors by 15 and 13 years respectively.Measures of collective performance will concern Slot more. Salah had 76 touches in the opposition penalty area in the first seven league games of last season. This term’s tally is 39. The numbers are symptomatic of the team’s problems overall. Only United and Arsenal have attempted more shots on goal than them this season, but Liverpool’s percentage of shots from inside the six-yard box is the lowest in the Premier League, their ratio from outside the area among the highest. Liverpool’s percentage of shots on target – 28.4% – is also among the lowest in the league.“In the first half of last season we mainly scored from a special moment from one of our front three and in the second half it was more from a set piece,” Slot said on Friday. “This season we haven’t had as many acts of brilliance and we haven’t scored from set pieces. But we are still the team that from open play creates the most xG chances.”View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Reece James closes in on Mohamed Salah at Stamford Bridge, where the Egyptian missed a big chance early in the second half.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThey are not punishing opponents in the way Slot envisaged whenWirtz,Hugo EkitikéandAlexander Isakwere brought on board this summer, although Liverpool remain the division’s joint third-highest goalscorers. A draw on Sunday would be enough for Slot to reach the 100-point mark in fewer games than any manager in Liverpool’s history (46). Imagine what his forward line will do when it does settle. Liverpool remain a team of supreme individual quality, capable of igniting and reeling in any rival for the title, but cohesion is missing. That can not be pinned on the new signings alone.Salah is not the only established player to suffer a drop-off, with Alexis Mac Allister working his way back to match sharpness and Ibrahima Konaté toiling. But he finds himself at the centre of the disruption that has recently enveloped Liverpool. That extends to a personal level, with Salah’s grief over the loss of Jota clear on that emotionalopening night against Bournemouth. The effect of Jota’s death can neither be measured nor overlooked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Díaz, Núñez and Alexander-Arnold contributed 10 assists for Salah. Only Szoboszlai remains in the squad and the Hungary captain has been shifted to right‑back four times as Slot seeks to accommodate Wirtz and address shortcomings at full-back.The rapport between Salah and Alexander-Arnold, which blossomed over eight fruitful seasons, has been a jarring absence. In nine starts this season, Salah has operated in front of three full-backs – Jeremie Frimpong, Szoboszlai and Conor Bradley – and alongside three new forwards in Ekitiké, Wirtz and Isak. Inconsistency, in Salah and Liverpool, should therefore be expected with the starting lineup at Chelsea suggesting Slot is not yet totally convinced by the new recruits.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold’s move to Real Madrid has had an impact on his former teammate.Photograph: GSI/Icon Sport/Getty ImagesSlot relieved Salah of some defensive duties last season to target his energies on destroying opponents in the final third. The trade-off paid rich dividends and a consistently world-class talent will no doubt deliver again. His second goal against Djibouti, a superb volley cushioned over the advancing keeper, was a little reminder of what Liverpool have come to expect.Slot’s tactical trade-off with Salah demands goals and assists in exchange for leaving Liverpool’s right flank more exposed. Marc Cucurella, the Chelsea left-back, said Enzo Maresca had targeted the space down Liverpool’s right at Stamford Bridge.“I heard the comments from Cucurella and saw how they scored the 2-1,” Slot said. “But I can also show you five or six moments where Mo could have made the difference for us. If that had happened, we would have had the conversation like we did last season where he made the difference so many times for us. If that doesn’t happen then there are probably comments like this.“There is always the balance between winger and full-backs. I want our full-backs to attack as well. We have to find the right balance in that.” He also needs Salah to command centre stage again. Against United, he usually does.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Moody spent 14 seasons with the East Midlands club, amassing 223 appearances and scoring 32 tries. Perhaps it is less well remembered that he was a two-club man who finished his career at Bath, finally forced to retire due to injury in 2012.The combative flanker won seven league titles and two European Cups with the Tigers, won the 2003 Rugby World Cup with England, captained his country and represented the British & Irish Lions. It will be a highly charged moment for all present when Moody appears.He is a legend of the game whose future has become worryingly uncertain. While a causal link between MND and collision sports remains unproven, Moody joins a number of high-profile former players, such asthe late Doddie Weir, to develop the condition. A fundraiser set up by his former Leicester teammates Geordan Murphy and Leon Lloyd has already raised nearly £170,000. Leicester have enabled donations to the fund for fans buying match tickets online, and a number of Moody’s former teammates will be present helping to raise money.Among the scientific community theonly consensus regarding MND and rugbyis that more research is needed and Moody, described by Murphy as “simply the most kind and inspirational person”, is already raising awareness.View image in fullscreenLewis Moody and his wife, Annie, revealed his MND diagnosis in an emotional interview this month.Photograph: Alan Davidson/ShutterstockConsidering the form of the two sides, a traditionally monumental contest may fail to materialise.Leicesterhave won 121 of 211 matches between the teams but it would be little surprise if Bath, with three bonus-point victories from three, storm the Welford Road fortress. They won this fixture three times last season.The new Tigers head coach, Geoff Parling, has one victory on the board after three rounds, at home against Harlequins two weeks ago. Away defeats by Bristol and Northampton came either side and things will not get any easier against ever-improving Bath.The Argentina international Santi Carreras slots in at full-back for the champions, his first start after moving from Gloucester, teaming up in the back three with the lightning-quick England wing Henry Arundell. Up front the former Exeter hooker Dan Frost also starts for the first time, while Tom Dunn is poised to make his 250th appearance from the bench.The influential Springbok prop Thomas du Toit, who this week announced his intention to return to South Africa next summer, is also among the replacements, with Ewan Richards, the talented lock who scored twice in last weekend’s win against Gloucester, aiming to make an impact for his 50th cap. Tom de Glanville will bring up a century of Bath games on the opposite wing to Arundell and with Finn Russell at No 10, and Ben Spencer captain and scrum-half, there is threat everywhere from a team who have scored 16 tries in three matches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tim Mayer, a former FIA senior steward, also condemned Formula One’s governing body for lacking transparency and threatening the sport’s future.The 59-year-old American, who was sacked from his FIA role last year, had been standing as a candidate against Ben Sulayem but on Friday in Austin acknowledged the incumbent would run unopposed because of the way FIA electoral regulations are composed.Mohammed Ben Sulayem set to remain FIA president after Mayer denied by arcane ruleRead more“There will be only one candidate, the incumbent,” Mayer said. “That’s not democracy – that’s the illusion of democracy.”Mayer, and two other would-be candidates cannot stand because presidential nominees are required to submit six prospective vice-presidents, one from each of the FIA’s global regions, represented on the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC).The Brazilian wife of the former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, Fabiana Ecclestone, is the only world council representative for South America and has already declared for Ben Sulayem. With no others eligible to be nominated as a vice-president, no candidate can meet FIA requirements.Mayer noted that in South America only one person had stood for the WMSC and in Africa only two, both of whom he said “are directly associated with the incumbent”.“When elections are decided before ballots are cast, that’s not democracy – that’s theatre,” he said. “And when member clubs are left with no real choice, they become spectators, not participants.”Mayer questioned why there were so few representatives on the WMSC list and why the number of eligible members had dropped from 40 in 2021 to 29 this year. “Did member clubs suddenly lose interest in shaping the sport? Were they persuaded, pressured or promised something not to stand? I cannot say for sure,” he said.When campaigning Mayer said that he had found FIA member clubs across the world did not want to challenge the status quo. “Across our travels, many member clubs told me: ‘We want to speak, but we can’t.’ Clubs fear losing projects, funding, or recognition if they simply question the system.”The American insisted he would continue his campaign if only to highlight what he believes is wrong with the current governance. He also recognised he knew of the regulations when he stood for president and that they may prove an impossible hurdle but chose to continue nonetheless.View image in fullscreenMohammed Ben Sulayem, pictured with Max Verstappen, will run unopposed for FIA president.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesMayer also cited a report commissioned from the Utrecht School of Governance into the FIA using the Sports Governance Observer benchmark. Their findings were damning, under an executive summary titled “power without brakes”.“The FIA’s governance structurally concentrates power in the office of the president, and accountability remains confined within a system over which the president exercises decisive control,” it read.“Unless independent oversight, open and competitive elections, transparent decision-making, and stakeholder representation are introduced, the FIA will remain structurally predisposed to the concentration of power. History across international sport governance shows that such reliance invariably fails.”The findings of the report Mayer argued could have a fundamental impact on F1, given that teams now have their own good governance practices to which they adhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So they find an undemocratic FIA to be a threat,” he said. “We provide a foundation which is where Formula One can build its house. Without democratic governance, without a strong internal process, that foundation is built on sand.”Ben Sulayem’s time in charge since 2021 has been marked by controversy, not least rifts with drivers and a string of high-profile departures from the sport’s governing body, including the deputy president for sport, Robert Reid,who left citing a “breakdown of governance standards”in April.Last year Lewis Hamilton was unequivocal when he statedBen Sulayem had “never” had his backing, adding his voice to the criticism of the FIA and warning it was damaging the reputation of F1.Risk of wheel bashing and strategy sets up complicated US Grand PrixRead more“There is a real lack of accountability here, within this sport, within the FIA,” he said. “There are things that are happening behind closed doors, there is no transparency, there is really no accountability and we need that.”The FIA has been approached for comment on Mayer’s claims. The governing body had issued a statement which addressed Mayer not meeting the requirements to be a candidate.“The FIA presidential election is a structured and democratic process, to ensure fairness and integrity at every stage,” it read. “The requirements for the 2025 FIA elections, including the relevant deadlines and eligibility criteria for the presidential list and world councils, are defined in the FIA statutes and internal regulations.“The requirements related to the regional representation of the vice-presidents for sport, and to select them from the World Motor Sport Council in order to draw up a presidential list, are not new.

Others had travelled after games and training for a service which celebrated a pioneering figure in women’s football, who died last month, aged 47.Goodbye Matt Beard: the Del Boy of women’s football who took Liverpool to two WSL titlesRead moreAs Beard’s coffin, draped in two Liverpool scarves, was carried into Sir Frederick Gibberd’s modernist “cathedral for a new world”, it was flanked by a 50-strong phalanx of current and former players who had played under him, many from Liverpool and West Ham. They were joined by Liverpool Women’s first-team squad, along with the head coach, Gareth Taylor, and his coaching staff, and the club’s sporting director, Richard Hughes.In an emotional eulogy, Mark Beard called his brother a “beautiful soul and a one-in-a-million personality” who “always found a way to make you laugh and smile”.Beard, he said, had gone into women’s football soon after moving into coaching in his 20s when an injury cut short a playing career and had “never looked back”, becoming one of the game’s “most inspirational managers”. Beard started his coaching at Millwall Lionesses in 2008, later taking charge of Chelsea, Liverpool over two spells, West Ham United and Burnley. He became Liverpool Women’s most successful manager, leading them to back-to-back Women’s Super League titles in 2013 and 2014.View image in fullscreenLiverpool players Beata Olsson (left) and Cornelia Kapocs arrive at the memorial service.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“He won everything there was to win, but more important than the titles was what he brought to people,” he said.An inquest confirmed last month that Beard had died by suicide, and his brother paid tribute to staff at the Countess of Chester hospital, where Beard was treated, and the city of Liverpool, which he said had supported the family in their grief. “Please, please, please let Matt’s passing be a lesson to us all,” he said. “We are all human, so be more thoughtful.”Beard’s family requested that instead of flowers, gestures of remembrance be made through donations to a mental health charity, and the running order for the service had the contact details of support services including the Samaritans, the National Suicide Prevention Helpline and the peer-to-peer support group Andy’s Man Club.Current and former players joined coaches, pundits and fans in the cathedral, including Emma Hayes, the former Chelsea manager and current USA women’s national team coach, and footballers including England’s Lucy Bronze, Liverpool’s Gemma Bonner and Arsenal’s Olivia Smith. Liverpool men’s all-time top goalscorer, Ian Rush, also attended the service, alongside Manchester United Women’s head coach, Marc Skinner.That people had travelled from far and wide was testament to Beard’s importance to the women’s game, said the commentator Jacqui Oatley. “Matt was just such a special person, and he was so significant in the evolution of the women’s game in this country,” she said.View image in fullscreenThe Liverpool Women’s manager, Gareth Taylor, arriving at the memorial service for Matt Beard.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe former Liverpool and England forward Natasha Dowie, who won two WSL titles under Beard and returned to Liverpool during his second period at the club, said after the service that he had treated everyone with the same warmth and kindness, whether they were a chief executive or a fan.“How will Matt be remembered?” she said. “A cheeky smile, someone that made you laugh, a twinkle in his eyes, an ‘All right, darling’, a big hug, which made you feel like a million dollars. He was a father figure … and I was very lucky to have played under him.”Beard was a “kind, caring, funny, cheeky” man, who had a real impact on everyone he met, said the Canada head coach and former Chelsea and Arsenal player, Casey Stoney. His death, she said, had to be a moment for people across football to recognise the importance of reaching out for help. “But I think the biggest impact I hope people take from this is that we’re all human and we all need help sometimes and we all need to talk,” Stoney said. “I hope people start taking the time to get out of their busy lives and reach out. I wish I had done more of that.”As Beard’s coffin was led out of the cathedral to a private ceremony where he would be laid to rest, fans raised scarves and joined Beard’s niece, Lucy, for an elegiac rendition of Liverpool’s club anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone. He was, said the Liverpool Women fan Michael Smith, a manager who had made fans feel like part of his family, coming on to supporter coaches and giving out signed shirts from the players. “He was an icon in the women’s game and in this city,” he said. “But he was so good with everyone he met. He wasn’t just a manager, it was like he was a friend.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counsellor.

Once you are first, you can just focus on your performance.”Arsenal were quickly installed as hot favourites to win the title for the first time since 2004, but things did not work out that way, the team spending just 26 nights at the summit before being overhauled by Claudio Ranieri’s 5,000-1 miracle workers.It is a feeling Arsenal supporters have had to get used to since they were last champions 21 years ago. Across that period, which started with the post-Invincibles season in which they led for the first 10 weeks before being derailed after Manchester United ended their 49-match unbeaten run and has included a record of being top for 248 nights and finishing second in 2022-23, they have spent 773 nights (as of Saturday morning) – the equivalent of more than two years – in pole position without taking the chequered flag.Days spent top of the Premier League since Arsenal’s 2004 title winArsenal are top againafter Liverpool, champions last season following a record 234 nights as leaders, suffered two successive league defeats before the international break and look much better positioned to take advantage than at any time over the past two decades. Although they have not won on their past two visits to Saturday’s opponents, Fulham, cathartic victories in successive matches: Newcastle, Olympiakos and West Ham – sides Arsenal have struggled against under Mikel Arteta – have created a growing sense of optimism at the club that this could be the year they finally get past the post.“We cannot pay too much attention to that because the feeling was: ‘You go to Newcastle, if you lose in Newcastle, the Premier League is over,’” said the Arsenal manager on Friday. “And one week later, you are where you are. So, honestly, it’s focus on what we can control, focus on our performance, focus on delivering and achieving what we want to achieve daily and the rest, it’s 30 games, it’s still too early. So many things are going to happen. Emotionally, we cannot be dragged into these things because we have much more important things to do.”Such is the depth of their squad after spending more than £250m on reinforcements in the summer that even the likely absence of the captain, Martin Ødegaard, for another six weeks with a knee injury picked up when Arsenal comfortably saw off West Ham should not have the same impact on results as last season. The Norwegian missed almost two months with an ankle injury and, combined with long-term injuries to the key attackers Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus, it meant they were never able to properly sustain a challenge to Liverpool despite finishing as runners-up for a third year in a row.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta led his side to a hard-fought win at Newcastle last month. Arsenal had lost their last two Premier League matches at St James’ Park.Photograph: Craig Cowan/Action Plus/ShutterstockEberechi Eze is likely to continue to fill in for Ødegaard against Fulham, and Arteta has top-quality cover in every position in a squad that unusually has the same number of players who predominantly use their left foot as their right. “Balance,” he said simply when asked what the benefits were.Arsenal head to Craven Cottage at the summit for the time since May 2024, a season when they led for 76 nights before being overhauled by Manchester City after a home defeat by Aston Villa – the only league game they lost after the turn of the year.In 2022-23 an injury to William Saliba proved their undoing, their lack of defensive cover ruthlessly exposed by City. But rather than regarding the past three campaigns as a negative, Arteta is hoping his players can draw on those experiences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For some of them, it will be unconsciously there but as a learning and hopefully a really positive learning as well because that’s sport and that’s football in general to do that. And then you do have microdoses of that: what happened at Newcastle for a few years, what happened against West Ham, what happened against City when we could not beat them. It’s a lot of situations and we have learned from that. And then the ultimate goal, if we do a lot of the small things well, it will come.”Before Arteta’s appointment as manager in December 2019, Arsenal had not been top since losing out to Leicester the season after the Spaniard retired from playing. He was captain of the team that Wenger described as having “won the stamina league” after they spent 128 nights top in 2013-14 before losing out to City. That still was not as many as in 2007-08, when Arsenal were at the summit for more than two-thirds of the season – 142 nights – yet ended up third.Arteta, whose side are favourites to win the title according to Opta’s supercomputer, must sense there is a real opportunity to finally banish those unwanted statistics for good.Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tim Southee, who has had the same title since May and is with the white-ball squad in his native New Zealand, will continue to work with the team until the end of the first Test in Perth, after which he will depart to fulfil playing obligations at the International League T20 in the United Arab Emirates.No Ashes talk in England camp, says Harry Brook before New Zealand seriesRead moreAnother returning face will be Gilbert Enoka, the former All Blacks mental skills coach, who was first brought into the group during the buildup to the Test against India at Old Trafford in July. Enoka, who lives in Christchurch, is also working with the white-ball squad – if only for the few days they are in his hometown – and will be involved for the first Ashes Test.On Friday, Enoka ran an hour-long session for the entire squad and backroom staff, as they finalised preparations for the T20 series against New Zealand that starts on Saturday and looked ahead to February’s T20 World Cup. Harry Brook, who last month promised he would “never have a meeting” as white-ball captain, reasoning they were “a waste of an hour – I’m not very good at sitting there and listening”, emerged to describe Enoka as “awesome”.But Brook refused to divulge what was discussed. “It’s something we want to try to keep to ourselves,” he said. “He brings a lot of knowledge about the mental side of the game. To have him in the ranks, just to be able to have a chat for five or 10 minutes, is awesome.”The long-term batting coach Marcus Trescothick and the spin-bowling coach Jeetan Patel, another New Zealander, will continue in their roles while the assistant coach Paul Collingwood, who has not been involved with the team in recent months, will again be absent.The 59-year-old Saker worked as England’s fast bowling coach between 2010 and 2015, during which time they won the Ashes in Australia, successfully defended them at home and won a series in India for the first and only time since 1984-85. He then fulfilled a similar role for Australia from 2016 to 2019 before returning to work with England in 2023, initially with the white-ball squad. At the time he described England’s Test side as “the best team in the world to watch”. “I’ve been involved in Ashes with both parties,” he said, “and the cricket is as exciting as it gets.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To have guys who’ve got so much experience, playing all over the world and being as good as what they are, we can only benefit from what they’re saying.”Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamAshes 2025 - 26The AshesBrendon McCullumAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The double-figure field also includes some very live “dark” horses that could spring a surprise, and a runner apiece for Ireland, Britain and France, European racing’s leading nations, among the three main contenders. The strength and depth of the competition is so high that punters who successfully unravel the puzzle can expect at least a 180% return on their stake, in the space of a couple of minutes.Champion Stakes at Ascot attracts the best but faces fight to maintain statusRead moreThere is even a little needle to add further spice, after Aidan O’Brien, the trainer of Delacroix, suggested to a media briefing on Thursday that John Gosden, who trains Ombudsman, the favourite, “can whinge a little bit after races, whether he wins or he loses”.His remark was a response to a suggestion by Gosden earlier in the season that he had opted against sending Ombudsman to face Delacroix in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown because his colt “would not appreciate running against multiple entries from one stable on a track with a short straight”.Ombudsman generally races some way off the pace, and the implication seemed to be that three or four O’Brien-trained runners spread across the home straight might get in his way on the run to the line. As it turned out, O’Brien had just two runners in the Irish Champion – Delacroix, the impressive winner, and Mount Kilimanjaro, a pacemaker.Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin operation, which owns Ombudsman, and the Coolmore Stud syndicate headed by John Magnier, which supplies the ammunition for O’Brien’s Ballydoyle stable in Ireland, have been fierce rivals at the highest level of international Flat racing for a quarter of a century. They have gone toe-to-toe with seven-figure bids for yearlings at the sales and seen their colours fight out finishes at the most famous tracks around the globe. Although O’Brien quickly added that his comment was meant “light-heartedly”, he will have been well aware that it would not pass unnoticed.The two perennial rivals have the most to gain – or lose – from Saturday’s £1.4m contest, the final Group One race on the Champions Day card, and the £800k first prize is far from being their primary concern. Both would love to end the season with a 2-1 victory in the two horses’ private match-up, but the implications for their future careers as stallions are significant too.Ombudsman seems likely to retire to stud at the end of the season, while Delacroix is all but certain to do the same. The Coolmore stallion operation lost one of its biggest names a few weeks ago when Wootton Bassett, whose covering fee was €200,000 (£174,000), died during his annual trip for the Australian breeding season.Quick GuideTale of the tapeShowOmbudsmanAge: 4Rating: 128World ranking: 1Career record: 1111-2121Strike rate: 75pcGroup One wins: 2Profit/loss to £1 stake: +£24.95Odds: 15-8DelacroixAge: 3Rating: 126World ranking: 6Career record: 21212-110121Strike rate: 55pcGroup One wins: 2Profit/loss: +£3.17Odds: 7-2CalandaganAge: 4Rating: 125World ranking: 9Career record: 31/211122-2211Strike rate: 50pcGroup One wins: 2Profit/loss: +£2.60Odds: 5-2Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Delacroix is a prime candidate to replace Wootton Bassett on the roster, and victory on Saturday could see him replace Ombudsman as the world’s top-rated racehorse. You can be sure that Magnier will already have one number in his head as a covering fee if Delacroix is beaten on Saturday and another, significantly larger, figure if he wins.The Godolphin/Coolmore rivalry is just one of a tangled mass of plotlines in Saturday’s race, and it would be no surprise if the two potential six-figure stallions in the lineup were beaten by a horse with no hope at all of a stallion career. Calandagan, a four-year-old gelding,won the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakesat Ascot in July, finished a half-length second in this race 12 months ago and will bid to set the seal on an astonishing season for his trainer, Francis-Henri Graffard.Graffard is certain to finish the season as France’s champion trainer for the first time, replacing the 30-times champion André Fabre, and also claimed his firstwin in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, Europe’s showpiece event, with Daryz less than a fortnight ago.Oisin Murphy: ‘I found escapism but also an awful lot of trouble in the bottle’Read moreCalandagan would have been a shorter price for the Arc than Daryz had it not been for the fact that geldings are barred, and while his two Group One wins have come at a mile-and-a-half, he has a fine burst of finishing speed.Between them, the “big three” account for more than 80% of the betting market on Saturday’s race, but in a season thathas already seen a 150-1 Group One winner,there are live runners at double-figure odds to tempt in each-way punters.Economics, last year’s Irish Champion Stakes winner, is running for the first time since finishing sixth as the 2-1 second-favourite 12 months ago, but would have an obvious chance on his form in Ireland, while Andrew Balding’s Almeric could still be anything after three impressive wins in lesser events. And then there is Ed Walker’s Almaqam, who has lined up against Ombudsman once already this season, over a mile-and-a-quarter at Sandown, and handed him a convincing one-and-three-quarter length defeat.As a conundrum to be solved and a spectacle to be enjoyed, there may be nothing quite like the 4.05 at Ascot on Saturday anywhere in the world. Whether you are a lifelong devotee of the turf or have only the most casual of fleeting interests, it seems sure to be worth two minutes of your time.Pacemaker could give Ombudsman the edgeThe Godolphin operation has left as little as possible to chance ahead of the Champion Stakes and the decision to spend £75,000 to add a pacemaker – Deilv’s Advocate – to the field could tip the balance in favour of John and Thady Gosden’sOmbudsman(4.05) in the feature event on the Champions Day card.Pacemakers have been a touchy subject for punters this season, with Qirat pulling off a shock win in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and Birr Castle, another 150-1 shot, threatening to do the same for much of the way in the International Stakes three weeks later.Quick GuideSaturday's tipsShowCatterick:10.30 Trapper John; 11.00 Sierra Sands; 11.28 Secret Sonata; 11.56 Made All; 12.23 Wreck It Ryley; 12.50 Ahamoment; 1.20 Venture Capital; 1.55 Beauty ChoiceAscot:12.55 Trawlerman; 1.30 Words Of Truth; 2.05 Big Mojo; 2.45 Waardah; 3.25 Fallen Angel (nb); 4.05 Ombudsman; 4.40 Oliver Show (nap)Stratford-on-Avon:1.15 Electric Eddy; 1.50 Absolutely Doyen; 2.30 Juggernaut; 3.05 Seeyouinmydreams; 3.40 Baikal; 4.25 Yorgunnabeplucky; 5.05 Prince De JuilleyNewton Abbot:2.15 Le Soleil Reve; 2.54 Of Corse I Can; 3.35 Dance And Glance; 4.15 Diplomatie; 4.55 Blueking D’Oroux; 5.25 Jaitroplaclasse; 5.55 Soldier ReevesWolverhampton:4.29 Almarada Prince; 4.59 Massimo Blue; 5.30 Bystander; 6.00 Stipulation; 6.30 Coolree; 7.00 T Or Coffey; 7.30 Invincible Crown; 8.00 Simply Blue; 8.30 Desert EmperorWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That made for a very odd-looking renewal of York’s 10-furlong Group One, but when William Buick and Ombudsman finally set off in pursuit of Birr Castle, they swiftly powered clear of the chasing pack andOmbudsman was three-and-a-half lengths clear of Delacroix, one of his main market rivals again today, at the line.That appeals as stronger form than Delacroix’s last-gasp defeat of Ombudsman in the Eclipse Stakes in July, and though Calandagan, the King George winner, is a big threat to the favourite, it is also interesting that Ombudsman is less exposed than either of his most obvious rivals.Saturday’s race will be just the ninth of Ombudsman’s career, while Calandagan has 12 starts to date and the year-younger Delacroix has 11, and started what is already a six-race three-year-old season back in March.All three main fancies in the betting have an obvious chance at their best, but Ombudsman is the one with the most scope for improvement on his form to date and a worthy favourite at around 15-8.12.55The Gold Cup winner,Trawlerman,has half a stone or more in hand on the field on ratings and should win this race for the second time in three years.1.30A big field for a valuable two-year-old prize but little strength in depth behind Charlie Appleby’s highly promisingWords Of Truth.2.05Lazzat,the Jubilee winner at the Royal meeting, is top on ratings but only a few pounds in front ofBig Mojo,who could make the most of a good draw in stall 20.2.45The lightly racedWaardahis fresher than several of her rivals and does not have much to find to figure.3.25Fallen Angelcame up with another career-best in the Sun Chariot last time and looks much too big in the betting at around 7-1.4.40The quirkyOliver Showhas only rarely shown the application to go with his talent but Billy Loughnane got him to within a nose of the winner in the Lincoln in March and has pace to chase from his draw in stall 22.

The Knights, who were playing in League 1 as recently as 2018, and Toulouse have joined the Bulls among the elite after both dominated on the field throughout 2025.Goodchild, who bought the club in 2022, said York and the wider area were long overdue such success after the Knights became the first ­professional sporting team from there to play in a top division in almost 40 years.“It’s a great day for the region,” he said. “A team from York that can represent the region in the highest tier in professional sport … it’s been a long time coming. Last time we were in this position was 1985-86 and hopefully we can kick on from here.”London were widely expected to be one of the two teams that were granted admission after a takeover of the club led by the Australian rugby league legend Darren Lockyer. However, they must now regroup and compete in the Championship for at least one more season.The door to Super League remains ajar for the Broncos in 2027, with the gradings system that has determined promotion and relegation for the past two seasons scheduled to remain for next year as things stand. That means London would have to place inside the top 14 of the gradings at the end of next season, having finished 16th this year.“The intent is that there will not be extra panels every year to select the teams in Super League,” the outgoing Rugby Football League chief executive, Tony Sutton, said. “Under the existing system, gradings will decide the top 14 as it has done previously with the top 12.”View image in fullscreenYork Knights won the 1895 Cup final against Featherstone Rovers at Wembley in June.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesSutton said there were “five really strong applicants” for the two extra places in Super League, naming the Broncos, Widnes Vikings and Oldham as the three clubs who pushed York and Toulouse the closest for admission.London have signed a number of high-profile players for 2026, including the Australia forward Reagan Campbell-Gillard, and they now face the remarkable prospect of walking out in places such as Batley and Workington rather than Wigan and St Helens.However, Lockyer said the new ownership group remain fully committed to achieving success in London despite missing out on promotion this year. “The Broncos are building with purpose and clarity, and there is real belief in what can be achieved,” he said. “Our coach and many of our significant player signings for 2026 were committed to this regardless of the Super League decision and we will work hard together to achieve a new goal of winning the Championship in 2026.”As for York, they can look forward to those marquee matches against Wigan and the newly crownedchampions, Hull KR. The Knights and Toulouse will receive only half the central funding the top 12 in the gradings receive – about £650,000 – but Goodchild has stressed they are aiming to be competitive and capture the imagination of people in North Yorkshire.“There are over 2,000 season-ticket holders at clubs like Hull FC, Hull KR and Leeds who live in a York postcode,” he said. “People want to see elite sport and they want to see the big brands. Now that we’re playing on their level in a local area, we’ll see how many convert to their home team.“The city of York is buzzing. We’re going in there to make a difference and we will not be playing catchup.”Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueLondon BroncosBradford BullsRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Eagle was also the biggest shareholder at Palace until July, whenTextor sold his 43% staketo the former US ambassador to the United Kingdom Woody Johnson.Arteta backs Gyökeres, Palmer injury blow, Liverpool v Manchester United news – football liveRead moreIconic brought the legal action against Textor in July, alleging he had failed to honour a contract to buy back their $75m stake if Eagle was not floated on the stock exchange, plus 11% in annual interest.Textor had countersued Iconic in the United States in July alleging he was duped, but the Florida district court dismissed that motion this week, ruling the case should be heard in the UK.In his defence, Textor claimed Iconic failed to hand over the paperwork required to complete the deal, most notably a stock transfer form and share certificate, and argued the obligation to buy them out was never triggered.In a judgment published by the commercial court, Judge Pelling KC ruled in favour of Iconic on a preliminary issue.A spokesperson for Iconic Sports said: “Today’s decision from the UK Commercial Court confirms unequivocally that John Textor knowingly violated contractual commitments and owes Iconic Sports approximately $97m excluding legal costs. Iconic intends to recover the funds that are rightfully owed, and will pursue all options, in any jurisdiction, to do so.”Textor confirmed his intention to appeal. “While this is a preliminary hearing, I am disappointed with the decision not to end this lawsuit at the outset. I intend to appeal.”Textor has endured a difficult time since watching Palace win the FA Cup at Wembley in May, the final game of his eventful four-year co-ownership. In addition to selling his Palace stake he resigned from the Lyon board in June after they wererelegated to Ligue 2 for breaching financial rules, although Eagle remains the club’s biggest shareholder and the club have since been reinstated in the top flight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its abrupt collapse triggered the most significant financial crisis since 2008.While SVB’sunderlying issues stemmed from earlier investment decisions, the collapse occurred when it announced a $1.75bn capital raising, telling investors it needed to plug a hole caused by the sale of its loss-making bond portfolio.Thiscaused a run on the bankas clients became alarmed that it was short of capital. Two days later SVB collapsed, marking the largest bank failure in the US since the global financial crisis.Reid said that markets were especially wary of a domino effect, as the issues faced by the two banks followed thebankruptcy of the sub-prime automotive lender Tricolor last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Friday, the county said it had reached another major settlement for $828m, pending approval by the board of supervisors, the county governing body, and the county claims board.Los Angeles approves $4bn payout to settle thousands of sexual abuse claimsRead more“Our settlements balance our obligation to compensate victims and treat their experiences with compassion, with the need to put strong protections in place to protect taxpayers from fraud,” Kathryn Barger, the chair of the Los Angeles county board of supervisors, said in a statement.There are still 2,500 other unresolved cases, not covered by either settlement, that remain, and that number is expected increase, according to the county. The settlements have added to the county’sunprecedented financial problems, which mounted after the wildfires that ravaged the region earlier this year.County officials said in announcing the new settlement that “the credibility of every individual claim will be reviewed, and plaintiffs determined to have submitted fraudulent claims will receive no money from the settlement”.Authorities are investigating allegations that some people were paid to file claims. Nine plaintiffs included in the first settlement said they were paid to file a lawsuit, and four of have said they made fraudulent claims, according to a Los Angeles Times investigation.The lawsuits filed by thousands of people alleged they were mistreated and sexually abused in foster care and juvenile detention facilities in the county with claims as far back as 1959. They were able to sue because of aCalifornialaw that took effect in 2020 that suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims, allowing them to bring cases for three years.The county said its ability to assess the validity of allegations was hampered by a lack of records, the sheer number of cases and court ordered limits on legal discovery, officials said.Under the $4bn settlement, the amount paid to each plaintiff could range from $100,000 to $3m. If the latest settlement is approved, individual awards will be determined based on factors including the severity of abuse alleged.In its statement, the county said that claims brought by the law firm Downtown LA Law Group, or DTLA, in the April settlement will undergo additional scrutiny.Some of the plaintiffs represented by the firm told the LA Times that people they met outside a county social services office offered them money to submit claims, drove them to the DTLA firm and then paid them amounts ranging from $50 to $200 each. Non-attorneys are prohibited from soliciting people to sign up for lawsuits with a firm under California law.DTLA has denied any wrongdoing. Plaintiffs represented by the firm could be asked to do additional interviews and provide more proof of allegations, depending on the nature of the claim and the suspected fraud, the county said.The county may also refer attorneys accused of paying for claims to the state bar for possible disciplinary action, officials said.DTLA Law Group said it filtered through nearly 13,000 inquiries and only accepted a fraction of the cases.“We do not pay our clients to file lawsuits, and we strongly oppose such actions. If we ever became aware that anyone associated with us, in any capacity, did such a thing, we would end our relationship with them immediately,” the firm said. “We want justice for real victims.”The county has put into place more safeguards to prevent abuse and act quickly if it does occur, officials said. That includes a new hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against county employees that is expected to be in place by year’s end.But officials said the law allowing the lawsuits has placed severe financial stress on the county and required cuts to “critical” programs and services and that “common sense fixes that strike the right balance for victims and LA county and other public entities” are needed.“LA county and other local governments must balance their obligations to past victims with the need to avoid ruinous financial impacts that would undermine the very social safety net services that our young people, families and communities depend on today,” said Joe Nicchitta, the acting county chief executive.The $4bn settlement in April far surpassed a $2.6bn settlement reached in 2022 with Boy Scouts of America the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in US history at the time.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesWest CoastCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Whether the world listened or not we can put to one side, but it puts the world on notice that he was an offender and a sexual offender.”If the 14-count federal case had gone to trial and the government had lost, Acosta argued, “that says that he got away with it, that you can do that more. And so we thought it was very, very important to send that signal, and that’s why … that’s one reason we favored the negotiated plea.”Acosta noted that the Palm Beach state attorney’s office had tried to encourage at least three victims to testify to a state grand jury – but only one had shown up. Acosta said federal prosecutors were uncertain that they could successfully prosecute Epstein given inconsistencies in some victims’ accounts.“Many victims refused to testify. Many victims had changing stories. All of us understood why they had changing stories, but they did. And defense counsel would have … cross-examination would have been withering,” he explained.“Many of them had issues in their background. They had MySpace pages, they had priors that would’ve been used against them by defense counsel. And that was a time when, in all candor, defense could be much, much tougher on victims on the stand.”But in making a non-prosecution deal with Epstein – one that Maxwell later tried to use as a basis for an appeal against her 2021 sex-trafficking conviction and was rejected earlier this month by the supreme court – Acosta said prosecutors anticipated Florida authorities would ensure Epstein served all his 13-month sentence in jail.“We had an assurance that he would be in continuous confinement,” Acosta said. Later in the interview, he added: “Had we known that he was going to get work release, this would not have gone forward.”But Acosta denied thatDonald Trump, afriend of Epstein’suntil a falling out over a property deal and a dispute over Epstein attempting to hire staff away from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago business, had ever been consulted about it. “He moved in circles that I did not move in,” he said.The transcript release comes on the day that Prince Andrew agreed togive up his royal titleof the Duke of York and other honors after it was revealed that he continued his friendship with Epstein after he said, in a 2019 TV interview, it had ended.The new release also comes days ahead of aposthumously published memoirby Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked to Andrew by Epstein and co-conspiratorGhislaine Maxwellon three occasions when she was 17.In the interview with the oversight committee Acosta indicated that Epstein’s defense team, which included constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, came close to unethical.“Everyone is entitled to an aggressive defense,” Acosta said. “I don’t think the line was crossed. I don’t think there was misconduct … but it was distasteful. It did frustrate our attorneys.”Earlier, Robert Garcia, a Democrat on the oversight committee, releaseda letterto Pam Bondi, the attorney general, demanding that she end her efforts to obstruct the panel’s investigation into Epstein.Garcia claimed that Bondi had refused to comply with a congressional subpoena to release the full Epstein files or co-operate with its investigation into “a corrupt quid-quo-pro between the DoJ and Ghislaine Maxwell”.Garcia said the “the ongoing refusal” to provide the committee with information “demonstrates the Trump administration’s contempt for providing transparency to the American people about Epstein’s crimes”.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Face veils would still be allowed in airplanes, diplomatic premises and places of worship.The bill stipulates fines for those wearing face veils in public ranging between 200 euros and 4,000 euros (£175 and £3,475).President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa still has to approve the bill. He could veto it or send it to the constitutional court for review.If signed into law,Portugalwould join a number of European countries such as Austria, France, Belgium and the Netherlands who have full or partial bans on face and head coverings.Not many women in Portugal wear such coverings, but the issue of Islamic veils has generated controversy similar to other European countries.Chega cited France and other EU countries’ rationales for banning face coverings commonly worn by Muslim women. The party received support for the bill from center-right parties.In its bill, Chega said that hiding the face subjects individuals – especially women – “to situations of exclusion and inferiority” and was incompatible with principles such as “liberty, equality and human dignity”.Lawmakers from left-leaning parties disagreed.“This initiative is used solely to target foreigners, those who have a different faith,” said center-left Socialist party lawmaker Pedro Delgado Alves whose party voted against the bill.He said that while no woman should be forced to wear a veil, the far-right party’s approach was wrong.Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropeIslamnewsShareReuse this content"

It is one of the foundation blocks of life on Earth.Using deep-learning algorithms, the authors of the new paper compiled data from satellites and monitoring ships to assess the change in the oceans’ hue. They found a significant decline of greenness – about 0.35 micrograms per cubic metre each year – over the more than two decade period of the study. The trend was twice as high in coastal regions and more than four times greater near river estuaries.They associate this with a reduction in the ecological functioning of the ocean, finding a 0.088% annual decrease in carbon sequestration capacity, equivalent to 32 million tons. “The decline in surface phytoplankton’s carbon sequestration capacity has profound implications for the carbon cycle,” said one of the authors, Di Long of Tsinghua University in Beijing.The new paper says the change was probably caused by rising temperatures associated with climate change.The heating of the upper strata of ocean near the surface has widened the temperature difference with the colder depths, which is thought to be blocking the vertical transport of the nutrients on which the phytoplankton depend.This confirms theories about the impact of global heating on ocean stratification. Collaborating author Michael Mann, of the University of Pennsylvania, said: “This is the first study to robustly demonstrate that, yes, we can confidently conclude that we are seeing a decrease in the greenness of the ocean, indicating a lowering of marine productivity, constituting yet another threat to humanity associated with fossil fuel burning and human-caused planetary warming.”The new research contradicts several previous studies that suggested algal blooms were increasing in the oceans.The latest paper says earlier studies were less comprehensive. It acknowledges that the situation differs from region to region and can be affected by runoffs from agriculture and other human activity, but concludes the broader picture of “significant decline” of phytoplankton is clear across the low and mid latitudes.“These changes will profoundly affect the magnitude and distribution of marine ecosystem functioning,” it says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

While this means the measure survives, and could still be imposed, it also gives the US and its allies – including Russia, Saudi Arabia and other petrostates – an opportunity to step up their pressure on other countries to ditch the charge.Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO secretary general, said the outcome was not a cause for celebration. Taking aim at the fractious nature of the discussions, he chided delegates: “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”The measure, which would meanshipowners pay a small charge on the CO2produced by their vesselsand have incentives to seekcleaner fuelsandupgrade their ships, was passed in a majority vote in April. But under the complex rules of the world’s shipping regulator, that vote had to be reaffirmed at a further meeting this week.For months, the US – which walked out of the April talks – put pressure on other countries to reject the move. In the past fortnight, this was stepped up to what some countries said amounted to an unprecedented campaign against them.The USthreatened countries, and individual officials, with tariffs, penalties and visa revocations if they supported the pricing mechanism.Dr Simon Bullock, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, said: “Yet again, powerful fossil fuel states are successfully blocking global efforts to cooperate on climate change. This is not the result the industry wanted, nor one the world’s people can afford. Progressive shipping businesses and nations can still chart a course to a clean shipping future, but Mr Trump’s aggressive, destructive lobbying has their made their job much harder.”Meanwhile, some petrostates including Saudi Arabia held out the offer of sweeteners to countries that voted against the plan, which has been several years in the making.In the final tally, 57 countries voted favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying, and 21 abstentions. In April, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained.Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate minister, expressed the frustration of many small developing nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”After Friday’s vote, countries will have to reconvene in a year to consider the proposal again. The delay means uncertainty and confusion for companies involved in shipping and in the global trade in many key commodities.John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “By delaying adoption of its net zero framework, the IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown. With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That could mean a delay until near the end of this decade, at least.Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry. Much of the money would be used to help companies upgrade their vessels and move to lower carbon fuels, and pay for modifications to ports, rather than beallocated to poor countriesto help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, as many had hoped.If it is eventually passed, the measure isnot likely to place significant costs on imported goods, despite theconcerns of some exporting countries.Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century. The IMO has beenworking on various plans to reduce carbon from shipping for the last two decades, butprogress has been slow.The extraordinary scenes at the IMO, where discussions are normally staid and highly technical, bodes ill for further talks onways to raise the revenues needed for poor countries to deal with the impacts of extreme weather, which will be continued at theCop30 UN climate summitin Brazil next month.Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at the green campaigning organisation Seas at Risk, said: “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. No single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail, but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet does not have time to waste.”Explore more on these topicsShipping emissionsShipping industryClimate crisisPollutionTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The company is currently being investigated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and lawmakers in the UK have been reviewing thebillions in renewables subsidiesthe North Yorkshire plant receives.The new lawsuit against Drax alleges that the Amite county facility – which shares afence linewith the larger community – has unlawfully exposed locals to excessive levels of chemicals and pollutants. It says those in turn have coated people’s homes and put them at greater risk of diseases such as cancer and respiratory illness.“This case is about holding a multibillion-dollar foreign corporation accountable for poisoning a small Mississippi community,” said Letitia Johnson, an attorney at Singleton Schreiber,which filed the lawsuit.Residents of Gloster’s predominantly Black, low-income town have reported feeling dizzy, getting headaches and otherwise feeling unwell since the facility opened a decade ago, and they have expressed concern that any plans for increased emissions could worsen respiratory illnesses, heart disease and other health issues linked to the pollutants.The UK government has previously been accused offunding “environmental racism”through the subsidies to Drax.“You got dust falling all night,”saidJimmy Brown, who lives less than a mile from the plant, the conservation outlet Mongabay reported. “You got constant noise from the plant. You got odor. You got truck traffic [carrying tons of trees and chipped wood] all day, every day. That’s what a lot of people don’t understand. It’s nonstop.”The approval came despite the site’s previous standardsviolations, which resulted in a $250,000 fine last year for releasing over 50% more harmful pollutants than allowed and a $2.5m penalty in 2020 for underestimating volatile organic compound outputs over several years.After the permit decision this week in Mississippi, a Drax spokesperson said the company was “pleased that the [permit board] has listened to the clear recommendations of its own technical staff, and the voices of Gloster community leaders, local businesses and a large number of our neighbors in Gloster”.In a statement, Drax Biomass said it was aware of the lawsuit and while it could not comment on ongoing legal matters it would “strive to be a good neighbour in our communities and to support their wellbeing and prosperity”.In a recent letter to Mississippi’s governor, Tate Reeves, and the MDEQ permit board, 85 advocacy organizations expressed concern at the effect Drax’s manufacturing has had on Gloster’s residents and urged steps “to ensure they can breathe clean, safe air”.“From young children with asthma who are unable to play outside, to elderly residents reliant on costly breathing treatments, it is clear that Gloster is a community in crisis,” the organizations wrote.“Those who can afford to leave are doing so,” they added, “while those who remain are left to suffer worsening health.”Explore more on these topicsMississippiAir pollutionPollutionRaceCancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

James Roscoe, the deputy head of mission in Washington, is temporarily filling the role.Sedwillleft the civil service in late 2020and has since taken up a number of private sector positions,including as a senior adviserto the financial advisory group Rothschild & Co.He is a member of the House of Lords and sits on the joint committee on national security strategy, which is due to question the national security adviser,Jonathan Powell, next month.Sedwill’s recent comments criticising thecollapse of the trial of two men accused of spying for Beijinghave raised eyebrows in Whitehall. He told a podcast he was “genuinely puzzled, to put it politely, about the basis on which this trial has fallen apart”.One government source said: “I can’t imagine that will have endeared him to Downing Street.” But other insiders suggested that Sedwill’s comments could put him in good stead with the Trump administration.One senior foreign policy figure said Sedwill had “an ‘edge’ to him, as Mandelson did, which might be seen as necessary to cut through in Trumpian DC. Being seen to be tough on the trial’s collapse would give him credibility in DC if Starmer picked him. And Starmer could think that choosing Mark would deflect some of the ongoing criticism.”Sedwill has since praised the prime minister for defending the deputy national security adviserMatthew Collins’s role in the controversy.Varun Chandra, the No 10 business adviser who has been a leading figure in trade talks with the US, is seen as another contender for the role. But one government source said his appointment would be a “loss to the centre” as well as a political risk given he is not a diplomat.Other senior officials who have been tipped for the role include Clive Alderton, the king’s private secretary, and Christian Turner, a political director of the Foreign Office who has just been appointed ambassador to the UN.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pierce, who built strong links with the Trump administration when she was in the post, is currently special envoy to the western Balkans.The new ambassador will be tasked with maintaining the positive relationship that the Starmer government has established with Trump’s administration. Mandelsontook up the role in Februaryand held it for just seven months before he was forced out. His resignation came just days before Trump’s second state visit to the UK.At first ministers considered making a speedy appointment to ensure the ambassador would be in place for Trump’s arrival in London, but ultimately decided to hold off and run a fuller recruitment process.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyJonathan PowellPeter MandelsonDonald TrumpForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

The prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward KC said the case had a terrorist connection and taken place during “a session where he was permitted to use cooking equipment”.Ledward told the court that Abedi “attacked and attempted to murder three prison officers using hot oil and makeshift weapons he had constructed himself”, shouting “Allahu Akbar” twice during the attack. A fourth officer was assaulted.Ledward said there was no indication the defendant had any previous hostility towards the alleged victims, but that he did hold an extremist mindset considering “not least his conviction in 2020 in connection with the Manchester Arena bombing”.Abedi was convicted of assisting his suicide bomber brother, Salman Abedi, who killed 22 people by detonating a homemade device at an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017.The attack allegedly took place on 12 April this year at HMP Frankland, County Durham, where Abedi has been kept since being given a life sentence with a minimum term of 55 years in 2020 for helping to orchestrate the Manchester Arena attack, the longest minimum term ever imposed by a British court.Abedi, who was not represented by a lawyer in court by his own wishes, pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder and one count of actual bodily harm.The trial will begin on 18 January 2027 and is expected to last for two to three weeks, while a provisional hearing has been set for 30 January 2026.When Abedi was asked by Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb if he wished to be represented during the proceedings, Abedi responded: “Yeah, basically I don’t want to attend anyway. That’s why.” He was then remanded into custody.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The leader’s term would be capped at 21 months, keeping the founding team in place until late 2027, unless members decide otherwise.The CEC, chair and vice-chair model is billed as a central pillar of Your Party’s attempt to build a political organisation “accountable not to billionaires and their client politicians, but to ordinary people”, breaking decisively with what organisers call the top-down Westminster model.If endorsed at a founding conference in Liverpool on 29-30 November, the blueprint would turn a loose and often fractious alliance into Britain’s first major party to the left of Labour in a generation, giving it formal rules, internal elections and a permanent structure.Your Party is expected to confirm its official name within weeks, with members due to vote on it before the conference, it is understood. Those involved emphasise that Corbyn and Sultana are steering the public process but will have no guaranteed leadership role once members vote next year.View image in fullscreenSome supporters have encouraged Sultana to run for leader, given her accusations of a ‘sexist boys club’.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThere is already speculation about whether Corbyn will stand, with some allies urging him to consider the risks of running given he has at times been privately frustrated by Sultana’s unilateral decisions.Others, meanwhile, have encouraged Sultana to run on her own ticket, given her questions over whether she thinks the party is democratic enough, her accusations of a “sexist boys’ club” and two self-directed interventions.The document introduces a digital democracy process, encouraging individual members to submit edits and suggestions online, with the text evolving “iteratively” over several weeks. Thousands of delegates will then be chosen by sortition (lottery) to vote on amendments at the Liverpool conference before the final version goes to an all-member vote.Insiders said the draft would include recall clauses, allowing elected officers to be removed midterm if they lost the confidence of members, part of wider safeguards intended to prevent any leadership drift. They also confirmed that the constitution would contain strict procedures to guarantee that selection processes remained democratic and that “due diligence” could not be misused, a clear response to criticisms of candidate vetting under Labour’s current leadership.The CEC would approve candidates approval and the party’s finances, powers that, some warn, could eclipse the elected leadership itself.Supporters counter that those responsibilities are necessary to prevent MPs consolidating control and point to new oversight clauses designed to ensure accountability. Sympathetic organisers concede a tension remains between Sultana’s democratic idealism and the administrative realities of party-building.Voters’ voices are being shut out of British politics. Your Party has a radical plan to change that | Jeremy CorbynRead moreThe draft comes after months of turmoil. Some said Sultana’s premature announcement in July was intended to prod Corbyn into engaging more decisively, reflecting frustration among younger organisers at his hesitation to formalise their joint work.Last month, Sultana and her alliespromoted a membership email drive that went live without full signoff, prompting internal complaints over data handling. The MP then accused colleagues in the Independent Alliance of running a “sexist boys’ club”, saying she launched the portal to protect grassroots engagement after being sidelined. Corbyn’s team denounced the site and referred the issue to the Information Commissioner’s Office.More than 20,000 people registered within hours.Both Corbyn and Sultana later said the dispute had been resolved, with Sultana joking that the pair werelike the Gallagher brothers, and one ally saying that, like the brothers, “one’s all heart, one’s all stubbornness”. Debate among supporters has since shifted to how the drafting group was selected and whether its internal workings would ever be made public.Organisers argue that disagreements are inevitable in a democratic project. Asked whether the constitution should include a binding clause to prevent future public rows, one insider said: “We don’t think democratic parties can or should do that. There will be vigorous debate at assemblies, but it should be kept respectful.”Regional assemblies begin this week, with more than 20 events planned nationwide before the conference. No independent body has yet been appointed to oversee the leadership vote planned for March 2026, though insiders say the ballot will be run by a trusted independent professional body to ensure transparency.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsJeremy CorbynZarah SultananewsShareReuse this content"

On average, 220 US residents still died of overdose each day in 2024.But when the CDC announced the decline in May of 2025, the downward trend in overdose fatalities had already begun to reverse in seven states, according to the Guardian’s findings.Line chart comparing a few state’s opioid death trends to the US average.

West Virginia was earlier and higher, Alaska’s later, and Georgia’s more or less in line with the national total.Public health expertswere unsureofwhat factors led to the declineand whether the reduction in deaths was the beginning of a long-term trend. “You can talk to five different experts, and you’ll get five different explanations for why the deaths are coming down. Nobody really knows,” said Andrew Kolodny, medical director for the opioid policy research collaborative at Brandeis University.In order to better understand how – and why – the overdose epidemic is clearly diminishing in some parts of the country, but progress is waning in others, the Guardian analyzed key data points, including: CDC data on overdose fatalities and the distribution of medication for opioid overdose and addiction; US Census Bureau data on population, poverty, Medicaid and uninsured rates; and drug seizure data from the National Forensic Laboratory Information System. The analysis also reviewed data on patients in substance-use treatment provided by the urinalysis company MillenniumHealth, an accredited drug-testing specialty laboratory.View image in fullscreenUS county-level opioid overdose mapWhile overdoses declined nationally between August 2023 and December 2024, the most recent month when county-level data is available, they increased by as much as 120% during that time in some US counties. State-level data, which is available through April of this year, showed deaths beginning to rise again in January, reaching near peak levels in Arizona, and climbing more modestly in Delaware, Hawaii, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington.Overdoses are still the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-44, according to the CDC, and would be listed as one of the 10 leading causes of death overall were they not lumped together in a single categorywith other accidental deaths and injuries.Overdoses claimed over 80,000 US lives in 2024 – more thantwice as manyas motor vehicle accidents and nearly three times as many as Covid-19. Yet this was still seen as a major improvement.Marc Fishman, an addiction psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on substance-use disorders in youths, is frustrated at the lack of national attention on addiction treatment.“Who ever would have thought that we’d be applauding 80,000 deaths?” said Fishman. “If 80 goes to 70 goes to 60, that’d be something to celebrate. Let’s see if the trend continues.”DrugsupplyOf the factors the Guardian analyzed, changes to the amount of fentanyl, and in some cases methamphetamine, in the drug supply, as well as geography, were most strongly linked to changes in overdose deaths.These two factors are likely related, according to recent research and the Guardian’sanalysis. According toa September Lancet study: “Starting in 2013, fentanyl began replacing heroin in the eastern US and spread westward, driving profound increases in overdose deaths” that have not yet abated to the same degree as they have in theeast.The increased prescription of opioids by doctors led many Americans to become addicted starting in the 90s, especially in eastern states such as West Virginia, where physical laborers took pills for their pain. Tightened restrictions on prescription opioids starting in the early 2010s led more people to turn to illegal opioids, such as heroin. Then fentanyl, which is cheaperand 70 timesmore potent, began to replace it.Bar chart showing that western counties had the highest share of people living where overdose deaths increasedView image in fullscreenEight per cent of the population in western counties included in the analysis were living in areas where overdoses were still increasing by more than 10% since the peak of the crisis, according to the Guardian’s analysis, which also showed that peaks in overdose death rates lined up with peaks in fentanyl prevalence. The percentage of drug seizures containing fentanyl peaked in 28 states in 2023, the same year that overdoses began to decline nationally.NaloxoneThe overdose-reversal drug naloxone is widely praised as a game changer in the crisis, and is often cited first as a possible explanation for the decline in drug overdose deaths, including inCDC releases.Opioid overdoses occur when the brain’s opioid receptors are overwhelmed and the body neglects to breathe. Naloxone reverses this process by blocking the opioid receptors in the brain, sending the recipient into immediate withdrawal as they awake.Naloxone undoubtedly saves lives, and every public health expert who spoke with the Guardian unequivocally supports its continued promotion. But its necessity is also a grim sign of the severity of the US opioid crisis. Every time someone needed naloxone to reverse an overdose, that person was already on the edge of death – without a friend or bystander with naloxone on hand, their chances of survival would have been slim. People who use opioids encourage one another to “never use alone” and to have naloxone on them at all times.“It is terrifying,” Fishman said. “I’ve been yelling about this for years. You can’t say I’m gonna reverse an acute overdose and then celebrate when you haven’t addressed the disorder.” Substance-use treatment can help prevent overdoses in the longer term, but it requires sustained investment in both addiction and mental health treatment. People who struggle with addiction are often self-medicating for other mental health conditionssuch as depression or PTSD.It is difficult to tease out how much naloxone has contributed to a reduction in overdose death rates.Evidenceismixed, andthe few studiesthat investigate the impact of naloxone on overdose rates were mostly conducted before overdoses began skyrocketing in the wake of Covid-19.Flying blindBack in 2015, the CDC issuedrecommendationsto address the increasing amount of fentanyl in the drug supply. Some, such as an uptick in the distribution of naloxone, have happened. Many others, like consistent analysis of drugs found on the scene of overdoses, have not.In statements about declining overdose deaths, the CDC toutedits improved data collection and sharing. Experts say it is not enough.“We should have much better data on this,” said Kolodny. “If you think about when Covid was raging, on a county level, on a zip code level, you could find out about Covid positivity rates on tests. You could find out deaths, hospitalization, and it was easily available for everybody. For opioids, we’re almost 30 years into the epidemic, and we still don’t have adequate surveillance.”Kolodny said that CDC overdose death data is “the best we have” to track the crisis – “inadequate as it is. We’re looking at [data from] April. That’s crazy. It’s October.”Eric Dawson, vice-president of clinical affairs at Millennium Health, said the company is already working with some health departments to try to “close the gap between what’s happening with fatal overdose today and what we’re being told today happened six, seven months ago”. Amodeling study published in Jamathis year found that Millennium Health’s urinalysis data for patients in substance-use treatment could be used to accurately predict overdose deaths.The CDC only releases data on a past 12-month basis, so it is not possible to pinpoint spikes. Data about what type of drug caused a death, and the demographics of the fatalities, is available, but extremely limited – there is no way to tease out how many deaths were caused by multiple drugs, for example.The CDC has not yet released data on how death rates among groups hardest hit by the crisis, such as Black and Indigenous men, changed in 2024, andmay never do so undernew Trump administration policies. When overdose fatalities began to decline in 2023, they were still accelerating among Indigenous, Black, Latino and multiracial populations, according to aJuneJama study.The CDC did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.Cartogram of the US, where a series of charts representing states show their overdose death trends.View image in fullscreenWhile the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) collects data on the drug supply, it does not share detailed data on information such as drug purity. Publicly available drug seizure data is only availableon state and national levelsand is currently more than 10 months old. When the DEA does occasionally share alerts and reports, they are oftenmonths or years behind new drug supply trends.In its most recent drug threat assessment report, the DEA announced that the purity of fentanylwas decreasing. Kolodny noted that this decrease in purity is likely related to the lower prevalence of fentanyl in Millennium Health and drug seizure data. “Fentanyl became more expensive for thecartels to manufacture, and so less fentanyl is coming into the United States,” Kolodny said. But these trends do not apply evenly across the country. The DEA would not share regionally specific data on fentanyl purity with the Guardian, or respond to requests for comment.Public health officials and researchers who spoke with the Guardian said the DEA doesn’t share this type of data with them either. “I don’t know why they don’t,” Jenny Hua, medical director of the Chicago department of public health, said. “I don’t know if it’s a cultural thing.”“Of course, that data should be more readily available,” Kolodny said, adding that he understands why the DEA might be skeptical of researchers, whose goals don’t necessarily align with those of law enforcement.While drug seizure data for 2025 is not yet available, 2025 Millennium Health data showed that in states where overdoses began to increase again this year, indicators of fentanyl use were also increasing.Fentanyl positivity rates both in urinalysis and drug seizure data were most overwhelmingly tied to overdose death rates, but the picture becomes more nuanced when you zoom in on a local level.Line charts showing the similar trends of overdose deaths and positive fentanyl testing in three western US statesIn some states, including Ohio, Washington and Oregon, methamphetamine was also closely tied to overdose death rates, according to the Guardian’s analysis.Data on the drug supply can help inform how to allocate overdose prevention dollars. Many interventions, including naloxone, are exclusively helpful for preventing opioid deaths. Methamphetamine is a stimulant, and stimulant-use disorder requires very different treatment than opioid-use disorder.Katie Strozyk, who manages the opioid and overdose response program in Thurston county, Washington, said that surveys show many residents primarily use methamphetamine, but it can be difficult for them to find treatment because resources are directed toward opioids. Overdose fatalities increased by 6% between the peak of the crisis and December 2024 in Thurston county.Overdose prevention is criticalKolodny said that if overdose prevention was a priority, it would be possible to get more precise data at the local level much closer to real time. Some US counties are already demonstrating that this is possible. In Cook county, Illinois, for example, drug death toxicology reports can be available within less than a month.Chicago has also ramped up its tracking of the drug supply and other overdose-related information, such as ambulance data, in order to pinpoint overdose spikes at a neighborhood level and understand why they are happening.How Chicago succeeded in reducing drug overdose deathsRead moreBut in most of the country, this type of timely and hyper-local response is not happening. Strozyk of the Thurston county, Washington, opioid response program said officials they “may or may not ever know the underlying cause” of a local uptick in overdoses, so they focus on a proactive approach.Hua said there are many factors beyond the control of health departments that influence death rates. It is easier to have a coordinated response in a big city, where people and resources are concentrated. Changes to the drug supply are also affecting different regions differently.A spokesperson for the Georgia department of public health also said they lack local data.Catoosa county, Georgia, saw an 120% increase in overdose deaths since the national peak, the highest among counties with data available in the Guardian’s analysis. Meanwhile, Dougherty county, Georgia, saw one of the largest decreases, by 74%. There is “no clear cause” for the disparity in the statewide data, the spokesperson said. “This is an example of why evolved surveillance and data-sharing strategies are critical to providing local partners with the information they need to focus their efforts on specific counties, populations and overdose risk factors.”Kolodny says it is important to understand why deaths are increasing in certain states, noting that most of these states have high rates of methamphetamine use. “In methamphetamine states, you have a lot of people who are addicted to both drugs [methamphetamine and fentanyl],” Kolodny said, “Maybe there’s an increase in purity of methamphetamine that’s causing you more deaths. That’s hard to tease out.”graphic showing percentage change in US counties’ overdose deaths from August 2023 to December 2024View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignA spokesperson for the Medicaid office in Arizona, where overdoses reached near peak rates in 2025, said the rise “is driven largely by synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl, which is increasingly found in combination with stimulants such as methamphetamine. These drug combinations complicate overdose response and increase lethality.” The spokesperson said Arizona faces unique challenges, including “proximity to major trafficking routes”, and that the state was leveraging CDC funding to analyze drug paraphernalia and identify emerging drug threats, and was also working to link more people to substance use treatment.The Guardian’s analysis of Millennium Health data found that the more you zoom in, the more specific trends emerge. In Cook county, there is a much stronger association between cocaine-positive urine samples and overdose deaths than in any state level data. Fentanyl is also associated with overdose deaths in Cook county. Hua’s team is already responding to cocaine’s popularity in the city.“Whether it’s meth or cocaine, we treat these as stimulant-use disorders,” Hua said. As part of this focus, the health department has formed a partnership with Northwestern University to provide “contingency management” – a highly effective treatment strategy in which patients are rewarded for abstaining from drug use.According to Kolodny, one of the reasons that the crisis became so alarming is because the focus is on deaths, rather than prevention.Acrisis of addictionWhile death and drug supply surveillance in the US is lacking, there is even less good data on addiction, said Kolodny. “It’s very, very rudimentary, and it was completely useless until a couple of years ago. It’s called the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, so you can extrapolate from about 70,000 face-to-face interviews, but that’s not adequate.”In Portugal,there is an agency devotedto tracking and intervening in addictive behaviors. The agency aggregates data from health agencies, law enforcement, population surveys and even drugs found in wastewater analysis to get a full picture. Portugal’s per capita overdose death rate is less than 1/30 of that in the US.The US national survey is conducted by SAMHSA, an agency whose future under the Trump administration is uncertain. New rules that will require Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month could also compromise patients’ ability to access treatment – it can be very difficult to work while in intensive substance-use recovery. These rules willgo into effect in 2027under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July.Deaths should be considered a symptom of the crisis, not the main outcome, Kolodny explained. “At the height of the Aids crisis, tens of thousands of people were dying from PCP pneumonia,” he said, “If you had Aids, it knocked out your immune system, you got this type of pneumonia.”But, Kolodny continued: “We didn’t approach the Aids crisis by calling it a PCP pneumonia epidemic. We realized it was HIV, an infectious disease that can be prevented through clean syringes and condoms, and it can be treated with antiretroviral therapy. But for the opioid crisis,” he said, we have it backwards. “This is a crisis of addiction: if you really understand that most of these deaths are occurring in people who are addicted, not people saying, ‘Hey, shooting up fentanyl would be a fun way to spend a Friday night.’ It’s people who are really struggling.”ContributorsVisuals: Andrew WitherspoonData editing: Will CraftCopy editing: Rusha HaljuciIllustration: Angelica AlzonaThis article was produced as a project for the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s 2025 Impact Fund for Reporting on Health Equity and Health Systems"

Nobody was injured in the attack and an investigation has been opened by anti-mafia police in Rome.The bomb, possibly made from fireworks, was planted between two vases outside Ranucci’s home, according to reports in the Italian press on Friday morning, citing police sources. The device was not detonated remotely, the reports said, and had possibly been left with a lit fuse.View image in fullscreenSigfrido Ranucci is host of Report on the state broadcaster Rai.Photograph: Stefano Colarieti/APRanucci, who for years has been under police protection owing to threats made against him, told reporters he heard “a tremendous bang”, adding that the blast was so powerful it could have killed a passerby.Video footage of the aftermath posted by the Report programme on social media showed twisted metal and shattered car windows.Ranucci said he had received so many threats that it would be difficult to trace who was behind the attack. “There’s an endless list of threats, of various kinds, which I’ve received and which I’ve always reported to the judicial authorities and which my security detail has always reported. But what happened last night was a worrying new level because it was right in front of my home, where bullets were found last year.”Politicians from across the divide expressed solidarity with Ranucci, whose investigations have often targeted government ministers; he has criticised allegedpolitical interference in Raiby Giorgia Meloni’s far-right administration, while several members of her coalition have sued Report.Meloni condemned the attack as “a serious act of intimidation”. She said in a statement: “Freedom and independence of information are essential values of our democracies, which we will continue to defend.”Elly Schlein, the leader of the opposition Democratic party, said the attack against Ranucci was an “attack on democracy and freedom of information”, adding: “We cannot accept any intimidation of investigative journalism.”Matteo Piantedosi, the interior minister, said Ranucci’s security detail would be raised to the maximum level.Massimiliano Capitanio, a commissioner at Agcom, Italy’s communications watchdog, said “attacking the freedom of expression is a vile terrorist act”, while the Fiom trade union said it was the result of “a climate of hatred” against Ranucci.Ranucci has written a book about the Italian mafia and in 2021 he described how a former prisoner told him that mobsters “had given the order to kill” him after the book was published, but the hit “was stopped”.On Sunday, he had announced the highlights of the forthcoming series of Report, including reports on the powerful ’Ndrangheta organised crime group in Calabria and Sicily’s Cosa Nostra.Italy ranks 49th in the world for press freedom, according to Reporters Without Borders.Explore more on these topicsItalyInvestigative journalismJournalist safetyTelevisionEuropeGiorgia MeloninewsShareReuse this content"

You know why? Because he doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States.”Maduro, who came to power in 2013, has recently shored up his security powers and deployed tens of thousands of troops around the country. He also accused Trump ofseeking regime change, an allegation the US president has downplayed.0:56Trump confirms attack on alleged 'drug-carrying submarine' in the Caribbean – videoLast week the New York Timesreported that Madurooffered a stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in recent months to stave off mounting pressure from the US.Meanwhile, Venezuelan government officials are said to have floated a plan in which Maduro would eventually leave office. The Miami Herald newspaperreported thatVice-President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother Jorge, who is president of the national assembly, had funneled proposals through intermediaries in Qatar to present themselves to Washington as a “more acceptable” alternative.The US has acknowledged carrying out at least five strikes on vessels nearVenezuelathat it says were transporting drugs, killing at least 27 people.A sixth strike targeted a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean on Thursday, and in what is believed to be the first such case, there were survivors among the crew, who were reportedly rescued and are being held on a navy ship.One sourcetold Reutersthat the vessel struck on Thursday moved below the water and was possibly a semi-submersible, which is a submarine-like vessel used by drug traffickers to avoid detection.Trump confirmed to reporters: “We attacked a submarine. That was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs – just so you understand.”US has seized survivors of attack on alleged narco-sub in CaribbeanRead moreHe added: “This was not an innocent group of people. I don’t know too many people that have submarines and that was an attack on a drug-carrying loaded-up submarine.”The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who was also present, did not dispute that there were survivors and repeatedly said details would be forthcoming.The US has described some of the victims in the first five strikes as Venezuelans, while the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, has suggested some were from his country. In Trinidad, family members of one man believed killed in a strike this week havedemanded proofhe was a drug trafficker.Venezuela’s government has said the strikes are illegal, amount to murder and are an aggression against the country.Trump has justified the strikes by asserting that the US is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the George W Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after theSeptember 11 attacks.But legal scholars have warned that the president’s use of overwhelming military force to combat the cartels, along with his authorisation of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law.Venezuela on edge over Trump regime change whispers: ‘If it does happen we are ready’Read moreJuanita Goebertus Estrada,Americasdirector at Human Rights Watch, said the attacks violated international human rights law and amounted to extrajudicial executions.“The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, or with alleged criminal groups involved. Under human rights law standards, officials engaging in law enforcement must seek to minimize injury and preserve human life. They may use lethal force only when strictly unavoidable to protect against an imminent threat of death or serious injury,” she said.The strikes have caused unease among Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, with some Republicans saying they had not received sufficient information on how the strikes were being conducted.Friday’s outburst was not the first that Trump has peppered the language of diplomacy with profanities. In June, frustrated with Israel and Iran attacking each other after a ceasefire, hetold a group of reportersthat the countries had “been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing”.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS politicsAmericasUS militaryDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The site has been a symbol of democracy and the focal point of anti-government protests on the Indian Ocean island since 40 student demonstrators were killed there by security forcesin May 1972.Then, on Saturday 11 October, the elite military unit Capsatcame out in supportof protesters, accompanying them to Place du 13 Mai. The next day, President Andry Rajoelina reportedlyfled the countryfor Dubai on a French military plane. On Friday, Capsat’s commander, Col Michael Randrianirina, was sworn in as transitional president for what he said would be 18 to 24 months.Young protesters, who had rallied as “Gen Z Madagascar”, were jubilant at the ousting of Rajoelina. Many were grateful to Capsat, which is responsible for military personnel and logistics. Some were worried about transitioning to military rule rather than a new civilian regime. All said they intended to keep fighting for a better Madagascar.Antonio, a shaggy-haired 17-year-old wearing a black face mask, bounded off stage after making a speech to the rapturous crowd in Place du 13 Mai on Wednesday evening. “I just wanted to say to them that the protests are not finished and that we must be vigilant,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe leaderless group calling itself Gen Z Madagascar took direct inspiration from other gen Z movements against corruption.Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/ReutersAntonio, who did not want to share his full name, had warm words for Capsat. “I thanked them for helping us to come here, to this sacred place, the 13 Mai,” he said. “Without them we wouldn’t have made it here.”But he reserved his most enthusiastic praise for his fellow activists: “I just want to thank gen Z, the people who truly protested … because it was them who gave us the victory.”Madagascar lies off the south-east coast ofAfrica, stretching almost 1,000 miles north to south. An island of 32 million people, it is rich in biodiversity and natural resources, including precious gems and vanilla.The former French colony is also extremely poor and plagued by corruption. Last year, its GDP per capita was just $545 (£405), the fifth poorest country in the world,according to the World Bank. It ranked140 out of 180countries in Transparency International’s 2024 corruption perceptions index.View image in fullscreenAndry Rajoelina giving a speech from an unknown location on Monday after being forced into hiding.Photograph: Presidency Of The Republic Of Madagascar/APWhile Rajoelina was a civilian ruler, he also came to power in a coup instigated by Capsat – short forCorps d’administration des personnels et des services administratifs et techniques (administrative body of personnel and administrative and technical services) – which backed him after he led three months of anti-government protests in 2009.Rajoelina, a former DJ who had risen to become mayor of Antananarivo, stepped aside as president in 2014 in favour of an ally, Hery Rajaonarimampianina. He returned to the presidency in the 2019 election and again in 2023, a vote that wasboycotted by the opposition, which claimed the poll had been rigged.The lot of Malagasay people has barely changed under 51-year-old Rajoelina. The country’s still tiny GDP per capita has risen just 22% since 2009. Only 5% of the population have a formal salaried job, according to theInternational Monetary Fund.The population hasmore than doubledin 30 years, with more than half under the age of 20, according to theWorld Health Organization. It is no wonder, then, that young people were liable to revolt when two councillors in Antananarivo were arrested in September for trying to organise a protest against water and electricity outages.1:31Protesters in Madagascar gather in the capital to celebrate – videoAleaderless group calling itself Gen Z Madagascarquickly formed online, with Facebook and Instagram accounts. They coordinated on Discord, a platform mainly used for socialising while gaming, and the secure messaging app Signal. Many only knew each other by aliases, members said earlier in October.They took direct inspiration from other gen Z movements against corruption, including in Indonesia and the Philippines. A particular influence was Nepal, where thegovernment was toppled in September, with Malagasy activists joining the Nepali gen Z discord to pick up protest tips. Moroccan young people then took to the streets in October under the name GenZ 212 (the 212 for the country’s international dialling code), protesting against poor education and health services.Gen Z Madagascar adopted the skull and crossbones flag from the Japanese anime series One Piece, which wasfirst flown in Indonesia in Augustand then in the Philippines in September. Instead of the original straw hat, the skull wore a pink and green satroka bucket hat from Madagascar’s Betsileo ethnic group. The flag is now flying inPlace du 13 Mai.View image in fullscreenProtesters hang a banner featuring the skull and crossbones flag adopted from a Japanese anime series and wearing a satroka bucket hat.Photograph: Zo Andrianjafy/ReutersThe initial reaction of Malagasy security forces was brutal. At least 22 people were killed in the first days of the protests in September,according to the UN. It said some were shot by the gendarmerie – police under the command of the defence ministry – and others killed in violence caused by criminal gangs and looters. Rajoelina disputed the toll, claiming last week there were “12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals”.However, the shooting did not stop straight away when Capsat said on Saturday 11 October that it would not fire on protesters and called on the rest of the military to “join forces” with it.On 10 October, Aina Sarobidy Randriamiharisoa travelled 75 miles after finishing his work as a mining truck mechanic to join the protests the next day. “What motivated me to go in the first place is that I am aware of what is happening in the country. That something is wrong and change is needed,” he said.Randriamiharisoa marched north with about 20 friends on Saturday afternoon. About a mile away from Place du 13 Mai, the gendarmerie pelted them with teargas. Then, Randriamiharisoa was shot through his left thigh by a live bullet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Sunday, the gendarmerie released a video statement admitting to “faults and excesses”.Randriamiharisoa underwent two operations, but never regained the feeling in his left foot. Then his toes started to turn black. On Wednesday, doctors amputated the leg above his knee. “I’m just thinking in a positive way. I did it for my country,” he said, adding that he hoped to find a sponsor to buy him a prosthetic leg and then return to work.As for the military takeover, Randriamiharisoa said he was uncertain about the soldiers’ intentions: “I don’t know if there’s something behind it, if it’s politics or if they just want to profit off the situation … because it’s like that almost every time in Madagascar.”Dr Velomahanina Razakamaharavo, a research fellow at the University of Reading, said that “for a long time, Capsat was viewed as being on the wrong side of history” because of its role in the violent 2009 coup.She added: “This time, however, public perception has shifted … Capsat’s decision to step in was seen as an act of courage and solidarity with the people. Their intervention altered the power dynamics and stopped further bloodshed.”Randrianirina, Madagascar’s new military ruler, was formerly the governor of the southern Androy district. He was arrested with an accomplice in November 2023 on accusations of plotting a coup, just before the most recent disputed elections, and handed a one-year suspended prison sentence.View image in fullscreenCol Michael Randrianirina (centre) after his swearing in ceremony in Antananarivo on Friday.Photograph: Rijasolo/AFP/Getty Images“We left at the beginning of February [2024] and resumed our status as officers in the shadows,” the 51-year-old told Agence France-Presse on Saturday. “I had no duties … I worked at home, I cooked, I played football.”Razakamaharavo said the new president had a reputation for integrity: “Ampiandry(shepherd) within the Lutheran church, he is widely seen as a man of principle and trustworthiness.”Randrianirina has denied his takeover was a coup, telling journalists on Thursday: “A coup is when soldiers enter the presidential palace with weapons. They shoot. There is bloodshed … This is not a coup.”Some gen Z protesters also rejected the label of a coup, emphasising that Randrianirina and his men had intervened bloodlessly to support their cause, with the takeover approved by the constitutional court. Others worried, though, that their revolution would be lost under the new regime.Tiana, a 26-year-old Gen Z Madagascar activist who did not want her full name used, recounted Randrianirina’s meetings with some of her compatriots, amongdozens he has heldwith everyone from businessmen and union leaders to survivors of a mass poisoning, according to AFP.Tiana, who wants young people to be involved as the political system is reformed, said: “We don’t really feel included in the decisions and in everything that’s been going on. He has been listening mainly, but never really consulting us about our ideas.”Additional translation by Iharinirina AndriamitondraExplore more on these topicsMadagascarProtestAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bar staff will get 17% of the service charge, down from 20%.Newly employed waiters will receive just 17%, according to a letter from Gaucho’s troncmaster – a specialist hired to manage the distribution of the service charge. Staff said they feared all waiters’ shares of the service charge would drop to that level in the new year, placing every worker on a similar level.Gaucho’s troncmaster, a company called WMT Troncmaster, wrote in a letter to employees that the service charge would now be shared with “staff located at non-public places of business such as head office and central production units. This may also include staff working at Gaucho restaurants who are provided by an agency but who are not directly employed.”“The Troncmaster strongly believes that service charges are paid by customers in respect of their whole experience, and that all team members who play a part and impact on that experience should participate in, and receive a share of, the tronc funds.”A spokesperson for Gaucho said: “The new tronc distribution has been set by the independent troncmaster following industry benchmarking across our Gaucho employees. The new distribution takes into consideration all our front- and back-of-house colleagues. It is an equitable solution for all of our excellent people. The employee costs borne by the Gaucho business remain as before and the business itself does not benefit in any way from the amended tronc system.”Gaucho says its new system is fully compliant with the law.Gaucho is part of RareRestaurants, which is owned by the Investec bank and investment firm SC Lowy, and which also owned the now closed M chain. Gaucho is held under the group’s Gioma UK arm, which slid £15.6m into the red last year as sales slipped 1% to £68.5m. At the end of last year Gioma had more than 1,000 staff, all but 64 of whom worked in the restaurants, according to the accounts filed at Companies House.Gaucho, which charges £65.60 for a steak marinated in chipotle chilli paste or £26.95 for a Sunday roast and at least £10 for a glass of wine, automatically adds a service charge of between 12.5% and 13% to customers’ bills, although they can opt not to pay it.“The perception of people paying £100 in service charge will be ‘this guy is doing good’,” one waiter said. “But I could be getting [only a small part] of it.”Under a law implemented last October, employers in Britain must share out 100% of service charges collected in a venue to workers there. It must be done in a “fair and transparent manner” and employees have the right to know “how tips are allocated and distributed”.The law was introduced amid concerns the service charge was being used to make up a significant part of workers’ total pay package to reduce national insurance liability. Service charge distributions do not always attract the employment tax when allocated through a tronc scheme, unlike ordinary pay.Bryan Simpson, the national lead on hospitality for the Unite union, which is pressing the government to toughen up the tipping legislation, questioned whether Gaucho’s policy met the current rules.He said: “One of the most egregious elements of this terrible policy is that tips and service charge can be used to pay ‘non-public places of business such as head office and central production units’. This is not fair or transparent according to the [government backed] code of practice, or indeed these workers, our members.“The result for low-paid workers in the most expensive city in the world? That waiters may only receive as little as 28% of the tips that they received on their tables … with more than 70% going elsewhere.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All waiting staff earn the legal minimum wage, so rely on the service charge as a major part of their pay.“I am quite worried. Potentially this means finding another job,” they said.Another waiter, who said they would lose out on between £300 and £600 a month, said: “We haven’t been consulted about these changes. The worst part is they said it’s to make it more fair for all departments, but what they are really doing is using this extra service to top up salaries through all company salary positions.”Another said: “I already find it hard to pay everything when I get £2,000 [working full-time] so I am actively looking for another job. I don’t know how I am going to do it [in October].”The cuts come only months after Rare Restaurants hired Baton Berisha, the former head of the Ivy chain, which is facinglegal action from a former waiterover the allocation of the service charge there.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryRestaurantsFood & drink industryFoodPayWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

It highlighted three reasons to be anxious: overstretched valuations for tech stocks; volatility in government bond markets as they absorb fast-growing debts; and risks in the burgeoning private credit sector.Georgieva saidit was this last worry, in particular, that exercised her. Since bank regulation was tightened in the wake of the catastrophic global financial crisis of 2008, other less heavily scrutinised non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), such as investment firms, have piled into the lending business.The IMF frets that this huge “shadow bank” sector could unleash global chaos if loans start to go bad – particularly since many of the firms involved are funded via borrowing from mainstream banks.“Adverse developments at these institutions – such as downgrades or falling collateral values – could significantly affect banks’ capital ratios,” it said. In total, it found banks in the US and Europe have $4.5trn of exposure to NBFIs.View image in fullscreenJP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon said ‘when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more’.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/ReutersThe recent collapse of the UScar parts supplier First Brandsand the sub-prime auto lender Tricolor, which had relied heavily on complex private credit financing, were regarded by some market veterans – including JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon – as a sign that more problems may be in store. “I probably shouldn’t say this but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more,” hetold an analyst call this week.Within days, market fears had turned to a pair of shaky regional banks –Western Alliance and Zions Bank– and the sell-off continued into Friday.The Trump administration, not a fan of financial regulation, appears relaxed about the issue, and more concerned withhammering Chinafor its perceived unfair industrial and trade policies.Washington is expected to use its chair status among the G20 group of countries next year to press for more international action to curb “imbalances” such as Beijing’s persistent trade surpluses – with the IMF playing a role in policing member countries’ policies.In DC this week, though, it was the risks of more “cockroaches” emerging from the vast and globally connected US financial system that were exercising policymakers: especially veterans of the global financial crisis in 2008.Asked about the issue of private credit at her press conference on Thursday, Georgieva said: “We are asking the question, what should be done to have more oversight and a better view of what is happening there?” She added that the question “keeps me awake every so often at night”.For Rachel Reeves, the whirl of meetings in the US capital was a welcome reminder that the UK is far from alone in facing pressures on tax and spend, skittish bond markets – and tariff chaos. The British chancellor’s energetic Canadian counterpart, François-Philippe Champagne, with whom she has struck up a friendship, also has a tough budget to land next month, as Mark Carney’s administration comes to terms with a new, harsher relationship with its neighbour to the south.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The yield, which moves in the opposite direction to prices, determines the interest rate the Treasury pays to borrow from investors.Analysts said the gilt moves were also part of a “flight to safety” as markets fret about the credit sector, but Treasury strategists were gratified nevertheless.Meanwhile, as if to underscore the IMF’s concerns about a “sudden, sharp correction” in markets, its global financial stability review was launched at a press conference on Tuesday morning to a background ofplunging stock prices. The fall was driven by Donald Trump upping the ante with China, posting a warning on his Truth Social platform that the US could cut off – of all things – cooking oil imports in retaliation for Beijing not buying its soya beans. Wall Street later rallied to close up on the day.Across town that same day the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, was telling an audience of investors at the Institute for International Finance conference that “we have to watch very carefully just how stretched valuations are becoming”. With typical understatement, he added: “There are very different potential paths at the moment.”As the IMF was careful to point out, any reversal in the AI boom would have real-world impacts, as tech companies backed away from the investment that is powering the construction of vast datacentres across the US and beyond – and driving a wave of tech imports from Asia. “The decline in aggregate investment could be rather sharp,” it warned.And a crisis, if it came, would hit a politically fragmented global economy, in which many governments’ finances are already stretched –with debt on course to hit its highest level sincethe aftermath of the second world war.The temperatures in DC were unseasonably chilly this week, but the IMF did its best to warn policymakers, preoccupied with domestic struggles, of the mounting risk the global backdrop could cool sharply in the months to come.Explore more on these topicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsGlobal economyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She also suggested in an interview with Sky News that spending cuts could be considered.Mark Dowding, the chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, said: “Comments from the ruling Labour party that everything remains on the table and that spending cuts are still being considered alongside tax hikes also helped to improve gilt market sentiment, taking 10-year yields towards the lower end of the range they have traded since March this year.”On Thursday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Reeves would be required to take “bold” action to plug a potential £22bn shortfall in the government finances.The chancellor is expected to facea sharp downgrade in the forecasts for the government financesfrom the Office for Budget Responsibility, owing to elevated borrowing costs, weaker productivity forecasts and welfare U-turns.Simon French, the chief economist at Panmure Liberum, said it was unclear whether the reduction in borrowing costs in recent months would influence the OBR forecasts. The independent Treasury watchdog will use a snapshot of bond market yields over a 10-day period in October before the budget on 26 November to underpin its forecasts for borrowing costs.“UK 10-year Gilt below 4.5% this AM for the first time since early July. Considerable question marks over whether this move will (or should) be captured by the OBR,” French wrote in a post on X.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Economic data released this week showedunemployment unexpectedly rose to 4.8%, wage growth dipped andthe economy grew by 0.1% in Augustafter revised figures showed it contracted by the same amount in July.Dowding said the “relatively soft” data could encourage the Bank of England to cut interest rates.Explore more on these topicsGovernment borrowingGiltsBondsRachel ReevesEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe when you sell to the UK, that car cannot be sold somewhere else [because of its right-hand wheel]”.In April the government abolished favourable tax treatment for non-domiciled residents – UK residents who declared that their long-term home was overseas to avoid paying UK taxes on global income and assets – and raised other duties on wealthy people.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told the Guardian earlier this week that talk of an exodus of wealthy residentswas just “scaremongering”.“This is a brilliant country and people want to live here,” she said. “And I think, when people scaremonger again this year, we should take some of that with a pinch of salt.”Reeves, who has said that wealthy people would be one of the targets for higher taxes in next month’s budget, has previously ruled out imposing awealth tax, but campaigners for changes to the system have highlighted other options.These include raising the rate of capital gains tax, levying national insurance on rental income and on partners in law firms and consultancies, and creating higher council tax bands.The non-dom tax changes prompted fears that Ferrari would lose its wealthy client base, leading to volatility in its residual prices, or the expected secondhand value of a vehicle when a leasing deal comes to an end.Most new cars in developed markets are bought on deals that provide financing based on the amount of value a vehicle loses – its depreciation – rather than the overall sticker price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has co-written the screenplay with another A-lister: Canadian actor and director Sarah Polley.And yet the resulting picture, adapted from the2013 novel by David Gilbert, feels nebulous and laborious. It is dependent on a giant twist-reveal, which is bafflingly implausible and strangely uncompelling even if taken at face value, and which tends to undermine the emotional reality of the whole film and its big confrontation scenes – though there is one riveting showdown between Staunton and Nighy, two black-belts each at the top of their game.Nighy is Andrew Dyer, a cantankerous old literary lion revered throughout the world for the brilliant novels of his youth, who has published nothing for years and is now marooned like a bearded, drunken hermit in his huge Oxfordshire mansion, boozing, playing jazz LPs too loud and shouting at the walls. He lives with his longsuffering Czech housekeeper Gerde (Anna Geislerová) and high-schooler Andy (Noah Jupe), the product of an affair that destroyed his marriage to Isabel (Imelda Staunton).Andy is (possibly) like Smerdyakov in Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov: the non-canonical brother to his other, older siblings, would-be documentary film-maker Jamie (George MacKay) and recovering alcoholic screenwriter Richard (Johnny Flynn). The entire family is imperiously summoned to the mansion by Dyer.Andy and Richard are furious with the old man for how he treated their mother but self-hatingly aware they are still using him for their various careers. The film shows that their intense dislike of Dyer is not helped by the extraordinary claim he now makes about Andy – is it just a delusional, self-serving excuse for his infidelity and the only imaginative effort of which the raddled old man is now capable? Or could it be true?Either way, there isn’t much drama to be had from it. The whole situation circles around Dyer’s revelation without satisfactorily fleshing out its claims to the truth, or its implications as fiction. Jupe, MacKay and Flynn transmit their roles strongly enough, though the male cast are perhaps upstaged by Staunton as Dyer’s estranged wife; it is actually Flynn’s character Richard, furiously obsessed with what Dyer owes him, who delivers the film’s second disclosure, which would be quite enough on its own for most stories.There are memories here of other films about ageing, conceited toxic-male authors: Bjørn Runge’sThe Wife(2017) and Alice Troughton’sThe Lesson(2023). Although as a movie about a dysfunctional family, it isn’t anywhere near the quality of Trapero’s own tremendous crime-family movieThe Clanfrom 2015.& Sons doesn’t deliver on the promise of all its film-making talent but Nighy is always amusing, especially when he crisply orders his nephew Emmett (Arthur Conti) to fix him a whisky. In his untutored way, the kid fills the glass almost to the brim and Dyer grinningly congratulates him on an excellent “Scotch-to-air ratio”.& Sons screened at theLondon film festival.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025London film festivalImelda StauntonBill NighyFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In an intoxicated state, Frehley “sped off”, as the charge sheet later phrased it, reaching 90mph and colliding with four other cars. He was caught, arrested and charged with drunk and reckless driving.“My licence was revoked, I had to pay a large fine, and I received a bunch of negative publicity,” he recalled, adding: “The other consequence was a court-ordered two-week stint in a hospital detox unit, and some mandatory AA meetings.”Frehley, who has died aged 74, led a life punctuated by similar incidents, whether self-inflicted or inadvertent, such as a life-threatening electrocution that he narrowly survived on stage in 1976 withKiss, the American rock band with whom he is most closely associated.Without Ace Frehley, Kiss could not have achieved their extraordinary greatness | Michael HannRead moreIn December that year the group – then Frehley plus the drummer Peter Criss and bassist Gene Simmons, who shared lead vocals with the guitarist Paul Stanley – took to the stage at Lakeland Civic Center in Florida. Walking down a flight of steps, Frehley – somewhat unsteady on his feet – clutched a metal railing for balance. As was frequently the case in the pre-health-and-safety era, the railing was unearthed: a connection was made with his electric guitar and he suffered a serious shock, falling several feet to the ground. Recovering, he wrote the songShock Mefor Kiss’s 1977 album Love Gun.Serious though they may have been, such incidents simply added to the lore surrounding Kiss, whose importance to a generation of 1970s and 80s rock fans is difficult to overstate. Portrayed in popular culture and in their own merchandise as a collection of cartoon superheroes, the group enjoyed enormous success in their early career, eventually going on to sell more than 100m albums.While Simmons and Stanley ran the group and were its most recognisable faces, in or out of their trademark makeup, Frehley was their wild card, an untrained but compelling guitarist whose “Spaceman” persona matched his otherworldly performances.Born Paul Frehley in New York City, he was the youngest son of Carl, an electrical engineer, and his wife, Esther (nee Hecht). His father was a church organist and his mother a pianist, so Paul and his siblings, Charles and Nancy, were encouraged to take up instruments.View image in fullscreenFrehley, centre, with, left, Gene Simmons, and Paul Stanley of Kiss at their final concert together, at Carrara Stadium in Queensland, Australia, in 2001.Photograph: AAPBy his early teens he was playing guitar, inspired by British R&B bands of the day such as the Rolling Stones and the Who. He was more interested in music and sport than education, and was expelled from several high schools, gaining the nickname Ace for his success at securing dates with girls. He also joined a local street gang at one point, later recalling: “I was stabbed in the stomach on my 13th birthday. Luckily it wasn’t a deep wound.”Frehley played in several bands before finding success, among them the Outrage, the Four Roses and Molimo, the last of which signed to the RCA label but failed to progress. He worked in a sequence of jobs – postman, furniture deliverer and taxi driver among them – before auditioning for Simmons, Stanley and Criss in late 1972. Simmons later told the musician Billy Corgan: “We’re going, ‘Boy, he’s a weird guy. He’s got one orange sneaker, one red sneaker. Just pigeon-toed and all,” and added that Frehley quickly irritated him: “Ace [comes in and] plugs in and starts playing while we’re talking to another guy, and I walked up to him and said, ‘Buddy, you better sit down before I knock you out. What are you doing? We’re talking.’”However, the band were impressed by Frehley’s guitar skills and asked him to join, using his double lightning-bolt design for their new band name, Kiss. When they adopted stage identities, Frehley conceived the Spaceman persona. A self-titled debut album was released by the Casablanca label in early 1974 and Kiss began to attract interest for their theatrical live shows, which featured Frehley’s extravagant guitar solos, later delivered via a guitar adapted to emit clouds of smoke.Always in the shadow of the more media-savvy Simmons and Stanley, Frehley often revealed some insecurity about his abilities: “I don’t know how to read music, but I’m one of the most famous guitar players in the world,” he said in 2009. At first he rarely contributed songs to Kiss albums, although he did write the classicCold Ginin 1974, and when his eponymous 1978 solo album was released alongside solo records by the other three members, his was the most successful of the four. Towards the end of his first stint in Kiss he was more prolific, writing two songs for Dynasty (1979) and three for Unmasked (1980).View image in fullscreenAce Frehley at the ceremony to induct Kiss into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Brooklyn, New York, 2014 – standing behind Frehley are Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons.Photograph: Lucas Jackson/ReutersHowever, Frehley was beginning to suffer from the pressure of being in a successful touring band, and developed an addiction to alcohol. “That was my downfall … most of the time I really had no idea where I was,” he said in 2017. “We went from city to city so fast. You know, pretty much you spend most of the time in a hotel or the venue. They all pretty much look the same, so it became a blur. That’s why a lot of rock stars go crazy.” Simmons and Stanley later recalled an incident in which the guitarist, yearning for a drink while ensconced in a limousine, downed an entire bottle of perfume in the absence of other options.After Criss was replaced by a new drummer, Eric Carr, in 1980, Frehley often found himself outvoted by Simmons and Stanley, and decided to leave two years later. His solo albums, Ace Frehley (1978) and Frehley’s Comet (1987), were hits, but by the late 80s Kiss – and by association, Frehley – were experiencing a career decline. From then on his solo releases were only moderately successful. A 1996 reunion of the original lineup proved popular, however, and lasted until 2001.Frehley finally quit alcohol in 2006 and wrote a bestselling autobiography, No Regrets, five years later. By this point he was held in high esteem by younger musicians influenced by Kiss’s early albums, with one notable appearance taking place in 2006 alongside members of Guns N’ Roses and Mötley Crüe at the VH1 Rock Honors in Las Vegas.Frehley’s relationship with his former bandmates remained largely adversarial, and he declined an invitation to perform on their final tour in 2019.He is survived by his wife, Jeanette Trerotola, their daughter, Monique, and his siblings.Ace (Paul Daniel) Frehley, guitarist and songwriter, born 27 April 1951; died 16 October 2025Explore more on these topicsKissPop and rockobituariesShareReuse this content"

More invisible,” says Leonard, blinking up at the night sky. “One thing’s led to another and now I feel like if I don’t do something I’ll just carry on in this …” – he searches for a fitting encapsulation of his life – “… minor, harmless existence.” Hungry Paul – Leonard’s best and, indeed, only friend – considers the implications of this announcement. “Nothing wrong with that, though,” he replies, bathrobe flapping thoughtfully in the breeze. “Better than trying to make a mark on the world only to wind up defacing it.”For those exhausted by the bluster and rat-tat-tat of today’s TV terrain, here is Leonard and Hungry Paul with a foil blanket and warming mug of Ribena.Like its harmless protagonists, Leonard and Hungry Paul – a six-part comedy written by Richie Conroy and Mark Hodkinson based on Rónán Hession’s understated 2019 novel – takes a dim view of modern life; peering disapprovingly over its prematurely middle-aged glasses at anything in the way of unnecessary noise, sudden movements or – heaven forfend – an abundance of ambition. The series is, instead, an ode to introversion; a quiet celebration of those content to pootle around below the parapet. And yet. Leonard (another sublimely idiosyncratic turn from Alex “The End of the F***ing World/Andor” Lawther) is unsettled. He feels a creeping “need to open the doors and windows of my life … a little”. The recent death of his beloved mother has whisked the rug from under his slippers and the 32-year-old ghost writer now finds himself questioning the choices that have brought him to where he is (single; defensively moustached; working on a range of children’s encyclopedias for a man who signs off emails with the phrase “ciao for now”).And so Leonard launches himself on a quest for emotional fulfilment, with the slightly bolder, if no less socially uncomfortable, Hungry Paul (Laurie Kynaston) serving as his confidant, life coach and co-conspirator in a weekly board games evening that serves both as symposium (“Is the pool warm because kids pee in it, or do kids pee in it because it’s warm?”) and refuge.(Why “Hungry” Paul? No idea. The origin of the nickname appears lost to the mists of time. Perhaps the postal worker once ate a sandwich unusually quickly, or responded to a socially fraught incident by panic-peeling four scotch eggs with his teeth).Into Leonard’s gentle world cartwheels Shelley (Jamie-Lee “Derry Girls” O’Donnell) a new, spring-loaded colleague who cheerily offers to kill Leonard’s appalling boss (Paul Reid) during the office fire drill. That whooshing sound you can hear is Leonard’s gentle world being turned upside down.Elsewhere in the first episode of a series driven less by plot and more by what the under-30s may refer to as “vibes”, we meet Hungry Paul’s dad (the ever-wonderful Lorcan Cranitch), a battered sofa of a man who secretly watches, records then replays daytime quiz shows to impress his adoring wife with his general knowledge.Shepherding us through all this minor-key niceness is a narrator who sounds very much like – and, indeed, very much is –Julia Roberts. Yes, Julia Roberts. If you are thinking, “Surely the inclusion of a major Hollywood star is at odds with the series’ unshowy MO and initially serves only as a distraction?” you would be correct. Still, Roberts acquits herself well, and lines such as “Leonard’s problem is that he lacks a ‘eureka’ face” help ensure that early misgivings give way if not quite to appreciation, then at least to acceptance.But that’s enough grumbling for now. Leonard and Hungry Paul’s heart is in the right place: the right place being “sitting on a park bench next to the Detectorists, pointing out its favourite duck”. It’s a series that ambles along in its sleeveless jumper, occasionally looking up at the stars, occasionally down at its slippers, quietly confident that there is nothing in the world as cheering as spending time in the company of good friends.Open the doors and windows of your life a little, and let it in.Leonard and Hungry Paul is on BBC iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJulia RobertsreviewsShareReuse this content"

From that hook, Kathryn Bigelow has fashioned an almost unbearably tense thriller out of the American response.

The pair were obviously made for each other but could their union survive the cultural realities underpinning their lives? It’s time to find out. Will Noah’s family accept the relationship continuing on an inter-faith basis? How will Joanne handle Shabbat? (“Ooh! I love how shiny this bread is!”). Can Joanne feasibly continue with her famously plain-speaking podcast? Nobody Wants This insistently carries an important message about tolerance – but the breezy dialogue and crackling chemistry help it slip down easily.Netflix, from Thursday24 OctoberHarlan Coben’s LazarusView image in fullscreenBeset with demons … Sam Claflin as Joel Lazarus and Bill Nighy as Dr Jonathan Lazarus.Photograph: Amazon /PAProlific novelistHarlan Cobenhas a sideline in cheerfully absurd TV potboilers. This series – co-written with Danny “Brassic” Brocklehurst – contains a familiar Coben trope; a visitation from the dead as a metaphor for buried trauma. It stars a moodySam Claflinas Joel Lazarus (see what they did there?), a forensic psychiatrist whose father Jonathan (Bill Nighy) takes his own life. Soon, Joel is beset with phantoms: memories of his past and victims of unsolved murders become intertwined in his fevered brain. It has the good sense to entirely commit to its own concept but it’s utterly ridiculous all the same.Prime Video, from Wednesday22 OctoberHappy Town: Pumpkin PartyView image in fullscreenCute, mildly spooky stuff … Happy Town: Pumpkin Party.Photograph: SkyFormer Spice GirlMel Bhas found a new niche, narrating this kids’ TV show, with a primary coloured, precisely gridded look that gives it the air of a retro platform-style computer game. The series is cute enough in its own way, following the adventures of Pep the hedgehog and his ladybird pal Tabitha as they keep the Happy Town sign glowing. However, this Halloween special should see the erstwhile Scary Spice coming into her own – as befits the season, expect games, pumpkins and some age-appropriate, extremely mild spookiness.Sky Kids, from Monday 20 OctoberMob War: Philadelphia vs the MafiaView image in fullscreenA grim and gritty story … Barry Gross in Mob War: Philadelphia vs the Mafia.Photograph: NetflixIn 1993, there was a power vacuum at the very top of the Philadelphia mafia. This documentary series examines the brutal battle for control that took place between old-school mobster John Stanfa and cocky young upstart Joey Merlino. It hears from the mafia soldiers implicated in perpetrating this carnage but also from the FBI agents – including some who worked undercover, at massive personal risk – who were tasked with ending the war. There’s little of the tawdry glamour sometimes associated with mob life on display here; it’s a grim and gritty story.Netflix, from Wednesday22 Octoberskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The murderer preyed on couples and he’s thought to be responsible for 16 deaths. The sluggish police operation is vaguely reminiscent of the British police force’s struggles to capture Peter Sutcliffe – and despite two men being convicted, there remains some doubt that the true killer was ever caught.Netflix, from Wednesday22 OctoberEntrepreneursView image in fullscreenHipsterish … Entrepreneurs.Photograph: Disney+Talentless, overprivileged, self-important millennials are the butt of the joke in this Spanish comedy. Gonzalo, the loser son of a millionaire, joins forces with self-styled “entrepreneurship guru” Jacobo to establish a co-working space called No Comfort Zone. It contains tiny basketball hoops, Segways and all the other signifiers of hipsterish dilettantism – but might there be a dark side? Gonzalo’s sister Julia thinks so, but can she stop her brother from making a fool of himself? The stakes never seem quite high enough to make any of this matter.Disney+, from Thursday23 OctoberBordertownView image in fullscreenThe villainy is entertainingly melodramatic … Ville Virtanen in Bordertown.Photograph: Channel 4This Finnish series occupies a space between a crime thriller and a bleak psychological drama about a disintegrating family. At its heart is Det Kari Sorjonen who, it might not be a surprise to learn, is both gifted and troubled. After a domestic tragedy during season two, there’s an increased focus on Kari’s desire to do right by his kids. However, the town they call home continues to be plagued by crimes ranging from poisonings to the reign of a dangerous cult leader. The self-consciously dark tone can drag but the villainy is entertainingly melodramatic.Channel 4, from Friday24 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pair have a longstanding creative relationship – Parker co-produced and co-wrote most of Dua Lipa’s last album, Radical Optimism – but nevertheless made for quite the study in contrasts. She was resplendent in a glittering lace catsuit, stiletto-heeled boots, a fake fur stole draped over her shoulder. Lank-haired, clad in a baggy multicoloured cardigan and a string of wooden beads, Parker looked not unlike a man who had arrived onstage direct from a very long night up at Glastonbury’s stone circle.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Deadbeat.Photograph: Publicity imageYou could see it as a visual metaphor for Parker’s unlikely journey to pop’s upper echelons which began, improbably enough, while he was listening to the Bee Gees while tripping on magic mushrooms. The experience prompted him to pivot away from the guitar-led psychedelia of Tame Impala’s first two albums and embrace his love of “sugary pop music” on 2015’s Currents. As evidenced by the success of its single The Less I Know the Better – 2bn streams on Spotify and counting – the record vastly outsold Tame Impala’s previous work. Moreover, a succession of mainstream pop stars decided they wanted some of what it had to offer. Parker subsequently worked with Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Kanye West, Travis Scott and the Weeknd among others. Last year, he cropped up on the Australian Financial Review’s list of his homeland’s richest under-40s.As his appearance with Lipa attested, Parker seems to have achieved all this with enviable ease and insouciance, but the contents of Deadbeat make you wonder. There’s always been a melancholy undertow to his Tame Impala work: one theory about the success of Currents was that the sound of Parker’s yearning voice, adrift on a bed of electronics, chimed with a very contemporary malaise, the fear that technology is making us more isolated. But here, he sounds more disconsolate than ever.You could read the first Tame Impala album in five years as a treatise on trying to balance success with some kind of normality, the disjunction between the demands of fame and domesticity. On Dracula, he’s riddled with self-loathing for enjoying himself like “fucking Pablo Escobar” when he should be at home. On Piece of Heaven, he seems to be in his children’s bedroom, haunted by his absence from their lives: “I don’t know if I’ll be here / I guess that depends.” “Waking in time to catch the last hours of sunlight / People walking home go by,” he sings on Not My World. But if that sounds like the bohemian dream of unshackling oneself from the nine-to-five-grind writ large, he doesn’t seem to be enjoying it much: “Must be nice,” he muses, sadly. “Makes me realise it’s not my world.”Tame Impala: Loser – videoParker has said that the primary influence on Deadbeat is western Australia’s “bush doof” rave scene, which explains the preponderance of banging four-four beats: Ethereal Connection boasts a particularly fierce example. He clearly has an affinity with dance music, handy with a writhing electronic bass line and a subtle tapestry of shifting electronic sounds. But occasionally, you wish he’d left certain songs as instrumentals: the impact of Afterthought feels reduced by the pop melody he’s placed on top of it. Indeed, if Deadbeat has a flaw, it’s the occasional sense that Parker’s pop leanings feel a little forced this time around. The simple see-sawing melody of No Reply wears thin before the track ends. Closing track End of Summer hits an enviable sweet spot between dancefloor euphoria and rainwashed sadness, but it’s jolted by Parker deploying a noisome sped-up vocal hook: an earworm, but the kind of earworm you wish you could shake.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Both My Old Ways and No Reply jump between the gleaming end product and what appear to be their haltingly played piano demo versions. On Loser and Obsolete, Parker’s vocals are interrupted by off-mic sighs and exclamations, the kind of stuff that you might have expected to be edited out of the finished track: “Fuck!” he snaps in apparent exasperation as the former ends. Oblivion, meanwhile, sounds like a disparate collection of misty electronic sounds – ideas, even – over a dembow beat, which suddenly snap into focus when it reaches the chorus.The effect is like someone drawing back the curtain to reveal the music’s inner workings: you think it’s like that, but it’s actually likethis. That could be the motto of an album that keeps suggesting everything isn’t as it might seem. If it’s occasionally confused, it’s also painfully honest and genuinely wracked: you leave it hoping the man who made it is OK.This week Alexis listened toSkullcrusher – LivingNew York singer-songwriter Helen Ballentine’s stage name might be the least appropriate in pop history: Living is gently wistful, driven by acoustic guitar and piano, and utterly lovely.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekTame ImpalaAustralian musicPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Should anyone decide to challenge the songwriter’s self belief – or as she names it in the hit single Selfish, “heritage ego” – this week’s back-to-back arena gigs prove her hard-earned place at the forefront of Black British music is warranted.Before she walks on to the stage, 90s baby pictures of an even littler Simz flash on the drop down screens, before we flick through the years to an awkward yet adorable teenager with her first guitar. It all leads to the present, where tonight she is an honorary Manc in a khaki overcoat, swinging her arms behind her lower back with plentiful Gallagher swagger: “Missed you!” She radiates joy and gratitude, but the live show does not shy away from her life’s trials, and she confronts the fallout of a messypublic financial disputewith menacing metaphors and a slick vengeance that slips readily from her tongue.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianEnough is a firm highlight, with a skanking, ESG-inflected Factory Records groove animated by bass maestro Marla Kether, whose fluid post-punk basslines and signature Bantu knots rightfully pull focus away from Simz for a good few minutes. Acid-green strobe lights spew across the arena for Venom, a viral fan-favourite, until grumbling feedback cues the emergence of a DJ booth from underneath the floor.Simz switches gears and takes to the decks to perform songs from her EP Drop 7, headphones hanging from one ear and friends huddling around to hype her up, instantly transforming the space into a late-night club. Mood Swings is drenched with Drexciya and Detroit techno vibes, as onlookers grind and contort with strangers-turned-dancers against sultry 808s and subaquatic synths. It’s thrilling: few artists can take a full arena from a friendly singalong to a sweat-fuelled Boiler Room set in the space of just a couple of songs.The encore features this year’s Glastonbury standout Gorilla, scratching and rewinding in classic Yardie sound system style, until Simz truly feels the crowd are ready to feel the rhythm. When the horn sample swells, even those seated have no choice but to leap to their feet. “Name one time where I didn’t deliver?” Simz shouts and giggles in her final closing lyric. It’s an affirmation that no-one here could contest.Little Simzplays 02 Arena, London, 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsLittle SimzRapHip-hoplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Fender sings on the chorus “Just wanna talk to you / Wanna talk with my best friend / Wanna let go of everything that I carry”, and has said the song is about: “the end of a long relationship – about the regret, the mistakes and the lessons that come with it. It’s that feeling of losing your best friend, and coming to terms with that. I was playing around with the riff and thought, ‘What I need is a really good pianist’, and then, ‘Hmmm, I wonder who I can call?’ And of course, who better thanElton John?”John added: “Sam was writing and recording in a studio in west London, and called to say he’d written a song with a piano riff that he thought would sound great with me playing it. I couldn’t resist, and it was so much fun playing it for him. I truly love Sam. He’s been a friend for many, many years and it’s incredible to see him grow into being a truly world class artist.”Fender is riding high as one of the UK’s most successful singer-songwriters. His third albumPeople Watchingtopped the UK album chart, just as his previous two had, and two of its songs – the title track and Rein Me In, a duet with Olivia Dean – have reached the Top 10. He played stadium dates in London and Newcastle over the summer.Sam Fender didn’t need his Mercury prize win – but he earned it with his incisive social realismRead moreHe won theMercury prizeat a ceremony in Newcastle on Thursday, beating competition from the likes of Pulp, CMAT and Fontaines DC. The judges praised People Watching’s “cohesion, character and ambition”, calling it: “melody-rich and expansive, marrying heartland rock with the realities of everyday life and the importance of community. These are thoughtful songs with broad appeal, as cinematic as they are intimate.”Fender dedicated the award to the late actor Annie Orwin, a close friend who is the subject of the album’s title track.

Now, at 81, he is collaborating with pop stars. He and his wife talk about his extraordinary life – and facing severe illnessFri 17 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 16.54 EDTShareWhen Beverly Glenn-Copeland was diagnosed with a form of dementia called Late two years ago, he was advised to stay at home and do crossword puzzles. He tried, but he doesn’t like crosswords, and it didn’t feel right. One day, recalls his wife Elizabeth, he said: “Honey, I know this is meant to be giving me more time, but I just feel like we’re not living a life. I have places I want to see and people I want to meet before I die. Since we have to make money, let’s make money doing what we love to do.”And so the couple, who live in Hamilton, Ontario, are in London, midway through a tour that is the latest chapter in Glenn’s extraordinary late-in-life journey from unknown musician to revered cult icon. It has only been 10 years since his indefinably radiant music was rediscovered (not that it was ever really discovered in the first place), and he wants to enjoy it.If you didn’t know that there are things Glenn can no longer do – drive a car, fill in paperwork, transcribe his music – you would take him for an unusually sprightly 81-year-old. Swaddled in a fleece and a giant scarf in the garden of the couple’s rented house, his hair a snowy cloud, he has a sly, twinkling mirth and an explosive, eye-rolling laugh. “Some things go downhill,” Elizabeth tells me before we sit down, “but in some ways he’s more himself than ever.”Partners and collaborators for almost 20 years, the couple appear intertwined, leaning on each other’s shoulders, clasping hands and tag-teaming anecdotes. At one point Elizabeth reminds Glenn of a favourite song and he fondly taps her head: “This is my memory.”Music has always come easily to Glenn. “It just gets sent to me and then often I forget I wrote it,” he says. “And that doesn’t have to do with the dementia. That’s just how my mind works. It’s an in-the-moment thing. I can’t sight-read for heck but if I receive it, I’m able to put everything down.”“Glenn is a savant,” says Elizabeth. Glenn shields his mouth with his hand to deliver a comic aside: “Usually they call themidiotsavants.”For most of his life, Glenn made music without hope of recognition. Two singer-songwriter albums in the early 1970s – imagine a more fraught Terry Callier – went nowhere. His 1986 albumKeyboard Fantasies, a meditative miracle that gets labelled ambient or new age but is reallysui generis, sold a few dozen copies on cassette. Most of his music remained private. He has countless unheard songs recorded on various outmoded formats over the years.“It didn’t bother me at all,” he says cheerfully. “I wasn’t doing it for an audience. I was doing it because it was sent to me. The kind of music I was receiving wasn’t the kind of thing that would excite most audiences. People were like, Whatisthis?” He was much better known (and paid) through his role on the Canadian children’s television show Mr Dressup.View image in fullscreen‘Music gets sent to me’ … Beverly Glen-Copeland in Keyboard Fantasies, a documentary made in 2019.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyElizabeth remembers seeing Glenn perform in a restaurant in Toronto in 1976, when she was 19 and he was still identifying as a woman. “Very few people in 1976 appeared gender neutral,” she says. “He was sitting up there in a tracksuit, playing beautiful music but not remotely interested in the audience. It was like, if you’re listening, you’re listening, and if you’re not, you’re not.”Elizabeth, who has been a poet, educator, improv comedian and musician, met Glenn properly in 1992 and they became friends and occasional collaborators. In 2007, they reconnected and fell in love, since working together in education, activism and community theatre. “Glenn said, ‘I know what’s going to happen, honey. I’m going to die and then they’re going to discover my music and you’re going to be set.’ And I said, ‘Screw that, I want you to feel the fruits of your labour.’”It happened out of the blue. In 2015, when Glenn was 71, a Japanese collector tracked him down and asked if he still had any copies of Keyboard Fantasies. That set off a life-changing chain of dominoes: reissues, new recordings, team-ups with Sam Smith and the xx’s Romy, his first international live shows andan album of covers and remixesby the likes of Bon Iver and Arca.Now the couple have made a new album with their musical director Alex Samaras and producer Howard Bilerman.Laughter in Summerwas meant to be an informal session with a choir at Montreal’s Hotel2Tango studio but they emerged with nine songs, some old, some new, each one recorded in a single take.Glenn’s version of the 19th-century folk song Shenandoah reminds him of his childhood in Philadelphia. His mother, Georgie, (“an exceptionally brilliant woman”) worked on early childhood education for the United Nations and taught him old spirituals. His father, John, was a high school principal and a classical pianist who played obsessively at home. Glenn secured a scholarship to study music at McGill University in Montreal. “When I think about it, I didn’t have much choice. [Music] was coming for me.”Glenn didn’t even learn what trans identity was until the 1990s, but “I told my mom I was a boy when I was two or three. Sometimes you know that. It’s not about genitalia, it’s about what you feel you are. In the 50s I was forced to do all kinds of things I didn’t want to do. As soon as I could, I went, ‘That’s enough of that. I’m not going to pretend.’”These days, gender-questioning young people often ask him for advice. “Mostly what I say is if you feel you can be who you really are, be who you really are. But we all take risks to be who we are in societies that aren’t accepting of certain things.”He lobbied the Canadian government for years to allow trans people to change their gender on passports without intrusive tests. “He said, ‘It’s none of your business what I do with my body, it’s a question of my identity,’” says Elizabeth. It’s rough for them to see those rights reversed across the world. “We have a responsibility to continue to behave in hopeful ways,” she says. “Hope is a verb. It’s an action. It’s got muscle.”View image in fullscreen‘He’s more himself than ever’ … Glenn-Copeland and Elizabeth.Photograph: Wade Muir“There are days when I could just weep,” Glenn says. “There are days when I get really angry. And then there are days when I think, well, that tends to be what happens. Things go forward and then they often get clawed back. It seems to be what us humans do. Unfortunately.”Spiritual practice has helped keep him afloat. He was a Quaker who became a Buddhist in the 1970s and found that the two religions had much in common. “You chant to be able to overcome the things that are most difficult for you, but you also chant for other people’s happiness,” he says. “That’s the point, right?”That same spirit of generosity and optimism infuses his music and performance. Having lived outside the music industry for so long, the couple see live shows in terms of fostering community. “It’s not the I’m-so-fabulous show,” says Elizabeth. “It’s: how can what we do in this room with these humans be of service?”The musicians in the band also take on caring duties. The couple are candid about living “kind of on the edge” financially. When the pandemic forced the cancellation of their 2020 tour, they lost their house and would have been made homeless if their daughter hadn’t launched a crowdfunder. Life remains precarious.‘I don’t worry about traditionalists’: Rishab Sharma, the sitar maestro earning millions of followers for his mindful musicRead more“People say, ‘Don’t you sing just because you love it?’” says Elizabeth. “I sing because I love it but damn, the grocery store won’t let me sing for my groceries. Our landlord won’t accept a theme song. We enjoy the work but we also have to do it.” As Glenn puts it, “Elizabeth has been the person taking care of me but Elizabeth needs someone to take care of her.”They hope this will not be Glenn’s last tour. His condition necessitates certain adjustments on and off stage, but, for the most part, he says, “not much has changed”. The couple also have a memoir, a musical and community workshops in the pipeline.“We don’t want to be old people in that way that our culture tells us old people should be,” says Elizabeth, gazing around the autumnal garden. “Yes, we’re coming into the decay phase of life but when you watch the leaves turn from green to orange, often the decay phase can be the most beautiful.”Glenn smiles up at her. “Mmm, that’s an interesting way to put it, honey. That’s true.” There will come a time for the rocking chair, he says, imitating its squeaking with a grin. “But this ain’t it.”Beverly Glenn-Copeland plays Aviva Studios, Manchester on 19 October.

The singer is living in a mouldering trailer on Martha’s Vineyard. He has a $200-a-day drug habit and is subsisting off a diet of cigarettes and cheeseburgers that he can’t chew because the heroin, cocaine and amphetamine he’s injecting have caused his teeth to fall out.It’s all a very long way from Dando’s brief burst of fame as frontman and solitary longstanding member of the Lemonheads: two big albums in 1992’s It’s a Shame About Ray, and 1993’s Come on Feel the Lemonheads, a huge hit cover of Simon and Garfunkel’s Mrs Robinson, an era with Dando’s face taking its place alongside the Betty Blue and magic eye posters on halls of residence walls, the Docs-shod female student’s pin-up of choice. But it’s also not totally unexpected, at least if you have even a glancing knowledge of the singer’s subsequent travails. Mainstream success was short-lived: Dando succeeds in sabotaging his own career in a blaze of hard drugs and wildly unpredictable behaviour. For the last 35 years, drugs and unpredictability – rather than music – is what Dando has become known for. The book’s blurb mentions “heroin chic”, but in truth, Dando’s dissipation is almost impossible to put any kind of romantic gloss on. To his credit, he doesn’t bother, instead recounting one public humiliation after another with a what-can-you-do? shrug.A cocktail of heroin and cocaine puts paid to a show designed to impress investors who’ve just bought a share of Dando’s song publishing for $300,000, but it’s just one of many gigs that collapse into chaos: he falls offstage, or the police are called and he’s led away from the venue in handcuffs. The Lemonheads miss their slot at Glastonbury because Dando is holed up in a hotel, doing heroin: when he does eventually turn up, he performs an unscheduled solo set, but the crowd throw bottles and boo him offstage. He hangs around Oasis in their pomp, even writing a song with Noel Gallagher: it has to be removed from a Lemonheads album at the last minute, because Gallagher deems it an “embarrassment”.Dando sounds insufferable, but weirdly, he doesn’t come across that way – he’s a good writer, possessed of a laconic witYou start wondering what his problem is, but there aren’t any straightforward answers: there’s no great childhood trauma beyond his parents’ divorce, which he seems to navigate well, and a predisposition to sleepwalking, which he eventually overcomes. Indeed, you get the sense that Dando’s real issue may be that he’s never had to try very hard. His parents are wealthy and he’s educated privately at a school so liberal that the only rule involves not rollerskating in the corridors; they nevertheless try to expel him after the first year because of his disinclination to do any work, but his mum steps in and talks them round.Long-haired and preposterously handsome, he works as a child model – his dad invests the money in shares, leaving him a tidy nest-egg – and from his teens onwards seems basically irresistible to women. When he forms the Lemonheads, consternation is caused by their privileged backgrounds but it doesn’t seem to impede their progress. They become increasingly successful as they shift from playing hardcore punk to melodic indie rock, garnering themselves a major-label deal, and eventually, international success. Understandably so: Dando has a genuine gift for songwriting. It’s a Shame About Ray lasted under half an hour, but every one of its 29 minutes contained a killer melody or a nagging hook.He is uncomfortable with celebrity, particularly the magazines that drool over his looks, and unhappy about being catapulted to fame by a hastily thrown together Simon and Garfunkel cover. But he’s hardly self-medicating to cope with the pressure: he just seems to have really liked taking drugs from the moment he started doing LSD, aged 14, and saw no reason to stop when he became famous. He attempts to blame the press for sensationalising his narcotic habits, but, frankly, if you turn up to an interview to promote your new album with a pad and pen to write your answers down because a crack-smoking binge has left you unable to speak, what do you expect? He claims his record company lost faith in him when Come On Feel the Lemonheads didn’t outsell its predecessor, but again, it’s hard not to wonder if the whole smoking-so-much-crack-you-lose-your-voice thing might not have caused a certain dip in corporate expectations.He sounds insufferable, but weirdly, he doesn’t come across that way in the pages of Rumours of My Demise. You wouldn’t want to be in a band with him, nor sign him to your label, but he’s a good writer, possessed of a laconic wit and, occasionally, bluntly insightful: “If I could go back in time and give a bit of advice to myself, I’d say ‘Evan, don’t be such a dick’.” The book ends with Dando kicking heroin – although a recent European tour was the usual chaos – and the reader finding Dando hopeless, but strangely charming with it: he’s somehow got away with it, as he seems to have done for the last 40 years.Rumours of My Demise is published by Faber (£20).

This Q is currently in his 50s; his backstory includes a fling with Miss Moneypenny, and emotional baggage in the form of his retired history don father. What’s drawn him home is the mysterious drowning of his old friend, quantum scientist Peter Napier, who has left him an encrypted note; although the coroner has ruled the death to be accidental and Q’s old flame, DCI Kathy Burnham, is not minded to reopen the case. The stakes here are worthy of the Fleming canon – Napier’s revolutionary work may have terrible consequences – and even if you’re not a Bond fan, you can’t fail to enjoy this solidly plotted and unexpectedly funny blend of nostalgia and new technology.View image in fullscreenThe Killing Stonesby Ann Cleeves (Macmillan, £22)Bestseller Cleeves’s latest novel is billed as the return of Jimmy Perez, as Perez and his life partner DI Willow Reeves, now living on the Orkney Islands with their young son, team up to solve a murder. It’s nearly Christmas when Jimmy’s old friend Archie Stout is found dead at the site of an archeological dig, felled by a Neolithic stone purloined from the local heritage centre. Suspects soon proliferate: the artist with whom roving-eyed Archie may have been having an affair; teacher and local history enthusiast George Riley; mediagenic archeology professor Tony Johnson, and even the deceased’s wife. With an evocation of place that is second to none, Cleeves keeps the narrative plates spinning beautifully to create a complex plot that takes in both the thorny issue of who controls heritage and the pernicious effects of online misogyny.View image in fullscreenThe Long Shoeby Bob Mortimer (Gallery, £22)Unemployed bathroom salesman Matt, protagonist of Bob Mortimer’s third novel, is someone who aims low in life and usually misses. He will be familiar, albeit with a different name and CV, to anyone who has read the first two books, right down to his ventriloquised cat, this symbol-of-loneliness role having previously been taken by, respectively, a squirrel and a pigeon. Not only has Matt lost his job, but his girlfriend Harriet has left and he’s about to be made homeless. Offered a rent-free luxury flat, he jumps at the chance, but of course there’s a catch; and meanwhile, Harriet is having problems of her own. Whether or not you enjoy this will depend more on your fondness for Mortimer’s surreal humour than your liking for crime fiction. Matt’s inability to take appropriate action at any given moment will have punctilious readers foaming at the mouth, but at the heart of the preposterous plot is a touching story about human relationships.View image in fullscreenBenbeculaby Graeme Macrae Burnet (Polygon, £12)Graeme Macrae Burnet’s latest is part of the Darkland Tales series of contemporary takes on Scottish history and legends. The Booker-shortlisted author has chosen a true story from 1857, when labourer Angus McPhee murdered his parents and aunt at their small farm in Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. Tried and found to be criminally insane, he spent the rest of his life in the Criminal Lunatic Department of Perth Prison. Based on such records as are available, Burnet’s account of the events is narrated, some years after the fact, by Angus’s brother Malcolm, who is still living, alone and largely ostracised by the community, in the family home. Recalling the events that led up to the killing, Malcolm slowly loses his grip on reason as he tries to make sense of something senseless. Burnet’s vivid portrayal of a troubled household by a man attempting to explain the inexplicable is dark, intense and utterly compelling.View image in fullscreenThe Winter Warriorsby Olivier Norek, translated by Nick Caistor (Open Borders, £18.99)Prize-winning French author Norek, best known for his cop series, has turned his hand to crime on a grand scale: the 1939 Soviet invasion of Finland. The “Winter war”, during which the temperature plummeted to -51C and the massively outnumbered Finns succeeded in keeping the Russian bear at bay and inflicting far heavier casualties than they sustained, was so embarrassing to the Kremlin that the conflict was written out of official Soviet history. Although Norek gives us a god’s eye view of proceedings, the moral and dramatic centre of the action is Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä, who, like most of the main characters, is drawn from life, and whose skill earned him the nickname “White Death”. The Soviet generals were more afraid of Stalin than of the enemy; horribly topical and wholly immersive, with descriptions vivid enough to make you shiver, this astonishing book is not only a testament to bravery and resilience, but a powerful indictment of the cruelty and needless suffering that result when ideology comes up against reality.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

As a branch publicity officer, one of his tasks was the monthly production of an in-house newsletter, and he decided to print, anonymously, a comic anecdote in verse form. When he asked a colleague who was a grammar school teacher what he thought of the contributor’s effort, the answer was dismissive: it did not rhyme or scan! Maurice decided to take up the challenge.An industrial technical writer by profession, he knew something about the building of ships. Now he would investigate the craft of poetry construction. In the public library, he discovered The Oxford Book of Twentieth-Century English Verse, chosen by Larkin. He bought the book – the first collection of poems he had ever owned.At this stage the poets who captured his attention were those who wrote movingly of their second world war experiences, such as Charles Causley, Keith Douglas, Vernon Scannell and, especially, Henry Reed, whose poemNaming of Partsshowed Maurice a picture from his own life as an 18-year-old conscript in charge of his first rifle.View image in fullscreenRutherford receiving his honorary doctorate from the University of Hull, 2023.Photograph: Phil CurryMaurice’s poetic skills and public presence flowered. Importantly, he went deeper into the work of the Welsh poet RS Thomas, and developed his “ear” for the music of language. He attended courses run by the Arvon Foundation. There were poetry competition successes, and increasing appearances in literary journals.In 1982 he published a first collection, Slipping the Tugs, with Lincolnshire and Humberside Arts, bringing to life the streets and people of Hull, the “rust-measled” ships and “ebbed-out estuary”, “the quiet men” and their war stories.His subsequent publications are This Day Dawning ( 1989), Love is a Four-Letter World (1994), After the Parade (1996), And Saturday is Christmas, New and Selected Poems (2011) and Flip Side to Philip Larkin (2012). Readers, critics and poets were enthusiastic. Causley, reviewing This Day Dawning, described Rutherford as “a totally original voice, sure, wide-ranging, very moving and arresting, as well as often being very funny”.Maurice shared a birth year with Larkin, but had a very different experience of Hull, east Yorkshire, the city where Larkin spent much of his life and where Maurice was born. He clearly relished writing as one of the everyday people Larkin had described as a “cut-price crowd”. In his poem View from Hessle Road, dedicated toJean Hartley(Larkin’s Hull publisher), he adapts some of Larkin’s words with mischievous intent, imagining the local response to “Hull’s late bard”: “Oozee? … / “We’ve never ‘eard of ‘im down ‘Ezzle Road. / No, bollocks. Poetsarra … crowdacraps!” However, Maurice, who, like Larkin, identified with no poetry movement, admired and learned a lot from his contemporary. Both were brilliant technicians and, though realists, could write with great lyrical sensitivity, especially when observing the natural world.Maurice was the son of Evelyn Rutherford, a manager for a salt cod curing business in Hull, and his wife, Maud (nee Rawson), and had three siblings, one of whom, Barbara, went on to write historical novels. He enjoyed poetry at school, but opportunities were limited: he left Hull Commercial College aged 16 to work as a clerk at the Hull Graving Dock. His second world war service was initially with the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and later with the Royal Armoured Corps, his duties taking him to Italy and North Africa. He left with an exemplary record.Olive Gray, his wife-to-be, was in the Women’s Land Army in Sussex during the war. She and Maurice met at a dance, were married in 1947, and went on to have two children, Ian and Jeannie. Maurice’s postwar career continued in the Humberside shipbuilding and engineering industries where he was a technical writer, and prepared accounts and estimates for ship repairs. He took early retirement in 1986, when Humber Graving Dock, in Immingham, Lincolnshire, went into liquidation, and moved from Grimsby back to Yorkshire.In 2016, he collaborated with Jeannie, an artist, on Marshalled Musings, an illustrated miscellany of short prose meditations and new poems. Also a gifted photographer, he curated, with the help of his granddaughter, Katy, and the leading music industry photographer Dan North, an exhibition of his rhymed haikus and accompanying photos, which ran at Cliffs in Cliftonville, Kent in 2019.In 2023, at the age of 100, Maurice, by then blind, was recognised by the University of Hull with an honorary doctorate. Before he heard about the honour, he had had a dream, and recorded it in a poem that ends by imagining, “The day my parents would have loved, / Mum in cherried hat and lemon-gloved, / My father standing taller than his height, / Willing this dream hold firm come morning’s light.” Yes, it rhymes and scans – but what’s unforgettable is the timelessly sharp and loving vision of two proud parents.Working at the University of Hull’s Larkin Centre for a period, I had the pleasure of discovering Maurice’s poetry and meeting him in person. I went on to feature him twice in the Guardian poem of the week series:The Autumn Outingsin 2009 andMistin 2022.Olive died in 2012. Maurice is survived by Ian and Jeannie, by two grandchildren, Katy and Alec, and four great-grandchildren.Maurice Rutherford, poet, born 28 September 1922; died 2 October 2025Explore more on these topicsPoetryPhilip LarkinobituariesShareReuse this content"

Now, she’s adding another title to her résumé: novelist.This month, the 49-year-old releases her first work of fiction, Gone Before Goodbye, co-written with the bestselling thriller author Harlan Coben.Already tipped to hit the bestseller lists on publication, the book follows Maggie McCabe, a former army combat surgeon who takes a discreet medical job for an anonymous client – only for a patient to vanish under her care, setting off an international conspiracy. “I’ve never had an idea for a novel before,” Witherspoonsaid recently. “I’m always the actor who shows up and executes someone else’s vision. I thought, maybe it’s time to take the big leap and build the world myself.”Witherspoon and Coben are touring the book and will appear together at the Royal Festival Hall next week as part of the London literature festival. But for Witherspoon, the move is less a pivot than a continuation – the latest chapter in a career defined by reinvention and an unerring sense of what audiences want.Born in New Orleans and raised in Nashville, Witherspoon made her screen debut at 14 in The Man in the Moon (1991). She spent her 20s playing sharp, ambitious young women who defied expectations: Tracy Flick in Election, Woods in Legally Blonde, Melanie Carmichael in Sweet Home Alabama. Her performance as June Carter Cash in Walk the Line earned her an Academy award and confirmed her as one of Hollywood’s most bankable stars.“She’s got that quality that men find attractive, while women would like to be her friend,” the director Alexander Payne once said. “But that’s just the foundation. Nobody else is as funny or brings such charm to things. She can do anything.”Despite her reputation, the late 2000s were professionally tough for Witherspoon. Her film choices faltered, and the scripts coming her way were uninspiring. “There are a lot of really, really big movies about robots,” she said at the time, “and there’s not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie.”The lack of complex roles for women prompted her to start producing her own material. In 2012, she founded Pacific Standard, later folded into her larger media company Hello Sunshine to tell stories by and about women.The strategy paid off. Gone Girl, Wild and Big Little Lies became critical and commercial hits, each one led by complex female protagonists. Subsequent projects, such as The Morning Show, Little Fires Everywhere and Daisy Jones & the Six, confirmed Witherspoon’s status as a cultural power broker (when Hello Sunshine sold in 2022 for a reported $1bn, it made Witherspoon one of the richest and most powerful women in Hollywood).In 2017, Witherspoon launched Reese’s Book Club, whichnow boasts millions of membersand an uncanny ability to turn any selection into a bestseller – creating its own term: the Witherspoon effect. The novels she picks are mostly stories of female resilience and reinvention, and many of them later become Hello Sunshine screen projects, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. In 2022, she wrote the first of her Busy Betty series of children’s books beforeannouncing her pivot to adult fictionlast year.Perhaps it was inevitable Witherspoon would one day write a novel. In recent yearsa slew of famous names have moonlighted as novelists. Keanu Reeves collaborated with the British fantasy writer China Miéville; Hillary Clinton teamed up with the mystery novelist Louise Penny; Bill Clinton co-wrote thrillers with James Patterson. According to Nielsen BookScan data, in 2023, eight of the top 100 bestselling paperback novels, and five in the top 20, were written by celebrities.View image in fullscreenReese Witherspoon has previously written children’s books.Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesFor Witherspoon and Coben, their story began nearly a decade ago when they met at a conference – he admired her work with books and she admired his knack for plot. When she phoned him years later with an idea about a surgeon forced to become a fugitive, their collaboration took shape over a single, three-hour call. “We both knew at the end there’s no way we’re not going to do this,” Cobentold USA Today. “It was just too much fun.”The premise has a personal resonance for Witherspoon. Her father was a military doctor who served as a lieutenant in the US army reserve, her mother was a professor of nursing. “We did not want any of this to appear gimmicky,” Coben said. “Neither of us needed a résumé thing. We both agreed it had to be our best work.”Whether it is remains to be seen. Early reviews have been encouraging –The Los Angeles Times praised the novel’sability to “pull the reader deep”, and the book holds a four-star average on Goodreads – but Witherspoon’s name alone will guarantee attention. Coben has already mused on the cinematic quality of the story and his co-author’s suitability for the lead role.But for now, Witherspoon’s ambitions are focused on the page. She has said she hopes Maggie McCabe can do for medicine what Elle Woods once did for law: inspire women to see themselves in professions where they are too often underestimated.Explore more on these topicsReese WitherspoonThrillersFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here is a gnarled landmass of bubblegum blues, powder pinks and strange, luminous beasts, where evolution seems to occur at light speed. This world’s considerable beauty is amplified by how it is rendered: like a 1980s fantasy movie filled with charmingly handmade practical effects. Keeper is the latest title from Double Fine, maker of trippy platformerPsychonauts 2, Kickstarter sensationBroken Ageand many other idiosyncratic titles. It is an action-adventure resplendent with the lumps and bumps of life’s imperfections, as if its 3D modellers had sculpted the setting from papier-mache rather than using computer software.Even stranger than the setting is the protagonist: you play as a lighthouse, coming to appreciate this gleaming ecological fantasia by shining its beacon about the environment. Long shadows stretch behind illuminated objects, making the outlines of spectacularly supersized plants and tiny critters all the more pronounced. The casting of light is how you interact with the world: it often causes vegetation to grow before your eyes, and sometimes unusual inhabitants will feast upon it. As you lumber through this environment – calm lagoons and sun-baked canyons filled with prickly cacti – there is joy to be found in simply looking, taking the weirdness in, and then bringing it to even greater life.View image in fullscreenPuzzle solving … Keeper.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosThat seems to be your role in Keeper: lighthouse as life giver. Quickly, you gain a companion: a bird called Twig, whose beak is made from driftwood. You become a double act: at various points, you send your feathered friend to turn a crank (in this far-future take on planet Earth, the organic and mechanical have fused, like a steampunk take on Henry David Thoreau). But these puzzles are no match for the daring ingenuity of the visual design, nor do they especially resonate with the game’s celebration of biology. Early on, you are merely swivelling the analogue stick, making the one cog line up with another.Too often, puzzles feel like a roadblock to exploration rather than an enabler. But, slowly, Keeper begins to lean into the surrealism of its world to generate surprises. At one point, a candy floss-like substance gets stuck to your lighthouse, causing it to become weightless. Rather than wobbling awkwardly, suddenly you’re leaping with grace, suspended in the air for many seconds, exuberant at the ability to take flight.Thereafter, Keeper finds an evolutionary groove. The lighthouse transforms into a boat of delightfully piscine characteristics: what pleasure there is swishing and whirling about in azure blue water. The game then takes a darker, more abstract turn as you become a red-hot disc of metal, carving through knotted undergrowth like a primordial Sonic the Hedgehog.View image in fullscreenA surreal setting … Keeper.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosKeeper speaks clearest through its tremendous images, while billing itself as a “story told without words”. But the latter isn’t quite right. At various points, button prompts flash up on screen: for example, press X to “peck”. In spelling out exactly what the player should be doing, the world’s ambiguity is diminished.This problem recurs at the game’s conclusion, albeit from a different angle. Without spoiling exactly what happens, the player seems to be presented with the magnificent and incomprehensible totality of existence itself. How do we interact with such transcendent profundity? Sadly, with another rote shape-based puzzle involving kaleidoscopic crystals and a black hole. That is Keeper in a nutshell, a game that lacks the interactive vocabulary to wholly embrace the weirdness it depicts with such sparkling, vivid imagination.Keeper is out now onXboxand PC, £24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesXboxPCPuzzle gamesAdventure gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there are others that need to be savoured, and sometimes even suffered. Silent Hill f is in the latter category, which is why our review is somewhat delayed. This slowburn descent into psychological horror is set in 1960s Japan, but it also has pertinent things to say about the modern era and the tendrils of misogyny crawling out of the basement of the culture wars.Lead character Hinako Shimizu is a school girl in the small conservative town of Ebisugaoka. Her father is a bully who treats his wife like a servant and his daughter like an inconvenience, and her best friend is Shu, a boy who may harbour deeper feelings for her – much to the frustration of another friend Rinko, who has a serious crush on him. It reads like a teen drama, which in a way it is, until an apocalyptic supernatural fog descends on the town and almost everyone goes missing.View image in fullscreenFilled with arresting imagery … Silent Hill f.Photograph: Konami Digital EntertainmentFrom here, we are very much in classic Silent Hill territory. You must explore the streets and alleys of the stricken town, now populated by a range of perversely eroticised monsters, from jolting marionettes with daggers to the wildly Freudian hatchers, who are covered in breast-like cysts and continuously give birth to more beasts. Whenever Hinako loses consciousness she finds herself in a shadowy underworld, where a man with a fox mask effectively gaslights her into a seemingly destructive quest of self-discovery and rebirth – against the warnings of her childhood doll, which makes regular visitations.The game, then, joins a crowded pantheon of horror texts that explore – often with a sense of dread and repugnance – the transition from girl to woman. Like The Exorcist, like Carrie, like the onryō movies of modern Japanese horror cinema we are in the territory of the “monstrous-feminine”, cinema academic Barbara Creed’s famous study of horror films in which the female reproductive body is a source of abject anxiety and revulsion. Just as the village in Silent Hill 2 came to embody lead character James Sunderland’s psychosexual neuroses , the monsters that lurk in the darkened, misty corners of Hinako’s home town are exaggerated versions of her own everyday fears as well as the attitudes of the society she lives in.Silent Hill at 20: the game that taught us to fear ourselvesRead moreIt is fascinating stuff, filled with arresting imagery. From the desolate farmland bordering the town, to the shadowy halls of the spirit world, each location is filled with detail that quietly serves the narrative. Combat is stilted and sometimes frustrating, but that was always the case with this genre until Resident Evil 4 came along, and we’re playing as a school kid, not a special ops soldier or an elite cop. The puzzles are familiar to survival horror veterans, but challenging enough to keep you going. The little cinematic scenes in which you meet up again with Rinko and Shu build the complexities of their friendship, and the societal expectations it apes, without outstaying their welcome. The endings tie in with previous games, providing an array of outcomes, some ghastly, some hilarious.Most of all, this is that rarest of things: a horror game that actually has something to say. Rather than simply throwing jumpscares and black-haired ghost maidens at you until you submit, it uses rural mythology and superstition as a lens through which to examine the harms of patriarchy and the rigidly gendered expectations it thrusts on to teenagers. It also proves that the survival horror genre still has so much to give, 30 years after its inception. You must come to Ebisugaoka as soon as you can, and stay at least a week, maybe longer.Silent Hill f is out now, £60Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

They’ve sunbathed before an artificial sun, slid down helter skelters and witnessed AI-powered robotic jellyfish floating through the air. But this is the first time they will be taking a deep dive into a reindeer’s nose. The latest artist commission for the cavernous space – by the Indigenous Sámi artist Máret Ánne Sara – invites gallerygoers into a labyrinthine structure based on the scaled-up interior of a reindeer’s nasal passages. Once inside they can meander round or chill out on reindeer hides, listening on headphones to Sámi elders telling stories and imparting knowledge.Why the nose? It might sound whimsical but the installation pays tribute to a little-known natural marvel: scientists have discovered that in under a second, the reindeer’s nose can heat the surrounding air it inhales by 80 degrees celsius, enabling the animal to survive in inhospitable Arctic temperatures. Scaling the nose up to larger than human size, Sara says, “creates a sense of inferiority that you as a human being are not dominant over nature”. The artist is a former journalist, children’s author and land defender, who comes from a reindeer-herding family in northernNorway. “Maybe that creates the potential to shift your perspective or trigger some humbleness,” she adds.The maze-like structure is one of several components in Sara’s immersive commission celebrating the culture, science and philosophy of the Sámi, Europe’s only Indigenous people. Semi-nomadic, the Sámi number roughly 100,000 people ranged across northern Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Russia’s Kola Peninsula (an area they call Sápmi). They have faced persecution, forced assimilation and suppression of their language by all four nations. By focusing on the reindeer, an animal at the heart of the Sámi cosmology and creation story, the work also draws attention to the community’s struggles relating to the climate crisis, land dispossession and colonialism.On the long entrance ramp, there’s a towering, 26-metre structure of reindeer hides trapped by power and light cables. It can be read as a metaphor for the political and economic systems constraining the Sámi. Part pylon, part celestial ladder, this part of the installation, titled Goavve- refers to the Sámi name for an extreme weather phenomenon, whereby dense layers of ice form as fluctuating temperatures melt and refreeze the snow, locking in the reindeers’ main winter food, lichen. Goavvi is a consequence of global heating, which is happening up to four times faster in the Arctic than elsewhere.View image in fullscreenNowhere to hide … Máret Ánne Sara (pictured with her work) in the Turbine Hall.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockThree years ago, I visited Sara in Guovdageaidnu in the far reaches of Norway during a goavvi winter and accompanied Sámi herders on their snowmobiles in biting cold as they hauled trailers of food pellets on to the wind-scoured tundra to distribute to manually. The reindeer crowded round us, pawing the icy ground in vain for mossy morsels. This costly and labour-intensive process is having a drastic impact on reindeer husbandry – and on the animals’ self-sufficiency. But the alternative is starvation. As goavvi winters become commonplace, reindeer are dying – some from lack of food, others drowning after falling into lakes and rivers through prematurely melting ice. On one level, the work is a monument to them. “With the layering of materials, in a way I’m bringing the goavvi to London,” says Sara.The sculpture also underscores the stark divergence between the western understanding of power as a resource to be harnessed for profit and survival and the Sámi worldview of energy as an innate life force in animals, people and land. Tate Modern’s history as a coal and oil power station is tied up in this, as is what the Sámi view as green colonialism by Scandinavian states. In their efforts to be standard bearers for renewable energy, Nordic nations have locked horns with the Sámi over the construction of windfarms, hydroelectric dams and mines on their ancestral land; the Sámi argue their human rights, livelihoods and way of life are threatened. “It’s very difficult being such a small minority to defend yourself when the arguments are rooted in saving the world,” Sara notes. “Extractivism has adopted the language of ecology, but still it’s just aiming to find more suitable ways to continue habits of consumption.”The artist and her family have themselves clashed with the Norwegian government over its increasingly stringent policies on herding. In 2016 Sara’s brother embarked on a series of ultimately unsuccessful lawsuits over the forced culling of his herd, ostensibly to stop overgrazing. In support, Sara created a four-year series of artworks titled Pile O’Sápmiincluding a colossal curtain of 400 reindeer skulls, which was exhibited at the 2017 art exhibition Documenta 14 and later acquired by the National Museum of Oslo, where it hangs in the entrance.For many Sámi, art seems the only sphere in which they can be heard by people of other nations. In 2022, Sara was one of three Indigenous artists who represented Norway, Finland and Sweden at the Venice Biennale when the Nordic Pavilion was temporarily rebranded the Sámi Pavilion. So her Turbine Hall commission has major political significance for the Sámi community and beyond. “This has so much synergy for Indigenous people globally, and for so many people who are not Indigenous, but who also feel strongly about the importance of ecological justice,” says Katya García-Antón, curator of the 2022 Sámi Pavilion, about the Turbine Hall work. “It will bring that conversation about rising temperatures closer. People will see that it’s not across the Atlantic or somewhere in the Amazon. It’s in Europe.”View image in fullscreenMáret Ánne Sara stands in the middle of her Turbine Hall installation.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockSara’s message is not about pitting western science against Indigenous knowledge; she’s interested in the way crucial, life-sustaining information has been gathered and transferred down generations of Sámi, through being so closely attuned to nature. This connectedness is expressed through her materials: animal pelts, bones, wood and power cables. Washing over the Turbine Hall is a soundscape of field recordings, which combines the natural sounds of a reindeer herd, mosquitoes, birds and Sámi traditional songs or joiks, with the hum and reverberation of industrial machinery.The structure modelled on a reindeer’s nasal passages is called -Geabbil (meaning “smartly adaptable” in Sámi). Alluding to Sámi traditions of makeshift home building, it is made with wooden poles, which are carved with the reindeer earmarks that distinguished generations of herds tended by Sara’s family. The walls are decorated with reindeer bones and skulls in a nod to Pile O’Sápmi. While to a westerner, the use of reindeer parts in an artwork may seem like cruelty to animals, here it underpins the Sámi notion of “duodji” – often crudely translated as “craft” but embodying a whole philosophy of life based on the interdependence of humans, animals and nature; this means that when any animal is slaughtered, nothing goes to waste. Animal wisdom can teach us a lot, say the Sámi, who do not believe in human supremacy.Sara recounts a childhood memory. When her ordinarily strong, resourceful father was summoned to the police station for supposedly letting his reindeer eat flowers, she was shocked to witness his posture, voice and gaze change before a high-ranking officer; above all she remembered his sudden “uncomfortable” smell, which she later understood as embodying his fear. The artist realised that reindeer similarly emit a warning scent through their bodies when stressed. “Looking at smell as a language, my memory started to make sense, understanding that we are linked with animals biologically and spiritually in every way,” she says. “As a child in that moment I was given so much information by my father’s presence, but wasn’t able to receive it.”Máret Ánne Sara’s Turbine Hall review – did no one think to ask her for a little bit more?Read moreSara has worked with an Algerian perfumer, Nadjib Achaibou, to capture the reindeer’s scent of fear and diffused this around the goavvi installation to reinforce its negative associations with extractivism and other catalysts of climate breakdown. In contrast, a pleasant aroma evoking reindeer milk, Sara’s breast milk and natural sweetgrass is intended to evoke hope at the entrance of the “geabbil” nose structure. These scents can provoke powerful visceral reactions. The first “blocks off my body,” the artist notes, whereas on smelling the second “instinctively I could feel my posture changing and my lungs and chest opening up”.For Sara, this Tate commission carries inherent promise. “There’s something very hopeful about the potential of anyone sitting down to soak this in with openness in their bodies and perspectives,” she says. “For me this is also a futuristic project, an invitation to learn from and incorporate Indigenous philosophy and knowledge into a global future.”Máret Ánne Sara’s Hyundai commission is at Tate Modern, London, until 6 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designTate ModernTurbine HallArtIndigenous peoplesNorwayEuropeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Her love life, her parenting andher relationship with her bodyhave all been the stuff of Fostekew’s shows in the recent past, and she revisits them all here. Apparently a show about tolerance (if she didn’t tell us, we wouldn’t know), Iconic Breath ranges widely across our host’s life and thoughts, while she conjures with the qualities she has inherited from her lovable but angry dad, and her inspiringly positive but recently deceased gran.She is an adroit mix of both in this show, with plenty of the trademark furious-but-fun rants about things that tee her off – including a volcanic mocking of female American podcasters and a bit about the pointlessness of meditation. But the show is upbeat, too, plotting a route through despair at the state of the world via the touchline of her son’s football matches, where she finds common cause with parents whose values are a world apart from her own. Not for the first time, Fostekew finds rich comedy in her role as doting but dismayed mum to a son who is maturing into quite the masculine stereotype, with a choice line in passive-aggressive filial put-downs.One or two of the set pieces here raise an eyebrow more than a laugh, such as the one about the embarrassing pall-bearing incident at her gran’s funeral. One might wish, meanwhile, for more developed thinking about, or reasoning behind, the show’s ostensible theme of tolerance, which seldom comes into focus. But if this isn’t an hour with impetus, it is consistently entertaining, as this “geriatric millennial feminist” riffs on the petty frustrations of co-habitation with her partner, re-enacts an undignified journey on a preposterously crowded tube, and delivers a bulletproof routine about pocket-dialling with her backside while out for a run. She may never be an airport comedian, but Iconic Breath is another Fostekew show that attains soaring altitude with impressive technique and efficiency.AtSoho theatre, London, until 18 October.

Time of falling leaves and Mike Oldfield chimes presaging Halloween? For David Teniers the Younger, the arrival of autumn doesn’t mean any of these. It means time for a drink, because the wine harvest is here. Other artists too have celebrated this time as the season of the vintage, from Poussin to Cy Twombly, but Teniers doesn’t even bother with scenes of the grape harvest. He cuts to the chase and portrays a plump tipsy bloke holding up a glass. His shiny face looks vaguely at us but he balances the glass perfectly, as he dangles the flagon he’s emptied in his other hand. Once Teniers, from Antwerp, was the most famous of 17th-century north European artists of everyday life: his ruddy realism was seen as the essence of this so-called “genre” tradition. As such he influenced British artists such as Hogarth and David Wilkie to paint ordinary, unprettified human existence.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nicolas Roeg’sfilm adaptationa couple of years later added a prologue in which we actually witness the recent loss of their youngest child, Christine, in a drowning accident. It is a horribly drawn-out scene, masterfully edited, and this new production directed by Douglas Rintoul opens by paying homage, while keeping the story’s original cause of death as meningitis.With the house lights up, Christine comes out to play on a reflective stage and darkness slowly descends. Against Daniel Denton’s rippling, misty video design, her blue dress seems to foreshadow a watery death. The next time we see her, John is cradling her lifeless body.It is a compelling opening for Nell Leyshon’s adaptation, which lets Laura voice more of her pain (Du Maurier’s story is filtered through John’s perspective). Leyshon has the couple reflecting on their return to the very hotel room of their carefree honeymoon, years earlier, painfully accentuating the strain on their relationship. She adds several realistic touches, threading their grief with guilt, and shows John (Mark Jackson), like their callous doctor, brusquely trying to get Laura (Sophie Robinson) to “move on” from what happened.View image in fullscreenThe supernatural elements never unsettle … Alex Bulmer, Robinson and Olivia Carruthers.Photograph: Manuel HarlanDu Maurier’s story is driven by an awful foreboding that colours each scene, not just the encounter with a pair of sisters who claim psychic visions of Christine but also the walking, waiting and confusions that occur after news arrives of an emergency back in England. On stage, those episodes crucially lack the creeping sense of dread: they are persistently lukewarm instead of chilling and the supernatural elements never unsettle. Although it is wisely played straight through without an interval, the closing section in particular slackens. Jess Curtis’s set becomes an empty shell on which John, the Venice police and the story’s famous hooded figure run around, with faintly ridiculous results.Until that climax, Curtis’s set had efficiently switched from hotel room to restaurant, while opened doors revealed the depth of the stage, and evoked places of worship and the ghostly streets of a city described as “slowly dying” in the story. Curtis’s costumes come mostly in the colours of the canals and, as in Du Maurier’s original, the often empty surroundings – mournfully lit by Jessie Addinall – underscore the absence the couple suffer.Like Adrienne Quartly’s score, the script is far better at conveying sadness than suspense. Leyshon describes water that looks like oil and boats that resemble coffins but John is given a number of overwrought psychic episodes, which scupper the mysteriousness of Laura’s later surprise appearance alongside the sisters (Olivia Carruthers and Alex Bulmer). Although it is moving to see John and Laura strive to rediscover their intimacy, some of the performances can sound stilted and the characters never get under your skin. Any suspense is sadly submerged.AtNew Wolsey theatre, Ipswich, until 25 October andSalisbury Playhouse, 29 October to 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreHorror booksDaphne du MaurierFictionShort storiesreviewsShareReuse this content"

There was the news thatMTV is shutting down its music channels– sad for those of us who misspent their youth watching them, though hardly surprising either, given MTV’s decades-long shift away from music and towards rolling repeats of Teen Mom and shows about tattooists. And there was amedia piece in the Guardianabout the demise of British TV’s once-gold plated 9pm slot, which for the first time last month failed to achieve a rating of 1m or more among any of the major broadcasters.That second storywasa little surprising. Overnight viewing figures are in constant decline in the streaming age, but even by those standards, not one solitary rating over 1m is eye-catching.It will naturally prompt the usual soul-searching about the end of appointment viewing: the whole country watching the same thing at the same time, families sat in the glow of the old cathode ray, kettle on in the ad break, et cetera. I’m not sure about that: appointment viewing, though not what it was, still lives on through live sport and certain blue-chip (often reality) shows (The Celebrity Traitors managed to attract someimpressive ratingsin that very same 9pm slot this week). But what the stories do underscore is something I’ve been thinking for a while: that TV channels, the places where we used to go to watch that appointment viewing, increasingly feel like an anachronism.As a teenager I would make a beeline for Channel 4 on Friday night to watch whatever the new comedy was that was airing in its post-watershed slot, a show that existed in the lineage of a murderer’s row of classics, stretching right back to the debut of The Comic Strip Presents on the launch night of Channel 4. When viewers tuned in to watch a series such as Spaced, Peep Show or Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace, plenty of them would have done so not because of the talent involved – the cast and creators of those were pretty much unknowns outside comedy circles at that point – but because of that lineage. We trusted Channel 4 to deliver a good new comedy; its tastes and sensibilities broadly mapped on to our own.View image in fullscreenFriday night appointment viewing … Peep Show.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAll the channels used to have that sort of distinct identity, rooted in their history. Are your tastes broad and mass market? Stick on BBC One or ITV. After something a little more rarefied? Try BBC Two (or formerly BBC Four). Or something a little more youth-skewing? Head towards BBC Three, ITV2 and E4. Or are you into air friers, documentaries about shopping centres and talking heads remembering the 80s? Off to Channel 5 you go. And then there’s the constellation of other channels on digital and what we used to call satellite, each catering for a certain set of tastes and sensibilities.Those sensibilities still exist today, of course – you can still trust Channel 4 to find great comic talent (I’m looking forward to seeing their upcoming comedyMake That Movie, starring gonzo Aussie comic Sam Campbell). But audience fealty to those channels doesn’t really exist in the same way. Nowadays, I’d argue that people are as likely to follow the talent around – someone like Jack Thorne, who bounces between BBC (Best Interests, the forthcoming Lord of the Flies series), ITV (The Hack) and Netflix (Adolescence, Toxic Town) – or devote attention to the production company involved in a show (see the A24 logo, now appearing on the title cards of Some Brave Girls and Dreaming Whilst Black).Simultaneously, the broadcasters have sought to downplay the very idea of these channels on their streaming platforms, the place where most people now watch their shows. On its homepage, iPlayer, for example, no longer tells you whether a show such as Film Club is BBC One, Two or Three (it’s Three, for the record). Instead, everything sloshes together in one big punchbowl of programming, the arts docs swimming alongside the soaps, the true-crime series next to the panel shows. Which makes sense, really: after all, in the age of streaming the aim is to keep people on your platform for as long as possible, so you need to illustrate the boundlessness of your content, low and high. But it does give a slight feeling of formlessness, of every streaming platform feeling a bit similar to one another. (Disney+ is a bit of an outlier here, splitting the platform into individual channels, including a section for National Geographic and – confusingly for UK viewers – a recently rebranded tab dedicated to US streamer Hulu, for more mature content.)All of those broadcasters are of course chasing Netflix, a platform that wants to replace TV wholesale, and thus has little interest in the idea of individual “channels”. Does Netflix have a sensibility? Perhaps, just about – though as it grows ever bigger that feels less evident. It wants to be an everything shop. That’s because Netflix is chasing YouTube – it’s why they justsigned a deal with Spotifyto broadcast video versions of some of their podcasts, video podcasts being a huge market that YouTube has so far pretty much had to itself. YouTube – with its billions of videos, ranging from shonky home movies right up to the highest of high-production series – is the ultimate example of this formless punchbowl of content, algorithmically guided but entirely absent of a sensibility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our discussion has fallen back in time to the start of the first mass Palestinian revolt against British rule and Zionism. It’s the year from which her latest film,Palestine36, takes its name, a year she’s heard about her entire life. It’s also the origin, she believes, of today’s reality – even if for others it’s a historical void. “A lot of people don’t even know, surprisingly, that the British were even in Palestine,” Jacir says incredulously. “This film is for Palestinians. It’s our story that hasn’t been told.”The veteran film-maker is undoubtedly well placed to tell it: this is her fourth feature to be selected as Palestine’s Oscar entry. And although a period film, it does not belong to the past. While years have passed since the executions, widespread detentions and demolished villages under Britain’s 30-year rule, she argues that history is alive. At one point in the film, a young Palestinian man is tied to the front of a vehicle by British soldiers, as a human shield. While filming the scene in Nablus, a city in the West Bank, the very same dayIsraeli soldiers strapped a wounded Palestinian man to a military vehicleduring a raid in Jenin. “Everything that is going on now was set up back then in 1936; everything that the Israeli army does, in fact, is all taken from that moment,” says Jacir.‘We need to do something’: the company releasing Palestinian films no one else willRead moreWe speak over video shortly after Palestine 36 premiered at the Toronto film festival to a 20-minute standing ovation. Understandably, Jacir is overwhelmed. The 10-year project has been “so difficult to come to life” and is a gift, she says, from a cast and crew who persevered despite living through “the darkest moments of our history”.As arguably Palestine’s foremost film-maker, Jacir has a gift for transporting Palestinians’ experiences of exile and rebellion on to the screen, notably withWhen I Saw You, her second feature, which is set in the aftermath of the 1967 Israeli invasion of the West Bank, and more recently,Wajib(winner of 36 international awards).Palestine 36, however, is macabrely applicable to the present moment. Days before our conversation, alongside other nations, theUK moved to recognise Palestinian statehood. Weeks earlier,global genocide scholars backed a resolution stating that Israel’s actions in Gaza met the legal definition of the crime. More than 65,000 Palestinians – a figurebelieved by academics to be an underestimate– have been killed since the attacks of 7 October. In the occupied West Bank,forced displacementsof Palestinians have intensified since.“There’s a genocide,” Jacir says. “I don’t want a state. I don’t give a shit about a state. We just want to live. That’s what Palestinians want. We want to have a life.”She tells me her father, born in 1936, survived the 1948 Nakba – the mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland after the creation ofIsrael– and speaks nonstop of the trauma and dispossession of the past. Jacir’s own backyard in Bethlehem is littered with canisters from Israeli weapons, tear gas, bullets, all labelled ‘Made in the US’. “There’s no respite for any generation of Palestinians. It never stops. Time is going quickly,” she tells me, “and yet we’re going nowhere.”Palestine 36 is stamped by Jacir’s resolve. From the start she was adamant about filming in Palestine, but production was shut down days before it was due to start, following the 7 October attacks. The foreign team were evacuated and it took hours for Palestinian crew members to return to their homes amid total lockdown. Forced to relocate to Jordan for 13 months, they were later able to return, but found one location – an entire village that they had painstakingly restored, including planting tobacco and cotton – had been overrun by settlers. There was also a risk of actors being misidentified if seen in military fatigues or rebel outfits. “It’s a very tense situation,” she says, “there’s no way we were going to put anybody’s life in danger.”View image in fullscreen‘These places are real, they exist’ … Palestine 36.Over two years, production stopped and started four times. The financial hit was massive. As the situation worsened, producers proposed filming in Cyprus, Greece or Malta instead, but for Jacir it was worth fighting to film in Palestine. “It’s so critical that Jerusalem is Jerusalem in the film. It’s not somewhere else. These places are real, they exist,” she says. “We do feel this can all be taken away, it’s being taken away.”While filming in the occupiedWest Bank, the Palestinian director was conscious it could be the last time they were there, just as she was aware of her own privilege at being on land many are unable to return to. The work felt all the more critical since this was the only feature film to shoot in Palestine in the past two years. Did filming in proximity to Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza change her relationship to the art of film-making, I wonder? “Artistically, the project changed. I couldn’t help but react to that.”While the film is large in its historic scope, covering the three-year Arab revolt, what we are left with is an emotional story of everyday people struggling to live. We find characters at a turning point, each life interwoven as skilfully astatreez– a hand-stitched embroidery central to Palestinian culture, which was top of mind for Jacir in the writing process. Each character was a thread for her to cross and intertwine – ultimately leaving us with a portrait of resistance in the face of imperialism.This is evidenced too in the film’s casting, with a mix of actors, from its animated lead, first-time feature film actor Karim Daoud Anaya, to Succession’sHiam Abbassand Game of Thrones’s Liam Cunningham, and in its use of colourised archival footage. Wanting the film to “feel alive”, Jacir says it was important to blend fiction with reality. The footage also took on further meaning after certain locations became inaccessible as the war worsened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As the number of Jewish immigrants escaping antisemitism in Europe rises, so too do Palestinian concerns over loss of land under British mandate. What follows is a farmer-led revolt that mobilises Palestinians from all classes. The British respond with martial law and the deployment of thousands of troops. Palestinians are imprisoned and executed, leaders are exiled and homes are scorched.In one scene, a young girl Afra (Wardi Eilabouni in her screen debut) finds a gun hidden in blanket folds near her sleeping grandmother, who catches her mid-act. She tells the girl she will teach her how to use it, “but you must know you have something more powerful than the entire British empire”. Afra is perplexed: what is it? Her grandmother takes her hand. “You will know on your own,” she tells Afra sagely. In another scene, we see Kareem (another debut, by Ward Helou) being told to bite his father’s finger, while his father does the same to one of Kareem’s. Kareem withdraws in pain. “I won. Do you know why?” his father asks. “Because I endured longer, not because I’m stronger. You need to endure so you can win in the end.”The two scenes are connected by their sense of hope – something Jacir says is important to hold on to. But in response to the ongoing devastation inGaza, she reined in the lighter moments. Suddenly, being playful or smart or intellectual hit a wrong note. “It’s not the time for lightness. It’s not the time for poetry. It’s not the time for being abstract and experimental,” she says.Just like the characters in Palestine 36, we don’t know what will happen next. By the film’s end, we see Afra run through Jerusalem in a tatreez dress, toward some future unknown. There’s no telling where she is going, or what is happening, but as news of a fragile ceasefire breaks, Jacir’s message of endurance feels urgent rather than historical. “It’s just about continuing,” she says.Palestine 36 will be released in UK and Ireland cinemas from31 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmPalestineWest BankWorld cinemaIsraelColonialismGazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

By the time Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley wrestled the brand back to the big stages, Frehley –who has died aged 74– was little more than a face-painted pattern to the generations of new fans who came to gawp at the fireworks.But one shouldn’t underestimate his contribution to Kiss: almost all of Kiss’s setlist to the end was made up of songs he had played on. And though he was not a prolific writer, one of his compositions – Cold Gin – remained in their setlist until Stanley and Simmons quit in 2023, more than 40 years after Frehley left the band (the less said about the 1998 reunion album, Psycho Circus, the better).But it also helps that Kiss are the only band in history to have provided a real-time comparison of all the members’ individual talents. When all four of them released solo albums on the same day in 1978, Frehley’s turned out to be by far the best, the only one of the four that passed muster as a rock’n’roll record, and the source of a genuine hit,Frehley’s perfectly pitched version of the Russ Ballard song New York Groove, which gave a disco sheen to the Bo Diddley beat that droveHello’s 1975 hit version. Admittedly, Frehley had to be talked into it by producer Eddie Kramer, but he delivered triumphantly.View image in fullscreenAce Frehley poses with Cadillac high school majorettes in Cadillac, Michigan in 1975.Photograph: Fin Costello/RedfernsFrehley – born Paul; Ace was the character in Kiss – was a Bronx kid, the proud delinquent in a middle-class family, who first played an electric guitar aged 12, and had his own Fender and Marshall setup by 14. At 21, he successfully auditioned for Kiss, and by 24 he was one of the biggest stars in the US. His bludgeoning guitar was central to the Kiss sound – the “monster plod”, that behind-the-beat throb with the weight of a dinosaur – and he was the most proficient musician in the original Kiss lineup, by a distance: he could be a charismatic lead guitarist, adding instrumental flash to the pyrotechnics.I’ve written enough about Kissfor it to be plain that while they fascinate me, and I have a genuine love for them, I alsodon’t think they’re all that great an actual band. They are an event, a ceremony, and Frehley’s Spaceman character was part of that. Where Stanley projected sexuality and Simmons horror, Frehley offered a kind of enigmatic mystery, a blankness. And, of course, while one heard their New York accents, one never heard Frehley speaking. Maybe he really was a spaceman.Kiss was not a band whose members were destined to be lifelong friends. Frehley’s 2011 memoir, No Regrets, noted that the band divided early on into the partiers – himself and drummer Peter Criss – and the businessmen, Stanley and Simmons. Even decades on, the autobiographies of the four members were a mass of contradictions and resentments, blame and recrimination.View image in fullscreenPaul Stanley, Peter Criss, Ace Frehley and Gene Simmons in London in May 1976.Photograph: Andre Csillag/ShutterstockFrehley began drinking almost immediately after the band’s formation in 1973, and started taking cocaine during the making of 1976’s Destroyer. He loved cocaine, not just for how it made him feel. “It made me a better drinker,” he wrote. “I was already damned prodigious, but cocaine put me in a different league. It allowed me to drink longer and harder without passing out.” It was just three years into the band’s career and Frehley already felt he was distanced from Stanley and Simmons.And, in all fairness, it’s not hard to understand why Stanley, who barely drank, and the teetotal Simmons might have tired of Frehley’s lifestyle. In his book, Frehley admitted that twice on tour Simmons had saved him from drowning while drunk, once in a swimming pool and once in a bath. There were lucky escapes when driving drunk as well.There was enough rancour that, when Kiss announced their final tour, Frehley ended up not appearing, despite Stanley and Simmons saying they had invited him to make guest appearances (Frehley claimed this was only said to sell tickets).View image in fullscreenL-R: Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Paul Stanley perform as Kiss on the Gold Coast in Australia in 2001.Photograph: AAPHis solo career didn’t begin until five years after he left Kiss, and then after three records in three years he fell silent until 2009. However, in 2006 he got sober, and the last two decades of his career were his most productive since the early days of Kiss, with six albums in 15 years. He wasn’t just productive in volume, too – he finally sounded like he was making music for pleasure, rather than to fulfil a brief. It was old-fashioned hard rock, but once again he sounded hungry, for the first time in an age.His first sober album – Anomaly, from 2009 – might well be the best album from Kiss or any of their members since the 1970s. And on 2018’s Spaceman he patched things up with Simmons long enough for them to write two songs together: those, in effect, are the last ever studio recordings of the Monster Plod.Kiss’s was an extraordinary kind of greatness – unpredictable, unreplicable and often disputed. They would never have achieved it without Frehley, the man who could make the plod into a dance when he soloed.Explore more on these topicsMusicKissPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

History will always remember her as the first woman to win a best director Oscar, which she did in 2010 forThe Hurt Locker.But in her new film,A House of Dynamite, history may not have long to run. It is the story of a nuclear missile, launched at an American city. The rest is about what happens next. Bigelow would like you to consider Armageddon.“Someone I know said the bomb for the audience is realising this is possible,” she says. She smiles. “I’m glad if people come away from the movie as concerned as I am.”Today, though, her bearing is Zen. Almost six feet and wearing tinted sunglasses, she looks like a rock star, and younger than 73. Her own memories of the nuclear era stretch back to the early 1960s, and a cold-war childhood in California. School involved “duck and cover” drills, teaching kids to stay safe in a nuclear attack. “I grew up hiding under my desk. Of course, I was too young to understand what I was doing down there.”View image in fullscreenRebecca Ferguson as White House security analyst Olivia Walker in A House of Dynamite.Photograph: BFA/AlamyA House of Dynamite is a belated answer. Bigelow’s previous movie,Detroit, was a 60s true story, an account of racist police violence. Now she is back in the period she most likes making films about: right now. It is an age of ironies. On our phones, nothing is beyond the pale, and everything makes us furious. And all, she says, while ignoring a nuclear stockpile able to render our online dramas irrelevant. “It’s the one thing we never mention, much less question. It’s crickets out there. It isn’t on TikTok, so it doesn’t exist.”The movie, then, reminds us of a terrifying fact of life. “Our world is combustible. And it’s extraordinary to me how that ever became normalised.”The cast includes Rebecca Ferguson as a White House security analyst and Idris Elba as the US president. Rich with closely researched detail, the film shows us the same nightmare experienced by multiple characters. Who fired the missile is never clear. Retaliatory strikes are still prepared. The film does exactly what its director intends. It makes everything else you might be thinking about feel absolutely trivial.The art world felt rarefied. But film crossed every cultural and class line, and you could just hit the ground runningBigelow has long staked out her own place in cinema. Singular and self-made, she is one of the few working film-makers to have climbed Kilimanjaro. She is also still among the most controversial of directors.She first made a name in what were seen as male genres – Blue Steel a cop movie,Point Breaka heist flick (with surfers). Later there were political third rails: The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty set amid US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.But only a fool would dispute her gifts as a film-maker: a virtuoso of action, tension and release. Jamie Lee Curtis, star of Blue Steel, once compared her to a military general. It was meant as a compliment, describing a woman of quiet, “machinelike” strength. When I mention it, though, Bigelow’s eyebrows shoot up. “The general!”View image in fullscreenIdris Elba plays the US president in A House of Dynamite.Photograph: NetflixThe playwright and actor Tracy Letts is among the stars in A House of Dynamite. On a personal level, he says, he still doesn’t feel he really knows Bigelow. But she lost her reserve on set. “I wasn’t sure what I’d find. She really does have a quality of genius, so I wouldn’t have been surprised to meet Francis Ford Coppola on Apocalypse Now. In fact, she was the calm at the eye of the storm.” Working days, he says, were full of praise. “And you’re reassured because you know why she’s there. She’s already got the awards, and I’m sure she has enough money. So, you know, the film actually matters to her.”One astonishing scene involves a civil war re-enactment. (The event was real, shot documentary style.) On screen, as the world hangs in the balance, it feels brilliantly cool-eyed. America, you think, can be deeply self-obsessed. “I think you are not wrong,” Bigelow says. “And also we are a culture defined by war. I wish we could define ourselves differently.”View image in fullscreenThe Hurt Locker (2008), for which Bigelow was the first woman to win the best director’s Oscar.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyFor all the dread plausibility of A House of Dynamite, she also keeps its fictional politicians free of reminders of their real-world counterparts. “The situation in our film stands outside that situation.” Even so, it can be hard not to watch Jared Harris play the secretary of defence without remembering that the post now has a secondary title attached to it: secretary of war.Today, Bigelow makes a joke – or half of one – about lately thinking a lot about moving to London. (For the moment she lives in what has been described as a “30-hectare horse property” in upstate New York.) Interviews with movie talent now sometimes specify no questions about Trump; Bigelow doesn’t roll that way. She looks tense when the subject comes up, though. The risk, she says, is derailing conversation about the film. But with troops in US cities, how anxious is she? “Well, I did just make a movie about nuclear war. So that may say it all.”Part of why her career has been a giant Rorschach test has been her reluctance ever to say too much. Her movies leave room to think as well, much as her characters don’t tend to have backstories. Still, her own can feel like a breadcrumb trail. She was shy at school. Her mother was an English teacher; her father managed a paint factory. (She was an only child, a situation in which, she has said, “You kind of become peers with your parents.”)By the 1970s, she had become a New York artist, living and working amid the downtown scene.Philip Glasswas a friend;Cindy Shermana neighbour; a conversation with Andy Warhol helped convinced her she should work with film. “The art world felt rarefied. Everything relied on existing knowledge. But film crossed every cultural and class line, and you could just hit the ground running. It was so much more exciting to communicate with.”View image in fullscreenBigelow (centre) on her way to accept the Academy Award for best director for The Hurt Locker, in 2010.Photograph: Matt Petit/AMPAS/EPABy the 90s, she was a sensation. Blue Steel and Point Break made her a favourite among postmodern theorists and multiplex crowds alike. But the edge of transgression people found so ticklish also caused problems. Her techno-thriller Strange Days (1995) drew complaints about a scene of sexual violence. Then came K-19: The Widowmaker, the true story of a stricken Soviet nuclear submarine in 1961, members of whose crew died preventing an accident that might have started world war three. Executives asked her who US audiences were supposed to root for. The box office was bad enough to stall a once spectacular career.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I realised it never hadShe says now this was also when she started to think again about the nuclear threat. Making the film, she visited the Arctic, where abandoned subs rusted under the sea, waiting to leak radioactivity. “In the 90s, we’d all assumed the bomb was just going to magically disappear. I realised it never had.”She made TheHurt Lockersix years later, the story of a US army bomb disposal unit in Baghdad. It made for a triumphant next chapter. Being the first woman to be awarded an Oscar for directing even brought a sense of Hollywood respectability. (There was also the fun sidebar of Bigelow beating to the prize her ex-husband, James Cameron, who was nominated for Avatar.) But the thought of being pinned in place as a woman film-maker made her uneasy. “If I can represent that the impossible can be possible, I love it,” she says today of being a role model. Then there is an audible full stop.Her time in the establishment was short-lived. Her next movie,Zero Dark Thirty, about the US hunt for Osama bin Laden, was a tour de force and a source of vast rancour – and saw her accused of colluding with the CIA. A decade later, she can still seem bruised, though time has made her wry. “Something that struck me …”, I say at the start of this interview. “Uh oh!” she exclaims. Later, I call her films conversation starters. She bursts out laughing. “And Istillthink that’s a good thing.”She says she sees a clear relationship between her hot potato films of the past 20 years and her new one. K-19 left her haunted by nuclear ghosts. Then, while others had their say about her, The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty sharpened her self-image as a film-maker adjacent to journalism. “The films start with my own curiosity, and then there’s a desire to provide access to information the public doesn’t have that I think might be important.”The other link, of course, is the military. A retired three-star general acted as a consultant on A House of Dynamite. She points out she has never sought endorsement from the Pentagon. Indeed, the story is more than sceptical about the accepted wisdom of mutually assured destruction – and the billions spent maintaining it. “Our nuclear armoury is a fallible structure,” Bigelow says. “Within it are men and women working thanklessly behind the scenes, whose competence means you and I can sit and have this conversation. But competence doesn’t mean they’re infallible.”View image in fullscreenA heist flick (with surfers) … Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break (1991).Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/20 Century Fox/AllstarIt feels like an idea close to Bigelow’s core. Letts even compares her to Ken Loach. “I know it sounds a strange parallel, but they both make movies about flawed systems, and ordinary characters trapped inside them.” For her own part, she retains an endearing faith in people’s ability to make good choices with enough real information. She also thinks we need to start taking responsibility.“We are our own villain,” she says. Humanity made the bomb; at some point, we have to deal with it. “Of course, the challenge is this is a global problem. Climate change is the same. But we have to act. And I would say a first action is to see this issue as your main responsibility when you vote.”From high-octane action to arthouse intrigue … all Kathryn Bigelow’s films – ranked!Read moreBut are movies still the all-powerful communication tool they were when the younger Bigelow discovered film? “I do read things about the future of our industry that are very grim. But I’m also kind of detached. I don’t live in Los Angeles any more. And I just keep moving forward.”And so, inevitably, we come to AI. In 2025, no one talks about nuclear weapons, but the world can’t stop discussing theartificially generated actor Tilly Norwood. Bigelow says she would never use AI for anything to do with a performance. Beyond that, who knows? “When I made Strange Days, which now seems a hundred years ago, I was always being asked about technology. And I said then: what’s important is who uses it.” She tells me she is readingIf Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, the bestseller about our AI future. It is, she says, as pessimistic as the title implies. “Fascinating.”The problem, I say, is people often look to film-makers for answers. “I know. They do.” She rewinds out loud back through our conversation. “AI. Climate change. Nuclear war.” She smiles again. “Next time, I’m making a comedy.”A House of Dynamite is in cinemas now and on Netflix from 24 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmKathryn BigelowHurt LockerZero Dark ThirtyOscarsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday afternoon, I headed into the Royal national park, south of Sydney, with researchers who had reintroduced a small population of the elusive monotremes two years ago.There was a big net and torches – and our dinner. It could be a long wait.The platypus was thought to be locally extinct by the 1970s, after a chemical spill on a nearby highway washed through streams and the Hacking River, devastating the delicate ecosystem that platypuses need to thrive.But then, in 2023, Dr Gilad Bino, an ecologist and freshwater biologist at the University ofNew South Wales, and his colleague, Dr Tahneal Hawke, introduced 10 platypuses into the national park in the hope of reestablishing a thriving population.View image in fullscreenDr Tahneal Hawke and Dr Gilad Bino beside the river where they set up 50 metres of netting to ensnare platypuses for research.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianThe project paid quick dividends. Anewborn platypuswas discovered in early 2024 and christened Gilli – a Dharawal word for “flame”. Three more adults were introduced in May.This week, the researchers were hoping to find evidence that Gilli wasn’t a fluke.I’ve lived in Australia for 10 years after moving from the US. And like many people, I had never seen a platypus in the wild. So I jumped at the chance to join Bino and Hawke this week when they ventured into the forest in search of their “platys”.The zigzaggy routeEach platypus introduced to the park in 2023 has a small transmitter about the size of a vitamin tablet. They signal to 40 underwater receivers along the Hacking River, allowing the researchers to know how the platypuses are faring.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsA platypus can range over 5km, and they’re “relatively agile”, according to Jackson Wilkes Walburn, a PhD candidate at UNSW working with Bino and Hawke.The animals can scramble over land, up and down riverbeds and into weirs in search of food, or in the case of the males, mates. That agility can make it hard to know where they might be.Bino and Hawke set up 50 metres of orange netting on the river on Thursday evening, with floats every metre, so any ensnared platypus could be collected within moments of hearing the telltale “platypus splash”.View image in fullscreenBino unfurls a net to try to catch platypuses in the Hacking River, in the Royal national park. The animals are mostly active at dawn and dusk.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian“Platys often take a bit of the zigzaggy route; they’re not flying down the [river] highway,” Wilkes Walburn says. The long net off the river’s bank gives the team “the best chance of picking them up”.The animals are crepuscular, meaning they’re mostly active at dawn and dusk. Platypuses feed on spineless waterbugs, worms, yabbies and mayfly larvae, eating for about eight or 10 hours a night. Once the net is in the water, we wait.A splash in the twilightWhen you are new to hunting platypuses, every rustle in the dark sounds like monotreme action. The researchers always have eyes or ears on the net when it’s in the water.When dusk gives way to darkness, Bino, Hawke and Wilkes Walburn operate as platypus lifeguards, scanning the surface of the net with a spotlight every few minutes. Many research sessions go until midnight, others much later, and Bino and Hawke have been known to pull all-nighters.At 8.03pm, we hear a splash.“Right on schedule,” Wilkes Walburn says. He and Hawke jump into a small boat.A minute later, Hawke has hoisted a platypus out of the net by its tail, checked for venomous spurs (it’s a male – he has them) and placed it into a pillowcase.Bino is waiting on the riverbank with a scanner to check who has been caught. Each of the released platypuses has an ID chip in the skin folds behind their necks.View image in fullscreenHawke pulls the first catch for the night from the net – a male platypus that was one of the first to be released in the Hacking River in 2023.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianWe’ve found Draco. He’s one of the original 10 released in 2023.“It’s kind of a surprise,” Bino says. Draco is a few kilometres from where the group was released. “We don’t really know where they all are. But it’s great to be reunited with one of the original 10, two and a half years later. Nice!”Bino still remembers the rush after capturing his first male platypus and reckoning with the spurs. They have a 1 cm-long spur on each hind leg. A prick can cause pain for months. Morphine doesn’t help, Bino says. Thankfully, the trio in the park don’t have first-hand experience.A bush research theatreBino, who was cooking dinner before Draco arrived, races to set up a platypus-sized field hospital. He’ll take a microbiome sample and attach a new transmitter to Draco that should last another three months.View image in fullscreenHawke takes a swab from the mouth of a juvenile platypus that is new to their database.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianThe animals are anaesthetised while the tests are being done, something Bino believes is “really important”.“You draw blood from the tip of the bill; it’s one of the most sensitive organs the animal has,” he says, noting some researchers test lucid animals. “[But] when I started, I was like ‘Uh-uh’.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Wilkes Walburn and Hawke have caught another male, but this one doesn’t have an ID chip. It’s a juvenile male, probably about a year-and-a-half to two years old, and just the second young platypus seen in the national park in the past 50 years.“That’s exciting,” Bino says, turning to Hawke, his research partner for the past 10 years. “Oh, give me a hug! That’s nice, very cool.”“Unreal!” Hawke says into the night. “Who’s your parent? Gilli’s brother? Cousin? Who knows. So exciting!”They’ll have to run “everything” with the new platypus: blood tests, urine samples, swabs of the mouth and cheek pouches, a fur sample and a small biopsy. They’ll run a full genome to figure out who his parents are.View image in fullscreenThe discovery of a juvenile platypus confirms breeding is continuing in the original population introduced to the Hacking River.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianFifteen minutes later, another platypus comes out of the water. He’s big at 1.6kg, with supple brown fur – another new juvenile. It’s nearly impossible to age older platypuses, but this guy still has a protective sheath around his spurs, which means he was probably born last year and emerged from his mother’s den earlier this season.The atmosphere is electric in platypus land. Half an hour later, the team catches a fourth platypus of the night. This time it’s a female. They aren’t sure which female, but she is one of a pair released in May in the area.Death is naturalIt’s not always good news, however. Earlier this month, a kayaker found a dead platypus in the Royal national park. It was a male named Chaos from the original cohort of 10. Tests are ongoing to find out the cause of its death.“Life and death is natural,” Bino says. “It could be natural mortality. We introduce adults and they have a natural longevity. [But] it’s a rough period for males.”It’s peak mating season for platypuses and males can exhaust their energy stores while looking for a partner – or during territorial fights with other males.“We’re very sad to be aware of this [loss]. But the survival has been great, they’re breeding, the reintroduction is currently successful,” Bino says. Platypuses can live up to 20 years in the wild,according to the Australian Museum.Distorted moles to lesser bilbies: a new way to marvel at Australia’s supremely weird and unique mammalsRead moreThere have been pollution scares. Peabody Energy, the operator of a coalmine upstream from the Royal national park, wasissued with a clean-up noticeafter a landslip turned the waters of some streams feeding into the Hacking River an oily-black. The event was localised and didn’t have any major negative effects on the program.Peabody has since become a major funder of Bino’s research, viaa three-year $630,000grant to support the next phase of the relocation project after funding from the NSW government and the WWF ran out.View image in fullscreenHawke and Bino examine the foot of a juvenile male.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian“I’m not stupid, but they’re a significant stakeholder in the catchment. So I see that as value,” Bino says of the energy company. “If they’re polluting, I’ll say they’re polluting, but it’s important to involve industry.”Peabody Energy says it’s “proud to support the dedicated UNSW research team working to return an iconic species to its natural home”. “The encouraging results show real progress toward a self-sustaining platypus population,” a spokesperson says.A good night anywhereYuin elder Uncle Dean Kelly, who named Gilli, says the discovery of two more juveniles on Thursday is an important moment for the park – and for the species.“It’s a successful thing that’s happened now with the platypuses, the relocating and now having the next generation,” Kelly says.“We know it can work, and there should be support … to continue. We know the platypus is an old animal, an ancient animal. That’s the plan, to continue to work with guys like Gilad [Bino] and … make sure these species survive for generations to come.”Bino, Hawke and Wilkes Walburn pull out the net at midnight and get ready to release the quartet of captured platypuses.One at a time, the monotremes are taken to the riverbank, their pillowcases opened up, before they make a dash to the safety of the water.“Four platypuses. In the Royal. That’s a good night anywhere,” Hawke says.View image in fullscreenBreeding is continuing in the population introduced to the Hacking River in 2023.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsWildlifeAnimalsNew South WalesMammalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This “real people” factor is catnip for fashion street style.At the fair this October, the crowd mixed neutrals with pops of colour. The art crowd are often well-heeled, so the signs of the super-rich – Birkin bags, discreet cosmetic surgery and even fur coats – were in evidence, alongside a stylish, creative crowd. Attention-grabbing outfits mixed with fashion-literate but more low-key looks.View image in fullscreenBelma Gaudio: ‘I tend to wear something that is comfortable but a little bit standout, with an affinity towards the art.’Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianCharlene Prempeh, the founder of creative agency A Vibe Called Tech, is wearing all-black – but the sculptural shapes ensure her outfit fits in. “There’s very few occasions where you can get dressed up for a day event,” she says. “That’s what the fair facilitates.”Too many overt blue-chip symbols turn some of the crowd off. Osman Ahmed, a writer wearing a Prada skirt and Alaïa bag, says he tones his look down at Frieze: “When there’s so much wealth and status signifiers in the room, I don’t want to be associated with that.”Fashion brands, however, perhaps see an opportunity. Dunhill, Stone Island, Loewe and Nanushka are partners, meaning their branding will appear at the fair.Talking to the Financial Times, both Dunhill and department store Dover Street Market said they often saw increased footfall during Frieze week.“[It] is both a fashion and art moment,” says Gaudio. Koibird launched a collection from artist James Shaw in store this week.Prada is perhaps the artiest of fashion brands. Last year, co-creative director Raf Simonstold Voguethat “my interest in art is much bigger than my interest in fashion.”For Frieze week, it has openedPrada Mode, a space in King’s Cross.It features an installation by the Danish-Norwegian contemporary art duo, Elmgreen & Dragset, entitled The Audience.Visitors will walk into a “cinema” to watch an intentionally blurred film. Along with other people, they will share the space with five hyper-real sculptures sitting in the seats. One, of course, is wearing Prada.It’s a full circle moment for the artists. Twenty years ago, they erected Prada Marfa, a replica of a Prada store, in the Texas desert. The project, originally a comment on the pomposity of land art, has since become an Instagram spot – Beyoncé and Solange posted selfies in 2012 – and it was in The Simpsons in 2019.Although it wasn’t a collaboration with the brand, Prada gave permission for the artists to use the logo, and provided Prada designs to fill the store.View image in fullscreenOsman Ahmed: ‘I always think what would Miuccia Prada wear? There a discreet, chic vibe that I want to go for.’Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian“In an informal way, that was our first collaboration,” says Michael Elmgreen. “It’s the [autumn/winter] 2005 collection, which happened to be in very desert-friendly coloured tones. They fit tremendously well in the desert landscape.”Head of Frieze art fair hopes for ‘Barbenheimer moment’ with Paris rivalRead moreTwo decades on from Prada Marfa, JW Anderson had two paintings by Jean Siméon Chardin on the walls of the venue for his Dior show in June, Roksanda Ilinčić was inspired by Barbara Hepworth for her latest collection, and a sculpture by Kwangho Lee was on the catwalk at Bottega Veneta.Artists are also inspired by fashion. Naomi Lulendo, exhibiting at the fair for the first time and wearing a striking outfit of a striped Kenzo shirt and flowing skirt, uses fabric and clothes in her work.“Clothing is projecting something,” she says, “and since everybody’s projecting something on to you, you have a kind of control … I like people to see me in a way I want to be seen.”London-based designer Bianca Saunders also makes artwork. This October, shecollaborated with the Tate on designs that use the work of William Blake.Art is central to her practice. “Whenever I feel blocked, I’m just like: ‘Let me do my rounds at the galleries,’” she says.The artistic world is also inspiring. “When I first [started], I was like: ‘I want to see [people] walking around Frieze wearing the brand.’ That’s the customer that I want – for them to be observers of art.”View image in fullscreenNaomi Lulendo: ‘It’s finding the balance between comfortable and also a bit classy and sassy and chic.’Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianElmgreen agrees that outfits are now part of the experience of Frieze.“You can say it’s a fair for common people [because anyone can buy a ticket]. It’s not only for the selected few who have the money to buy the art … I think the fashion world is interested in a group of people that they can reach through the art.“And the artist is definitely also interested in a group of people they can reach through the fashion world.”This article was amended on 17 October 2025.

While it may not have enjoyed a “ginaissance” like its juniper-based cousin – or seen the same trend-led uplift of rum and tequila –Wine and Spirit Trade Associationdata showsvodka is the UK’s biggest-selling spirit by volume.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Too often people just buy the cheapest vodka as they believe it doesn’t have flavour,” says Dawn Davies, buying director at the Whisky Exchange. “Vodka has plenty of flavours, especially if you don’t choose one that has been distilled 100 times over. If you like a cream texture, then a potato-based one is good; for a bit more spice, try rye; and for fruitier notes, apple or grape.”While commonly made using neutral grain or potato, producers are using options from fruit to rice and sugarcane, maple sap and honey. Even Jeremy Clarkson has jumped on the bandwagon, using byproduct whey as the basis of his Cow Juice vodka (something the wonderfulBlack Cowhas been doing since 2011).I have been writing about drinks for about a decade, and drinking vodka for more than double that time (vodka, lime and soda was a millennial mainstay), but I only really started to appreciate it after trying Alessandro Palazzi’s famed martinis at Dukes Bar in Mayfair, London. After quizzing him on how he made them taste so good (freeze the vodka, freeze the glass, do clever things with lemon oil), I promptly sourced his recommendedPotocki vodkaand have been stirring them up since. I use different vodkas depending on my mood, and have tried lots of different styles over the years.So, to test the 30-odd vodkas that crossed my desk for this article, I first made a (teeny weeny) martini. A sniff of vermouth and a twist of lemon is all I used to pep them up, and I tried them neat and unchilled. We all know that the super-premiumBelvederesof this world taste great – at a price – but here I’ve tried to focus on a range of styles at a sensible price, and sourced from small-scale distilleries where possible. I wanted to include bottles from a variety of countries while still championing UK producers and any planet-friendly options.Whether you like yours long with tonic or in a bloody mary, or a cosmo a la Carrie Bradshaw, vodka is a versatile and essential ingredient in your cocktail cabinet. Here are my favourites.The best vodkas in 2025View image in fullscreenA classic comeback: the simple, straightforward martini is having a renaissance.Photograph: Zeferli/Getty ImagesBest sustainable vodka:Sapling raspberry vodka with hibiscusView image in fullscreen£35 at Fenwick£35.32 at Master of MaltI don’t have a sweet tooth, but I’ll make an exception for this raspberry and hibiscus vodka from sustainable vodka brand Sapling (which makes a gin now, too). The B Corp-certified brand prides itself on being climate-positive, removing more carbon than it produces. The vodka itself is distilled four times, giving a beautifully sweet cleanness, and the addition of “wonky” raspberries, like the kind rejected by supermarkets, provides a juicy, jammy freshness. Further floral fruitiness comes through from a touch of hibiscus essence. Wonderful with soda, spectacular in an extra-fruity cosmo. Sapling plants a tree for every bottle sold, too.‘The whole thing tastes like gherkins!’ Are vegetable martinis really the drink of the summer?Read moreBest flavoured vodka:Ramsbury hot honey vodkaView image in fullscreen£33 at RamsburyEach of the Ramsbury vodkas I tried impressed, but this on-trend hot honey variety blew me away. Many aspects of the vodka originate from the Wiltshire estate: honey from the hives, winter wheat from its fields, water from a pure chalk aquifer, then distilled on-site in copper stills. The natural honey sweetness is incredibly delicious and moreish, while gentle chilli warmth adds an up-to-date edge. I enjoyed sipping this, but it would be foolish not to entertain the brand’s recipe for hot honey picante – shaking a double shot up with 25ml fresh lime, 20ml more honey (if you like) and a few sprigs of fresh coriander with ice; garnish with a slice of chilli and pretend it’s summer again.Best potato vodka:Chopin potato vodkaView image in fullscreen£32.75 at the Whisky Exchange£32.75 at AmazonPotato vodkas are the way to go if you’re looking for creaminess, and this is one of the best examples: we’re talking earthy, smooth, mashed potato here. Family-owned Chopin is made at a countryside distillery where vodka has been made in the Polish tradition for almost 130 years, so it makes sense to enjoy this vodka in the same Polish tradition: neat. Paired with rich, hearty food, a chilled shot or two of Chopin potato vodka opens up with further creamy, full-bodied starch, plus a nice nuttiness for good measure. It’s also dreamy in a dirty martini and has currently overtaken Potocki as my preferred Polish vodka.Best vodka for a martini:Jo Vodka 101 the PuristView image in fullscreen£49.99 at Jo VodkaJo Malone has taken her gift ofsynaesthesiaand decades of fragrance creation and pivoted to spirits – and why not? Her collection of three signature vodkas is made using British wheat in collaboration with master distiller Joanne Moore (creator of Bloom gin, Opihr and others), and each is designed to capture a “scene”. 101 the Purist has been created for uncomplicated, clean freshness, which Malone associates with crunching through snow. On tasting, this description feels too simplistic; this is an icily pure vodka, with crisp, shattering dryness and refreshing clarity without an overtly identifiable flavour note. This is what you think vodka should taste like, but never actually does. It would be criminal to drink this with any mixer – martinis only, and hold the vermouth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The spring water is extremely soft and low in minerals, which the brand says accounts for the smooth taste across its spirits (currently gin and vodka). It is smooth, with absolutely no unpleasant alcohol bite. What makes this vodka so delicious, however, is the discernible, almost malty grain flavour – a yeasty spice with toasty flavours and pepper emerging from the mash of barley and wheat that has undergone an unusual two-stage fermentation. This vodka won gold at the 2024 San Francisco WorldSpiritsCompetition and is delightful alone, but also shines with tonic.Best Ukrainian vodka:Nemiroff De Luxe vodkaView image in fullscreen£20.95 at the Whisky Exchange£20.11 at AmazonNemiroff has been produced on the same historic site for 150 years – continuing through Ukraine’s geopolitical challenges – and remains one of the country’s bestselling vodka brands. Nemiroff is a boldly authentic vodka with bags of flavour. Using 100% Ukrainian winter wheat blended with water drawn from underground springs, the spirit is refined through an 11-stage filtration process using charcoal, silver and platinum. The result is this robustly herbal, zesty vodka with natural notes of coriander seed and grassy green apples. It’s just asking to go into a mule – ginger beer, lime, fresh mint – otherwise drink neat over ice with a side of pickles like the locals.Best wheat-based vodka:Altamura vodkaView image in fullscreen£36.25 at the Whisky Exchange£38.68 at Master of MaltThere are several wheat-based vodkas on this list, but Altamura from Puglia, Italy, is significant. It’s an ancient variety of durum wheat that’s also used to make the region’s PDO-certified sourdough – and now this “terroir-driven” vodka. Using 100% Altamura grain distilled in small batches, this is a layered, silky vodka that has made its way on to the menus of many luxury bars (the Dorchester, Nightjar, the Corinthia) since its UK launch two years ago. Taste-wise, it’s soft and smooth with creamy lemon flavours and restrained sweetness. I found it lovely with a lemon twist or replacing gin in a French 75.Best zero-waste vodka:Discarded Spirits grape skin chardonnay vodkaView image in fullscreen£36.99 at Selfridges£27.95 at AmazonRepurposing ingredients discarded by the coffee, wine and whisky industries, Discarded Spirits’ mission is to “reverse waste”. Its zero-waste vodka uses recovered leftover grape skins combined with the alcohol produced from chardonnay wine de-alcoholisation. It makes for an innovative take on the spirit, with fruit-forward wine-adjacent flavours in spades. Before you say you don’t like chardonnay: chablis is made from chardonnay, and it’s one of the main three grapes used in champagne-making. Apples, almonds and brioche are all very much present in this triumph of a vodka, with plenty of tropical and slightly mineral flavours, too. If a vodka martini isn’t your thing normally, do try it with this (the wine flavour negates the need for vermouth in my opinion) or drink it with soda or tonic.Best sugarcane vodka:Independent Distillers (Barbados) Spitfire vodkaView image in fullscreen£42 at English SpiritAnd now for something different: a Bajan vodka. Spitfire vodka is crafted from Barbadian sugarcane, of which 28 hectares (70 acres) surrounds the Kendall Hill signal station – home to the first new distillery to open in nearly three decades on an island best known for its rum. Using copper pot and column stills, each batch is handmade and carefully distilled with the aim of an end product to enjoy neat. Indeed, Spitfire vodka is deliciously sweet and rich, with a silky mouthfeel that is pleasantly warming on its own, but its natural lush sweetness makes for a great espresso martini, too.For more, read the Filter’s guides to:The best gins for G&Ts, martinis and negronis10 refreshing alternatives to Aperol spritzThe best low- and no-alcohol drinksJoanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Right up until the moment when their leaves start to fall off, that is, and you’re left with the annoying autumnal job of clearing up.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Traditionally, we’d just use a rake for this job, and perhaps a good pair ofleaf grabbersto help transfer them to the compost or a recycling bag (see below for our gardening expert Matt Collins’ advice on what to do with your leaves afterwards). If your leaf drop isn’t particularly heavy, these remain perfectly adequate tools for the job.If you have more leaves to clear than time in your life, however, help is at hand. Wave these 10 cordless blowers in the vicinity of your leaves and they’ll lift and blow them into piles, significantly reducing all that raking. Some of them also convert into garden vacuums, which can suck as well as blow, drawing your leaves into a handy collection bag ready to turn into precious mulch.At a glanceBest leaf blower overall:Milwaukee M18 Fuel Blower FBLG3-802Body only, £134.98 at ToolstationBest garden vacuum overall:Stihl SHA 56£339 at Just LawnmowersBest budget leaf blower:Worx 20V PowerShare Cordless LeafJet Blower WG543E£99.99 at AmazonBestcombined leaf blower/garden vacuum:Einhell Venturro 36/240£195.95 at Tooled UpBest leaf blower for small gardens:Bosch Universal Leaf Blower 18V-130£107.87 at AmazonWhy you should trust meLeaf blowers and garden vacuums are the latest in a line of outdoor tools that I’ve reviewed for the Filter, after my pieces onelectric lawnmowersandpressure washers. I’ve been reviewing labour-saving gardening tools for five years, and have been a professional product reviewer in other sectors (mainly technology) for more than three decades.My garden isn’t particularly large, but it’s surrounded by a beech hedge and mature trees that mostly belong to my neighbours, but seem prone to dropping their leaves on my side of the fence. As a result, I do more than my fair share of collecting and picking up leaves and hedge trimmings.In the past I’ve relied on rakes, leaf grabbers, shredders and reluctant (but short on cash) teenage family members to tidy leaves and branches, but as my nest empties and my enthusiasm for manual labour wanes, I’m ready to reduce the effort and go electric.How I testedView image in fullscreenAndy puts the Milwaukee M18 Fuel Blower through its paces.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianThe first problem I encountered during testing was a distinct absence of leaves. I requested the 10 leaf blowers and garden vacuums from their manufacturers towards the end of the summer, but at the time, all leaves were still on trees. I was considering going through the recycling and tearing up scrap paper, raiding my local beech woods (because beech leaves appear to last for ever), and asking neighbours to save their hedge trimmings.In the meantime, I tested the batteries by timing how long each device could run for, both at full power and at a lower power. I used an air speed of about 45mph (measured with an anemometer) as a minimum for the low setting, as some of the variable blowers can be set so low that they’d struggle to budge the lightest of leaves.In the end, autumn came a bit early for the horse chestnuts on a nearby avenue, so I collected a good haul of their leaves in a large garden sack. From there, it was plain sailing. For each blower, I used a 14-litre builders’ bucket full of leaves, tipped out in front of a wooden marker. I took a few steps back and with the blower set to full power, I approached the marker, pointing the wind blast at the leaves.When the end of the funnel arrived at the mark, I measured how far the farthest leaf was blown, but also how large the clear area (in the centre of the spread of leaves) was, measuring the distance and the width of the cleared area.View image in fullscreenTesting leaf-blowing distance.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIf the blower also had a garden vacuum mode, I used that to clear up the mess afterwards, noting how well it performed the job and inspecting the contents of the collection bag to see how well the leaves were chopped. I also measured how noisy the blowers were at head height when being used, using the Decibel X app on my phone.Most of the devices I’ve tested were supplied by the manufacturers on a loan basis and will be returned when testing is concluded. Any that aren’t will be donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best leaf blowers and garden vacuums in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBestleaf blower overall:Milwaukee M18 Fuel Blower FBLG3-802View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£563.99 at Data PowertoolsBody only, £134.98 at ToolstationMilwaukee is best known as a trade brand rather than a consumer name, but it’s worth seeking out this powerful, long-lasting blower if you have a lot of leaves to tidy.Why we love itThe Milwaukee M18 Fuel Blower only takes a single 18V battery, but you can buy it with two long-lasting 8Ah units – enough to keep it blowing for more than an hour, or more than 24 minutes on full blast.It has a simple dual-control system, so you use either a variable trigger, which produces more power the harder you pull it, or a slider that locks the trigger in a particular place. Pull the trigger hard, and the force of air that comes out of the blower will cause the end to leap about – it’s that powerful. That’s partly because it’s also remarkably light, so I didn’t need to keep putting it down to rest my arms.In my tests, the Milwaukee blew leaves further than any other, with the most distant moving 3.4 metres into the distance. More importantly, the clear area created in front of the blower measured 100cm wide and 170cm deep, also the best performance in this group test.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive. Note that the two 8Ah batteries that come in the kit cost more than £200 each if bought separately, however, which makes the kit look like better value for money.Type:leaf blowerAirflow volume:852m3/hAirflow speed:120mphWeight:3.3kgNumber of speeds:variableTested noise:98.5dBTested battery life (full/low power):12mins 40secs/35mins 58secsBestgarden vacuum overall:Stihl SHA 56View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£339 at Just LawnmowersBlowing leaves into piles is all well and good, but if you don’t want to bend down and pick them up, you need a garden vacuum to suck them into a collection bag. The Stihl SHA 56 can do it all, with both blowing and vacuuming functions in one.Why we love itWhile most of the multifunctional devices I tested aren’t as good at blowing as the dedicated models, the Stihl SHA 56 was the best. It created a clear space measuring 120cm long and 80cm wide. It also pushed leaves the farthest, with the most distant transported 3.3 metres away.It takes a bit of converting to get from blower to vacuum; you can’t just flip from one job to another at the flick of a switch. Instead, you have to remove and replace various bits and rotate the handle through 180 degrees.In vacuum mode, its suck feels less powerful than its blow, and I had to keep the nozzle close to the ground to capture the leaves. It comes with a comfy padded shoulder strap, though, to make it easier to hold in position, and a good-sized 40-litre collection bag.It’s a shame that …operation is a bit fiddly, with a three-way switch and a variable trigger that can’t be locked into a particular position, so I could only test the battery at full power.Type:leaf blower and garden vacuumAirflow volume:560m3/hAirflow speed:136mphWeight:5.7kgNumber of speeds:variableTested noise at head height:90dBCollection bag size:40 litresTested battery life (full/low power):39mins 20secs/unable to testBest budget leaf blower:Worx 20V PowerShare Cordless LeafJet Blower WG543EView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£99.99 at B&Q£99.99 at AmazonThe Worx WG543E is an affordable magic wand that you can wave in front of your garden’s scattered leaves to blow them into more organised mounds for easy collection.Why we love itIt’s the easiest of the leaf blowers I’ve reviewed in this test, with a very simple dual-power setting. A rolling switch under the thumb lets you choose between its three settings – off, on and boost.This isn’t the cheapest leaf blower I tested – that honour goes to the Titan – but it’s terrific value for money. At full power, it blew a 110 x 65cm hole into the middle of my leaf pile, and pushed some of the leaves a distance of 2.2 metres.In use, the handle is comfortable to hold and the whole unit is light and easy to wave around, with the weight of the battery counterbalancing the comparatively light motor. The battery life is reasonable too, lasting 25mins 45secs on its standard setting, or 15mins 46secs when switched up to full blast.It’s a shame that …at 2hrs 10mins, the battery takes quite a long time to charge, so those with more leaves to blow may want to invest in a second battery.Type:leaf blowerAirflow volume:696m3/hAirflow speed:130mphWeight:1.7kgNumber of speeds:twoTested noise:96dBTested battery life (full/low power):15mins 46secs/25mins 45secsBestcombined leaf blower/garden vacuum:Einhell Venturro 36/240View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£195.95 at Tooled UpBody only, £119 at B&QThe Einhell Venturro 36/240 isn’t quite the cheapest combination leaf blower and garden vacuum that I tested, but if this is a garden chore that you don’t want to spend a fortune on, it’s a sensible choice.Why we love itEyeballing the Venturro in a shop, you’d be hard pressed to work out why it’s available at such a reasonable price. It has the largest collection bag at 45 litres, and it has a handy window in it so you can see it filling up.Out in the garden, its limitations started to show next to more expensive models, though it still did the job. It blew a 140 x 55cm hole in my leaf pile test, with the farthest blown leaf reaching 2.7 metres. That doesn’t match the width of the Stihl, so you’ll spend more time covering the same ground, but it’s a great effort for the price.It’s a shame that …we had to keep it on full blast to get much done with it. That limited the battery life to 17mins 53secs during testing, using the two 4Ah batteries supplied.Type:leaf blower and garden vacuumAirflow volume:740m3/hAirflow speed:149mphWeight:5.3kgNumber of speeds:fiveTested noise:94dBCollection bag size:45 litresTested battery life (full power/low power):51mins 17secs/17mins 53secsBest leaf blower for small gardens:Bosch Universal Leaf Blower 18V-130View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£115.95 at Tooled Up£107.87 at AmazonMost of the leaf blowers I tested are large, making them cumbersome to hold and difficult to store. Bosch’s compact Universal Leaf Blower 18V-130 challenges this, being small and easy to use, and still providing enough power to clear a small garden of leaves.Why we love itThere’s nothing fancy about this device, which has a long, narrow blower tube attached to a small motor unit. It takes a single 18V battery that’s compatible with thePower For All Alliance system, which makes it interchangeable with a selection of other 18V power tools from Bosch and a handful of other brands, including Flymo, Gardena and Husqvarna. The blower is easy to operate with a choice of two power settings. At low power, the battery took 22mins 18secs to drain, while at full power it lasted 14 minutes.At full blast, the Bosch cleared a 95 x 30cm hole in my leaf pile, blowing the most distant leaves 2.3 metres forward. That makes it the weakest of the dedicated blowers I tested, but it’s still very capable of pushing leaves around.Usefully, the package also comes with a set of inflation nozzles to blow up balls, paddling pools and rubber dinghies, so you can put the blower to use even when there are no leaves to blow. Storage is also straightforward, with the device packing down small enough to store in a small carrier bag or tuck away in a cupboard.It’s a shame that …it’s only a little bit cheaper than the Worx LeafJet, which does a better job of blowing leaves around. The Worx isn’t as small and compact for off-season storage, however.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

If you can afford that increase, it’s good value for money.It’s a bit more of a faff to convert from a blower to a vacuum, as you have to switch tubes and attach the bag, but it performed strongly, pushing leaves up to 3.2 metres away. It vacuumed leaves well and shreds them as it goes – the horse chestnut leaves I tested it on ended up a mixture of dust and larger pieces.It didn’t make the final cut because …competition proved tight. It’s not as powerful as the best and not as affordable as the cheapest.Type:leaf blower and garden vacuum;airflow volume:575m3/h;airflow speed:208mph;weight:5.3kg;number of speeds:two;tested noise:95dB;collection bag size:35 litres;tested battery life (full/low power):39mins 23secs/17mins 17secsMakita Blower LXT DUB187View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBody only, £132.95 at Alan Wadkins Tool StoreBest for:easy switching between functionsThis Makita blower was the weakest blower of the lot. However, it still managed to shift leaves around, and did a good job of collecting them when I’d finished the blowing tests.It has the smallest leaf collection bag of this group at just 25 litres, which is a bit on the small side and means you’ll need to empty it more often. Still, I liked the fact that there’s no conversion necessary when switching between blowing and vacuuming – just a large lever on the side that you shift from one position to the other.It didn’t make the final cut because …it proved less powerful in blowing tests than the other combination blowers and garden vacuums.Type:leaf blower and garden vacuum;airflow volume:252m3/h;airflow speed:143mph;weight:4kg;number of speeds:variable;tested noise:88dB;collection bag size:25 litres;tested battery life (full/low power):27mins 23secs/11mins 29secsEgo LB6704EView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£419 at Just LawnmowersBest for:long-lasting batteryThe EgoLB6704E is aimed at pro gardeners, but anyone with a lot of leaves will appreciate the huge 56V, 5Ah battery. It occupies the entire back end of the blower under the handle, and provided the device with enough power to last 20 minutes on full blast during my tests, and almost two hours with the power dialled down.The downside is the noise (98dB, which was the loudest I tested) and the weight. At 4.4kg, it’s the heaviest model that didn’t include a shoulder strap in the box, though there is a clip for a strap on its left-hand side, and you can buy one as an optional accessory. I tried the shoulder straps provided by other manufacturers (Ego shoulder strapsare an optional extra), and it worked with them all.It didn’t make the final cut because …it matched the lighter Milwaukee blower for blowing performance and can outlast it, but it’s heavier and more cumbersome to use.Type:leaf blower;airflow volume:1,138m3/h;airflow speed:159mph;weight:4.4kg;number of speeds:variable;tested noise:98.5dB;tested battery life (full/low power):1hr 56mins 16secs/20mins 3secsFlymo 18V EasiBlowVacView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£229 at AOBody only, £159.99 at AmazonBest for:a shared battery systemThe Flymo 18V EasiBlowVac doesn’t need any converting to transition between use as a leaf blower and a garden vacuum, so you can easily switch to clearing leaves while you’re still tidying with the blower. It operates reasonably well in either mode, although I had to use the higher power settings to get much blowing done.This isn’t ideal because the battery life was the weakest when turned right up, lasting only 10mins 45secs at full power. It lasted a more reasonable 34mins 48secs on its most economical setting, though that’s only good enough for light dry leaves.A good thing about the battery is that Flymo uses the 18VPower for All Alliance system, meaning it’s interchangeable with other 18V tools, such as drills, screwdrivers, shearers, grass trimmers, hedge cutters and pressure washers, from Flymo, Bosch, Gardena and Husqvarna.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s reasonably priced for what you get, but the Einhell outperformed it for only a few more pounds.Type:leaf blower and garden vacuum;airflow volume:not supplied;airflow speed:155mph;weight:4.2kg;number of speeds:four;tested noise at head height:86dB;collection bag size:30 litres;tested battery life (full/low power):34mins 48secs/10mins 45secsTitan TTI931BVC 18V TXP cordless blowerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£79.99 at ScrewfixBest for:lowest priceIf you’re tempted by a leaf blower but suspect it won’t see a lot of action, you can save some money by opting for the Titan TTI931BVC. This Screwfix brand pulls the blower back to its bare essentials, including a 2Ah battery that lasted only about 15 minutes in my tests. It managed a decent-sized hole in my pile of leaves, measuring 120 x 60cm, but it only launched them a distance of 2.4 metres.Operation is kept simple, too, with a trigger to control the blower’s variable speed and a locking switch to keep it in a place of your choosing.It didn’t make the final cut because …although it might be good enough for a casual user, spending a bit more will get you more power and a longer use time.Type:leaf blower;airflow volume:492m3/h;airflow speed:67mph;weight:2.2kg;number of speeds:variable;tested noise:89dB;tested battery life (full/low power):15mins 37secs/12mins 13secsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenGarden vacuums make short work of sucking leaves off the ground and collecting them in a bag.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianWhat should I look for in a leaf blower?The two key specs are the air speed and the air volume. Air speed is measured in miles per hour (mph) and is indicative of how much power the blower can muster; a higher number will help you punch through harder tasks, such as piles of wet leaves. The air volume is how much air the device pushes out. A higher number here means a leaf blower should be able to cover more ground more quickly.All the leaf blowers I tested are battery-operated, but there are also leaf blowers that plug into the mains with a cable. You have to manage the cable while blowing leaves and stay within reach of the mains, but that may not be a problem in a smaller garden. The benefit is that it will never run out of power.If buying a battery blower with a battery included, take note of its Ah (amp hours) rating. The higher this is, the longer the battery will last.What’s better, a leaf blower or a garden vacuum?It depends. In my tests, I found the leaf blowers to be more powerful. If you just want to move a lot of leaves from one place to another, and don’t mind picking them up when you’ve gathered them into a pile, then a leaf blower will do the job well.However, while you may spend longer blowing with a combination device, it will make comparatively short work of sucking the leaves off the floor and collecting them in a bag. That makes it much easier to empty into your compost or into a larger bag for taking to the tip.Can I convert a leaf blower into a vacuum?Only if it’s designed to do both jobs. Some combination leaf blower and vacuums, such as the Flymo and Makita models I’ve reviewed, convert by simply flipping a switch on the side. Others, such as the Worx and Stihl units, require components to be added or removed to switch between the functions.What should I do with my collected leaves?View image in fullscreenMatt Collins, head gardener at the Garden Museum in London, in his own garden.Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins/The GuardianMatt Collins, gardening expert and head gardener at London’s Garden Museum, writes:In nature’s annual cycle, decomposing leaves are a valuable source of renewal and regeneration. That said, within domestic gardens, leaves do not always fall where they’re wanted: they clog drains, cover lawns and can make hard surfaces slippery – ample cause to reach for a leaf blower or garden vacuum. However, once gathered, fallen leaves needn’t be disposed of: here are five ways of putting them to effective use, for the benefit of your garden, its plants and its resident wildlife.Tree and border mulchingBy either raking gathered leaves or blowing them directly into a circle around a tree trunk, you’ll provide that tree with a nutritious, nurturing and water-retentive mulch. Similarly, leaves – particularly lighter-weight species such as beech, birch, oak and cherry – can be spread by hand through herbaceous plantings to the same end.Make leaf mouldAs a soil conditioner, mulch or potting compost additive, homemade leaf mould is useful and surprisingly easy to produce. Pack your leaves into a polythene bag (preferably one being reused), dampen with water, and tie off the bag. Puncture with holes for airflow and place it somewhere out of the way. In one to two years you’ll have wonderfully crumbly, lightweight leaf mould.Shred and add to the lawnLeaves left lying on top of a lawn can lead to patchy dieback, but when finely shredded and lightly distributed as a top-dressing, they can actually feed the grass as they break down. Use alawnmoweron a mid- to high-level setting to mow over a light volume of leaves (either while cutting the grass in autumn or specifically for this purpose), and distribute the clippings afterwards with alawn rake.Add straight to the compost binThe best homemade compost is produced by mixing “browns” (small twigs, wood chippings, cardboard, etc) and “greens” (grass, vegetable and green plant clippings). Dry, fallen leaves are an excellent form of brown material, breaking down slowly when added to amodularorclosed-lid composter. Thicker leaves are best shredded first.For more ways to give your outdoor space a glow up:The best pressure washers, testedExpert tips to get your garden ready for autumnHow to create a more eco-friendly lawnAndy Shaw is a consumer and technology journalist who has reviewed tech, home and garden gadgets professionally for more than 30 years.

But is it just hype?Morwenna FerrierFri 17 Oct 2025 07.04 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 13.11 EDTShareWhen the presenter Jesse Burgess goes to a restaurant, the kitchen always sends him dishes he didn’t order. One of the ironies of fame is that the more you can afford, the less you have to pay for it. Except that Burgess isn’t a celebrity, he says. “I’m just a guy who really likes food.”Burgess is the 34-year-old host of Topjaw, a small but mighty internet platform featuring chefs and foodies, whose “Best of” series, for better or worse, has changed the way Londoners – and those beyond – eat out. The Topjaw channel has been around since 2015 but Burgess started the viral series in 2023 with his friend Will Warr, who is also Prince and Princess of Wales’s videographer (he made Kate’s cancer statementvideo). It has now grown to more than a million followers.The series’ premise is simple. In a snappy 90 seconds, Burgess asks influential food industry types for their favourite places to eat, drink or get drunk. Having featured a mix of influential chefs, critics and celebrities including Gordon Ramsay, Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh, the quick-fire formula – best coffee inLondon? Best Sunday lunch? Best burger? – shares some DNA with the “man on the street” interview, in which someone holding a microphone stops people to ask them about their relationship, or their outfit.View image in fullscreenJesse Burgess at an event hosted by Gordon Ramsay at his Lucky Cat restaurant in London this month.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Studio RamsayBeyond his Instagram followers, Burgess is an unknown entity. But if you’re a chef who has appeared on his show or seen your restaurant recommended on it? “It’s a hugely important platform,” says Oisín Rogers, who owns the Devonshire, a central London pub famed for its food and Guinness, and who has appeared on Topjaw several times.With his Rembrandt curls, square jaw and wry sense of humour, Burgess’s appeal is obvious, and the content he makes is informative and wholesome. It’s been so successful that Burgess and Warr have taken the format beyond London, to Cornwall, Paris and New York, while Burgess has started fronting a new behind-the-pass TV series, Knife Edge: Chasing Michelin Stars, on Apple TV.But Topjaw has also become something of a target for some who find its format infantilising. One restaurant industry insider said: “It’s lowest common denominator content, which is the stuff that absolutely slaps but what else does it do?” Another describes it as: “One dimensional but highly addictive.” As culture becomes increasingly atomised online, they argue, it’s predicated on “chasing the zeitgeist”, which has the effect of creating hype where perhaps there isn’t any, a phenomenon that the writer Gabrielle Bluestone describes as “Schrödinger’s catfish” in her book Hype.“Does Topjaw drive customers? Certainly,” says Rogers. “You know if someone’s come because of Giles Coren or Grace Dent or Topjaw because they’ll often tell you.”“It’s not just hype though,” he adds. “There is an element of zeitgeist but asking people who are influential or good at restaurants is just a simple idea: it’s about weaponising opinion. [Topjaw has] no skin in the game so when you trust the person recommending it, and you do when it’s from the horse’s mouth, that information is invaluable.”View image in fullscreenTopjaw has featured some of the country’s biggest stars, including Florence Pugh.Photograph: TopJawAt a time when choosing where to eat out can feel overwhelming, the power of influencers grows ever stronger. In spring, the government introduced a new law banning “fake reviews” or “concealed incentives” aimed at influencers (and other beneficiaries) attempting to conceal or omit if they’ve been paid to promote something. Just as restaurant critics usually pay for the meal they critique, Burgess says he and Topjaw “never have and never will be paid by any restaurant we feature or speak about so as to not skew the authenticity of our recommendations”. That said, he also thinks consumers have reached a point where even though they are wise to paid content, they don’t care.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Rather he is one of a new breed of gatekeepers through which people in the know can impart the sort of approval that can make or break a place.“Restaurant critics are a different channel,” says Rogers. “They are incredibly important, and they set the base for what people look for in restaurants. But you just need to look at the reach of a [Topjaw] clip to see how influential it is.”Indeed the Topjaw effect is tangible.Restaurantssuch as Akub, Kudu, the Seed Library and Fonda are among those that say they have experienced noticeable demand after appearing in videos. According to one restaurant PR, a positive review on Topjaw can bring several hundred new bookings.On the other hand, one of the most popular questions is the most overrated spot, of which Mayfair’s Sexy Fish, the former tick-box It restaurant with an onyx exterior and a carb-lite menu, is one of the most namechecked. “It seems to represent a group of restaurants where diners are there to ‘be seen’ rather than for the food offering,” Burgess says. “Londoners have a general disdain for that type of establishment.”The Guardian approached Sexy Fish for comment.Surely the only real beneficiary of Topjaw’s screengrab content is consumerism? Rogers disagrees: “Asking where to get a decent pint? That’s just a really good, simple question.”Jesse Burgess’s top London picksBest restaurant:Camille in Borough.Best coffee:Bar Italia.Best pub:I bounce enthusiastically between the George in Fitzrovia and the Coach & Horses in Soho.Place I’d travel for:Janda Dinerin Peckham.Best of all time:Ynyshir in Wales.

Put the lingonberry juice, sugar and lemon verbena in a small saucepan, heat gently to 70C, then leave to cook at that temperature for 10 minutes, until all the sugar dissolves. Take off the heat, leave to cool and infuse, then strain into a clean bottle or jar, seal and store in the fridge; it will keep happily for a good two to three weeks (mixed with cold soda water, it also makes a great non-alcoholic spritz).To build the drink, measure all the liquids into a shaker, add a decent handful of ice and shake hard.

Despite my best efforts to get through them, a couple of well-ripened, black-skinned bananas in the fruit bowl is an all too common sight. Banana bread feels the obvious choice, but sometimes you just don’t have the time or enough people to share it with. A quicker option that I like to make at weekends is french toast, though I tend to lean into the Hong Kong-style in which the slices of bread are stuffed with peanut butter and drizzled generously with condensed milk and butter. Delightful stuff.Peanut butter and banana french toastPrep5 minCook20 minServes22 large eggs60ml milk1 tsp vanilla extract½ tbsp brown sugar2 tbsp smooth peanut butter4 slices brioche2 small ripe bananas, peeled and sliced30g salted butter, plus extra to serve1 tbsp oilCondensed milk, to servePut the eggs, milk, vanilla and brown sugar in a shallow bowl and whisk to combine.Spread the peanut butter over one side of two of the brioche slices, top with the sliced banana, then sandwich with the other two slices of brioche. Carefully dip the sandwiches into the egg mixture, making sure to coat them all over.Put the butter and oil in a large pan on a medium heat. Once it’s melted, lay each sandwich in the pan, leave to cook for two to three minutes, then flip and repeat on the other side. Using tongs, hold the sandwich on all its edges so they also brown and crisp up.Put the french toasts on plates and, while they’re still warm, drizzle with condensed milk and some extra butter.

Only 0.9% of models were plus-size, also known as curve (UK 18+), while 2% were mid-size (UK 10-16).View image in fullscreenAshley Graham on the Nina Ricci spring/summer 2026 catwalk; she walked in just three shows this season.Photograph: Paolo Caponetto Paolocapo.net/Nina Ricci SS26In the Milan shows, just four out of 55 brands included a model who was not straight-size. Elektra Kotsoni, the deputy editorial director of Vogue Business, said it was the lowest proportion since her team started compilingthe biannual reporttwo and half years ago. She describes the outlook as “horrible”.Anna Shillinglaw, the founder of the model agency Milk Management, says she isn’t surprised. “Previously, the body positivity movement was growing with curve models doing the same shows and shoots as straight-sized models. But recently there has been a massive decline. The industry has literally done a 360 turn.”The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic isa contributing factor, with their use proliferating among celebrities and thinness now being normalised beyond the catwalks.Although GLP-1s were originally developed to treat diabetes, they have quickly been co-opted for weight loss, leading toshortagesfor patients. In the UKabout 1.5 million peopleare thought to be buying them through private prescriptions. There is also agrowing parallel marketonline. The psychotherapist and writerSusie Orbachdescribes the trend as “the latest commercialisation of the body”.Elsewhere, there is growing demand for body modification procedures – including“Barbie waist” surgery, in which a person’s ribs are inflicted with tiny fractures in order to reduce their size.“We are manufacturing bodies as though they are a product rather than living from them,” Orbach says, pointing to the influence of reality TV. “The Kardashians are an exemplar of that but it is now being massified.”‘Ozempic arrived and everything changed’: plus-size models on the body positivity backlashRead moreWhile thin models have always commanded the catwalks, in recent years there has been a shift, albeit slight, towards more inclusive casting. In 2023 British Vogue put the plus-size modelsPaloma Elsesser, Precious Lee and Jill Kortleveon a coverdescribing them as “the new Supers”. From campaigns to catwalks the trio were omnipresent.Felicity Hayward, a plus-size model and writer who has fronted a Mac cosmetics campaign and starred on the cover of i-D, describes the period from 2011 to 2017 as a “golden era”. Now the downward trajectory has left her wondering if plus-size models are “used as tokenism in order to make press headlines”.This season Lee walked in one show, Kortleve in two and Elsesser in five. Ashley Graham, who wasone of the highest-earning models of 2017, walked in three.View image in fullscreenJill Kortleve on the Coperni spring/summer 2026 catwalk.Photograph: Luca Tombolini/Coperni/ Collective ParadeAs demand declines, insiders describe plus-size models losing weight in an attempt to secure more work in the mid-size market. Straight-size models are also feeling pressure as sample sizes shrink. Shillinglaw says it is unfair to blame models for promoting a thin ideal. “The models aren’t making the samples. The pressure comes from the designers and those at the top of the brands.”As thependulum swings backtowards skinny, it is having a knock-on effect on the high street. In August the chief executive of the UK Advertising Standards Authorityurged advertisersto avoid using “irresponsible” images of unhealthily thin-looking models after an increase in complaints from the public about the size of models portrayed in adverts from brands includingM&SandNext.The value of the plus-size market in the UK is estimated to beover £4bnbut it is becoming more inaccessible to consumers. Brands such as H&M, which caters up to a UK 34, and River Island, which runs up to a UK 22, have removed dedicated plus-size sections from their stores and made the ranges available online only. Shillinglaw says brands that were shooting on curve models five days a week have now reduced those shoots to two days.Hayward mentions the designer Rick Owens, who shows atParis fashion week, as an example of tokenism. Last season he included 16 plus-size models in his show; this season he used none.“It really upsets me,” says Hayward, “seeing a credible designer go from using big girls with stomachs and broad shoulders, not just stereotypical hourglass curves, to casting not even one. If you are going to be progressive you need to continue with progression. Otherwise, why bother?”Explore more on these topicsModelsMagazinesAdvertisingFashion industryBody imageMilan fashion weekParis fashion weeknewsShareReuse this content"

My wife and I bought our passes for all of Europe (under £500 for one-month unlimited rail trips) and it was great to rediscover the sense of freedom and adventure travelling by train gave. Having a romantic dinner in Paris, getting on the night train and having coffee and croissants for breakfast in Nice on the Côte d’Azur for example. I corrected the teenage mistake of trying to do too much and see too many places so we lingered longer in places such as Poland and Romania, soaking up the atmosphere in Wrocław and Bucharest. It was interesting to compare the speed, quality and comfort of train services too. We found that sometimes slow travel was better – like when we got on the wrong train from Rome to Naples, allowing us to appreciate the scenery, locals and way of life of people who were not in a hurry. The trip was a learning experience at 61 as much as it had been at 16.PeterFlight and fancy-free, cycling from Saint-Malo to NiceView image in fullscreenKaren and Andrew on their trip.In pursuit of a flight-free adventure, we packed our bikes (and several panniers) on to the Eurostar for a three-week cycling trip across France. Our initial worries about sore legs and flat tyres quickly faded away as we pedalled along comfortable cycle lanes in the picturesque French countryside, fuelled by village boulangeries and cold local beer. We covered 1,040 miles from Saint-Malo to Nice via the Dordogne, staying in B&Bs or rented apartments each night (from £100 per night). Highlights included stops for refreshing swims in rivers, avoiding airport chaos, and proving that holidays in your 60s can be active and fun.Karen and AndrewProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

With one eye on my pension settlement and another on the atlas, I dreamed of travelling the world, staying in breathtaking locations with stupendous views. I never realised that the most rewarding stay would be in a tiny cabin in Clyro, Powys. Was it the compact design, the comfortable bed, the picture windows framed by woods and pasture? Partly, but more importantly I learned how little I needed to feel happy and comfortable. In this beautiful woodland setting, within walking distance of a pub and not too far from twee little Hay-on-Wye, I had everything I needed.LindaI went to Japan for the cherry blossom – and saw it at its peakView image in fullscreenCherry blossom in Tokyo.Photograph: Falcon0125/Getty ImagesAt 69, I embarked on an 18-day solo adventure across Japan. My goal was to witness the cherry blossom, and I saw it at its peak. Starting in Osaka, my journey led me through Kyoto, Kobe, Okayama, Kurashiki and finally Tokyo. I wandered through historic gardens unchanged for centuries, admired weeping cherry trees along riverbanks, and watchedsakurareflections dance across still ponds. Every path seemed lined with blossom, and side trips to shrines, temples and castles deepened the sense of timeless wonder.Marilisa FioraniSquabbles and giggles from London to San SebastiánView image in fullscreenSue travels with university friends ‘collected over 54 years’.Five female friends from York to Brighton, collected over 54 years from university, between 74 and 84, do rail trips round Europe. Last year we did London to Paris, staying in La Rochelle, Bordeaux and San Sebastián. We are like an extended marriage, dipping in and out of shared history, politics, and to disagree and insult each other with only temporary hurt. It takes months of planning, each person booking accommodation or part of the rail journey – which is where theMan in Seat 61is so helpful. We are three vegetarians, two meat eaters, four fish eaters, two teetotallers. At an amazing fish restaurant in La Rochelle, one of the two vegetarians asked: “Couldn’t you do us an omelette?” The waiter chased them away rather angrily, but the rest of us had delicious seafood with good wine. In La Rochelle we disagreed over the way to the Airbnb. Running late, we were greeted with applause by the owner’s mother, who had spotted five old ladies with backpacks and wheelie suitcases from many metres away!SueBrittany on two wheels is heavenView image in fullscreenKelvin Atkins explored Brittany by van and bicycle.Earlier this summer, at 64, I used a 22-year-old van conversion as a base for exploring Brittany’s Gulf of Morbihan by bicycle. Pedalling along deserted lanes and canal paths, I discovered picture-book villages and towns, tidal creeks, coastal cliffs and ancient woodlands. I came across dolmens and menhirs, medieval castles and Nazi bunkers, and took ferries to car-free islands with empty beaches and incredible views. I rode to creperies for lunch and restaurants for dinner, ate like a king and slept like a baby. For a 64-year-old on two wheels, Brittany is nothing short of heaven.Kelvin Atkinsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Islamic, Russian colonial and post-independence influences merge in the architecture. A palace, mosques, museums, galleries and caravanserais are jammed together in delightful disarray. One highlight is theMaiden Tower, certainly 12th century and possibly once a Zoroastrian fire temple. ThePhilharmonic Garden, just beyond the wall, provides a calming green space.

But when you’re a pampered, weak-bladdered 65-year-old, yurt camps with outdoor toilets and shared facilities in family homes were not within my comfort zone. Crossing into countries with difficult neighbouring relationships proved time-consuming, with Turkmenistan, one of the world’s least visited countries, involving copious paperwork, expensive visas and, in June 2024, a Covid test. There was no ideal time to visit, and temperatures ranged from 40C to -10C at night. However, stunning scenery, friendly people and ubiquitousplov(a rice-based pilaf), meant I not only survived the trip but thoroughly loved it.Helen JacksonA trek to a holy valley in NepalView image in fullscreenMichael Wilson travelled to the Tsum valley by eight-hour minibus journey.In 2017, aged 69 and with friends, I took an eight-hour minibus journey from Kathmandu then walked for four days to get to the Tsum valley, a remote Himalayan valleyclose to the Nepalese border with Tibet. The path was about 3,000 metres high and was surrounded by the 7,000-metre peaks of the Ganesh Himāl; we found people living without mechanisation, roads, vehicles or wifi. Buddhists regard it as abeyul, a hidden and holy refuge to be discovered when it is feared the planet is approaching destruction and the world has become too corrupt for spiritual practice. It seemed an appropriate place to be, then and now. I planned the journey using Kathmandu-based trekking companyBeyond the Limits.Michael WilsonPedalling through Portugal’s AlentejoView image in fullscreenThe Alentejo and parts of the Algarve are perfect for a leisurely cycle, says our tipster.Photograph: Westend61/AlamyMy friend and I are both in our early 60s and love cycling in Portugal.

My parents had helped out at the very first contest back in 1996 – my mum gave out flyers, my dad sorted the music. Since then, national championships have been held all across the world, with the winners assembling in Oulu every summer.At the time, I asked my parents if I could compete. At first they were hesitant; the event was in a bar, and there would be a lot of adults. They thought it might be an intimidating atmosphere, but I was determined.As a kid, I was always “playing” air guitar, miming along to the biggest rock tunes with my imaginary instrument. My parents were music fans – my dad loved Bruce Springsteen and U2. AC/DC was the first band I discovered on my own. Angus Young, the lead guitarist, was my hero.When I stepped on stage, I did my routine to AC/DC’s Whole Lotta Rosie. The crowd started chanting “Angus”, just like on the live recording, and it hit me: this is what it feels like to be a rock star. I made it to the finals, playing to hundreds of people in Oulu’s market square, and I was hooked. I got the nickname “Little Angus” that day.Then I took a break. I was a judge one year, and opened for the show another time, but I didn’t compete. I went back at 18, tried a few different stage names, but people kept calling me “Little Angus” so I decided to own it and make “The Angus” my stage name. I’ve made it to the final every year since 2022, and in 2023 I came second, so I was determined to win this year.The air guitar community is like a family. Our motto is ‘Make air, not war’. It sounds silly, but it’s a real philosophyThe competition itself is intense but joyful. Contestants have 60 seconds to give everything – explosive energy, perfect mime, rock star charisma – on an invisible guitar. Judges score you on a scale from 4.0 to 6.0. In the case of a tie, there’s an “air-off” between the final two contestants: a song plays and you improvise.Preparation is everything. I chose an Avenged Sevenfold song for my routine. I listened to it on a loop for weeks. I stretched constantly, trying to get my legs loose enough to leap, my fingers fast enough to mimic solos and my back ready for those bends and jumps. By the time competition day came, I could feel the song in my bones.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

We went head-to-head to Sweet Child o’ Mine by Guns N’ Roses. When I heard the song, I felt relieved because it was one that I knew, and more than anything I was so excited to perform one more time. When they announced I’d won, the square erupted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I think I blacked out from shock. Then everyone started singing Neil Young’s Rockin’ in the Free World and lifted me on to their shoulders. Justin Howard – AKA Nordic Thunder – a former champion and one of my closest friends, was hugging me. I cried. I was Finland’s first air guitar world champion in 25 years. The previous Finnish champion, Markus “Black Raven” Vainionpää, was there, too. He gave me the biggest hug and said it was “about damn time”.The air guitar community is like a family. Our motto is “Make air, not war”. It sounds silly, but it’s a real philosophy. People come from all over the world, and everyone is supportive and encouraging. Before you go on stage, every competitor comes and hugs you. Then for 60 seconds you’re allowed to be free, silly, the biggest rock star in the world.I’m also a drummer and guitarist in a band with my brother called the Southgates, named after Gareth Southgate, as we’re influenced by Britpop and new wave. I’ve been bartending for a few years now, and I direct short films and music videos. Winning hasn’t changed my day-to-day life too much but I’ve been doing a lot of press, and I hope it leads to more creative work. Oulu will be a European capital of culture next year, so there are exciting things ahead.For now, I’m just grateful: for the community, for the chance to perform, and for that little kid who picked up a newspaper and thought, “I want to do that.”As told to Emma LoffhagenDo you have an experience to share?

The exact date of the last frost of the year is anyone’s guess, but it’s important to know how to anticipate that first frosty night and how it affects our plants. Understanding which of your plants can withstand temperature drops and which cannot is key to planning what to sow and when.There are two main types of frost: air and ground. An air frost occurs when the temperature of the air drops to or below the freezing point of water (0C or 32F), whereas a ground frost occurs when the temperature of the ground drops that low. Each can happen separately, though they often occur together, and both can damage plants to different degrees.When the water in a plant’s cells is exposed to freezing temperatures, the cell walls can burst, damaging the plant and often causing it to turn black and die. Different plants have different levels of frost tolerance, ranging from tender (for example, tomatoes) to very hardy (eg evergreen trees, such as pines).For many edible plants – from beans to summer lettuces and cucumbers – the first hard frost marks the end of their life. Having said that, I’ve managed to keep a few tender crops going for a couple of extra weeks with the protection of fleece or by moving container-grown plants – such as my cape gooseberries, this season – into sheltered positions.Certain plants can stand up to some frost, including leeks, chard, certain cabbage varieties and kaleThere are a good number of plants that can stand up to some freezing weather, including leeks, chard, certain cabbage varieties and kale – the latter two growing sweeter in winter as cold temperatures prompt them to convert their starch into sugar.Interestingly, there are some spots more liable to freezing than others – commonly known as frost pockets. As cold air is more dense than warm air, it tends to flow downwards, meaning that, in a garden on a slope, say, the very bottom of a growing space will be more vulnerable to early and late frosts than a sheltered spot at a higher point. Avoid planting tender plants in a frost pocket, but if you do, be ready to fleece them on even moderately cold nights.Predicting a frost is a challenge even for meteorologists. They only forecast air temperature, so remember it’s possible for there to be a frost even if that doesn’t get down to 0C. A cold, clear and cloudless night often precedes a plant‑damaging ground frost.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Our writer found some he may hate even more – and others pivotal to his riseHannah Jane ParkinsonFri 17 Oct 2025 12.24 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 12.37 EDTShareIn a turn of events that may surprise some, Donald Trump expressed a few relatable insecurities this week. First he questioned the attractiveness of his beach body, then he blasted Time magazinefor an unflattering cover photo. In fairness, he wasn’t wrong. He called the picture, taken from below, “the worst of all time”. People have focused on the wattle neck, the gossamer hair, the inside of his nostrils.‘The worst of all time’: Trump rails against ‘super bad’ Time magazine coverRead moreThe question he asked of the editorial decision was actually a pertinent one. “What are they doing, and why?” This is the kind of scrutiny that the press should attract, except that media literacy is dying a fast death – and that has a lot to do with Trump himself. Constantly lambasting Pulitzer prize-winning publications as “fake news” and then retweeting Photoshopped images and deep fakes isn’t helping the situation.Here are some past memorable Trump covers – some of which he admired, and others which, in no uncertain terms, he did not.Time, 2024View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Evan Vucci/TimeThis is no doubt a cover much more to the President’s liking. Love him or despise him, it’s undeniable that standing up mere secondsafter a bullet grazes the side of one’s headand yelling “Fight, fight, fight!” is a brave move. Crazy maybe, but brave. The photo of that moment, shot by Evan Vucci, will go down as one of the most significant images in political history.Time and Trump have a turbulent relationship. He famously mocked up covers of himself to hang at four of his golf clubs, which resulted in themagazinewriting to the President to ask him to remove them (and a pilloryingcartoon from The New Yorker). The magazine has issued a number of memorable covers of Trump, including an illustration ofstormyconditions in the Oval Office, and one of his golf cart stuck in a bunker.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: TimeOne of his more recent Time covers was when he was named Person of the Year – a title Trump hasreceived twice. (Although he once claimed he had turned it down, Time magazine denied it in a statement.) Before Trump entered the White House for the first time, he hadonly featured on the cover of the magazine once, in 1989. But in 2017 hefalsely claimedto have been on the cover more times than anybody else. In fact Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan at that time surpassed him.On the second occasion he received his Person of the Year designation, Trumpsaid: “Well, thank you very much. This is an honor, a tremendous honor.” (Up for debate, when previous recipients include Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.) He was pleased too with one Time cover,brandishing it at a rally in Des Moines. “They used to call it the ‘Man of the Year,’ but they can’t do that anymore. They call it ‘Person of the Year.’ It’s the same thing. That’s fine. But look at that – that’s a good-looking cover.”Esquire, 2004View image in fullscreenPhotograph: EsquireWhile Trump may not have featured on the Time cover very much pre-politics, he did feature on many others as New York’s brash, publicity-seeking business mogul and Manhattan social scene fixture. Trump is obsessed with gold. He loves bling. It makes sense then that Esquire would kit him out in medallions and rings galore. Also shout out to the accompanying cover lines of: “Wild tales of strippers! Streakers! Tsunamis! Leopard Attacks!” Talk about something for everybody. And note the other feature: “The Case for Bush”. This is not, in fact, an editorial on pubic hair,but about George W.Oh, and the strap for the Trump story?“How I’d Run the Country (Better)”. Indeed, Trump’s first mention of his wish to achieve the highest office was circa 1987. Turns out we should have taken him bothseriously and literally.C 41, 2016View image in fullscreenDonald trump on cover of C 41 MagazinePhotograph: C 41 MagazineAn extremely innovative cover from theMilan-based magazinededicated to all things design and style. Layering the cover with a Trompe-l’œil style technique (pun possibly intended), the magazine’s gallery arm put on anexhibitionentitled American Change, in which this cover, created by Japanese artist Kensuke Koike, features. A copy of the magazine was also included in the London Design Museum’sHope to Nopeshow.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Washington PostThere are other similarly themed covers; Trump’s mouth is rather a subject of fascination. Note that impressionists will first attempt to nail his voice; then the second thing is the puckering of the mouth. Recently, the queen of the Netherlands wascaught mocking Trump’s lip movements– a bold move given he was standing right next to her. Some might liken the general aesthetic of this particular maw to a cat’s bum, but that wouldn’t be me. What is good about this cover is it is a departure from the usual way cover designers depict Trump’s mouth – which is black text across his philtrum to resemble a Hitler moustache. It’s been done, guys. Many, many times.Vanity Fair, 2024View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Vanity FairIn the past few years outlets have taken to producing digital covers for online readers. This was a striking one in 2024 from Vanity Fair, not just for the pore-intense close-up, but the directly presented set of numbers down the lefthand side. Can’t really complain when the facts add up. The cover wentviral on its release, with millions of likes and views on X alone.Trump has a history of beef with Vanity Fair. In particular with its former editor, Graydon Carter, who once referred to Trump as“a short-fingered vulgarian”. In turn, Trump has called Carter “a real loser”. Trump has often dissed the magazine on social media, and in 2016tweeted: “Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!” He was right about the last part – but Carterstepped down in 2017, staying on longer than intended to cover the beginning of Trump’s administration.Internazionale, 2017View image in fullscreenPhotograph: InternazionaleThe matryoshka doll design isn’t super original, but this is very well executed from the progressive weekly Internazionale, which translates long-form articles from around the world into Italian. Theimplicationof the cover is clear, and the detail is such that one doesn’t need the fully exposed face of Putin to recognise him. We can spot those thin lips and filler-enhanced cheeks anywhere.Bloomberg Businessweek, 2016View image in fullscreenPhotograph: BloombergPerhaps the most unsettling of the bunch, courtesy of a 2016 Chinese edition of Bloomberg Businessweek. Trump likes to assert his reputation as a great businessman, which is questionable given hismultiple bankruptcy filings. Nevertheless, he iscurrently receiving praisefor his brokering of the Gaza ceasefire. (Maybe he listened to the audiobook of The Art of the Deal to brush up on his skills.)The cover line translates to: “Donald Trump is a modern political Steve Jobs, turning his US presidential campaign into a one-man show.” This would have pleased Trump no end, as he seemed to have something of a crush on Jobs,tweeting many times about himin glowing terms. Except for when he declared: “I’ve always been a fan of Steve Jobs … but the yacht he built is truly ugly.”Trump, however, is very much not a fan of Steve Jobs’ widow, who holds shares in The Atlantic, opining that the late Apple designer would “not be happy” about Laurene Powell Jobs “wasting money” on the publication. (Powell Jobs alsodonated $930,000to the 2020 Biden campaign.)Playboy, 1990View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PlayboyTrump is back in his playboy era here – literally. We know Trump is keen on this cover because he waspicturedholding and signing the magazine not too long ago. (A signed copy isavailable on eBayfor $4,000.) The truth is he does look good here. The suit is a much better fit than theone he wore to Buckingham Palacein 2019 – although true confirmation can only come fromMenswear Guy.In the cover interview, whichyou can read here, Trump appears to rule out a future run for the presidency – despite the topic being raised precisely because of his previous musings. Speaking about himself in the third person, he told the outlet: “The presidency? No, that takes an election, and it is clear that Trump is not that patient.”Trump will probably not be too happy to hear that Hugh Hefner’s son has said that his father “regretted” the cover.Speaking to The Hollywood Reporterin 2017, Cooper Hefner said: “We don’t respect the guy. There’s a personal embarrassment because Trump is somebody who has been on our cover.”New York, 1992View image in fullscreenPhotograph: New YorkThe funniest thing about this cover is that the tie makes Trump look for all the world like he goes to an underperforming British comprehensive school. The tie is screaming Geography second period. And the stance? Organised fight behind the maths block at the end of last bell. The reason Trump has to “scramble off the canvas” to quote the subhead, is that in the late 80s Trump seemed down and out. As Politico hasdescribed it, the businessman “lost his mind” and “sowed the seeds of his near-ruin” with catastrophic financial choices. But if there’s one thing Trump has proved, it’s that he has staying power. He is the human embodiment ofChumbawamba’s biggest (only) hit.New York, 2015Photograph: New YorkIs there a headline that has aged worse than “Donald Trump Is Saving Our Democracy”? Probably not, what with him trying toorganise a coup against the elected government.Trump’s hair is one of the most recognisable things about him, so this cover, digitally manipulated so he’s wearing wear a coiffed wig in emulation of George Washington, is quite the deviation. And while the reference to the founding father is obvious, the look does slightly veer towards nan’s perm.The above two examples aren’t the only New York editions featuring striking covers of Trump. The “Loser” strap line is one, for which the magazine issued anonline explanation. And there’sthis one, which aged about as well as the Washington one.Libération, 2016View image in fullscreenPhotograph: LibérationThere’s nothing equivocal here. The left-leaning Libération melds what some might consider two of New York’s most famous villains, with Trump channelling Patrick Bateman. There’s also a touch ofThe Godfather. The French periodical is not the only publication to have referred to Trump on its cover as the Bret Easton Ellis character, with the New Statesmandoing the same.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Der SpiegelIn terms of unsparing assessment, a competitor could be Die Welt’s no-nonsense strap line “Das Ende Der Welt” on a 2016 cover, which I feel even non-German speakers can take a stab at understanding. That was a great cover, featuring Trump as a roaring streak of anger in comet-form on track to consume the earth. Illustrated by Edel Rodriguez,it won a top prizeat the Art Directors Club Germany awards. The magazine and Rodriguez followed up with amuch more controversial and perhaps ill-judged coverof the President decapitating the State of Liberty.The Economist, 2018View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The EconomistOne for the pop culture aficionados. In 2013 Miley Cyrus’s certified banger Wrecking Ball (taken from the accurately titled album Bangerz) was riding high in the charts – and she was riding a giant wrecking ball in themusic video. Memes abounded at the time, but five years on the Economist took inspiration and came out swinging with this cover. I’m not sure Trump suits the cherry Doc Martens that Cyrus wore in the video, but props to the illustrator Ben Kirchner for including them. And it is not impossible he does own the real thing – the singerauctioned the boots off for charity. The accompanying cover story you canread here.The New Yorker, 2016View image in fullscreenIllustration: Barry Blitt/The New YorkerThe symbol for the Democrats is a donkey and for the Republicans an elephant. The former has an association with Andrew Jackson (opponents called him a“jackass”), and the latter with Abraham Lincoln (“seeing the elephant” was aterm used by soldiersduring the Civil War). It’s a clever cover from The New Yorker to depict how Trump cleaved apartthe old school GOP. It’s safe to say the Never Trump movement has failed abysmally – and now there are masked mendragging people off the streetand it’s horrifying. But don’t forget: with the circus trick, the subject of the sawing is a volunteer.The cover was illustrated by the New Yorker’s own Barry Blitt and given the title “Grand Illusion”.Blitt saidit was the fourth time in less than a year he had drawn the President. There is a gallery of Blitt’s previous Trump covershere.Explore more on these topicsDesignTime magazineDonald TrumpConsumer magazinesMagazinesNewspapers & magazinesUS press and publishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You know why? Because he doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States.”Maduro, who came to power in 2013, has recently shored up his security powers and deployed tens of thousands of troops around the country. He also accused Trump ofseeking regime change, an allegation the US president has downplayed.0:56Trump confirms attack on alleged 'drug-carrying submarine' in the Caribbean – videoLast week the New York Timesreported that Madurooffered a stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in recent months to stave off mounting pressure from the US.Meanwhile, Venezuelan government officials are said to have floated a plan in which Maduro would eventually leave office. The Miami Herald newspaperreported thatVice-President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother Jorge, who is president of the national assembly, had funneled proposals through intermediaries in Qatar to present themselves to Washington as a “more acceptable” alternative.The US has acknowledged carrying out at least five strikes on vessels nearVenezuelathat it says were transporting drugs, killing at least 27 people.A sixth strike targeted a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean on Thursday, and in what is believed to be the first such case, there were survivors among the crew, who were reportedly rescued and are being held on a navy ship.One sourcetold Reutersthat the vessel struck on Thursday moved below the water and was possibly a semi-submersible, which is a submarine-like vessel used by drug traffickers to avoid detection.Trump confirmed to reporters: “We attacked a submarine. That was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs – just so you understand.”US has seized survivors of attack on alleged narco-sub in CaribbeanRead moreHe added: “This was not an innocent group of people. I don’t know too many people that have submarines and that was an attack on a drug-carrying loaded-up submarine.”The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who was also present, did not dispute that there were survivors and repeatedly said details would be forthcoming.The US has described some of the victims in the first five strikes as Venezuelans, while the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, has suggested some were from his country. In Trinidad, family members of one man believed killed in a strike this week havedemanded proofhe was a drug trafficker.Venezuela’s government has said the strikes are illegal, amount to murder and are an aggression against the country.Trump has justified the strikes by asserting that the US is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the George W Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after theSeptember 11 attacks.But legal scholars have warned that the president’s use of overwhelming military force to combat the cartels, along with his authorisation of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law.Venezuela on edge over Trump regime change whispers: ‘If it does happen we are ready’Read moreJuanita Goebertus Estrada,Americasdirector at Human Rights Watch, said the attacks violated international human rights law and amounted to extrajudicial executions.“The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, or with alleged criminal groups involved. Under human rights law standards, officials engaging in law enforcement must seek to minimize injury and preserve human life. They may use lethal force only when strictly unavoidable to protect against an imminent threat of death or serious injury,” she said.The strikes have caused unease among Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, with some Republicans saying they had not received sufficient information on how the strikes were being conducted.Friday’s outburst was not the first that Trump has peppered the language of diplomacy with profanities. In June, frustrated with Israel and Iran attacking each other after a ceasefire, hetold a group of reportersthat the countries had “been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing”.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS politicsAmericasUS militaryDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not immediately clear what would be done with the survivors, who the officials said were being held on a US navy vessel.They confirmed the strike on the condition of anonymity because it has not yet been publicly acknowledged by theTrump administration.‘Trump is killing poor people’: Caribbean village mourns victim of US strikeRead moreThis strike on Thursday brings the death toll from theUS militaryaction against vessels in the region to at least 28.Trump justified the strikes by asserting that the United States was engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a “war on terror” after the September 11 attacks in 2001. That includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership.The president’s use of overwhelming military force to combat the cartels, along with his authorization of covert action insideVenezuela, possibly to oust the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law, legal scholars say.The survivors of this strike now face an unclear future and legal landscape, including questions about whether they are now considered to be prisoners of war or defendants in a criminal case. The White House did not comment on the strike.Juanita Goebertus Estrada,Americasdirector at Human Rights Watch, said the attacks violated international human rights law and amounted to extrajudicial executions.“The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, or with alleged criminal groups involved. Under human rights law standards, officials engaging in law enforcement must seek to minimize injury and preserve human life. They may use lethal force only when strictly unavoidable to protect against an imminent threat of death or serious injury.“In the different recent strikes conducted in the Caribbean, the US authorities made no effort to minimize harm and have not sought to demonstrate that the individuals aboard vessels posed any imminent threat to life,” she said.Venezuela on edge over Trump regime change whispers: ‘If it does happen we are ready’Read moreThe strikes come against the backdrop of a US military buildup in the Caribbean that includes guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter jets, a nuclear submarine and about 6,500 troops as Trump escalates a standoff with the Venezuelan government.On Wednesday, Trump disclosed he hadauthorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operationsinside Venezuela, adding to speculation in Caracas that the United States is attempting to topple Maduro.The strikes in the Caribbean have caused unease among Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, with some Republicans saying they have not received sufficient information on how the strikes are being conducted. A classified briefing for senators on the Senate armed services committee earlier this month did not include representatives from intelligence agencies or the military command structure of countries in South and Central America.However, most Senate Republicans stood behind the administration last week when a vote on a war powers resolution was brought up, which would have required the administration to gain approval from Congress before conducting more strikes.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS militaryVenezuelaTrump administrationDonald TrumpCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But speaking to the Guardian at a wake for the two men, Joseph’s cousin La Toya, 42, said he was denied the basic right to due process and accused theTrinidad and Tobagogovernment of giving up its sovereignty to the US.“Everybody have a right to due process and due process wasn’t given. It don’t look like we running under our government no more when it comes to the waters – that’s not Trinidad waters,” she said, questioning why US officials decided to destroy the boat rather than detain and question its occupants.At a wake for the two men late on Thursday, family and community members said they felt betrayed by their own government and at the mercy of aTrump administrationthat has been given unfettered access to their waters.“I just want to know whyDonald Trumpkilling poor people just so,” Joseph’s uncle, known only as “Dollars”, said. “Just because he going after the people gas and their oil. He going after people riches and killing poor people children.”View image in fullscreenMessiah Burnley, a cousin of Chad Joseph, sits outside the home Joseph shared with his grandparents in Las Cuevas, Trinidad and Tobago.Photograph: Andrea de Silva/ReutersTrinidad citizens believed killed in US airstrike off Venezuela coast identifiedRead moreLynette Burnley, Joseph’s aunt, said the family had received no communication from the Trinidad government since reports of her nephew’s death first emerged.“That make me feel a kind of way too,” Burnley said. “People coming from international, all over, [calling us but] not right here in Trinidad. They real poor, they let us down.”On Thursday, Trinidad’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, who has previously expressed strong support for aUS militaryoperation in the region, avoided questions from reporters about the US airstrike that is thought to have killed Joseph and Samaroo.“Just imagine, the prime minister … They asking she about this. She never even make a statement,” Burnley said, adding that it felt as if Joseph and Samaroo were being treated like “they did not exist”.Joseph’s grandmother Christine Clement said she was very close to him. He moved from his mother’s home in another fishing village, Matelot, and came to live with her.She said the only support she had had was from the community.“Everybody hurt, because in this community everybody is family and friends and everybody close … Our own police service, nobody come and ask a question. There’s no investigation, nothing,” she said, adding she was trying to stay calm and monitor her blood pressure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He coming home here to keep a mass, five o’clock.”On Thursday, US media reported another strike on a boat in the Caribbean, from which there reportedly are survivors. At least 27 people have been killed in previous attacks off the coast of Venezuela, which theTrump administrationsays are necessary to protect the United States from narcotics smuggled from Venezuela, but which UN experts and human rights groups have described as extrajudicial killings.Last month, fishers in Las Cuevastold the Guardianthat they were afraid of being caught in the crossfire amid Trump’s “war on drugs” in the region. Instead of their usual route, heading west toward Venezuela, fishers said they now head east, staying close to the coast of Trinidad.

However, there is added concern in parts of Latin America over unequal access to healthcare and the worrying situation in the US, which is facing its worst measles outbreak in decades followinga reversal of vaccine policyled by Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.“The US’s political position in relation to health and vaccination is an outrage,” said Rosana Richtmann, an infectious disease doctor and coordinator of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Disease’s immunisation committee. “It’s a problem for us.”View image in fullscreenPeople queue for vaccination at a Ciudad Juárez shopping centre near the US border. Mexico has had more than 4,800 measles cases.Photograph: C Chavez/APMeasles was successfully eliminated from the Americas in 2016, andthen again in 2024, but the continent is nowat risk of losing its measles-free status. There have been 11,668 cases reported across 10 countries in North and Latin America, according tothe latest datafrom the Pan-American Health Organization (Paho).More than half of these cases are in the US and Canada, with three deaths in the US and two in Canada so far.Mexico is the hardest-hit country in Latin America, with more than 4,800 cases and22 deaths, followed by Bolivia with 354 cases. Other countries, including Brazil, Belize and Paraguay, are dealing with a few dozen infections linked to imported cases.Concern over high numbers of cases in North America has led the Brazilian health ministry to focus more on the highly contagious disease witha nationwide vaccination campaign launchedfor children and teenagers in October. Adults who did not have the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as children are also being offered the jab.View image in fullscreenPeople register for a measles vaccine during the health ministry’s inoculation campaign in Mexico City last month.Photograph: Yuri Cortéz/AFP/Getty ImagesBrazil also has protocols in place to respond swiftly to individual cases. When a nine-year-old tested positive for measles on 7 October in Várzea Grande, health authorities were swift to act. Nurses kitted out in protective gear visited the child’s school and worked quickly to implement “ring vaccination”, inoculating everyone who had been in contact with her.The city’s health teams have also been going from door to door to identify unvaccinated people and holding vaccination drives in a shopping centre and the international airport.Richtmann said the biggest fear was imported cases. “We are much more worried about Brazilians travelling to Europe, to the US or Canada [catching measles and bringing it back], than about those who live here,” she said.RFK Jr could have disastrous global impact on public health, experts fearRead moreAmira Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Virginia’s George Mason University, agreed that the outbreaks in the US posed a threat to neighbouring countries.“Now suddenly, you’re more likely to run into someone who has some kind of infectious disease [in the US]. You visit the US, you go home with souvenirs – and you might also go home with measles,” she said.Mexico’s first measles case in February was imported from Texas by an unvaccinated Mennonite boy. Bolivia’s first cases also spread through pockets of unvaccinated people living inMennonite settlements.Mennonites are Anabaptist Christian communities of European descent who reject many aspects of modern life, including vaccines.Daniel Salas, executive manager of Paho’s special programme for comprehensive immunisation, said: “Having close-knit communities that are often reluctant to receive vaccinations and having large flows [of people] from country to country through the region are aggravating factors.”View image in fullscreenMeasles testing on offer at a hospital in Seminole, Texas, in February. The state was the centre of the latest big outbreak in the US.Photograph: Julio Cortez/APHealth authorities should identify communities resistant to vaccination and target their efforts there, Salas said.There is no cure for measles, which can lead to serious complications and even death, but it is easily preventable with two doses of theMMR vaccine, which provides 97% protection.MMR vaccination rates in Latin America fell during the Covid pandemic and the years leading up to it but have recovered since 2022, reaching 86% last year, according tothe World Bank. However, this remains below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity, with a lag in uptake of second doses and significant disparities between countries and within them.View image in fullscreenThe US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has spread misinformation about the MMR vaccine and measles treatment.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyLack of information and access to heathcare has contributed to lower vaccination rates, but doctors also blame the influence of thegrowing anti-vaxxer movement in the US.“A lot of South American countries look to the US,” said Carlos Paz, head of infectious diseases at the Mario Ortiz Suárez paediatric hospital in Santa Cruz,Bolivia, where 80% of the country’s cases have been reported.“The population sees what a US minister says about vaccines, and some people start to say, ‘well, we shouldn’t get vaccinated here either’,” he said.While the US health secretary didendorse the MMR vaccineafter an outbreak in Texas in April, Kennedy has also spreadmisleading informationabout it andmisinformation about measles treatment.This month theUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now led by a biotech investor, suggested the MMR vaccine should be given as three separate jabs, even though the safety and efficacy of combined shots have been demonstrated by decades of research and going against theCDC’s own longstanding advice.Bolivia declared a national health emergency in June, extended school holidays to avoid contact between children, and launched a widespread vaccination drive, relying partly on donations from Brazil, India and Chile. But coverage in October had stillonly reached 45%, while the government still has 1.6m doses available.“We’ve been campaigning to increase the vaccination rate. Each doctor, each paediatrician, is a soldier advocating for vaccination,” said Paz.Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthMMRInfectious diseasesVaccines and immunisationHealthRobert F Kennedy JrMexicofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Police fired teargas while some protesters hurled fireworks, rocks and burning objects.“Everyone must go!” protesters chanted when they reached congress and tried to tear down metal barriers protecting the building, leading to clashes.A 32-year-old man, Eduardo Mauricio Ruiz, was killed during the protest and his death would be investigated, said Fernando Losada, a representative from the country’s ombudsman’s office. Peru’s prosecutor’s office said Ruiz died after being shot.1:21Peru: police and anti-government protesters clash outside congress – videoJerí expressed regret over Ruiz’s death in a post on X, saying the death would be “objectively” investigated. He blamed violence on “delinquents who infiltrated a peaceful demonstration to sow chaos”.“The full force of the law will be on them,” he said.After attending a meeting about the protests at congress on Thursday afternoon, Jerí said he would ask congress for “authority to legislate on public safety issues”.Jerí said one focus would be prison reform, but did not elaborate on what those powers would entail.Speaking to the unicameral congress soon after, the newly appointed interior minister, Vicente Tiburcio, said the government would push for comprehensive reform to the national police, adding that 89 police and 22 civilians had been injured during the protest and 11 people were detained.The interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the police reform or Jerí’s request for expanded legislative powers.Wednesday’s protests were a bellwether for how Jerí’s nascent presidency – which ends next July due to scheduled elections – could play out.Jerí, 38, has promised to make crime his top priority but has faced a number of scandals, including corruption allegations and a now-shelved investigation for sexual assault. Jerí has denied wrongdoing in both cases and expressed willingness to cooperate with any corruption investigation.Boluarte faced widespread protests after she assumed power in late 2022, leading to dozens of deaths and a plunge in her popularity levels, which oscillated between 2% and 4% in the days leading up to her ouster.Congress – which was headed by Jerí before he became president – is almost equally unpopular, with a single-digit approval rating.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Barclays was the worst hit, with shares closing down nearly 6%.Head of IMF says risks in private credit market keep her awake at nightRead moreMore widely, €37.4bn (£32bn) was wiped off the pan-European banking industry, including the UK.Spain’s Banco Sabadell fell by 6.78%, followed by Germany’sDeutsche Bank, which shed 6%.Concerns over credit stress in the network of loans to businesses across the world’s largest economy fuelled heavy losses on Wall Street on Thursday, followed by Asian markets, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 1.6% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropping 2%. US markets were calmer on Friday morning trading on Wall Street.Jittery investors turned to safe haven assets, with gold hitting a new record of $4,378 (£3,262) an ounce, a weekly gain of almost 8.5%, its biggest since the 2008 financial crisis.US banking stocks plunged on Thursday after Zions Bancorporation, a Utah-based lender, said it would write off $50m on two loans, and the Phoenix-headquartered Western Alliance said it had started legal proceedings over a bad loan said to be worth $100m.Shares in Zions plunged by more than 10%, while Western Alliance Bancorp dropped more than 9%.“While this was an ostensibly isolated story at two banks each with less than a $10bn market cap, the event drew inevitable comparisons to the regional bank stress that followed thecollapse of Silicon Valley Bank [SVB] in 2023,” said Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. “[That] raised broader questions over potential credit quality issues after a lengthy period of elevated rates and expansion in private credit.”The California-based SVB was the 16th biggest bank in the US, a $212bn lender popular with the tech sector. Its abrupt collapse triggered the most significant financial crisis since 2008.While SVB’sunderlying issues stemmed from earlier investment decisions, the collapse occurred when it announced a $1.75bn capital raising, telling investors it needed to plug a hole caused by the sale of its loss-making bond portfolio.Thiscaused a run on the bankas clients became alarmed that it was short of capital. Two days later SVB collapsed, marking the largest bank failure in the US since the global financial crisis.Reid said that markets were especially wary of a domino effect, as the issues faced by the two banks followed thebankruptcy of the sub-prime automotive lender Tricolor last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The so-called “fear index” rose a further 6% on Friday morning.Earlier this week, Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US investment bank JP Morgan, rather presciently said thatmore “cockroaches” could emergeafter the collapse of Tricolor and First Brands.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Airport operations were disrupted, infrastructure damaged, and heavy rainfall caused landslides across the island chain. The typhoon also generated 9-metre waves, creating dangerous coastal conditions. Off the Pacific coast in Oiso, in Kanagawa prefecture, three men were swept away while fishing, one of whom has been confirmed dead.Nakri has since transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, weakening as it moved eastwards over cooler north Pacific waters, with wind speeds dropping to about 65mph as of Thursday. Riding the jet stream, its remnants are on track to reach British Columbia, Canada, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and storm surges.A week earlier, Halong had unleashed more than 200mm of rain in three hours, as maximum sustained winds reached 122mph. By late morning last Thursday, rainfall totals reached 349mm, shattering the 24-hour record. The typhoon’s remnants then crossed the north Pacific and reachedAlaskaon Sunday, bringing a record-breaking 2-metre storm surge.The coastal villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were the hardest hit. One person died, homes were destroyed, and about 1,500 people were forced into shelters. Alaska experienced one of the largest airlifts in its history to evacuate displaced residents. Halong stands as one of the most powerful storms the region has experienced. Its rapid intensification was fuelled by unusually warm north Pacific waters, which provided extra heat and moisture.Meanwhile,Mexicoendured a double blow last week as the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Storm Raymond converged, dumping about 609mm of rain in four days across central and eastern regions.Steered by a dip in the jet stream, both systems hit the same area in quick succession. The first deluge from Priscilla left the ground saturated, intensifying flooding when Raymond arrived.More than 300 communities were affected by landslides and overflowing rivers. As of Wednesday, 66 people have been confirmed dead and 75 are still missing. Rescue and recovery operations are continuing, with stagnant flood waters raising health concerns in isolated areas.Explore more on these topicsJapanWeather trackerHurricanesExtreme weatherAsia PacificAlaskaMexicoanalysisShareReuse this content"

The conflict came after months orretaliatory actionsincluding Cambodia banning the import of Thai films and fruit, and a Thai protester throwing fish sauce of a portrait of Hun Sen.The ceasefire was announced after US president Donald Trump said he had called both countries and warned that trade negotiations would be paused until the fighting ceased.Trump is expected to oversee a formal peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia later this month.The pushback against the alleged ghost-like broadcasts come as Thailand has accused Cambodia of laying new mines along the border, Reuters has reported. Landmine detonations, which have maimed at least six Thai soldiers since July, triggered the clashes between the two nations.Cambodia denies the accusations and says Thai soldiers stepped on ordnances planted during a decades-long civil war that left it as one of the world’s most heavily mined countries.Explore more on these topicsCambodiaThailandTrump administrationAsean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)MalaysiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Since their successful relaunch, they have rowed with calloused hands around the clock, averaging 50 nautical miles daily. By the end of their trip they will have rowed an estimated 8,300 nautical miles (15,300 km) while raising money for theOutward Bound Trust.A map showing the route from Lima, Peru to Cairns, Australia‘We keep plodding along’: UK pair two-thirds of the way through 8,000-mile charity rowRead moreOvernight, they switch out every two hours, sleeping in shifts inside their small cabin while the other rows, using lightweight towels for bedding.Their survival kit includes 400kg of food, 80% of it freeze-dried, “salty” the water desalinator, “dumpy” the loo bucket and, when a critical pipe failed, a pair of cut up underwear for repairs. A supply of leaves and micro greens are also harvested from an onboard growing unit, and occasionally they catch a fish on the line.From a cramped rowing station (also know as “the office”), they have faced down 30ft waves, navigated shipping lanes and battled storms that silenced their electronics. They have persisted under star-filled skies and had close encounters with sharks,whales, dolphins, turtles, sea lions and birdlife.The sun is a crucial ally, providing energy via solar panels. A system fault that led to the onboard solar-powered batteries discharging too quickly was a critical challenge.A video loop of the women rowing in the oceanPayne and Rowe crossing the South Pacific Ocean in their nine-metre vessel, Velocity.Nick Rowe, Jess’s dad, says they have to be extremely cautious with power, especially since the electrical systems run their vital water generator.For much of the journey, the rowers had to switch off most other electronics due to the battery failure, including the chartplotter – a navigation device – and the beacon that alerts passing ships. This turned their rowboat into a “ghost ship,” adding constant manual navigation and lookout to their already exhausting schedule.Their final approach to Queensland, Australia is proving as challenging as the crossing. Originally bound for Brisbane, stubborn headwinds forced a course change in August.View image in fullscreenJess Rowe (left) and Miriam Payne, who are rowing across the South Pacific Ocean from Peru to Australia on board their boat Velocity.Photograph: Seas The Day Ocean Rowing TeamThey are now navigating a new route, requiring guidance from Cairns fisher Alec Dunn, to weave through islands and theGreat Barrier Reef.The pair say they are keen for a “long-awaited pizza” when they arrive at Cairns Marlin Marina, which is expected to be any time between noon and 2pm AEST on Saturday. There, they will face the next physical challenge of regaining their “land legs”.Buoyed by letters from schoolchildren in their final approach, the duo credit their success to “stubborn determination from start to finish” during their time “spent in the wild in our teeny tiny rowing boat”.Once settled in Cairns, they want to invite children to visit them in the local marina for tours and hear “tales of the high seas”.Rowe and Payne are among a small cohort of peopleto have crossed the Pacific in rowing boats, either individually or in teams.View image in fullscreenThe British pair are expected to arrive in Cairns, Australia between noon and 2pm AEST on Saturday.Photograph: Seas the Day Ocean Rowing TeamThey say they will be setting a new record as the first all-female pair to row across the South Pacific Ocean non-stop and unsupported.Another group of adventurers took on a similar challenge recently, with aScottish trio of brothersrowing nonstop from Peru to Cairns, where they arrived in August.The perilous nature of such journeys was highlighted in March when Lithuanian man Aurimas Mockus attempted a solo 12,000km Pacific Ocean crossing from San Diego andhad to be rescuedafter he was caught in turbulent waters due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred.There have been other close calls – in 202324-year-old Australian Tom Robinsonset out to row from Peru to Cairns but was rescued by a cruise ship after his boat capsized. There have also been tragedies – in 2020, the AmericanParalympic rowing star Angela Madsen diedwhile attempting a solo journey from California to Hawaii.In 2023, AustralianMichelle Leebecame the first woman to row solo across the Pacific Ocean non-stop and unsupported, rowing from Mexico to Port Douglas in Queensland.At the time,Lee told the ABCher journey had been a “privilege”.“You’re just experiencing and witnessing Mother Nature in all her runway-ready, take-me-as-I-am, natural beauty,” she said.Explore more on these topicsRowingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anopen letter criticising the Australian government’s focus on renewable energycoordinated by RRA, which is based in far north Queensland, has been signed by several notable Australians, including the energy entrepreneur Trevor St Baker, Dick Smith, the Indigenous advocate Warren Mundine and several nuclear energy advocates.The Guardian is not suggesting the analysis or open letter were developed using AI.‘100% misleading’RRA made a submission to theSenate inquiry on misinformation and disinformationin the climate change and energy debate.The submission said Australia’s climate and energy policy was being “undermined by a persistent failure to confront misinformation” and plans to reach “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions relied on “incomplete science, policy capture, and the systematic omission of ecological costs (Brulle, 2014; Oreskes and Conway, 2010)”.Prof Naomi Oreskes is a Harvard science historian and an expert on science misinformation who co-authored the 2010 book Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming, which the submission cites.“Merchants of Doubt does not support that claim,” Oreskes said, and “net zero” was not discussed in her book.She said: “It is true that no technology is 100% impact free. But some technologies are far worse than others, and the passage cites my work in a way that is 100% misleading.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe same submission points to two publications from Prof Bob Brulle of Brown University – an expert on the global network of groups working to slow action on climate change. The submission said Brulle’s work supported a claim that advocacy for renewable energy was often “devoid of underlying context”.“While the citations are real, neither paper remotely addresses the issues that the [submission] discusses,” Brulle said.“The citations are totally misleading. I have never written on these topics in any of my papers. To say that these citations support [RRA’s] argument is absurd.”RRA also made submissions toa Senate inquiry into Pfas chemicalsand aNSW parliamentary inquiry on Pfas in waterways. Both claimed solar panels and wind turbines were releasing so-called forever chemicals into the environment.The submissions cited two papers from the Journal of Cleaner Production as evidence, but the Guardian could not find the papers.A spokesperson for the journal’s publisher, Elsevier, said: “These references appear to be hallucinated and do not exist – we have not found any articles with those titles published in Elsevier journals.”Nonexistent windfarmRRA’s website says itssubmissions are developed by a volunteer, Anne S Smith who, the charity says, “continues to call for policy grounded in truth, science, and stewardship not ideology”. Smith is described on the RRA website as a volunteer and an environmental research strategist.In two submissions published on its website, both with the same date, RRA opposed a windfarm development in Queensland called Moonlight Range that was ultimately rejected by the state government.One submission, authored by Smith, refers to areport from 2023 produced by the “Queensland Environmental Protection Agency” – an agency that has not existed since 2009.It also refers to the “Australian Regional Planning Commission” and the “Queensland Planning Authority” – neither of which exists.The other submission, which does not name an author,claimed “case studies from the Oakey Wind Farm in Queensland” had reported “widespread contamination” at the site. But there is no windfarm in Oakey and the cited “Oakey Wind Farm Contamination Report” does not exist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a misrepresentation.”He said Friends of the Earth had “genuine concerns about ensuring renewable energy is planned properly” but the submissions from RRA “poisons the well for legitimate environmental concerns”.Guardian Australia’s questions to RRA were forwarded to Smith, who sent a 1,500-word response that she later acknowledged had been generated with the help of AI.For the submissions, she said she had used “a range of analytical tools including AI-assisted literature searches, data synthesis, and document preparation” and were “entirely under my direction”.She claimed the citation of Oreskes and Brulle was fair.She claimed one of the papers in the Elsevier journal had become “inaccessible” and suggested this could be because “they contain findings that challenge dominant policy narratives”.Referring to the findings of nonexistent or long-closed organisations was “entirely appropriate”, she said, and the citation relating to Oakey windfarm was “misattributed” but was “intended to illustrate a real and serious issue”.She said the claims from Friends of the Earth were “inflammatory, politically motivated, and does not reflect the reality of our work”.When the Guardian asked RRA if the responses to its questions had been generated using AI, Smith responded “Yes” in an email, and added it was “the most efficient way to review everything properly and provide you with an accurate and timely response.

It was found in a section of the heritage site that overlaps with the defence force’s missile testing range near Woomera, which is one of the largest in the world. An exclusion zone for the range covers 122,000 sq km, roughly the size of England.The location of the missile was also in close proximity to several culturally significant artefacts for the Kokatha people, including rock art.The Starkey brothers told Defence about the missile in May 2021. When it had not been removed by September, they contacted Saab and lodged a complaint with theOECD, which can investigate whether multinational companies have breached human rights obligations.Asio’s 9/11-era questioning powers to become permanent despite warnings from human rights advocatesRead moreSaab immediately contacted Defence but the missile remained uncleared until January 2022 – a year after it was discovered. It may have been sold to Australia between the mid-1980s and early 1990s, the investigation suggested.The complaint, investigated by the Australian National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (AusNCP), alleged that Saab did not undertake adequate due diligence that could have prevented its weapon being used in a human rights violation.It also alleged that Saab failed to respect their right to protect and preserve the land.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA final ruling by the AusNCP, published on Friday, found the brothers feared for their safety, with the missile preventing them from accessing their land and continuing their cultural practices.“This constituted an adverse impact on their human rights, including rights to enjoy culture and take part in cultural life, maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their traditional lands and to uphold their responsibilities to future generations,” the AusNCP said.“There are reasonable grounds to conclude that Saab did not cause or contribute to the adverse human rights impacts experienced by the notifiers.“However, as the ordnance as manufactured and supplied by Saab, the enterprise was directly linked to the adverse human rights impacts experienced by the notifiers.”A Saab spokesperson said the company was “committed to upholding human rights and complies with Australian laws, other nations export controls, and international treaties when supplying defence and security products to the Australian government”.The AusNCP cannot issue sanctions or fines but called on Saab to update its human rights due diligence processes and meaningfully engage with First Nations people affected by the use of its weapons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the investigators said in the report that the brothers had no recollection of this assurance.The brothers referenced a November 2021 email from Defence, which warned that the missile could include unexploded ordnance and that it “must not be touched, removed or otherwise interfered with”.But Defence told the AusNCP investigators that the missile did not contain an explosive element. It said this could be for several reasons, including that a warhead may not be used during testing, or the explosive material had detonated upon impact with aerial target.The Starkey brothers’ lawyer, John Podgorelec, said it was “absurd that a Swedish missile could land in a protected heritage site in Australia and for Defence and Saab not know about it”.The human rights lawyer said the ruling sent a message to arms companies that “unless you do your due diligence, customer misuse of your product can link you to human rights harms”.Andrew Starkey said the ruling “means we have some say in how overseas companies treat us and our country”.John Pace, a former secretary of the UN commission on human rights who worked with Podgorelec on the case, said Indigenous people had “a crucial role to play in building safe practices” in the area.The AusNCP noted that Defence and the Starkey brothers were locked in a dispute about whether financial compensation has been provided.Explore more on these topicsSouth AustraliaAustralian militarySaabHuman rightsArms tradeIndigenous AustraliansOECDnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "14.36 EDTSummary: Trump hesitant about giving Tomahawks to Ukraine, saying 'hopefully they won't need it'Donald Trump andVolodymyr Zelenskyyfinished speaking to reporters ahead of their bilateral lunch in which they are expected to discuss Ukraine’s request for US Tomahawks. Here’s a look at where things stand:Trump showed hesitance on supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles.He said: “One of the reasons we want to get this war over is…that it’s not easy for us to give you … massive numbers of very powerful weapons … Hopefully they won’t need it. Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over with without thinking about Tomahawks.”Zelenskyy emphasized Nato and security guarantees as part of any peace deal with Russia.“First of all, I think we need to sit and speak. The second point, we need ceasefire… We are ready to speak in any kind of format,” he said, adding: “Nato, for Ukrainians, is very important… But the most important thing…for people inUkraine, which are under each day’s attacks, to have really strong security guarantees.”Trump said that Melania Trump’s push to help return displaced Ukrainian children in the war was her own decision.“She wanted to do it. She just felt very strongly about the children. And she’s done a really good job,” Trump said. Last week, the first lady announced the return of the children followed an “open channel of communication” she had with Russian presidentVladimir Putin.Trump called himself the “mediator president,” adding: “I love solving wars.”Talking about his mediating efforts around the world, he said: “This is number nine. Okay, this will be number nine for me. I’ve solved eight, including the Middle East… I didn’t get a Nobel Prize…so I don’t care about all that stuff. I just care about saving lives. But this will be number nine.”Zelenksyy said that he believes Trump has a “big chance to finish this war.”Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy added: “President Trump really showed for the world that he can manage [a] ceasefire in [the] Middle East and that’s why I hope that he will do this and we will hve a big success for Ukraine… I hope that President Trump can manage it.”Trump also said that there is a lot of “bad blood” between Zelenskyyy and Putin.‘These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everybody. So one way or the other we’ll be involved in threes, but it may be separated,” Trump said.ShareUpdated at14.45 EDT"

Face veils would still be allowed in airplanes, diplomatic premises and places of worship.The bill stipulates fines for those wearing face veils in public ranging between 200 euros and 4,000 euros (£175 and £3,475).President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa still has to approve the bill. He could veto it or send it to the constitutional court for review.If signed into law,Portugalwould join a number of European countries such as Austria, France, Belgium and the Netherlands who have full or partial bans on face and head coverings.Not many women in Portugal wear such coverings, but the issue of Islamic veils has generated controversy similar to other European countries.Chega cited France and other EU countries’ rationales for banning face coverings commonly worn by Muslim women. The party received support for the bill from center-right parties.In its bill, Chega said that hiding the face subjects individuals – especially women – “to situations of exclusion and inferiority” and was incompatible with principles such as “liberty, equality and human dignity”.Lawmakers from left-leaning parties disagreed.“This initiative is used solely to target foreigners, those who have a different faith,” said center-left Socialist party lawmaker Pedro Delgado Alves whose party voted against the bill.He said that while no woman should be forced to wear a veil, the far-right party’s approach was wrong.Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropeIslamnewsShareReuse this content"

And that should be it. Stop right now at the battle line. I told that to President Zelenskyy. I told it to President Putin.”The Ukrainian leader was frank, telling Trump that Ukraine has thousands of drones ready for an offensive against Russian targets, but needs American missiles.“We don’t have Tomahawks, that’s why we need Tomahawks,” he said.Trump responded: “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks.”Later, Trump reiterated that he wants the United States to hold on to its weaponry. “We want Tomahawks, also. We don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country,” he said.Trump’s doubtful tone on the cruise missiles follows a surprise phone call withVladimir Putinon Friday during which the Russian leader told Trump that supplying the Tomahawks would damage US-Russian relations.His position on supplying Ukraine with weapons has changed a number of times since he returned to office in January, often after negotiations with Putin or European backers of Ukraine.During the White House meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also discussed plans to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin in Hungary, saying it was “to be determined” whether Zelenskyy would join but that he would inform him of the discussions.“There is a lot of bad blood,” Trump said.After the talks on Friday, the US president issued a stern call to both sides on social media to “stop the killing, and make a DEAL!”.“They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!” Trump posted on Truth Social.Zelenskyy told reporters he did not want to talk about long-range missiles, saying the US did not want escalation, and he was “realistic” about his chance of getting them.The Ukrainian president, who spoke by phone with European leaders after the meeting, said he was counting on Trump to pressure Putin “to stop this war”.The Kremlin’s top aide, Yuri Ushakov, earlier said Putin had initiated Thursday’s conversation with Trump, during which the Russian leader urged his US counterpart not to supply Ukraine with the Tomahawks.Trump says he plans to meet Putin in Budapest as Zelenskyy prepares to make missiles case at White HouseRead more“I did actually say: ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple of thousand Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him. I said it just that way,” Trump said, recounting the conversation.“He didn’t like the idea. You have to be a little bit lighthearted sometimes.”Ushakov told reporters in Moscow that Putin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with Tomahawks “won’t change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries”.It was the eighth known call between the two men since Trump began his second term in January, and followed a familiar pattern in the complex and often confusing contest between Putin and Zelenskyy for Trump’s ear.On previous occasions, when Trump had seemed ready to tilt towards Kyiv and its European allies, a call from Putin was often followed by a sudden softening in the US leader’s tone towards Moscow.‘The key to success is in the sky’: the Ukrainian defenders struggling to stem Russia’s air assaultRead moreA flurry of activity was also set off with Trump’s announcement after the call that he was planning to meet the Russian president in the Hungarian capital on a date still to be determined, in an effort to end the war.Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Friday morning said that the summit could take place “within two weeks or later”.Peskov said Putin had already discussed the planned meeting with Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister. Orbán – an outlier among European leaders with warm ties to Trump and Putin – said he had also spoken to Trump about the summit, writing on X: “Preparations for the USA-Russia peace summit are under way.”It remains unclear how Putin would travel to Hungary, given EU sanctions and airspace restrictions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the fact that he is wanted by the international criminal court (ICC). As a signatory to the ICC, Hungary would be obliged to arrest him, though Orbán has previously said this would not happen.When asked about the logistical challenges, Peskov said the route was “so far, of course, unclear”.Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said on Friday that Putin would be able to enter and leave the country. “There is no need for any kind of consultation with anyone, we are a sovereign country here. We will receive [Putin] with respect, host him and provide the conditions for him to negotiate with the American president,” he told a press briefing.Trump and Putin last met in Alaskain August, which did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough. Trump added that fresh high-level talks between Washington and Moscow would be held next week, led on the US side by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, before a presidential summit in Budapest.The latest conversation, which lasted more than two and a half hours, appears to have sapped the momentum Zelenskyy had built with Trump, with the US leader now unlikely to show significant support for Ukraine before meeting Putin.“Zelenskyy must be pulling his hair out. Today’s meeting with Trump is now completely overshadowed and overtaken by the Budapest meeting,” said John Foreman, a former British defence attache to Moscow and Kyiv.Trump also has hinted that talks between Putin and Zelenskyy may need to take place indirectly, contradicting Zelenskyy’s longstanding aim of meeting Putin face to face to end the war.“They don’t get along too well, those two,” Trump said. “So we may do something where we’re separate. Separate but equal.”Zelenskyy, who touched down in Washington on Thursday and met US defence contractors before his White House visit, has not commented on the Putin-Trump call, though few in Kyiv are likely to view it positively.Some Ukrainian officials tried to put a positive spin on the call, saying that Putin’s outreach underscored the Russian leader’s fear of new Ukrainian weapon supplies.“Today’s call between US President Donald Trump and Putin demonstrates how even the discussion about Tomahawk missiles had already forced Putin back into dialogue with America,”Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, wrote on X. “The conclusion is that we need to continue with strong steps. Strength can truly create momentum for peace.”.While Moscow has repeatedly claimed it is ready to end its invasion of Ukraine, Putin has shown no indication he is seeking compromise or to scale back his maximalist goal of forcing Kyiv’s capitulation.Despite Trump’s typically upbeat rhetoric that peace may be within reach, the US vice-president, JD Vance, struck a more cautious note on Thursday, saying that “the Russians and the Ukrainians are just not at the point where they can make a deal”, and that a settlement “remains possible but will require a lot more work”.In an interview with the conservative network Newsmax, Vance spoke of what he called a “misalignment of expectations”, saying “the Russians tend to think they’re doing better on the battlefield than they actually are”.Additional reporting by Jennifer RankinExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But it remains the weakest cabinet in decades and could be toppled at any moment if opposition parties join together to oust it. France faces a brutal two-month battle in parliament to achieve what once seemed the most basic element of governance: passing a budget.Political analysts argue that that the figure most damaged by the current crisis is the centrist president.The pro-Europe, pro-business Macron wasfirst elected in 2017,vowing to revolutionise politics andlisten to voterslike no one had done before. He promised a “pragmatic” cherrypicking of ideas from left and right to liberalise the economy, create jobs after decades of mass unemployment and end inequality. Crucially, he said he wanted to stop the rise of the far right by ensuring citizens hadno more reasonto vote for extremes.There were crises: thegilets jaunes(yellow vests) anti-government revolt, followed by the Covid pandemic and then the war in Ukraine. And when he was re-elected in 2022, Macron no longer had an absolute majority in parliament.But his woes deepened considerably when he gambled on calling asudden and inconclusive snap parliamentary electionin June 2024, at a time when Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (NR) was at a historic high after itsEuropean election win. Parliament is now split between three blocs: the left, the centre and the far right, which has increased its vote. No bloc has an absolute majority. Meanwhile, Macron’s centrist base has begun to fragment.“The crisis inFranceruns very deep,” said Rémi Lefebvre, a professor of political science at the University of Lille. “The problem is there are actually several crises mixed together. There’s a financial crisis of [public] debt, a social crisis of inequality, a weakness of political parties, and then there is the rise of the far right. Macron is not the sole cause of the crisis; it’s all those different factors, but Macron has accelerated those factors.”To prevent the government being ousted this week, Macron and his centrist ally, the new prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu, appealed to the Socialist party. The government offered a highly symbolic suspension of the only major change of Macron’s second term: the 2023pensions lawthat introduced a gradual rise in the retirement age from 62 to 64.Lefebvre said Macron’s second term risked looking “chaotic” and ineffective. His choice not to appoint a leftwing government last year – when aleft alliancewon the greatest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority – had been seen as damaging democracy, he said.Stewart Chau, the director of polling at Verian Group, said: “If there’s one political personality or political movement that emerges extremely weakened from the sequence which began with the snap election of July 2024, it’sEmmanuel Macronand his centrist party, Renaissance. That is clear in every study.”Polls this month have shown that only about 14-16% of voters have confidence in Macron. Even his global presence, which once boosted his image at home, no longer lifts his ratings. “His popularity has constantly declined in recent months, despite a significant international news cycle,” Chau said.Support had dropped among Macron’s voters because he was seen as lacking empathy for people’s daily concerns, Chau said.“One of Macron’s biggest promises as president had been his vow to block the path of the far-right National Rally, saying that no one would ever have reason to vote for them again,” he added.But since Macron became president, more people have voted for the RN and view the party as a credible alternative.“That is a real shift,” Chau said. “Previously, some people had voted for extremes, saying it was a protest vote. Today, a lot of French people think it’s no longer simply a protest vote, it’s an alternative – and Macron is, perhaps, responsible for that.”The political historian, Jean Garrigues, said Macron’s image was now probably the worst of any president since France’s current political system, the Fifth Republic, began in 1958.“He has dropped to an exceptional level of unpopularity but, above all, an exceptional level of hatred,” Garrigues said. “[His Socialist predecessor] François Hollande also experienced record unpopularity but didn’t experience the same level of being detested as Emmanuel Macron.”Garrigues said this public rejection had roots that ran deeper than the current crisis. Macron arrived in 2017 amid strong hope and expectation built around a kind of mythology of the “man of the moment”, he said, but disappointment followed when voters felt his promises to work with all political sides and “permanently listen to citizens” were not materialising.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeThe far rightanalysisShareReuse this content"

Duringa speech in Egypt, Trump turned to Meloni – the only woman at the event – and called her “beautiful”. “In the United States, it would be the end of your political career,” he said. “But I’ll take the risk. Do you mind if I say you’re beautiful? Because you truly are beautiful.”The US president later praised her as “an inspiration to all” in reference to the English version of her book, I Am Giorgia: My Roots, My Principles, which has a foreword by his sonDonald TrumpJr.In August,Meloni also hit backafter discovering that doctored photos of her and other prominent Italian women had been posted on a pornographic website, saying she was “disgusted” and expressing “solidarity and support to all the women who have been offended, insulted and violated”.Explore more on these topicsGiorgia MeloniItalyWomenGenderEuropeDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli government and Hamas continue totrade blameover violations of the truce.The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday that it had brought about 560 tonnes of food a day on average intoGazasince the ceasefire began, but it was still below what was needed.Its spokesperson Abeer Etefa said: “We’re still below what we need, but we’re getting there ... The ceasefire has opened a narrow window of opportunity, and WFP is moving very quickly and swiftly to scale up food assistance.”Aid trucks were lined up at the Kissufim crossing betweenIsraeland Gaza since the early hours. It is one of the few entry points where lorries load supplies on the Israeli side before heading back into Gaza.As aid entry was delayed into the strip, Israel continued to fire on Palestinians. The Israeli army shelled a car which had crossed past the ceasefire line with Israel in the Zeytoun neighbourhood of Gaza, killing nine people.“They had crossed the so-called ‘yellow line’, an imaginary boundary mentioned by the Israeli army. I am certain the family couldn’t distinguish between the yellow and red lines because there are no actual physical markers on the ground,” said Mahmoud Basal, the spokesperson for the Gaza civil defence.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Friday that the yellow line in Gaza will soon be physically marked.View image in fullscreenTrucks wait at the Kissufim crossing.Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty ImagesDrivers often wait for hours for clearance to pass, with long delays leaving many stranded in the heat. Although 600 trucks are meant to enter Gaza each day, fewer than half that number make it through, and even that target falls short of the vast needs on the ground. Stringent restrictions on what can be transported means that some convoys are forced to turn back.During the war, Israel shut down entry and exit routes, largely blocking off food and medicine, which in turn caused afamine in parts of Gaza.The UN said it would take time to reverse the famine in Gaza and urged the opening of all crossing points. Etefa said the WFP had five distribution points up and running but wanted to get to 145 in order to “flood Gaza with food”.The WFP said it had not begun distribution in Gaza City, pointing to the continued closure of two border crossings, Zikim and Erez, to the north of Gaza where the humanitarian crisis is most acute.“Access to Gaza City and northern Gaza is extremely challenging,” Etefa said, adding that convoys of wheat flour and ready-to-eat food parcels were struggling to move along damaged or blocked roads from the south of the devastated territory.Though small amounts of nutrition products have reached the north, relief convoys were still unable to move significant quantities of food there, as well as other areas.View image in fullscreenThe devastated Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“We’ve had 57 trucks yesterday [enter southern and central Gaza]. We consider this a breakthrough, but we’re not yet at the level of around 80-100 trucks a day,” Etefa said.The ceasefire deal, signed last week, between Israel andHamasraised hopes of a surge of humanitarian aid finally reaching the territory after two years of war, but most restrictions have remained in place, throttling the supply of desperately needed assistance.Tens of thousands of tonnes of supplies are positioned in neighbouring countries such as Jordan and Egypt. Underthe terms of the first phase of the deal, aid was meant to surge into the territory and humanitarian groups were preparing to bring large amounts of vital aid to starving people in Gaza this weekend.The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that infectious diseases are “spiralling out of control”, with only 13 of the territory’s 36 hospitals even partially functioning.“Whether meningitis … diarrhoea, respiratory illnesses, we’re talking about a mammoth amount of work,” Hanan Balkhy, the regional director for the UN health body, told Agence France-Presse in Cairo.‘One of the oldest urban centres on the planet’: Gaza’s rich history in ruinsRead moreIn a separate update, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory said on Thursday it had been scaling up deliveries of medical supplies to health facilities since theGazaceasefire came into effect.But as Israel and Hamas continue to trade blame over breaches of the truce, there is a risk of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepening by the day.Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return the remains of deceased hostages. On Monday, Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but has handed back only nine of 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins ofGaza.Turkey has deployed dozens of disaster relief specialists to help search for bodies under the rubble.Gaza’s civil defence agency estimates that thebodies of about 10,000 peopleare trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings. The task ahead of the rescuers is immense given that there is an estimated 60m tonnes of rubble across the territory.The US president, Donald Trump, has said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas failed to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap of them, they’d do that,” Trump was quoted as saying to CNN in a brief telephone call when asked what would happen if Hamas refused to disarm.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelAidnewsShareReuse this content"

Though the group was a less obvious presence in the last months of the conflict, in the absence of any alternative, it remained the closest the increasingly devastated territory had to a ruler.Its administrative officials continued to be key interlocutors for humanitarian organisations. Its armed police units hunted looters, armed gangs, clans who challenged its authority, the more outspoken critics among ordinary Palestinians and militia groups backed by Israel.This campaign now appears to have become a priority for Hamas – and it requires weapons, which Hamas is supposed to relinquish if the current ceasefire deal reached last week is to harden into anything resembling a durable peace.For Hamas, there are now new priorities, and they do not involve giving up guns. Senior officials have already made this clear, as have some involved in the tortuous negotiations under way on the second phase of Donald Trump’s 20-point “plan for peace”. Instead, the group has moved fast to assert its authority across the 47% ofGazato which the population of 2.3 million hungry, weak and traumatised people are confined now that the Israeli military has withdrawn from its previous positions.‘I can breathe again’: Israel’s Zikim beach open for first time since 7 October attackRead moreIn recent days, there have been skirmishes, shootings and a public execution of seven unidentified “traitors and collaborators” in Zeitoun, a ruined neighbourhood to the east of Gaza City. Though the group may not be able to deter enemies, rivals and ordinary criminals through the certainty of punishment, it clearly believes it can do so through spectacular, terrifying armed violence.This may appal onlookers, but not necessarily all of those whose lives have been blighted by the collapse in rule of law and social order in Gaza during the conflict.Some undoubtedly oppose the new rough justice. “You can’t correct one mistake with another,” an activist in central Gazatold the BBC. “Executions without fair trial are a crime. May God guide our people.”But Najla Jundiya, from the central town of Deir al-Balah, said she supported the new Hamas campaign.“I won’t hide it … I am very worried about the chaos currently happening in Gaza and I strongly encourage the measures taken against thieves and those causing chaos until a responsible government takes over to maintain safety and security,” the 36-year-old told the Guardian.One reason for the anarchy is that Israel refused to outline any alternative government to Hamas throughout the conflict and has blocked any role there for the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial authority over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Despite Israeli efforts to promotearmed gangsas a counterweight to Hamas on the ground, the result is a vacuum which Hamas can now fill.“When you have a complete and total destruction of a society, the ones who can maintain some sort of monopoly of violence will rule … Hamas has been by far the most successful in terms of deploying force and getting violence under control,” said H A Hellyer,an expert at London’s RUSIand the Center for American Progress in Washington.Israel and Hamas trade blame over truce violations as tensions rise over return of hostages’ bodiesRead moreThe importance to Hamas of its current effort to eliminate rivals was underlined by comments made by Trump last week suggesting Hamas had been given a green light to use force to prevent “bad things” happening. This could only have come about if Qatar or another trusted interlocutor had passed on to the US a specific request from Hamas to be allowed to continue its crackdown. Almost simultaneously, however,Trump said: “If [Hamas] don’t disarm, we will disarm them. And it will happen quickly and perhaps violently.” He escalated that threat late on Thursday, saying: “If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.”Trump’s plan calls for the establishment of a transitional administration staffed by politically unaligned Palestinian technocrats under international oversight. It also specifies that Hamas and other armed factions in Gaza will be excluded from the future governance of Palestinian territories. There is no agreed timeline for any of this. In fact, there is no agreement at all.The most likely scenario is that Hamas surrenders its minimal remaining stocks of heavier offensive weapons that could target Israel, but refuses to handover the kind of lighter arms that will allow it to crush any opposition to its rule. This falls short of what Trump – and Israel – demand, but may be sufficient.As for the exclusion from future governance, these recent days are likely to prove decisive. Hamas may well give up any formal role in Gaza, but is very likely to remain the “de facto authority” for the foreseeable future.Explore more on these topicsHamasGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.“With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.”Technically, Andrew will retain the dukedom, which can only be removed by an act of parliament, but he will not use it. The title, in effect, remains extant but inactive, like the HRH (His Royal Highness) honorific.It is understood the decision was taken in close consultation with his brother, King Charles, and in recognition of the fact that his personal issues continued to be an unwelcome distraction from the work of the wider royal family.The king is understood to be glad of the outcome. The Prince of Wales was also consulted, along with other family members.Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, will also not use her title and be known simply asSarah Ferguson. The titles of their two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will remain unaffected.The agreement was made after high-level meetings at Buckingham Palace as aides were said to have finally reached a “tipping point”.There was understood to be “concern” and “anxiety” within the royal household about the continual headlines causing serious reputational risk to the monarchy.Allegations about Andrew concern his relationship with the late child sex offenderJeffrey Epstein, and recent details of his relationship with a prominent figure involved in the China spying case.This week the Guardianpublished extractsfrom the posthumous memoir of Andrew’s accuser Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, aged 41. In the book she claimed the prince “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”. Andrew has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre when she was 17, and settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.In her book, due to be published on Tuesday, Giuffre describes meetings with Andrew. In one passage, she recounts what she said happened in London one evening.“Back at the house, [Ghislaine] Maxwell and Epstein said goodnight and headed upstairs, signalling it was time that I take care of the prince. In the years since, I’ve thought a lot about how he behaved. He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.“He seemed in a rush to have intercourse. Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent. In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.“The next morning, Maxwell told me: ‘You did well. The prince had fun.’ Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called ‘Randy Andy’.”Late on Friday Giuffre’s family said the decision about Andrew’s titles was “vindication for Virginia”.“We, the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, believe that Prince Andrew’s decision to give up his titles is vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere,” they said in a statement.They added: “Further, we believe it is appropriate for King Charles to remove the title of Prince.”It has also been reported that Andrew held meetings in 2018 and 2019 withCai Qi, a member of China’s ruling politburo. Cai wassuspected of being the recipient of sensitive informationallegedly passed to China by two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing.The case against Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash wasrecently dropped by the CPSand both have denied wrongdoing.Andrew has already been stripped of his military titles and charity affiliations and banned from using his HRH honorific.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”He is said to have signed off with: “A, HRH The Duke of York, KG.”Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.In 2008 he pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, for which he served time in jail.Also late on Friday, documents were released in the US showing Prince Andrew took flights on Epstein’s private jet on four occasions.The prince is listed on flight logs as having flown from Luton to Edinburgh on 1 September 2006, with the convicted sex trafficker Maxwell, as well as a flight from 12 May 2000, where he is named as travelling with Epstein, Maxwell, the celebrity chef Adam Perry Lang, a bodyguard and three others.Two further flights from 1999 also displayed the name “Prince Andrew”, alongside the royal protection officer Steve Burgess.The wife of the disgraced former New Jersey senator Bob Menendez, Gwendolyn Beck and a woman named Claire Hazel are also listed on one of the 1999 flights – with Epstein and Maxwell travelling on both.The flight logs surfaced after the US House oversight committee published hundreds of further documents from Epstein’s estate on Friday.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchySarah FergusonKing Charles IIIJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

His HRH style was put in abeyance, and he was stripped of all his military and charity patronages.The humiliation, then, will have been hard for a man who so clearly cherishes his status. Now it is complete.He has always clung stubbornly to his dukedom, a gift from his mother on the morning of his wedding in 1986, along with the titles the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. And to his prestigious Garter role as Royal Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter. He will no longer use any of them, with immediate effect.And he has always, including in Friday’s statement agreeing to put them in abeyance, vehemently denied the allegations against him. He maintains he did not have sex with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Epstein who died in April by suicide aged 41, and whom he claimed he had never met yet paid millions to in order to settle a civil sexual assault case.The headlines will not go away. With each one, the risk of reputational damage to the monarchy is graver. Behind the walls of Buckingham Palace, it has been decided, enough is enough.Andrew’s acceptance of his fate comes on the eve of the posthumous publication of Giuffre’s memoir, due out next week,exclusive extracts from whichhave been published by the Guardian this week. More unwelcome coverage was, perhaps, inevitable. Certainly palace aides would have feared so.Charles is due to make a historic visit to the Holy See next week, when he will become the first English monarch since Henry VIII split with Rome in 1534 to pray publicly with the pope and head of the Catholic church. The king will not have wanted coverage of that occasion to be overshadowed by yet more vocal cries for Andrew to relinquish his titles.Pressure has clearly been ramped up by other senior royals on the eighth in line to the throne.It was a bad week in which Andrew found himself linked to the collapsed China spy case when it emerged he had held meetings withCai Qi, the member of China’s politburo at the centre of the spy scandal. They had met on at least three occasions between 2018 and 2019, and the prince had invited him to Buckingham Palace for lunch in 2018.The week had begun with leaked emails allegedly showing that far from cutting off contact with Epstein in December 2010, as he had claimed in his 2019 Newsnight interview with Maitlis,he was apparently in touch with the disgraced US financierin February 2011.The emails purported to show Andrew messaging Epstein on publication of that famous photograph of the prince with his arm around Giuffre, saying that they were “in this together”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFriday’s statement presents this as Andrew’s decision, yet it would certainly have been made by the palace. Charles will not have relished taking the drastic step of forcibly removing the dukedom. The last time a dukedom was taken away from a senior royal was more than 100 years ago, according to the historian Anthony Seldon, who told the BBC: “That was in 1919, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – lost the title of Duke of Albany for fighting on the German side during World War One.”It would also have required an act of parliament.Andrew is also a brother: a brother Charles has hitherto loyally included in family occasions, though Andrew will not be present at the royal family’s Christmas celebrations this year.The prince’s continued obduracy over doing the “honourable” thing will have saddened and frustrated the king, who seems to have finally grasped the nettle and found a way to persuade his sibling this is in the family and the monarchy’s best interests.So what is left for the son of the late Queen Elizabeth? He remains a prince and eighth in the line of succession. He is also still theoretically a counsellor of state – a stand-in for the king if he’s overseas or unwell. It is only theoretical, because as a non-working royal the palace has already made clear he would never be asked. As with many of his titles, it’s classed as “inactive”.But all the other vestiges of his once senior royal role are now no more.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewKing Charles IIIMonarchyJeffrey EpsteinanalysisShareReuse this content"

They downplayed the idea of reducing the eligibility criteria for Motability cars, but said the option of scrapping the VAT and insurance premium tax exemptions was “more likely”.Another change under consideration is the idea of removing luxury brands such as BMW and Mercedes from the scheme, under which a minority of claimants top up with an advance to get a more premium car. These premium brands only make up 40,000, or about 5%, of the 800,000 Motability cars.Adding VAT and insurance premium tax to the Motability car’s price tag would mean more claimants would need to make an advance payment for their cars. Estimates suggest it could bring in about £1.2bn, although Whitehall sources suggested it would not be likely to raise as much as that.Although not a direct cut to the benefits bill, further attempts to reduce tax exemptions for the Motability scheme would still be controversial, with critics warning the Treasury to listen to the concerns of disabled people.James Taylor, the director of strategy at the charity Scope, said it could “heap extra costs on to disabled people all over Britain”. “Motability is a cost-effective way for disabled people to be able to use adapted cars. Often these cars need to be able to accommodate equipment, carers, and disability related aids,” he said.“Life costs more if you are disabled. Energy and day-to-day living costs remain stubbornly high across the board. The government shouldn’t be looking to ramp up costs on disabled people. They could leave more disabled people isolated, and less able to get into work.”Emma Vogelmann, the co-chief executive of the disability group Transport for All, said: “As disabled people we often find public transport is unusable – broken pavements, nonexistent bus routes, and packed stations we can’t navigate. A Motability car changes that – it allows us to work, shop, and do the school run. Scaling back the scheme would lock disabled people away from daily life. Does the chancellor want to take away our freedom?”Cuts to the Motability scheme have previously been backed by the Conservatives. Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said on Friday that the chancellor was “following our lead”.“I’m glad she’s been keeping an eye on our welfare announcements, but the government should be doing much more to fix welfare and reform the Motability scheme,” she said.“Motability should be there for people with serious disabilities. That’s why the Conservatives would stop people with low-level mental health problems and neurodiversity – like mild depression and ADHD – getting free cars. We would also put an end to taxpayers funding luxury cars on Motability, instead ensuring every penny goes towards supporting genuinely disabled people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scheme is run by a private company, overseen by a charitable foundation, that buys new cars then leases them to claimants for three years before selling them on.Rachael Maskell, a Labour MP who was one of the strongest critics of the government’s abandoned disability cuts, said the “government must adopt a process of co-production [involving disabled people] and then follow the evidence … Random top-slicing or cuts often cost more in the long run”.A Treasury spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation around changes to tax outside of fiscal events.”While Labour’s attempts to cut disability benefits were largely abandoned earlier this year, government sources suggested the chancellor continues to believe the system is unsustainable in its current form and in some cases disincentivises people from seeking work.Reeves is expected to introduce a significant package of tax increases and spending cuts in her 26 November budget to offset a downgrade in the Office forBudgetResponsibility (OBR) forecasts for economic growth.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said on Thursday that the chancellor could be forced to look again at welfare savings alongside tax rises. The IFS said options could include scrapping the pensions triple lock, a fresh drive to cut health-related and disability benefits, and limiting growth in spending on special educational needs.The OBR reviewed its forecasting model over the summer and is expected to say the public finances look £10-20bn weaker than it believed at the time of Reeves’s spring statement. The chancellor has expressed irritation at the timing of this review, which she believes would have been better done immediately after last year’s general election or in 2023.As well as tackling this deterioration, the chancellor must also deal with the £7bn cost of the U-turns on winter fuel and welfare. Reeves is hoping to build up more “headroom” against her fiscal rules, to avoid being buffeted by the bond markets.Government borrowing costs fell to their lowest level since July on Friday after Reeves’s comments on tax and spend appeared to reassure investors.Explore more on these topicsWelfareLabourBenefitsBudget 2025BudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he did not “recognise any claims of commitments or assurances”.Conservative MPs have accused ministers of breaking the law by giving China private assurances that they would wave through the proposed complex, which at 20,000 sq metres would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead.Oliver Robbins, the head of the Foreign Office, is in China this week discussing the embassy application and the refurbishments Britain wants to carry out on its own embassy in Beijing. The Guardianrevealed last yearthat China was refusing to let the works go ahead while the fate of its own embassy is being decided.Starmer has been keen to improve relations with Beijing as he seeks foreign investment to help build big infrastructure projects in the UK. But those attempts have faced multiple hurdles, including the two recent rows over spying and the proposed new embassy.Beijing bought the site of the prospective embassy near the Tower ofLondonfor £255m in 2018. Tower Hamlets council refused permission for the project in 2022, prompting wrangling over whether it could go ahead.China resubmitted its application shortly after Labour came to power and Xi Jinping raised the matter directly with Starmer in their first call in August 2024.Starmer told Xi on the margins of the G20 summit in November 2024: “You raised the Chinese embassy building in London when we spoke on the telephone. We have since taken action by calling in that application.”Angela Rayner took over the decision last year in her role as housing secretary, but was replaced by Reed days before a decision deadline of 9 September. That deadline was pushed back until 21 October after China redacted large portions of its plans for what it said were security reasons.Downing Street this week said the decision had been delayed again in the midst of a separate controversy over two British citizens accused of spying for China. The case against the pair, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry,collapsed last month, prompting accusations that the government had intervened in order to preserve diplomatic ties with Beijing.Parliamentarians wrote to Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, Matthew Collins, his deputy who drafted the government’s evidence in the case, and Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, with a series of questions on Friday night.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In her book, Giuffre claimed the prince behaved as if he “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”.Andrew has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre, a victim of Epstein’s, and settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.It has also been reported that Andrewheld meetingsin 2018 and 2019 with Cai Qi,a member of China’s ruling politburo. Caiwas suspected of beingthe recipient of sensitive information allegedly passed to China by two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing. The case against Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash wasrecently dropped by the CPSand both have denied wrongdoing.Emails recently published by the Mail on Sunday also appeared to show Andrew had been in contact with Epsteinlater than he had claimedin his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Friday, the county said it had reached another major settlement for $828m, pending approval by the board of supervisors, the county governing body, and the county claims board.Los Angeles approves $4bn payout to settle thousands of sexual abuse claimsRead more“Our settlements balance our obligation to compensate victims and treat their experiences with compassion, with the need to put strong protections in place to protect taxpayers from fraud,” Kathryn Barger, the chair of the Los Angeles county board of supervisors, said in a statement.There are still 2,500 other unresolved cases, not covered by either settlement, that remain, and that number is expected increase, according to the county. The settlements have added to the county’sunprecedented financial problems, which mounted after the wildfires that ravaged the region earlier this year.County officials said in announcing the new settlement that “the credibility of every individual claim will be reviewed, and plaintiffs determined to have submitted fraudulent claims will receive no money from the settlement”.Authorities are investigating allegations that some people were paid to file claims. Nine plaintiffs included in the first settlement said they were paid to file a lawsuit, and four of have said they made fraudulent claims, according to a Los Angeles Times investigation.The lawsuits filed by thousands of people alleged they were mistreated and sexually abused in foster care and juvenile detention facilities in the county with claims as far back as 1959. They were able to sue because of aCalifornialaw that took effect in 2020 that suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims, allowing them to bring cases for three years.The county said its ability to assess the validity of allegations was hampered by a lack of records, the sheer number of cases and court ordered limits on legal discovery, officials said.Under the $4bn settlement, the amount paid to each plaintiff could range from $100,000 to $3m. If the latest settlement is approved, individual awards will be determined based on factors including the severity of abuse alleged.In its statement, the county said that claims brought by the law firm Downtown LA Law Group, or DTLA, in the April settlement will undergo additional scrutiny.Some of the plaintiffs represented by the firm told the LA Times that people they met outside a county social services office offered them money to submit claims, drove them to the DTLA firm and then paid them amounts ranging from $50 to $200 each. Non-attorneys are prohibited from soliciting people to sign up for lawsuits with a firm under California law.DTLA has denied any wrongdoing. Plaintiffs represented by the firm could be asked to do additional interviews and provide more proof of allegations, depending on the nature of the claim and the suspected fraud, the county said.The county may also refer attorneys accused of paying for claims to the state bar for possible disciplinary action, officials said.DTLA Law Group said it filtered through nearly 13,000 inquiries and only accepted a fraction of the cases.“We do not pay our clients to file lawsuits, and we strongly oppose such actions. If we ever became aware that anyone associated with us, in any capacity, did such a thing, we would end our relationship with them immediately,” the firm said. “We want justice for real victims.”The county has put into place more safeguards to prevent abuse and act quickly if it does occur, officials said. That includes a new hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against county employees that is expected to be in place by year’s end.But officials said the law allowing the lawsuits has placed severe financial stress on the county and required cuts to “critical” programs and services and that “common sense fixes that strike the right balance for victims and LA county and other public entities” are needed.“LA county and other local governments must balance their obligations to past victims with the need to avoid ruinous financial impacts that would undermine the very social safety net services that our young people, families and communities depend on today,” said Joe Nicchitta, the acting county chief executive.The $4bn settlement in April far surpassed a $2.6bn settlement reached in 2022 with Boy Scouts of America the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in US history at the time.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesWest CoastCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Several employees expressed concerns that the network was intentionally aidingDonald Trumpand the Republican party.One anonymous employee said that Fox should “change the misogynist, racist, rightwing content”, adding: “Fox News is a propaganda machine for the Republican party NOT a news organization and should be acknowledged as such. It is embarrassing to tell people that I work here as even conservatives know [Fox News Channel] and [Fox Business Network] are biased information sources – not news.” While the employee called the work environment “great”, they said “the content is hateful and has made the world a more divided and angry place”.“I sometimes go home fighting back tears,” an employee said. “This network made me question my morals. Have I sold my soul to the devil?”An employee said the network should “get out of Trump’s pocket” and realize that its most prominent hosts – including Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity – “are a total embarrassment, peddling BS and conspiracy theories”. “Many days I feel like I am part of the problem and FNC is contributing to hatred in this country,” the person said.“This company aligns itself with the current administration and has lost its integrity,” an employee said. “I wish there was purpose for what we do other than pushing the brand, ideology and political will of [the president],” another comment read.Many of the comments dealt specifically with the network’s conservative opinion hosts, rather than its news division. “I wish that management would crack down on conspiracy theories and hateful rhetoric spewed by such hosts,” an employee said. “We need to stand up for our real journalists and have more focus on news gathering and reporting to change our credibility and the way we are perceived.”An employee asked for “a commitment from opinion hosts/producers to only tell viewers the truth, and to bolster their arguments with hard, proven facts given in full context, rather than spin or reckless conjecture that causes harm to real people”.Fox has said that the survey responses are irrelevant to Smartmatic’s case because they were made months prior to the network’s coverage of the 2020 presidential election, which was the basis of the lawsuit. “There is no connection between these comments and the states of mind of the individuals responsible for the at-issue statements,” the network said in response, referring to the on-air comments made by such hosts as Jeanine Pirro and Lou Dobbs. The organization that conducted the survey, Great Place to Work,ultimately certified Foxas one of the best places to work in 2020, with the vast majority of network employees endorsing it as an employer. It’s also not clear whether the quotes cited in the filing come from a wide swath of employees or from a few particular ones.But Smartmatic believes the critical comments from employees provide evidence thatFoxexecutives were on notice of internal concerns about what the network was airing. The company has also argued that Fox’s board of directors failed to act on the results of the survey, which it said provided a “stark warning” about the network’s programming.A few employees quoted in the survey called directly for the imposition of new editorial guidelines. “I would suggest FOX put in some general ethical guidelines or positions overseeing editorial content so that we can limit the spread of insensitive and/or false information, racism and xenophobia,” one said.One employee expressed a belief that “there’s a fear that we cannot anger the president or his most zealous supporters, and have abdicated all pretense of truthful reporting”, a comment in line with Smartmatic’s contention that Fox pivoted to a strategy of embracing Trump’s election-denying claims out of a fear of alienating viewers. (Fox has denied such a “pivot” and argued that it did not defame Smartmatic in its coverage of the 2020 election.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Later this year, the parties are scheduled to appear in front of a New York judge and petition him to grant their motions for summary judgment, asking him to rule on key aspects of the case before it ever reaches a jury.But in a wrinkle on Thursday, Smartmatic was formally added to an indictment filed by the Department of Justice last year against a few company executives, accusing them of participating in a scheme to bribe election officials in the Philippines related to the country’s 2016 elections.“We can now categorically deny those allegations,” a Smartmatic spokesperson said. “This is wrong on the facts and wrong on the law. We will contest the claims, and we are confident we will prevail in court.”While the indictment might not have a direct impact on the merits of the case, which hinges on whether Smartmatic can prove that Fox hosts and guests made knowingly false statements about the company’s conduct during the 2020 US election, the charges could theoretically factor into estimates about the value of the company and how much it might be owed in damages if a jury finds in its favor.Judicial hearing officer Alan C Marin ruled on Thursday that Smartmatic must produce documents regarding the effect of the alleged conduct on the company’s business. Fox has repeatedly said that Smartmatic’s estimated damages are wildly inflated.Explore more on these topicsFox NewsDonald TrumpRepublicansFoxUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It highlighted three reasons to be anxious: overstretched valuations for tech stocks; volatility in government bond markets as they absorb fast-growing debts; and risks in the burgeoning private credit sector.Georgieva saidit was this last worry, in particular, that exercised her. Since bank regulation was tightened in the wake of the catastrophic global financial crisis of 2008, other less heavily scrutinised non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), such as investment firms, have piled into the lending business.The IMF frets that this huge “shadow bank” sector could unleash global chaos if loans start to go bad – particularly since many of the firms involved are funded via borrowing from mainstream banks.“Adverse developments at these institutions – such as downgrades or falling collateral values – could significantly affect banks’ capital ratios,” it said. In total, it found banks in the US and Europe have $4.5trn of exposure to NBFIs.View image in fullscreenJP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon said ‘when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more’.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/ReutersThe recent collapse of the UScar parts supplier First Brandsand the sub-prime auto lender Tricolor, which had relied heavily on complex private credit financing, were regarded by some market veterans – including JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon – as a sign that more problems may be in store. “I probably shouldn’t say this but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more,” hetold an analyst call this week.Within days, market fears had turned to a pair of shaky regional banks –Western Alliance and Zions Bank– and the sell-off continued into Friday.The Trump administration, not a fan of financial regulation, appears relaxed about the issue, and more concerned withhammering Chinafor its perceived unfair industrial and trade policies.Washington is expected to use its chair status among the G20 group of countries next year to press for more international action to curb “imbalances” such as Beijing’s persistent trade surpluses – with the IMF playing a role in policing member countries’ policies.In DC this week, though, it was the risks of more “cockroaches” emerging from the vast and globally connected US financial system that were exercising policymakers: especially veterans of the global financial crisis in 2008.Asked about the issue of private credit at her press conference on Thursday, Georgieva said: “We are asking the question, what should be done to have more oversight and a better view of what is happening there?” She added that the question “keeps me awake every so often at night”.For Rachel Reeves, the whirl of meetings in the US capital was a welcome reminder that the UK is far from alone in facing pressures on tax and spend, skittish bond markets – and tariff chaos. The British chancellor’s energetic Canadian counterpart, François-Philippe Champagne, with whom she has struck up a friendship, also has a tough budget to land next month, as Mark Carney’s administration comes to terms with a new, harsher relationship with its neighbour to the south.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The yield, which moves in the opposite direction to prices, determines the interest rate the Treasury pays to borrow from investors.Analysts said the gilt moves were also part of a “flight to safety” as markets fret about the credit sector, but Treasury strategists were gratified nevertheless.Meanwhile, as if to underscore the IMF’s concerns about a “sudden, sharp correction” in markets, its global financial stability review was launched at a press conference on Tuesday morning to a background ofplunging stock prices. The fall was driven by Donald Trump upping the ante with China, posting a warning on his Truth Social platform that the US could cut off – of all things – cooking oil imports in retaliation for Beijing not buying its soya beans. Wall Street later rallied to close up on the day.Across town that same day the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, was telling an audience of investors at the Institute for International Finance conference that “we have to watch very carefully just how stretched valuations are becoming”. With typical understatement, he added: “There are very different potential paths at the moment.”As the IMF was careful to point out, any reversal in the AI boom would have real-world impacts, as tech companies backed away from the investment that is powering the construction of vast datacentres across the US and beyond – and driving a wave of tech imports from Asia. “The decline in aggregate investment could be rather sharp,” it warned.And a crisis, if it came, would hit a politically fragmented global economy, in which many governments’ finances are already stretched –with debt on course to hit its highest level sincethe aftermath of the second world war.The temperatures in DC were unseasonably chilly this week, but the IMF did its best to warn policymakers, preoccupied with domestic struggles, of the mounting risk the global backdrop could cool sharply in the months to come.Explore more on these topicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsGlobal economyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

CNBC reported it was for $140m a year, much higher than the $90m the Walt Disney-owned ESPN was paying each season for F1, which it has broadcast since 2018.Apple’s deal begins next year. The iPhone maker will stream F1 onAppleTV, its critically acclaimed streaming service that won 22 Emmy awards this year but lacks the scale to compete with industry leaders such as Netflix and Disney+ despite billions of dollars in investment.F1 joins Apple’s growing sports lineup, which includes Major League Soccer and Friday Night Baseball. Live sports have become a key battleground in the streaming industry as platforms compete for costly rights that attract loyal fans, reduce churn and increase ad revenue.“We’re thrilled to expand our relationship withFormula Oneand offer Apple TV subscribers in the US front row access to one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports on the planet,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice-president of services.As part of the agreement, Apple TV will host all practice, qualifying, sprint sessions and grands prix. Select races and all practice sessions throughout the season will also be available to watch for free in the Apple TV app.The deal follows the box office success of the Apple-produced F1 film, which has grossed more than $628m worldwide, according to IMDb’s Box Office Mojo. The movie will make its global streaming debut on Apple TV on 12 December.Formula One added nearly 90 million new fans last year, with China showing the biggest percentage rise after the sport’s post-Covid return to Shanghai, according to Nielsen Sports data.Explore more on these topicsApple TV+Formula OneSport TVAppleMotor sportTV streamingnewsShareReuse this content"

The recent collapses of Tricolor, a used car seller and sub-prime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto parts supplier, have put the finance industry on edge, almost two decades after problems in the sub-prime mortgage lending market set the stage for the global financial crisis.“When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase CEO,ominously cautioned analyststhis week, after the US’s largest bank disclosed a $170m charge tied to Tricolor’s bankruptcy. “Everyone should be forewarned on this one.”As the car lending market shows signs of strain, business around repossessions is booming. “Right now, we’re overwhelmed with work,” George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, Michigan, said.JP Morgan boss says more ‘cockroaches’ will emerge after private credit sector failuresRead moreThe so-called repo man, tasked with recovering vehicles from drivers who default on loan agreements, waseulogized in music by Bruce Springsteenand in the 1984 Alex Cox film Repo Man.Repossessions – especially in the sub-prime auto market – are on the rise, according to Badeen, who is also president of the Allied Finance Adjusters trade body. “We’ve seen some sub-primes making changes, which probably indicates they’re having issues,” he said. “They’re not financing cars like they were. Two years ago they were financing anybody.”While few are bracing for a crisis on the scale of the crash that pushed the world economy to the brink in 2008 – sub-prime auto lending is a fraction of the $1.7tn overall car lending business – the collapses of Tricolor and First Brands have drawn the car sector into the spotlight, amid fears they highlight credit stress in lower-income households, as well as problems in credit markets tied to auto debt.First Brands received approval for $500m rescue financing from a bankruptcy court, although Scott Greenberg, an attorney for First Brand’s lenders, told the court of concerns that they could be “lending good money after bad”.The wider fear – and the one causing consternation among investors – is what the troubles inside this one market might indicate about broader pressures rippling throughout the wider economy. “Distress in auto lending broadly is often seen as a bellwether to changing circumstances in theUS economy, because Americans particularly in the lower-income brackets tend to put their highest priority in auto payments,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School.“Having a car is essential to being able to work,” he added. “So when we see stress in the auto financing market, we typically receive that as an indication that household finances are getting tighter.”An estimated 100 million Americans hold auto loans, with 85% of new car purchases and 55% of used car purchases financed. It is the third-largest consumer credit market in the US, behind mortgages and student loans.Problems in the auto loan industry have been manifesting for several years, as car prices rose sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic while inflation soared and interest rate increases followed. Paying off a new car required 42 weeks of income in 2023, according to Cox Automotive, up from about 33 before the pandemic.High prices meant bigger loans. The average monthly repayment now stands at more than $750.Car repossessions surged to their highest level since 2009 last year, according to Cox, with 1.73m vehicles seized, up 16% from the year prior and 43% from 2022.Car owners were found to be missing payments at the highest rate in more than 30 years in January, when a Fitch Ratings index monitoring the share of sub-prime auto borrowers at least 60 days past due on their loans hit 6.5%.“The consumer has been distressed for a little while,” Bill Nash, CEO of CarMax, the biggest seller of used cars in the US, told analysts last month after its lower sales and profits unnerved shareholders. “I think there’s some angst.”Auto loans are short-term investments, and Kevin Armstrong, author of Repo Blood: A Century of Auto Repossession History, believes they are often extended to consumers who may not be credit-worthy. For this reason, he said, auto loan delinquencies are often seen as clues – “one of the canaries in the coalmine” – to the health of the broader economy.Loan operators are now “giving out massive amounts of loan modification to try to move back delinquencies” to stave off repossession orders, Armstrong said. But they may only be buying time. “There’s a massive amount of recidivism when it comes to loan delinquencies,” he added.Armstrong traces the rise in repossessions to the pandemic, when stimulus checks and extra unemployment aid allowed consumers to pay up for pricier cars. “When Covid hit, prices went through the roof,” he said. “I watched people paying outrageous amounts for cars that just weren’t going to hold their value, and the dealers laughing all the way to the bank. They got hosed.”Now, coupled with higher mortgage or rental payments, high grocery bills and higher auto loan payments, he added: “Consumers got stuck with loan payments they can’t afford.”Under most loan agreements, the lender or leaseholder can repossess the car even if borrowers are only a few weeks behind in payments, in part because a borrower could try to hide the car if they know the lender is looking to repossess it – and potentially sell it at auction.First Brands: why a maker of spark plugs and wiper blades has Wall Street worriedRead moreThe job of repossessing a car is becoming harder, according to Badeen, with greater consumer rights awareness and a higher likelihood of confrontation. “We’ve had so much violence in recent years that we’ve had to train our people in what people like to call situational awareness and de-escalation,” he said. His company typically now sends tow trucks out with two people, one to pick up the car and another to keep watch.The clouds gathering over the auto lending market could grow darker. Should Congress fail to agree on a continuation of Covid-era healthcare subsidies, the political issue at the center of the current federal government shutdown, that could put more pressure on the finances of auto borrowers.“That whole mess comes out of Covid. It has an impact on individual people that many people don’t understand,” said Badeen. “Everything intertwines in some way, shape or form.”If a large sub-prime lender stumbles as a result of this pressure – Santander Consumer is the nation’s biggest, and was last yearfined $550mto resolve claims it violated consumer protection laws by placing borrowers with sub-prime credit into auto loans it knew carried an unacceptably high probability of default – there could be wider turbulence.Unlike First Brands, Tricolor sought bankruptcy protection last month under the shadow of fraud allegations that have prompted two federal investigations. Charles Gibbs, the attorney representing Tricolor’s court-appointed trustee, told a Texas court this month that initial reports “indicate potentially systemic levels of fraud”.“Tricolor’s failure is not necessarily indicative of what is immediately ahead for the sector as a whole, because of the special circumstances, but I would still see it as an economic warning indicator,” said House.Armstrong, too, was reluctant to call the failure of the companies, and the rise in repossessions, a trend. “But it’s on the verge,” he added.Explore more on these topicsUS economyAutomotive industryEconomicsConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Indeed, for his part, James’ only contribution to the discourse has been astatement of support for Israel. Otherwise, athletes have largely chosen to shut up and dribble.However, in December 2023, former NBA player and Guardian contributorEtan Thomasprovided a windowinto how many NBA players actually feel, noting that in response to his own public comments on Gaza he received “over a dozen messages from different active NBA players and even more from retired NBA players thanking me”. One anonymized player told him, “Their oppression is too forreal !! It’s just evil!” while another explained, “I was actually advised by my agent to stay far away from this topic unless I wanted theKyrie treatment….Hard to admit we’ve been hoodwinked our entire lives on Israel and if we say anything, we’re labeled anti semitic smh.”In order to better understand what is going on around athlete activism andGaza, we spoke to seven current and former athletes. Some players we spoke to were granted anonymity to protect them from reprisal for their comments.US Olympic trial runner Jesse Joseph was frank about his despair at the situation: “It’s been hard seeing the silence from so much of the professional running world, especially knowing that many of these athletes truly do want an end to the slaughter but don’t want to speak out on a public stage. … Athletes for the Palestinian national teams in multiple sports have been killed by Israel, yet most of the sporting world appears to be totally fine entering into competition with Israeli teams as if everything were normal.”He noted that “there are many pressures that prevent athletes from speaking out - fear of losing sponsorships, general fear of backlash, and fear of repression.”Another US Olympic trial runner, echoed this point: “It’s the conversations that don’t happen, and the impacts felt in the shadows that I’ve just had to accept. You never know if you’ll get passed up for a job, if you’re ending up on some surveillance list, or if it’s just a silent backing away of support that will make itself known in the future.”Still, Joseph underlined, compared to sport, in “other cultural fields that have similar pressures such as the film industry, people have been more outspoken. It helps to have a critical mass of voices. There’s safety and solidarity in numbers.”One of the issues we asked the athletes we spoke to about was whether players are being specifically counseled not to speak. A current athlete and former Olympian told us, “I have not been counseled at all. But, hey, I am notLeBron James.”His perspective is that what athletes struggle with most “is that focus on their sport and how they balance that with their political activism. And how they can signal to their sponsor, ‘Hey, my head is still in the game despite all the stuff I might be involved outside of it,’ and I think that is probably the most telling on whether or not a company fully pulls funding or not. Or resorts to silencing tactics.”Sponsorship, as every athlete we spoke to mentioned, is a critical issue.Nikki Dryden, two-time Olympic swimmer and human rights lawyer, told us, “Some athletes have morality clauses in their sporting contracts or sponsorship contracts, and whether this issue would be included or not, the fear that it could be used will silence some. These disrepute clauses are very broad and use threats and intimidation to keep athletes from speaking out. At the Olympics for example, if you violate anything in your athlete agreement you are threatened with having your Olympic results erased ... think about Manizha Talash, a 20-year-old refugee who was literally kicked out of the village by the IOC and left on her own on the streets of Paris!”A recently active NFL player echoed this concern: “I would guarantee that sponsors are part of the reason players don’t speak out about Gaza. Talking about homophobia is a piece of cake compared to talking about Israel in this moment. Sponsors are comfortable about that. When it comes to the war on Gaza, that feels way way more like there will be consequences to sponsorship for speaking out on the ‘wrong’ side.”In the most striking case of the players we spoke to, a women’s professional basketball player told us, “As a professional, one thing I did have to navigate was firing my agent, as it was revealed to me through her instagram stories that she was a raging Zionist, spreading false propaganda and frankly racist narratives that painted Palestinians as ‘savage’ or ‘terrorists’. This agent was/is a highly respected and well connected agent in the women’s basketball space, so maybe in theory I could be missing out on some brand deals, or playing opportunities. Maybe there are also opportunities I am not even aware I am missing out on due to my stance on Gaza, given there are a lot of powerful people in the NBA and WNBA who are Zionists.”“But,” the player added, “I feel much more satisfied standing on my principles and using my platform to speak out against a genocide that will go down in history as one if not the worst human rights abuses of our lifetime.”The former NFL player told us that one area of principal concern is the prospect of being labeled antisemitic. He told us, “When it comes to someone speaking about Israel, I think it is something that gets escalated because of the assumption of antisemitism. There seems to be socially a ranking of which issues are okay, and it seems like in the last hundred years, antisemitism has shot up that list.“Even if someone is incredibly well-educated on Gaza and also feel in a way that is left-leaning and feeling that there is a genocide and the reaction to October 7 is vastly overdone,” he continued, “I think there is hesitance to speaking out on that because people have had to walk back things based on investorship and thinks like that. It seems like a less normalized topic than something like gay marriage. … I think Israel in our country has been thought of as the victim because of the Holocaust for so long, it seems illogical that they would become the perpetrator of similar crimes.”A former international soccer player elaborated: “When you say, ‘Why are innocent people being murdered and maimed en masse?’ and the narrative gets flipped, and you are called ‘antisemitic,’ that’s gaslighting. That’s a tactic, it’s a form of deflection back at other people as if they’re the problem.” Similarly, the WNBA player noted that others are “afraid/confused by the antisemetic label.”Backlash and harassment are another significant and associated issue. The Olympian pointed to “the backlash on social media and the constant harassment and inundation and noise that brings with it,” adding that “there is an overarching narrative in the general population that athletes are supposed to be these entertainers and national representatives of all the people of the nation and as such they should really take this approach of ‘shut up and play.’”The basketball player we spoke to highlighted the dangers of “the McCarthyist response from government” and “Zionists gaslighting and doxxing people,” but also drew on personal experiences in college. “I would post as much info on my story as I could, which sometimes led to locker room discussions by teammates who had engaged in pretty good faith. I always knew that there was the chance of higher ups within my college program, coaches, administration, or donors, taking issue with what I had to say. One of the first instances of direct intimidation was when a family member of mine received threats from parents of a player on the team. This instance, amongst others, never discouraged my conviction to speak up. Again, I always felt that any lost opportunity in my career pales in comparison to what Gaza’s people are enduring.”The former international soccer player suggested that this issue is emblematic of systemic problems in sport more broadly: “Most athletes learn early that compliance is rewarded and that truth, or questioning the status quo, is punished. This conditioning does not just preserve order; it protects exploitation. Silencing happens quietly, through the fear of losing sponsorship, selection, or reputation, and through the violence of online attacks. Many fear being branded as something they are not, or accused of causing harm simply for naming it. I know this from decades of witnessing and experiencing these same patterns of behaviour in sport and beyond. The question is not just why athletes are not speaking out; it is what kind of culture and leadership ecosystem we have built, and who we have become within it, when silence feels like our best and only option. And in the end, what do we lose within our humanity in the process?”Former Olympian Dryden notes that this sort of potential backlash can lead to “some of the same fear, apprehension, confusion that many people are struggling with around the history of the region and a worry that they will say the wrong thing and be attacked in the media.” Part of the problem is that “many athletes are young and don’t always have time (or interest) to be educated on complex issues.” The recent NFL player felt similarly, noting that “Although Israel has gone down this road for decades, the conflict feels new to my generation in the US, whereas we are much more aware of other struggles like gay rights.”Then too there is the relative financial precarity of Olympic athletes. This can lead to different perspectives. The still-active Olympian told us that “perhaps political activism is tolerated in Olympic sports because the financial consequences are not as severe for business as they are for the NBA and NFL or whatever.” Dryden, by contrast, herself a former Olympian, felt that for Olympic athletes, “we are living on the financial margins already and live in a state of just feeling grateful for the opportunity...Sadly, this has a tendency to keep us silent and compliant.”The WNBA is a particularly interesting case. Although Natasha Cloud has been among the most outspoken active athletes in the world against the genocide, it is striking how little her colleagues have said on the subject despite their established record of social justice activism.The basketball player we spoke to tried to unpack for us why that might be. “For some reason, the courage to speak onPalestineseems to me like maybe it takes another degree of courage and also awareness,” she told us. “It’s an international issue and I think Americans tend to fail hard in that arena [with the] ‘I don’t know enough’ cop out, plus years of ant-Muslim and xenophobic propaganda, ‘the Middle East is always at war,’ ‘it’s too complicated,’ etc… I think some people maybe just like to think ‘it’s none of our business,’ whereas something like Black Lives Matter is very close to home and people feel empowered to speak on it as a predominantly Black league.”But, there is another dimension as well: direct familiarity with the Israeli context. She explained, “there is a good amount of women’s basketball players who have played in Israel!! I know multiple people playing there right now….[thumbs down emoji]. Which is insane to me but some people really just keep their head down, I guess? Like I know a lottt of W players have played there in their overseas career. So you have that experience and obviously the propaganda they take in, they pay well, etc.”She contrasted this to Natasha Cloud, who, she said, “played a season in Jordan. Which is a country with a good amount of Palestinian refugees. And I know for a fact that played a role in her stance because she said somewhere that her teammates in Jordan taught her about the conflict! Which is amazing.”Part of the frustration of athlete silence for Jesse Joseph is how impactful theycouldbe. He remarked on the success of fans and local runner in pressuring Saucony todrop sponsorshipof the Jerusalem Marathon “which runs through Occupied East Jerusalem” and the Denver Colfax Marathon todrop Chevronas a sponsor on grounds of genocide complicity.“Connecting with and amplifying the organizing of these local athletes and communities would be an incredible way to use the platform that high profile athletes have,” Joseph told us.Still, over two years of genocide, such leadership by athletes has been far more exception than rule.As the former international soccer player put it, “In 2022, when many people were speaking about migrant workers’ rights, Fifa just said that the players had to play, which of course is incorrect. Because it is political, it is about power. When you say ‘stay in your lane and just dribble,’ you’re saying don’t take our power away.”Unfortunately, when it comes to Gaza, too many players have listened.Nathan Kalman-Lamb is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of New Brunswick.

Hart was one of five former Team Canada World Junior players initially charged with sexual assault stemming from an incident in 2018, and, though acquitted earlier this year, remains suspended by the NHL until 1 December. Ina statementabout Hart’s contract signing, the Golden Knights said that the team remains “committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception” and that the team expects “that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward”.Blood, bias and the Battle of Florida: how the NHL’s dirtiest rivalry exposed hockey’s old-boy rotRead moreWhich sounds all well and good, but there’s a difference between expecting someone to meet a standard and maintaining it – or even enforcing it. It’s not surprising that Hart is back on the ice in theNHL. For one thing, he was indeed acquitted, along with the other four accused, which is technically grounds for readmittance, whether one agrees with the ruling or not. For the league, the union, and the teams, the story is – or can be – relatively simple: a player cleared by the courts is ready for a comeback. But the real reason Hart’s return will strike many as unsurprising is because, well, this is just how hockey works. That is, yes, everyone can talk about values and standards and expectations, but in reality hockey is still driven by silence.The 2018 sexual assault scandal was neither an isolated incident nor unprecedented. Shortly after the Team Canada story broke, the Canadian Hockey League and its member major junior leaguespublicizedthe findings of an independent review panel examining its hazing, bullying, harassment, and abuse policies. The paneldeterminedthat the leagues and its teams have “a systemic or ‘culture of embedded behaviours’, where off-ice misconduct is perpetuated, condoned, or ill-addressed” and that a “code of silence” existed when it came to reporting misconduct. As the allegations surrounding the 2018 Team Canada players swirled, it also emerged that Hockey Canada, the country’s national governing body for the sport,had paid out$2.9m in settlements in 2022.And just a year prior, the same code of silence was revealed when former Chicago Blackhawks player Kyle Beachcame forwardas the player at the center of sexual abuse allegations against the team in 2010. Beach alleged that he’d been sexually assaulted by one of the Blackhawks’ then-video coach Brad Aldrich. Afollow-up reportfound that, though Beach informed the team of his allegation, and the information was discussed in a meeting that included the general manager, Stan Bowman, and head coach, Joel Quenneville, nothing happened for three weeks – until after the Blackhawks had won the Cup.View image in fullscreenCarter Hart was acquitted of sexual assault in July.Photograph: Cole Burston/Getty ImagesMuch like with Hart, the men at the center of that scandal went away – but not for long. Afterstepping downfrom his role as general manager in Chicago, Bowmanwas hiredthree years later, in 2024, by the Edmonton Oilers and remains the general manager there. Quenneville isback behind the bench, as of May. He’s the head coach of the Anaheim Ducks. It’s a pattern of redemption without reckoning. As for the moral question, that’s left up to the fans. The NHL and hockey more broadly makes what it might simply call a business decision – even cynically, perhaps, seeing an opportunity for a cut-rate contract – and moves on, leaving its supporters to sort out the ethics of it all, or to do the mental gymnastics of separating the player from the person.The case of the Team Canada players was billed as a reckoning for hockey – finally. In the end, the case itself, and the judge’s ruling, made a clear line of justice difficult to draw. And so, yet again, no reckoning. The so-called watersheds come and go, the turning points lead to the same place. The behavior, the pattern, remains. A scandal, a moment of reflection, then a quiet reabsorbing of those involved back into hockey’s ecosystem. The machinery of hockey, from development to junior to pro, protects itself. The game goes ahead and change, when it happens, feels incidental rather than intentional.Hart was acquitted, that’s true. Legally, he bears no criminal responsibility. He has the right to rebuild his career. But what the courts decide and what a sport chooses to celebrate or reward are not the same thing. Neither is acquittal equal to absolution. Acquittal doesn’t negate the power imbalances that shaped the case. And it doesn’t delete the learned behaviour that makes these situations seemingly so common – the kind that teaches young athletes that consent may be negotiable, or that group loyalty outweighs empathy, or that success is a sanitizer. The accused in this case were found not guilty, that is not up for debate. Still, being legally innocent and being ethically fit for a role are two different things. The court may have had its say, but hockey’s silence, as usual, speaks louder.Explore more on these topicsVegas Golden KnightsNHLIce hockeyUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

One hundred per cent this. Heart emoji. Slay, king. This is not just the best part of sport. It’s the only real point.“Now is the time to ease tensions, set aside political difference and focus on the football,” Khan concluded, scattering flowers of all shades, fluttering his fingers to release a cascade of butterflies, and opening his arms to embrace, personally, brothers and sisters of every caste and clime.Starmer condemns ‘wrong decision’ to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from Aston Villa gameRead moreExcept it turns out Khan also wants to bansupporters of an Israeli team from watching a football match in Birmingham. He wants to do this because in this case, and in this case only, it’s too much bother, and because this is all about love.But wait. We’ve still got Zack Polanski, who released a video this week specifically about Birmingham, who believes in tolerance and diversity above all things, and who quoted sections from the Benjamin Zephaniah poem The British to make the point that Birmingham is not, repeat not, a no-go area for any group.As Polanski says, it is instead time to “be cool”, to prioritise unity and understanding. So of course Polanski will now be speaking out urgently against the banning of Israelis, taking the opportunity to rise above division, because this is the absolute best of Britishness, the one non-negotiable principle of this mixed and porous island at the jumping-off point between the continents.Except, it seems he won’t be doing that. The Greens’ Polanski has so far resisted this temptation, and is instead the only leader of a major political party not to questionthe decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fansfrom attending the Europa League tie against Aston Villa at Villa Park next month.In isolation this does seem jarringly out of character. What about the coolness? And the unity? Zack! Are you OK, Zack? Is the internet down? It is true that the video of love was not an entirely clear lens, containing a lingering closeup of only one flag, the flag of Palestine, because borders only divide us and unity is all.And, yes, Polanski also appeared to believe at one point that you can make your tits bigger with a course of paid hypnosis, as first trailed in pick-up artist bible The Game, a book about how to say things people want to hear in order to get them to agree with you.View image in fullscreenThe Green party leader, Zack Polanski, released a video about Birmingham this week.Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty ImagesEither way, the decision is now out there. It remains at the time of writing unreversed. Supporters ofMaccabi Tel Avivwill be barred from watching their team play at Villa Park on 6 November due to safety concerns identified by West Midlands police and ratified by the Birmingham Safety Advisory Group. There may yet be a messy volte face, as the government brings its pressure to bear. It may emerge that the safety concerns override any other argument, that there is a genuine terror threat that makes the rest of this debate fade into nothingness.But as things stand the British authorities have decided for the first time that overseas sports fans will not be welcome in this country, that it is simply too hard to police, and that this needs to happen in the name of peace and unity.It shouldn’t really matter what your views are here, as long as your views are even vaguely consistent with the laws and principles of the territory. It doesn’t matter what you think about the bloodshed in Gaza, which presents its own distinct case for atransparent and properly leveraged sporting boycottof Israel, and of anyone else involved in violent acts of war.This is just a terrible decision. Not to mention a depressing and alarming decision. And also an insultingly mendacious one as long as we’re going to pretend it’s about safety and nothing else.On a sporting level it makes no logical sense. Who are wenotgoing to ban now? How are the England team, source of vastly inflated police bills around the world, going to get away with showing their face anywhere if this is the standard? How about Paris Saint‑Germain, whose Champions League celebrations led to mass arrests and death on the streets? Or any trip to Napoli, a city-wide parkour of buttock-stabbing rage?But no. We will instead draw the line at a few hundred Israeli supporters. This is based, as far as anyone knows, onsome serious unrestlast season during the trip to Ajax, where 62 people were arrested, 10 of them Israelis, 49 of them Dutch or residents in the Netherlands.View image in fullscreenMaccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam last November.Photograph: Jeroen Jumelet/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockEven without hard evidence that Maccabi fans want to start trouble, the idea this could be seen as an act of de-escalation is basically nuts. What do we think is going to happen now, even if this act of peace‑keeping is reversed? That the game is going to pass in a doe‑eyed spirit of love for all? That it will be less, not more, contentious as a result of this act of heavy-handed prohibition?It’s a terrible moment for Birmingham, which might be better off worrying about the huge rise in reported antisemitic hate crimes in theWest Midlands, quite a feat given how few Jewish people actually live there. Most obviously it is an alarmingly feeble admission of inadequacy on the part of the British police, whose entire job description is to preserve order while upholding the law.These are the same police who spend every weekend permitting, as they should, gatherings of all tones, who have in the past walked through flying bricks to preserve the right of a few hundred National Front supporters to march provocatively through south London, and done so as a mark of pride, because this is the thing about living in a liberal democracy.Mainly it is just a terrible decision for the country, and for what we should now expect. It gives a horribly open door to those who want to plug their own line of political division, to claim that there really are mid-90s-Mogadishu-style no-go zones. This is votes in the bank, pure political capital. Is Nigel Farage going to conclude: “Hmm, no real need to appear in Birmingham in a union flag frock coat eating tripe out of a Beefeater helmet?” Or that he might on balance decide to show up and do that?There are so many ways of making a statement out of this event if you want to. Stay away. Turn your back. Protest and be protected. Instead, here we have sport once again being marched about in a headlock, a propaganda Tannoy for the loudest voice, and wreathed as ever in the platitudes of tolerance and unity.Sadly, Polanski’s video left out the key part of Zephaniah’s poem, the coda at the end that states “all the ingredients are equally important” and “treating one ingredient better than another will leave a bitter unpleasant taste”, an unfortunate piece of editing given the week’s events. For now the fix on the hoof for this particular note of division is obvious enough. Examine the details. Reverse it if possible.Policeit robustly. And then go out there and model something better.Explore more on these topicsMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillaPoliceWest MidlandsBirminghamIsraelcommentShareReuse this content"

Now the Mavericks’ new phenom, 18-year-old Cooper Flagg, inherits the mantle – whether he wants it or notFri 17 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 04.01 EDTShareEvery time Jack Johnson’s big Black fists smashed into a white fighter’s face, he wasn’t just breaking the bones of his opponents, but the spirit of White America. Blow after blow after blow. Out of this shame, a mythos was born. One after another, white fighters propped up like scarecrows. One after another, collapsing. As cultural critic Gerald Early has argued, Johnson’s fights became less about sport and more about the drama of race in America, with every knockout symbolizing a direct challenge to white supremacy. For the next 100 years, across multiple sports, whites have tried to find the next champion to return them to glory. This myth-making even inspired Howard Sackler’s Pulitzer-winning play The Great White Hope.In basketball, figures like Jerry West and “Pistol” Pete Maravich represented Anglo excellence before the NBA’s full desegregation revealed the overwhelming superiority of African-American players. By the time Larry Bird rose in the 1980s, the Great White Hope narrative had simply been repackaged for a new generation. Bird was a badass hick from Indiana. Bird was a godsend to Boston’s white working class. Bird was Magic’s equal. Bird was the Great White Hope disguised as the Great White Hope denier.From a 1985 Sports Illustrated profile:I don’t want to be seen as the Great White Hope. I just want to be a great basketball player, period.But that was 40 years ago. The MVP-level white players since have all been European (Dirk Nowitzki, Luka Dončić, Nikola Jokić). There hasn’t been an American white All-Star in the NBA since Kevin Love in 2018: a good player, but no superstar.If there were ever a made-for-TV plot for the next Great White Hope to emerge, Sackler couldn’t have imagined a better milieu than the Dallas Mavericks. This is the only franchise that can say its three best all-time players are all white (Steve Nash, Nowitzki, Dončić). With Dončić’s trade to the Lakersstill fresh and raw, Dallas are desperate. The city has been languishing, nursing an open wound. So when luck on thelevel of conspiracy fellin Harrison’s lap,Cooper Flaggbecame part of a myth-cycle that pre-dates him by a millennium.Not since LeBron James in 2003 has a rookie arrived carrying such immense expectations, along with the hopes of a city desperate for deliverance. In Dallas, the 18-year-oldFlagg is walking into a shit show.The Dončić trade was one of the worst ever. When he was traded, the fanbase protested losing him outside the arena for weeks, evendragging a coffinto the steps of American Airlines Center. A dead fandom in a dead box. Harrison should thank his dumb luck, or the scripted simulacrum that landed him Flagg, who ostensibly saved his job.None of this is Flagg’s fault. He’s just a nice kid from Maine who wants to hoop. But the reality is the Mavericks are a massive question mark. Harrison is still the GM, so anything is possible regarding roster construction. Kyrie Irving re-signed with Dallas this summer, but is out for the year with a torn ACL. Anthony Davis is a former superstar who might still have something special left in the tank at 32, but remains the most injury-prone big man in the NBA. The rest of the roster has rangy bigs and defensive-minded wings. Shot-creation will fall primarily on Flagg, who will be the rightful favorite for Rookie of the Year. He also has a chance, with Irving out, to lead the Mavs in scoring and assists. Flagg is more known for his all-around two-way game, especially his voracious defense. But in year one, he will be asked to run the offense.Checking out his full shooting profile reveals the cracks and the promise. From Maine United to Montverde to Duke, the data shows what kind of looks he hunts and what he makes of them. Layups (1.22 points per shot) and free throws (a ridiculous 1.62) are his bread-and-butter. Unguarded catch-and-shoot threes are money at 1.08 points per shot. Then the cracks: pull-up twos at 0.64, floaters at 0.87 sink like stones. This is where defense will force him in year one. As a rookie, he’ll have to live at the rim and on the line. The polished Bird-style pull-up daggers will come later.View image in fullscreenCooper Flagg shakes hands with NBA commissioner Adam Silver after being selected first overall by the Dallas Mavericks in June’s draft.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesUnlike the opponents Johnson put on the floor, Flagg is the real deal. He obliterates the old stereotype of the “crafty but unathletic” white player. His vertical leap is violent and quick, his defense freakishly reactive. He can shoot, handle, defend and playmake. His favorite player? Bird. No shit. He has Bird’s bawdy panache, too, which he will need every ounce of, playing forMavericks owner Miriam Adelson. Her titles include: gambling lobbyist. Trump’s top donor. Architect of legalized vice. Builder of casinos. Propagandist for Israel’s genocide in Gaza. She is all of those things, and she is also the main architect behind legalizing gambling in Texas so that she can sink Dallas into gambling degeneracy. Rookies don’t get to decide where they’re drafted. Flagg has to play for an owner whose politics are toxic. That’s part of the pressure he’ll face just trying to hoop.Dallas have a fanbase accustomed to white superstars. Flagg doesn’t have to fill Dončić’s shoes, but he does have to follow in his footsteps. Dirk was the silent assassin, gentle and approachable. Dončić was a devilish imp, sarcastic and full of South Dallas swag. Both were beloved. Flagg’s handoff is broken before it begins. He’ll have to dominate on the court and establish a presence off it.So far, he’s responded coolly: “I wouldn’t look at anything as pressure. … I’m not worried about living up to certain players’ expectations. … I’m just going to be myself and really try to get better every single day that I can.”But Flagg’s not only walking into racial baggage – he’s entering a national zeitgeist. After the first two decades of the NBA being dominated by American whites, desegregation made clear that Black players were superior in every part of the game. Ironically, Nowitzki became the archetype that helped Europe catch up to America. Dirk was the first European-born MVP, but Jokić has racked up three of his own. Former Mav Nash won back-to-back MVPs in Phoenix. Meanwhile, the US has mostly produced white role players like JJ Redick: shooters, facilitators, table-setters. It’s hard to continue to claim America is the best basketball country when it’s been eight seasons since it produced an MVP.Flagg has the chance to be more than that. He looks like a transcendent talent, a player who could change not just how the game is played but how it’s taught. Post-Dirk, every big shoots threes. Not since Brent “Bones” Barry have we seen a white kid from the suburbsdunk like this. Defensively, Flagg is already built different. His timing and coordination are preternatural: those “dead arm” blocks where he meets the ball midair without flinching. His rim protection already resembles that of a perennial All-Defense candidate before he can legally buy a beer.Similarly, Caitlin Clark’s arrival in the WNBA was a maelstrom of a ratings boom and culture war for a white phenom in a Black-dominated league. Flagg steps into something similar, though the script is older on the men’s side and stitched directly into NBA mythology.It’s foolish fandom to root against anyone because of race. But it happens across all races and sports. Dallas is unique in its history of generational white stars. Flagg will have to block out the noise and focus on ball. He’s done that at every level. The city is wounded, still raw from Dončić’s departure, and there’s healing that must happen. Providing entertainment for the masses will help, but Dallas doesn’t have a mythical Jack Johnson to defeat. There’s no racial redemption arc waiting to be fulfilled. There’s just bad blood and hard truths.Flagg doesn’t exist to redeem whiteness or avenge Jack Johnson’s ghosts. He exists in a league where those myths linger but no longer dictate the game. His story is about possibility. He’s a teenager stepping into a story larger than himself. At worst, Flagg will be a welcome distraction. At best, he could write the next chapter in basketball’s complicated history of expectations.Explore more on these topicsCooper FlaggDallas MavericksNBABasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

But the union added it had not asked theBarcelonaand Villarreal players to participate in the protest, even though, the union said “they share the basic premise of the protest.”The ninth round kicked off on Friday with Oviedo hosting Espanyol.Earlier Friday, Barcelona coach Hansi Flick and his players were not pleased at having to travel 7,200km (4,500 miles) to play a regular season game.“My players are not happy, I am not happy, but La Liga decided that we will play this game,” Flick said at a press conference in reply to a question about his position on the game.Barcelona president Joan Laporta has defended the move by saying it represents an opportunity to further push into the American sports market.But for Flick and his players, it represents added travel before a short winter break. Barcelona will also travel to Saudi Arabia for the Spanish Super Cup starting on 7 January.Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong also criticized playing the game in the US, saying players were already overloaded with travel and a packed playing calendar.Like Barcelona, Villarreal were also playing in the Champions League.La Liga president Javier Tebas has defended the game abroad as a key to boosting “revenues in the mid- to long-term” and increasing the value of his competition’s television rights, which lag behind those of England’s Premier League.Tebas said the league plans to make an international match an annual event.The match will be at Hard Rock Stadium inMiamiGardens, home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins.The league has chartered planes to take to Florida what it estimates will be 2,000 to 3,000 fans from Villarreal, which is the home team.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaBarcelonaVillarrealMiamiEuropean club footballShareReuse this content"

European soccer body Uefa has identified the trend as a threat to the integrity of games and the player trading industry worth more than $10bn each year.“As alleged, Wander used his investment firm, 777 Partners, to cheat private lenders and investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars by pledging assets that his firm did not own, falsifying bank statements and making other material misrepresentations about 777’s financial condition,” Jay Clayton, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in an FBI statement Thursday.The indictment charging Wander with wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy to commit those crimes was unsealed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan. Most of the charges carry a maximum prison term of 20 years.Wander and 777 had failed last year in targeting their biggest capture in soccer, nine-time English champion Everton, amid increasing scrutiny of the business and a lawsuit in New York from a London-based investor.Reporting about 777’s soccer interests, led by Norwegian soccer magazine Josimar, intensified even before Wander was elected to a board seat at the influential European Club Association, a network of hundreds of teams that shapes the Champions League and other competitions.Wander’s firm had moved heavily into soccer in 2021, buying stakes in financially distressed clubs recovering from playing in empty stadiums during the Covid-19 pandemic.The former chief financial officer at 777, Damien Alfalla, “is cooperating with the government,” the FBI said, and made a guilty plea this week.“The women and men of the SDNY and our law enforcement partners will continue to work tirelessly to protect our investors and our markets,” Clayton said.Another 777 executive, Steven Pasko, also is targeted in a civil law court filing Thursday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Explore more on these topicsFootballHertha BerlinGenoaStandard LiegeVasco da GamaShareReuse this content"

The main man stepping on to centre stage yet again. Liverpool need him to stay there.There are numerous reasons why inconsistent, unconvincing performances have been the common thread running through Liverpool’s start to their title defence, whether they produced seven straight victories or, before Manchester United’s visit to Anfield on Sunday, three consecutive defeats. The upheaval from so many summer changes, Arne Slot’s search for his best XI,Diogo Jota’s death; Salah has felt the effect of them all during his uncharacteristically subdued opening to the campaign.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreSunday’s showpiece occasion could provide the spark for the source of a record 16 goals in 17 appearances forLiverpoolagainst United, who are paying their 100th visit to Anfield and have not won at their fierce rivals for more than nine years. Salah will present Slot with another unforeseen dilemma, however, should he remain lost in the disruption much longer.Liverpool’s head coach must have recognised the irony of Salah’s first goal against Djibouti last Wednesday. Swept first time with the outside of his left foot inside the near post, Salah’s eighth goal of Egypt’s World Cup qualifying campaign came from an almost identical spot to his costly missagainst Chelseabefore the international break.Had that right-foot effort been converted moments after the restart at Stamford Bridge we would still be eulogising Florian Wirtz’s first sublime assist in the Premier League. Inquests into Salah’s dip and Liverpool’s rare losing run might also have been postponed. Instead, Wirtz’s wait continues while Slot stews over a third away defeat in succession, two inflicted by last-minute winners and one the result ofa debatable penalty. Small margins, as Slot reiterated on Friday, but they do not camouflage bigger issues.Salah was instrumental in propelling Liverpool towards a record-equalling 20th league title last season while uncertainty over his future rumbled in the background. “We brought almost the maximum out of Mo this season,” said Slot when his leading striker signeda new two‑year contract in April.There has been a noticeable drop-off on an individual and collective level since. The team, not the terms of a contract, are responsible.Comparing Mohamed Salah’s first seven Premier League games from this season and lastThe 33-year-old’s output in terms of goals and assists is down 50% on the corresponding stage last season, from a combined eight in the first seven league games of 2024-25 to four (two goals and two assists) this term. His number of shots has fallen from 22 to 12 while shots on target have dropped from 15 to five, contributing to a sharp decline in shooting accuracy (excluding blocks) from 78.9% to 55.6%, Opta’s statistics show.One attribute that has held more steady is Salah’s chance creation. With 12 chances created, compared with 14 at the same stage of last term, his figures remain among the best in Europe and up in the company of Lamine Yamal and Arda Güler, his juniors by 15 and 13 years respectively.Measures of collective performance will concern Slot more. Salah had 76 touches in the opposition penalty area in the first seven league games of last season. This term’s tally is 39. The numbers are symptomatic of the team’s problems overall. Only United and Arsenal have attempted more shots on goal than them this season, but Liverpool’s percentage of shots from inside the six-yard box is the lowest in the Premier League, their ratio from outside the area among the highest. Liverpool’s percentage of shots on target – 28.4% – is also among the lowest in the league.“In the first half of last season we mainly scored from a special moment from one of our front three and in the second half it was more from a set piece,” Slot said on Friday. “This season we haven’t had as many acts of brilliance and we haven’t scored from set pieces. But we are still the team that from open play creates the most xG chances.”View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Reece James closes in on Mohamed Salah at Stamford Bridge, where the Egyptian missed a big chance early in the second half.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThey are not punishing opponents in the way Slot envisaged whenWirtz,Hugo EkitikéandAlexander Isakwere brought on board this summer, although Liverpool remain the division’s joint third-highest goalscorers. A draw on Sunday would be enough for Slot to reach the 100-point mark in fewer games than any manager in Liverpool’s history (46). Imagine what his forward line will do when it does settle. Liverpool remain a team of supreme individual quality, capable of igniting and reeling in any rival for the title, but cohesion is missing. That can not be pinned on the new signings alone.Salah is not the only established player to suffer a drop-off, with Alexis Mac Allister working his way back to match sharpness and Ibrahima Konaté toiling. But he finds himself at the centre of the disruption that has recently enveloped Liverpool. That extends to a personal level, with Salah’s grief over the loss of Jota clear on that emotionalopening night against Bournemouth. The effect of Jota’s death can neither be measured nor overlooked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Díaz, Núñez and Alexander-Arnold contributed 10 assists for Salah. Only Szoboszlai remains in the squad and the Hungary captain has been shifted to right‑back four times as Slot seeks to accommodate Wirtz and address shortcomings at full-back.The rapport between Salah and Alexander-Arnold, which blossomed over eight fruitful seasons, has been a jarring absence. In nine starts this season, Salah has operated in front of three full-backs – Jeremie Frimpong, Szoboszlai and Conor Bradley – and alongside three new forwards in Ekitiké, Wirtz and Isak. Inconsistency, in Salah and Liverpool, should therefore be expected with the starting lineup at Chelsea suggesting Slot is not yet totally convinced by the new recruits.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold’s move to Real Madrid has had an impact on his former teammate.Photograph: GSI/Icon Sport/Getty ImagesSlot relieved Salah of some defensive duties last season to target his energies on destroying opponents in the final third. The trade-off paid rich dividends and a consistently world-class talent will no doubt deliver again. His second goal against Djibouti, a superb volley cushioned over the advancing keeper, was a little reminder of what Liverpool have come to expect.Slot’s tactical trade-off with Salah demands goals and assists in exchange for leaving Liverpool’s right flank more exposed. Marc Cucurella, the Chelsea left-back, said Enzo Maresca had targeted the space down Liverpool’s right at Stamford Bridge.“I heard the comments from Cucurella and saw how they scored the 2-1,” Slot said. “But I can also show you five or six moments where Mo could have made the difference for us. If that had happened, we would have had the conversation like we did last season where he made the difference so many times for us. If that doesn’t happen then there are probably comments like this.“There is always the balance between winger and full-backs. I want our full-backs to attack as well. We have to find the right balance in that.” He also needs Salah to command centre stage again. Against United, he usually does.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Marinakis is expected to be in attendance and it is thought the Greek billionaire could sack Postecoglou if Forest fail to show signs of progress.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreThe head coach said he did not speak to Marinakis during the international break and was bullish when questioned about his position. “What I consistently say, and I was mocked and ridiculed for it last year, is: if you let the story play out, I’ll tell you how it finishes,” Postecoglou said. “But I don’t hold that decision in my hands.“I said last year [while in charge at Tottenham] in my second year I always win things, right? And what’s the key to that? That I’m there in my second year, because it takes a bit of time. But the story always ends the same: you leave me here, let me do my job, it’ll end the same … with a trophy. If I don’t and I’m removed, well, what can I do about it? I can’t win in this situation in terms of trying to convince people. You either see what you see or you don’t; either way it doesn’t affect me.”Postecoglou, who won the Europa League with Tottenham last season, earning their first trophy since 2008, expressed bafflement at his position being under such scrutiny after fewer than six weeks in charge. He repeatedly mentioned the word “prism” during Friday’s press conference. Asked through which lens he feels the Forest hierarchy view him, the Australian replied: “I’d like to think that when they made this decision they didn’t look at me and see a failed manager who is lucky to be in a job. I think they probably appointed me because they saw something in me that they felt I could deliver at this football club. Now, has that changed in five weeks?“I can’t answer that question but I’d be surprised because that would probably mean there probably wasn’t a helluva lot of conviction in it to start with. All the interaction and feedback I’ve had with the people at the club, not just the owner but everybody else, they want us to win, they want us to get the results and I understand that.”The 60-year-old added: “The owner especially, he wants to win, that’s pretty clear; I don’t need any further clarification on that. No one has been anything but encouraging to me. Do I get any sort of sense of where [they] sit with things? I’ve never asked for that, I’ve never sought reassurance for that, wherever I’ve been. What I say to you is what I say to the people around me, or the owner: let the story play out, I’ll tell you the ending. I’ve said it to all of them, everywhere I’ve been appointed.”Marinakis is mindful of the discontent among Forest supporters, many of whom were against Postecoglou succeeding Nuno Espírito Santo, who led the club into Europe for the first time since 1995-96. Thousands of Forest fans chanted against Postecoglou – and in support of Nuno – during their3-2 Europa League defeatby Midtjylland at the City Ground, their most recent home match.View image in fullscreenEvangelos Marinakis heard chants against Ange Postecoglou during Forest’s defeat by Midtjylland at the City Ground.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“I can’t tell people what to feel or sing,” Postecoglou said. “I’ve never taken it too personally either way, even when the praise comes, because I know it can flip. When we were at Tottenham last year, after the first five games they were playing this Robbie Williams song [Angels] after every game and it was annoying the hell out of me so I told them to stop playing it, because it wasn’t real, it wasn’t genuine. It was trying to manufacture people to feel a certain way and I just don’t believe in that stuff.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When asked whether this game felt like an ordinary match given the heightened noise around his position and Forest sounding out potential successors, he replied with a five-minute monologue.At the end of a considered response, in which he said “I just don’t fit, in general”, he added: “You can look at this first five weeks and say: ‘He’s under pressure because he was lucky to get this job.’ Or you can look at it and say: ‘Well, there’s been a major change.’“I am trying to change the way we play.

Victory ended a three-game winless run for the home side, who had made their intent plain by pummelling the visitors’ goal after a forgettable first 30 minutes.Whittaker doubled Boro’s lead in the 55th minute after Cédric Kipré’s own goal in first-half added time had given them the advantage, shortly after the home goalkeeper Sol Brynn saved a George Hirst penalty.‘Let the story play out’: Postecoglou defends record as Nottingham Forest pressure growsRead moreIpswich, who had their own goalkeeper Alex Palmer to thank for keeping them level with a series of important saves around the half-hour mark, reduced the deficit through Dara O’Shea’s header with 14 minutes to go but scarcely threatened to claim the draw that would have extended their five-match unbeaten run.Ipswich, stewing over a penalty appeal that was turned down after Hirst’s rising shot struck the arm of Alfie Jones, were saved three times in quick succession by Palmer. The former West Brom goalkeeper first stopped a low drive from Tommy Conway, then flipped Hayden Hackney’s deflected effort over the crossbar before tipping away Alan Browne’s drive from the resulting corner.The visitors almost snatched the lead at the other end after an effort from Sam Szmodics. Then Middlesbrough broke swiftly, with Delano Burgzorg’s low effort parried by Palmer into the path of David Strelec, who somehow spooned wide from point-blank range.The hosts looked set to pay the price when Callum Brittain’s shirt-tug on Davis won the visitors a 42nd-minute penalty, but this time it was Brynn who rose to the occasion, diving to his right to tip Hirst’s spot-kick around a post. A breathless end to the first period was complete in added time when Burgzorg wriggled around the left edge of the Ipswich defence and delivered a harmless looking cross that took a slight deflection and dribbled into the net off the unfortunate Kipré.View image in fullscreenGeorge Hirst shows his dismay after missing a penalty that would have put Ipswich in front at Middlesbrough.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAMiddlesbrough seized the momentum at the start of the second half and, after Burgzorg fired a speculative effort over the bar, they doubled their lead in the 55th minute. Strelec’s low cross from the right was palmed away by Palmer under pressure from Conway and fell to Whittaker, who lashed home his first Boro goal to put Edwards’ side in full control.Whittaker drove another effort wide at the end of Burgzorg’s swift counterattack as Boro looked likely to add to their tally. But instead it was Ipswich who reduced the deficit when O’Shea glanced home a 76th-minute header from a corner.However, that goal did not ignite the expected spell of Ipswich pressure, with Brynn saving well from the substitute Jack Clarke in an otherwise relatively comfortable concluding spell for Middlesbrough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whittaker has come in for criticism since signing from Plymouth in January but Edwards believes his confidence will grow after his coolly taken strike.“I’m really pleased. There’s high expectations on him because he’s a really good player and he understands that,” said Edwards. “What I’d really like to celebrate is that he’s working very hard to get through it. It’s his night, it’s big for him and hopefully we’ll build on that.”The Ipswich manager, Kieran McKenna, bemoaned his side’s inability to take their chances as they extended their winless record this season away from Portman Road. Hirst’s penalty gave them a golden opportunity to take a half-time advantage but instead they went in behind and extended their poor form on their travels.“I don’t think we can have too many complaints about the result because we made too many mistakes,” said McKenna. “We had a big moment with the penalty to go 1-0 up and it could have been really different, but you can’t go in 1-0 down from that situation. We need to be stronger. We didn’t stay together defensively when it was really tough.

Once you are first, you can just focus on your performance.”Arsenal were quickly installed as hot favourites to win the title for the first time since 2004, but things did not work out that way, the team spending just 26 nights at the summit before being overhauled by Claudio Ranieri’s 5,000-1 miracle workers.It is a feeling Arsenal supporters have had to get used to since they were last champions 21 years ago. Across that period, which started with the post-Invincibles season in which they led for the first 10 weeks before being derailed after Manchester United ended their 49-match unbeaten run and has included a record of being top for 248 nights and finishing second in 2022-23, they have spent 773 nights (as of Saturday morning) – the equivalent of more than two years – in pole position without taking the chequered flag.Days spent top of the Premier League since Arsenal’s 2004 title winArsenal are top againafter Liverpool, champions last season following a record 234 nights as leaders, suffered two successive league defeats before the international break and look much better positioned to take advantage than at any time over the past two decades. Although they have not won on their past two visits to Saturday’s opponents, Fulham, cathartic victories in successive matches: Newcastle, Olympiakos and West Ham – sides Arsenal have struggled against under Mikel Arteta – have created a growing sense of optimism at the club that this could be the year they finally get past the post.“We cannot pay too much attention to that because the feeling was: ‘You go to Newcastle, if you lose in Newcastle, the Premier League is over,’” said the Arsenal manager on Friday. “And one week later, you are where you are. So, honestly, it’s focus on what we can control, focus on our performance, focus on delivering and achieving what we want to achieve daily and the rest, it’s 30 games, it’s still too early. So many things are going to happen. Emotionally, we cannot be dragged into these things because we have much more important things to do.”Such is the depth of their squad after spending more than £250m on reinforcements in the summer that even the likely absence of the captain, Martin Ødegaard, for another six weeks with a knee injury picked up when Arsenal comfortably saw off West Ham should not have the same impact on results as last season. The Norwegian missed almost two months with an ankle injury and, combined with long-term injuries to the key attackers Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus, it meant they were never able to properly sustain a challenge to Liverpool despite finishing as runners-up for a third year in a row.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta led his side to a hard-fought win at Newcastle last month. Arsenal had lost their last two Premier League matches at St James’ Park.Photograph: Craig Cowan/Action Plus/ShutterstockEberechi Eze is likely to continue to fill in for Ødegaard against Fulham, and Arteta has top-quality cover in every position in a squad that unusually has the same number of players who predominantly use their left foot as their right. “Balance,” he said simply when asked what the benefits were.Arsenal head to Craven Cottage at the summit for the time since May 2024, a season when they led for 76 nights before being overhauled by Manchester City after a home defeat by Aston Villa – the only league game they lost after the turn of the year.In 2022-23 an injury to William Saliba proved their undoing, their lack of defensive cover ruthlessly exposed by City. But rather than regarding the past three campaigns as a negative, Arteta is hoping his players can draw on those experiences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For some of them, it will be unconsciously there but as a learning and hopefully a really positive learning as well because that’s sport and that’s football in general to do that. And then you do have microdoses of that: what happened at Newcastle for a few years, what happened against West Ham, what happened against City when we could not beat them. It’s a lot of situations and we have learned from that. And then the ultimate goal, if we do a lot of the small things well, it will come.”Before Arteta’s appointment as manager in December 2019, Arsenal had not been top since losing out to Leicester the season after the Spaniard retired from playing. He was captain of the team that Wenger described as having “won the stamina league” after they spent 128 nights top in 2013-14 before losing out to City. That still was not as many as in 2007-08, when Arsenal were at the summit for more than two-thirds of the season – 142 nights – yet ended up third.Arteta, whose side are favourites to win the title according to Opta’s supercomputer, must sense there is a real opportunity to finally banish those unwanted statistics for good.Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 29-year-old has only just begun light running on grass and is still receiving intense physiotherapy on his knee before a prospective first team debut in mid-November.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreAlan Shearer is among those pundits suggesting that Wissa should reject an almost inevitable call-up from the DRC for the tournament in Morocco in December and January and, instead, prioritise playing for Newcastle.When Howe was asked if he endorsed that standpoint, Newcastle’s manager avoided answering the question directly. “That’s a conversation and a topic I’m not going to get involved in,” he said. “That’s not fair on Yoane. I haven’t seen Alan’s comments but that’s one I’ll stay away from.”Right now Howe – whose side travel to Brighton on Saturday – is simply relieved that Wissa’s knee is recovering so rapidly from an injury that can sometimes require surgery and a nine-month layoff. “It’s great to see Yoane on the grass for the first time,” he said. “He’s reacted pretty well to that work so far. Now, it’s a case of trying to step him up gradually.”Shearer believes Wissa, one of the DRC’s best players, acted irresponsibly in playing a key role during the World Cup qualifiers in September, despite barely training with Brentford during a close season spent largely trying to force a move to Tyneside.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe hopes to have Yoane Wissa available for Newcastle from mid-November, but the Africa Cup of Nations kicks off in December.Photograph: Gary Oakley/EPA“It will be a really difficult decision for Wissa not to go to Afcon,” said the former Newcastle captain and manager. “But, because of him not training or playing during the summer, he could have shown more responsibility in not playing as much as he did in those two games when he went away on international duty.”Meanwhile, Newcastle officials are in regular contact with their counterparts in Marseille over arrangements for visiting fans wanting to travel to the French city for the teams’ Champions League meeting in late November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Indeed, preparations are already well advanced to ensure fans can visit Marseille safely.A club spokesperson said: “From the information we have now, at this moment in time, our fans are permitted to travel to Marseille. We have very clear instructions from the authorities in Marseille for when they do travel. So we’ll stick to that and let you know if there’s any change.”Many Newcastle fans have already made travel arrangements while a series of special supporters’ charter flights have been organised to fly them direct from Tyneside to the south of France.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweAfrica Cup of NationsAlan ShearerDemocratic Republic of the Congo football teamnewsShareReuse this content"

The England international’s contract expires in the summer and the club must decide if he deserves an extension after an injury-hit spell at the Etihad Stadium.The 31-year-old recently saidhe contemplated retirement last seasondue to fitness problems, which resulted in him making only 11 Premier League appearances and missing the final three months of the campaign witha hamstring injury. Stones was an unused substitute for City’s past two league matches but will hope to return to the starting lineup against former club Everton on Saturday, having featured twice for England during the international break.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“The club will decide what is best for John, we will see how he performs,” Guardiola said. “When John is fit, he is part of the group, the starting XI and the year of the treble [he] was unbelievable but since then he has not had the consistency in [number of] games. He’s been injured many times so that is why we have to wait and see.”Guardiola has previously said he needs players who are capable of featuring three times a week, which was one reason behind Kevin De Bruyne being allowed to depart in the summer. Asked if Stones’ injury problems are behind him, Guardiola said: “I hope so. I’m happy that he’s back [with England] and the confidence from Thomas [Tuchel] to him. There’s no doubts about his potential and his quality. I’m happy he played with his country.”Guardiola will be without Rodri on Saturday, the midfielder is sidelined after sustaining an injuryat Brentford, but could have Rayan Aït-Nouri and Omar Marmoush available again. Stones will not face his former City teammate Jack Grealish, who is on loan at Everton and is unable to play against his parent club.City possess the in-formErling Haaland, who has scored 12 goals in nine games for his club this season. Would Guardiola be confident of finding a way to stop him? “Yeah, of course. Four central defenders,” he joked. “I had the pleasure to face him when he was in Dortmund and hopefully I’m not going to face him again the rest of my life.“He’s a top-class player; in world football, there are four, five, six, 10 players that are unbelievable. They make a difference. Erling is one of them. I will have him, hopefully, for many years and I’m really pleased for that.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityJohn StonesPep GuardiolaPremier LeagueErling HaalandnewsShareReuse this content"

Eagle was also the biggest shareholder at Palace until July, whenTextor sold his 43% staketo the former US ambassador to the United Kingdom Woody Johnson.Arteta backs Gyökeres, Palmer injury blow, Liverpool v Manchester United news – football liveRead moreIconic brought the legal action against Textor in July, alleging he had failed to honour a contract to buy back their $75m stake if Eagle was not floated on the stock exchange, plus 11% in annual interest.Textor had countersued Iconic in the United States in July alleging he was duped, but the Florida district court dismissed that motion this week, ruling the case should be heard in the UK.In his defence, Textor claimed Iconic failed to hand over the paperwork required to complete the deal, most notably a stock transfer form and share certificate, and argued the obligation to buy them out was never triggered.In a judgment published by the commercial court, Judge Pelling KC ruled in favour of Iconic on a preliminary issue.A spokesperson for Iconic Sports said: “Today’s decision from the UK Commercial Court confirms unequivocally that John Textor knowingly violated contractual commitments and owes Iconic Sports approximately $97m excluding legal costs. Iconic intends to recover the funds that are rightfully owed, and will pursue all options, in any jurisdiction, to do so.”Textor confirmed his intention to appeal. “While this is a preliminary hearing, I am disappointed with the decision not to end this lawsuit at the outset. I intend to appeal.”Textor has endured a difficult time since watching Palace win the FA Cup at Wembley in May, the final game of his eventful four-year co-ownership. In addition to selling his Palace stake he resigned from the Lyon board in June after they wererelegated to Ligue 2 for breaching financial rules, although Eagle remains the club’s biggest shareholder and the club have since been reinstated in the top flight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others had travelled after games and training for a service which celebrated a pioneering figure in women’s football, who died last month, aged 47.Goodbye Matt Beard: the Del Boy of women’s football who took Liverpool to two WSL titlesRead moreAs Beard’s coffin, draped in two Liverpool scarves, was carried into Sir Frederick Gibberd’s modernist “cathedral for a new world”, it was flanked by a 50-strong phalanx of current and former players who had played under him, many from Liverpool and West Ham. They were joined by Liverpool Women’s first-team squad, along with the head coach, Gareth Taylor, and his coaching staff, and the club’s sporting director, Richard Hughes.In an emotional eulogy, Mark Beard called his brother a “beautiful soul and a one-in-a-million personality” who “always found a way to make you laugh and smile”.Beard, he said, had gone into women’s football soon after moving into coaching in his 20s when an injury cut short a playing career and had “never looked back”, becoming one of the game’s “most inspirational managers”. Beard started his coaching at Millwall Lionesses in 2008, later taking charge of Chelsea, Liverpool over two spells, West Ham United and Burnley. He became Liverpool Women’s most successful manager, leading them to back-to-back Women’s Super League titles in 2013 and 2014.View image in fullscreenLiverpool players Beata Olsson (left) and Cornelia Kapocs arrive at the memorial service.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“He won everything there was to win, but more important than the titles was what he brought to people,” he said.An inquest confirmed last month that Beard had died by suicide, and his brother paid tribute to staff at the Countess of Chester hospital, where Beard was treated, and the city of Liverpool, which he said had supported the family in their grief. “Please, please, please let Matt’s passing be a lesson to us all,” he said. “We are all human, so be more thoughtful.”Beard’s family requested that instead of flowers, gestures of remembrance be made through donations to a mental health charity, and the running order for the service had the contact details of support services including the Samaritans, the National Suicide Prevention Helpline and the peer-to-peer support group Andy’s Man Club.Current and former players joined coaches, pundits and fans in the cathedral, including Emma Hayes, the former Chelsea manager and current USA women’s national team coach, and footballers including England’s Lucy Bronze, Liverpool’s Gemma Bonner and Arsenal’s Olivia Smith. Liverpool men’s all-time top goalscorer, Ian Rush, also attended the service, alongside Manchester United Women’s head coach, Marc Skinner.That people had travelled from far and wide was testament to Beard’s importance to the women’s game, said the commentator Jacqui Oatley. “Matt was just such a special person, and he was so significant in the evolution of the women’s game in this country,” she said.View image in fullscreenThe Liverpool Women’s manager, Gareth Taylor, arriving at the memorial service for Matt Beard.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe former Liverpool and England forward Natasha Dowie, who won two WSL titles under Beard and returned to Liverpool during his second period at the club, said after the service that he had treated everyone with the same warmth and kindness, whether they were a chief executive or a fan.“How will Matt be remembered?” she said. “A cheeky smile, someone that made you laugh, a twinkle in his eyes, an ‘All right, darling’, a big hug, which made you feel like a million dollars. He was a father figure … and I was very lucky to have played under him.”Beard was a “kind, caring, funny, cheeky” man, who had a real impact on everyone he met, said the Canada head coach and former Chelsea and Arsenal player, Casey Stoney. His death, she said, had to be a moment for people across football to recognise the importance of reaching out for help. “But I think the biggest impact I hope people take from this is that we’re all human and we all need help sometimes and we all need to talk,” Stoney said. “I hope people start taking the time to get out of their busy lives and reach out. I wish I had done more of that.”As Beard’s coffin was led out of the cathedral to a private ceremony where he would be laid to rest, fans raised scarves and joined Beard’s niece, Lucy, for an elegiac rendition of Liverpool’s club anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone. He was, said the Liverpool Women fan Michael Smith, a manager who had made fans feel like part of his family, coming on to supporter coaches and giving out signed shirts from the players. “He was an icon in the women’s game and in this city,” he said. “But he was so good with everyone he met.

Seven weeks after joining the Premier League champions, however, and having played the entirety of Sweden’s two recent World Cup qualifiers, Slot believes match fitness is no longer an issue for a striker who aims to kickstart his Liverpool career against Manchester United on Sunday.A decade of despair: Manchester United’s long winless run at AnfieldRead more“Fitness-wise he is close to the level he should be and we can judge him in a fair way from now on,” said theLiverpoolhead coach.“The first five or six weeks, of course we had the player we signed but he was not completely ready. He was getting fitter but he had to do this in aPremier Leaguegame. This is not normal for a player. Ideally you would use him earlier in friendly matches but there is no time in the middle of the season for a friendly so we had to build him up playing Premier League and Champions League games.“You have to be on top of your game to make a difference at this level. You can play at this level if you are 80, 90 or 95% but to make a difference at the highest level of football you need to be 100%. That goes for every player and I think I can safely say he is 100% now.”Isak has started four games for Liverpool in all competitions,scoring once in the Carabao Cup win over Southampton. When asked what he wanted from the club’s record signing, Slot replied: “Goals. That is the most simple thing but also to be the leader in pressing from our front three, there we can improve as well. That is something he needs to do but Hugo [Ekitiké] the same.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dibling could get another opportunity at Manchester City on Saturday with the on-loan Grealish ineligible to face his parent club. But, even if the winger misses out, Moyes insists he has been impressed by the new arrival and studying Grealish at close quarters will only accelerate Dibling’s development.US businessman tied to global football empire indicted in $500m fraud caseRead moreTheEvertonmanager said: “I’m hoping that Tyler picks up on what he’s seen from Jack, but it’s never easy. When you sign players it’s not easy for it all to fall into place right away, especially in a world where everything is expected so quick.“I’ve already said to him: ‘You should be watching Jack and seeing what he does.’ But Tyler’s a really good footballer. I’ve been really impressed by his football since he’s been here. He just needs to take a bit of time. He was a bit unlucky to get taken off [against Palace] but we had to try and do something to alter the course of the game.”Dibling has also been given clips to study of the former Bayern Munich duo, Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. But Moyes believes Grealish, who has created the most chances from open play in the Premier League this season, has aspects to his game that Dibling can replicate such as “his ability to caress the ball, take the team up the pitch and be creative.”Moyes added: “I want Tyler to score goals as well. You need your wide players to score goals and we could name one or two not far from here who do that. We need to try and get that as well. I am getting Tyler in that frame of mind if I can. But I want him to look at Jack, how he plays, how composed he is on the ball. I have to say that Tyler has really impressed me with his close skills and ability. He is a quiet boy and it is going to take a bit of time for him to come out of his shell.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then the job is half done in terms of what you like to try to achieve. And that is like an unbelievable cohesion between the team and the fans.“It cannot only be the team, it cannot only be the fans. It needs to be both. We need to bring energy to each other. We need to work unbelievably hard, perform well, try to be positive – but also need a little bit of help.

That means there’s 50 left where we can’t excite every single minute.“I’m very aware they also need to play positive and attacking and happy football, that can get people off their seat.

Tim Mayer, a former FIA senior steward, also condemned Formula One’s governing body for lacking transparency and threatening the sport’s future.The 59-year-old American, who was sacked from his FIA role last year, had been standing as a candidate against Ben Sulayem but on Friday in Austin acknowledged the incumbent would run unopposed because of the way FIA electoral regulations are composed.Mohammed Ben Sulayem set to remain FIA president after Mayer denied by arcane ruleRead more“There will be only one candidate, the incumbent,” Mayer said. “That’s not democracy – that’s the illusion of democracy.”Mayer, and two other would-be candidates cannot stand because presidential nominees are required to submit six prospective vice-presidents, one from each of the FIA’s global regions, represented on the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC).The Brazilian wife of the former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, Fabiana Ecclestone, is the only world council representative for South America and has already declared for Ben Sulayem. With no others eligible to be nominated as a vice-president, no candidate can meet FIA requirements.Mayer noted that in South America only one person had stood for the WMSC and in Africa only two, both of whom he said “are directly associated with the incumbent”.“When elections are decided before ballots are cast, that’s not democracy – that’s theatre,” he said. “And when member clubs are left with no real choice, they become spectators, not participants.”Mayer questioned why there were so few representatives on the WMSC list and why the number of eligible members had dropped from 40 in 2021 to 29 this year. “Did member clubs suddenly lose interest in shaping the sport? Were they persuaded, pressured or promised something not to stand? I cannot say for sure,” he said.When campaigning Mayer said that he had found FIA member clubs across the world did not want to challenge the status quo. “Across our travels, many member clubs told me: ‘We want to speak, but we can’t.’ Clubs fear losing projects, funding, or recognition if they simply question the system.”The American insisted he would continue his campaign if only to highlight what he believes is wrong with the current governance. He also recognised he knew of the regulations when he stood for president and that they may prove an impossible hurdle but chose to continue nonetheless.View image in fullscreenMohammed Ben Sulayem, pictured with Max Verstappen, will run unopposed for FIA president.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesMayer also cited a report commissioned from the Utrecht School of Governance into the FIA using the Sports Governance Observer benchmark. Their findings were damning, under an executive summary titled “power without brakes”.“The FIA’s governance structurally concentrates power in the office of the president, and accountability remains confined within a system over which the president exercises decisive control,” it read.“Unless independent oversight, open and competitive elections, transparent decision-making, and stakeholder representation are introduced, the FIA will remain structurally predisposed to the concentration of power. History across international sport governance shows that such reliance invariably fails.”The findings of the report Mayer argued could have a fundamental impact on F1, given that teams now have their own good governance practices to which they adhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So they find an undemocratic FIA to be a threat,” he said. “We provide a foundation which is where Formula One can build its house. Without democratic governance, without a strong internal process, that foundation is built on sand.”Ben Sulayem’s time in charge since 2021 has been marked by controversy, not least rifts with drivers and a string of high-profile departures from the sport’s governing body, including the deputy president for sport, Robert Reid,who left citing a “breakdown of governance standards”in April.Last year Lewis Hamilton was unequivocal when he statedBen Sulayem had “never” had his backing, adding his voice to the criticism of the FIA and warning it was damaging the reputation of F1.Risk of wheel bashing and strategy sets up complicated US Grand PrixRead more“There is a real lack of accountability here, within this sport, within the FIA,” he said. “There are things that are happening behind closed doors, there is no transparency, there is really no accountability and we need that.”The FIA has been approached for comment on Mayer’s claims. The governing body had issued a statement which addressed Mayer not meeting the requirements to be a candidate.“The FIA presidential election is a structured and democratic process, to ensure fairness and integrity at every stage,” it read. “The requirements for the 2025 FIA elections, including the relevant deadlines and eligibility criteria for the presidential list and world councils, are defined in the FIA statutes and internal regulations.“The requirements related to the regional representation of the vice-presidents for sport, and to select them from the World Motor Sport Council in order to draw up a presidential list, are not new.

The Knights, who were playing in League 1 as recently as 2018, and Toulouse have joined the Bulls among the elite after both dominated on the field throughout 2025.Goodchild, who bought the club in 2022, said York and the wider area were long overdue such success after the Knights became the first ­professional sporting team from there to play in a top division in almost 40 years.“It’s a great day for the region,” he said. “A team from York that can represent the region in the highest tier in professional sport … it’s been a long time coming. Last time we were in this position was 1985-86 and hopefully we can kick on from here.”London were widely expected to be one of the two teams that were granted admission after a takeover of the club led by the Australian rugby league legend Darren Lockyer. However, they must now regroup and compete in the Championship for at least one more season.The door to Super League remains ajar for the Broncos in 2027, with the gradings system that has determined promotion and relegation for the past two seasons scheduled to remain for next year as things stand. That means London would have to place inside the top 14 of the gradings at the end of next season, having finished 16th this year.“The intent is that there will not be extra panels every year to select the teams in Super League,” the outgoing Rugby Football League chief executive, Tony Sutton, said. “Under the existing system, gradings will decide the top 14 as it has done previously with the top 12.”View image in fullscreenYork Knights won the 1895 Cup final against Featherstone Rovers at Wembley in June.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesSutton said there were “five really strong applicants” for the two extra places in Super League, naming the Broncos, Widnes Vikings and Oldham as the three clubs who pushed York and Toulouse the closest for admission.London have signed a number of high-profile players for 2026, including the Australia forward Reagan Campbell-Gillard, and they now face the remarkable prospect of walking out in places such as Batley and Workington rather than Wigan and St Helens.However, Lockyer said the new ownership group remain fully committed to achieving success in London despite missing out on promotion this year. “The Broncos are building with purpose and clarity, and there is real belief in what can be achieved,” he said. “Our coach and many of our significant player signings for 2026 were committed to this regardless of the Super League decision and we will work hard together to achieve a new goal of winning the Championship in 2026.”As for York, they can look forward to those marquee matches against Wigan and the newly crownedchampions, Hull KR. The Knights and Toulouse will receive only half the central funding the top 12 in the gradings receive – about £650,000 – but Goodchild has stressed they are aiming to be competitive and capture the imagination of people in North Yorkshire.“There are over 2,000 season-ticket holders at clubs like Hull FC, Hull KR and Leeds who live in a York postcode,” he said. “People want to see elite sport and they want to see the big brands. Now that we’re playing on their level in a local area, we’ll see how many convert to their home team.“The city of York is buzzing. We’re going in there to make a difference and we will not be playing catchup.”Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueLondon BroncosBradford BullsRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The most important thing is the next game. You cannot control, even [the] owners, you cannot control the next day in football.“But it’s really good to hear, also because of the noise, but Omar [Berrada, chief ­executive] and Jason [Wilcox, ­director of football] tell me that all the time.”Amorim is clear that he wants to turn United around as soon as ­possible. “Sometimes the pressure that I put on the team or on myself is so much bigger than them,” he said. “I know that it’s going to take a while, but I don’t want to think like that because it will give a feeling that we have time to work things out. So I don’t want that feeling here in our club.”Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper who joined in the summer window, impressed on debut inUnited’s 2-0 win over Sunderlandbefore the international break.

Scherzer settled in from there, and was not removed until manager John Schneider’s second mound visit.With two outs in the fifth, Schneider and Scherzer briefly exchanged words on the mound for the first time, and the three-time Cy Young Award appeared to tell Schneider he wasn’t coming out of the game at that point.Schneider left Scherzer in and he promptly struck out Randy Arozarena swinging with a curveball, one of a career high-tying six whiffs Scherzer induced with his curve, before pounding his glove in celebration.The Blue Jays’ offense, meanwhile, picked up where it left offafter scoring 13 runs in Game 3. Giménez hit a two-run homer in the third inning for the second consecutive day, this one off starter Luis Castillo to give Toronto a lead they didn’t relinquish. The Blue Jays tacked on another run in the inning chasing Castillo when reliever Gabe Speier walked in a run.Toronto added to its advantage in the fourth on an RBI double from George Springer, who came around to score on a wild pitch by Matt Brash. Guerrero, who singled earlier in the game, smacked an opposite-field homer to right the seventh off Eduard Bazardo.Guerrero leads the majors in homers this postseason.Giménez tacked on two insurance runs in the eighth with a two-run single up the middle that deflected off reliever Emerson Hancock’s glove.Miller has a 2.61 ERA in two playoff starts this October while Gaustman, a two-time All-Star, is 1-3 with a 4.14 ERA in 10 career postseason games.Explore more on these topicsMLBToronto Blue JaysSeattle MarinersBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Steelers (4-2) fell for the first time this season on the road.Flacco, 40, completed 31 of 47 passes for 342 yards and three touchdowns. Rodgers threw a pair of scores to tight end Pat Freiermuth, including a 68-yarder for the go-ahead TD with 2:21 to go to put the Steelers up 31-30. Rodgers finished with four touchdown passes, all to tight ends.With Cincinnati star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson out with a hip injury, Rodgers, 41, connected on 23 of 34 passes for 249 yards with two interceptions. Pittsburgh’s Jaylen Warren added 127 rushing yards on 16 carries.Ja’Marr Chase had a team-record 16 catches on 23 targets for 161 yards and a touchdown. Running back Chase Brown was key in Cincinnati’s first-half rally with explosive runs of 37 and 27 yards. He finished with a season-high 108 yards on 11 carries.Rodgers drew first blood by marching the Steelers 69 yards on eight plays in just over four minutes. Facing a third down, Rodgers scrambled to his left and then his right before throwing a strike to tight end Jonnu Smith in the end zone for a 10-yard score.The Steelers controlled most of the first half and were threatening to add another touchdown when Warren ran it in from 18 yards out. However, Steelers lineman Zach Frazier was called for holding and then Pittsburgh committed a false start on fourth down. The Steelers settled for a 41-yard Chris Boswell field goal that made it 10-0 with 10:26 left in the second quarter.The game then began to turn for the Bengals. Flacco engineered a 10-play, 72-yard drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown pass to Chase.Jordan Battle intercepted an Rodgers’ deep ball for Metcalf on Pittsburgh’s next possession. Flacco drove the Bengals 76 yards, capped off by a 29-yard strike over the middle to Tee Higgins that put Cincinnati up 14-10.Rodgers was intercepted again with 40 seconds remaining in the half by DJ Turner II. Flacco drove the ball to the Pittsburgh 31 where McPherson converted a 49-yard field goal to put Cincinnati up 17-10.The Bengals used the first seven minutes of the second half to drive to the Pittsburgh 5, where they settled for a 23-yard field goal and a 20-10 lead.Explore more on these topicsNFLCincinnati BengalsPittsburgh SteelersAaron RodgersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Next thing I know, I am at a candlelit bar sharing a martini with the biggest serial dater of the 16th century.But the night is not over. Next, I am DJing back-to-back with Diana, Princess of Wales. “The crowd’s ready for the drop,” she shouts in my ear, holding a headphone to her tiara. Finally, Karl Marx is explaining why he can’t resist 60% off, as we wait in the cold to get first dibs on Black Friday sales.On Sora 2, if you can think it, you can probably see it – even when you know you shouldn’t. Launched this October in the US and Canada via invitation only, OpenAI’s video app hit 1m downloads in just five days, surpassing ChatGPT’s debut.OpenAI launch of video app Sora plagued by violent and racist images: ‘The guardrails are not real’Read moreSora is not the only text-to-video generativeAItool out there, but it has become popular for two main reasons. First, it is the easiest way yet for users to star in their own deepfakes. Type a prompt and a 10-second video appears within minutes. It can then be shared on Sora’s own TikTok-style feed or exported elsewhere. Unlike the mass-produced, low-quality “AI slop” clogging the internet, these clips have unnervingly high production values.The second reason is that Sora allows the likenesses of celebrities, sportspeople and politicians – with one crucial caveat: they have to be dead. Living people must give consent to feature, but there is an exception for “historical figures”, which Sora seems to define as anyone famous and no longer alive.That seems to be what most users have been doing since launch. The main feed is a surreal whirlpool of brain rot and historical leaders. Adolf Hitler runs his fingers through a glossy mane in a shampoo ad. Queen Elizabeth II catapults herself from a pub table while hurling profanities. Abraham Lincoln erupts with joy on a TV set upon hearing: “You are not the father.” The Rev Martin Luther King Jr tells a gas station clerk about his dream that one day all slushy drinks will be free – then grabs the icy beverage and bolts before finishing his sentence.But relatives of those depicted are not laughing.“It is deeply disrespectful and hurtful to see my father’s image used in such a cavalier and insensitive manner when he dedicated his life to truth,” Malcolm X’s daughter Ilyasah Shabazztoldthe Washington Post.She was two when her father was assassinated. Today, Sora clips depict the civil rights activist wrestling with MLK, talking about defecating on himself and making crude jokes. On Friday, OpenAI announced that they had “worked together” with the estate of Martin Luther King Jr and at their request, OpenAI has paused generations depicting King as the company “strengthens guardrails for historical figures”.People fear … this kind of content is going to lead to a distortion of these people and how they’re rememberedHenry AjderThe company has not made similar public statements following the complaints of other family members of people depicted on the app. Zelda Williams, actor Robin Williams’s daughter, pleaded with people to “please stop” sending her AI videos of her father, in an Instagram story post. “It’s dumb, it’s a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it’s NOT what he’d want,” she said. Shortly before his death in 2014, the late actor took legal action to block anyone from using his likeness in advertisements or digitally inserting him into films until 2039. “To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to … horrible, TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening,” his daughter added.Videos using the likeness of the late comedian George Carlin are “overwhelming, and depressing”, his daughter, Kelly Carlin,said in a BlueSky post.People who have died more recently have also been spotted. The app is littered with videos of Stephen Hawking receiving a “#powerslap” that knocks his wheelchair over. Kobe Bryant dunks on an old woman while shouting about objects up his rectum. Amy Winehouse can be found stumbling around the streets of Manhattan or crying into the camera as mascara runs down her face.Deaths from the past two years – Ozzy Osbourne, Matthew Perry, Liam Payne – are absent, indicating a cutoff that falls somewhere between.Whenever they died, this “puppeteering” of the dead risks redrawing the lines of history, says Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. “People fear that a world saturated with this kind of content is going to lead to a distortion of these people and how they’re remembered,” he says.Sora’s algorithm rewards shock value. One video high on my feed shows King making monkey sounds during his I Have a Dream speech. Others depict Bryant re-enacting the helicopter crash that killed him and his daughter.[There’s] going to be legal uncertainty until the supreme court takes up a case – and that’s another two to four yearsAshkhen KazaryanWhile actors or cartoons may also portray people posthumously, there are stronger legal guardrails. A movie studio is liable for its content; OpenAI is not necessarily liable for what appears on Sora. Depicting someone for commercial use also requires an estate’s consent in some states.“We couldn’t just intimately resurrect Christopher Lee to star in a new horror film, so why can OpenAI resurrect him to star in thousands of shorts?” asks James Grimmelmann, an internet law expert at Cornell Law School and Cornell Tech.OpenAI’s decision to hand the personas of the departed to the commons raises uncomfortable questions about how the dead should live on in the generative AI era.The legal questionConsigning the ghosts of celebrities to haunt Sora for ever might feel wrong, but is it legal? That depends who you ask.A major question remains unresolved in internet law: are AI companies covered bysection 230, and therefore not liable for the third-party content on their platforms? If OpenAI is protected under section 230, it cannot be sued for what users make on Sora.“But unless there’s federal legislation on the issue, it’s going to be legal uncertainty until the supreme court takes up a case – and that’s another two to four years,” says Ashkhen Kazaryan, an expert in first amendment and technology policy.View image in fullscreenSam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, speaks during Snowflake Summit 2025 in San Francisco, California, on 2 June. He is one of the living figures who has allowed Sora to use his likeness.Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesIn the meantime, OpenAI must avoid lawsuits. That means requiring the living to give consent. US libel law protects living people from any “communication embodied in physical form that is injurious to a person’s reputation”. On top of this, most states have right of publicity laws that prevent someone’s voice, persona or likeness being used without consent for “commercial” or “misleading” purposes.Permitting the dead “is their way of dipping their toe in the water”, says Kazaryan.The deceased are not protected from libel, but three states – New York, California and Tennessee – grant a postmortem right of publicity (the commercial right to your likeness). Navigating these laws in the context of AI remains a “grey area” without legal precedent, says Grimmelmann.People are treating it like entertainment, seeing what crazy stuff they can come up with or how many likes they can gatherBo BergstedtTo sue successfully, estates would have to show OpenAI is liable – for example, by arguing it encourages users to depict the dead.Grimmelmann notes that Sora’s homepage is full of such videos, in effect promoting this content. And if Sora was trained on large volumes of footage of historical figures, plaintiffs might argue that the app is designed to reproduce it.OpenAI could, however, defend itself by claiming Sora is purely for entertainment. Each video carries a watermark, preventing it from misleading people or being classed as commercial.Bo Bergstedt, a generative AI researcher, says most users are exploring, not monetising.“People are treating it like entertainment, seeing what crazy stuff they can come up with or how many likes they can gather,” he says. Upsetting as this may be for families, it could still comply with publicity laws.But if a Sora user builds an audience by generating popular clips of historical figures and starts monetising that following, they could find themselves in legal trouble. Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the security, trust and safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, notes that “economic AI slop” includes earning money indirectly through monetised platforms. Sora’s emerging “AI influencers” could therefore face lawsuits from estates if they profit from the dead.A ‘Whac-A-Mole’ approachIn response to the backlash, OpenAI announced last week that it would begin allowing representatives of “recently deceased” public figures to request that their likeness be blocked from Sora videos.“While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, we believe that public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,” an OpenAI spokesperson said.‘My son genuinely believed it was real’: Parents are letting little kids play with AI. Are they wrong?Read moreThe company has not yet defined “recently”, or explained how requests will be handled. OpenAI did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.It has also backtracked on its copyright-free-for-all approach, after subversive content such as “Nazi Spongebob” spread across the platform and the Motion Picture Association accused OpenAI of infringement. A week after launch, it switched to an opt-in model for rights holders.Grimmelmann expects a similar pivot over depictions of the dead. “Insisting people must opt out if they don’t like this may not be tenable,” he says. “It’s ghoulish, and if I have that instinct, others will too – including judges.”Bergstedt calls this a “Whac-A-Mole” approach to guardrails that will probably continue until federal courts define AI liability.In Ajder’s view, the Sora dispute foreshadows a larger question each of us will eventually face: who gets to control our likeness in the synthetic age?“It’s a worrying situation if people simply accept that they’re going to be used and abused in hyperrealistic AI-generated content.”This article was amended on 17 October 2025 to include mention of OpenAI pledging to pause Sora 2 depictions of Martin Luther King Jr.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIArtificial intelligence (AI)Law (US)featuresShareReuse this content"

Yet with the cast and crew of productions already fretting over the coming role of AI in the industry, it is anincreasingly troubling undertaking.“It happens without warning,” says Olivia Williams, who adds she has been scanned more times than she cares to remember during a career that has spanned fromThe Sixth SensetoDune: Prophecy.“You are on set. You are in costume. A friendly assistant director who is already known to you, who brings you tea and holds your phone while you’re acting, says that the VFX [visual effects] team are in today – and just after you finish the scene, could you pop over to the VFX bus? And off you go.“Actors are, by and large,people pleasers. To have a standoff about scanning when you are in the midst of a scene annihilates your creativity, engenders fear that you will never work again, that your agent will drop you. So you comply.”Lead and supporting actors, stunt performers and dancers have all told the Guardian of similar experiences on set, of being ushered into scanners despite being unclear on their rights relating to the biometric data produced.Williams said performers were told that “if you want to be in the scene, or you want the scene to look cool with the alien crawling out of your brain”, then scans were needed.View image in fullscreenScanning ‘happens without warning’, said Olivia Williams, who said actors complied through ‘fear that you will never work again’.Photograph: David Vintiner/The ObserverThe experience has caused unease for some time, but the development of “AI doubles” for performers and claims about the arrival of “AI actors” has injected urgency into clarifying exactly what is happening to the data harvested on set.Those concerns were flushed into the open with the publicity aroundan AI actor called “Tilly Norwood”. It seems unlikely that the company behind the creation will generate the first AI star, but it has given a focus to an ongoing fight to clarify performers’ rights.Williams decided to put her head above the parapet out of concern for young actors just starting out, as well as the existential threat posed to performers known in the industry as supporting artistes (SAs), who populate a show’s crowds and backdrops.Dave Watts, an experienced SA who has appeared in numerous superhero movies and major productions, has been scanned several times. He said there were wider implications for the industry.“I already hear crew members saying: ‘To be honest, we don’t even need to do this any more. We can just ask AI to create a crowd of 1,000 people based on information which has already been captured,’” he said.“If you don’t have your usual crowd of 100, 200 or 500 SAs on a big production, then you also don’t need the assistant directors that look after them, and you don’t need the hair and makeup people. You don’t need the costume people, the costume fittings, all the caterers, all the drivers and location marshals. There’s a whole range of jobs there that AI effectively puts at risk.”View image in fullscreenImages of the AI-generated actor ‘Tilly Norwood’ have heightened concerns for performers.Photograph: ReutersA dancer, speaking anonymously due to concerns speaking out would affect their work, raised similar points about the pressure to be scanned and the use of the data. “Filming is gruelling – you’re getting up at 3am,” they said. “It’s now 8pm and you’re not allowed to go home until you’ve done it. The way it happens, you just really don’t have a choice.“You wonder, have we all done ourselves out of a job? It makes you feel a bit of a fool.”Alex Lawrence-Archer, a data rights lawyer from the law firm AWO which has been working with actors on the issue, said performers were hampered by a morass of complicated, overlapping laws. He said it was crucial for them to have clearer agreements going into a production, rather than trying to reclaim their data after the fact.“Contracts are often quite poorly drafted, often industry-standard wording that has been around for many years,” he said. “They’re really not designed with these kinds of technologies in mind. What you have is kind of a vacuum of uncertainty. In that vacuum, AI developers and studios are doing as much as they can get away with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They need to negotiate better contracts that are clearer and that truly reflect a fair agreement between actors, studios and AI developers.”There are now signs of a fledgling rebellion. On one recent shoot, performers were given advanced notice of scans after concerns were raised.“The cast has collectively been pushing back against the atmosphere of ambushing actors,” said one of the performers, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We succeeded in getting them to put a sort of addendum into our agreement, which basically prevents them from using the digital scans for anything other than the show without our written consent.”View image in fullscreenFilming in Cardiff for Mr Burton. As well as actors, AI puts the jobs of assistant directors, hair and makeup artists, costume designers and wardrobe staff, caterers, drivers and location marshals at risk, says one supporting actor.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe battle for rights in the face of the AI industry’s thirst for data can seem hopeless. Such data can be harvested from various footage and sources that sidestep professional performers. However, there is a consensus over attempting to take back some control.“The technology could conceivably be used in a reductionist way that drastically reduces the need for human performers, or it could be used to benefit creativity and build things out in a really positive way,” said Theo Morton, a professional stunt performer and member of the British Stunt Register. “There’s a lot of uncertainty and no one truly knows. That’s why it’s so important to create safeguards contractually, to protect against this potential erosion of control that could happen.”Williams, however, is among those who despair that control has already been lost.The great unknown is where exactly the data training AI models is coming from. Lawrence-Archer said that remained a closely guarded secret, but needed to be exposed. He also warned against reducing the issue to extra compensation for performers.“The AI industry relies on large amounts of data,” he said. “Someone is gathering it. We know that these questions are very sensitive for AI developers and studios. We have supported actors to make these data access requests, trying to learn more. I personally know of actors who have been paid off by AI companies in order to withdraw those requests.“We need to be building a world in which the human creativity, connection and performance of actors carries on being valued. If we focus only on legal and compensation questions, there’s a risk that you end up with actors becoming data gig workers, rather than the creative performers they are.”Explore more on these topicsAIData protectionRights issuesFilm industryArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyOlivia WilliamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The results are on display at an exhibition in London.Giant’s Causeway, now and visualisedGiant’s Causeway, now and visualised. By Alex GriffithsMark Maslin, a professor of earth system science at University College London, used climate modelling to examine the low-end and top-end damage at each location. His findings were interpreted by a group of artists for the show at the Last Shot Gallery by Back Market. The artistic works are not intended to be taken as literal predictions of what will happen in these locations, but to raise awareness of the threat posed by climate breakdown.Maslin said the environmental impact of tech consumptionwasestimated to account for 6% of the human-driven climate crisis; double that of the aviation industry.“There is a lack of awareness that all the gadgets people are using and replacing are contributing to overconsumption, huge pollution and climate change,” he said. “We are trying to raise that awareness. I don’t think people using their phone every single day have any idea of its impact on the planet.”Moraine Lake in Canada, now and visualisedMoraine Lake in Canada, now and visualised. By Hugh JardineThe climate damage caused by fast tech stems from the mining of materials such as tantalum, cobalt and tin – a process with serious social and environmental repercussions – and the disposal of e-waste, which releases harmful greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide, when incinerated or pollutes soil and water with toxic chemicals from improper landfill disposal.He said legislation to curb built-in obsolescence was being introduced by the EU, including rules for universal chargers rather than the plethora of wires and plugs that piled up in people’s homes.Tech companies are pushing back, accusing the bloc and other legislators of interfering in the free market. The EU adopted a directive in June 2024 that mandates repairs for a wider range of products, extends legal guarantees and prohibits manufacturers from blocking third-party parts.Iguazu Falls, now and visualisedIguazu Falls, now and visualised by Osman GThe UK has had regulations since 2021 that apply to certain appliances,but there are concernsover their effectiveness.Luke Forshaw, the head of brand and marketing at Back Market, a global marketplace dedicated to refurbished technology that produced the exhibition with Maslin, said: “Our research shows that while people recognise the changes happening around them, too many still don’t see how their everyday choices, particularly around tech, connect to the bigger picture.”Venice – now and visualisedVenice – now and visualised. By Archie McGrath and Josiah NaguarIn 2022, a record62m tonnes of electronic waste was produced, making it one of the world’s fastest-growing waste streams.

But to those who formed a robust parasocial bond with the duo – who have more than 13 million collective subscribers onYouTube– this was a revelatory moment. It was also a sobering reminder of the emotional damage that toxic fandoms can wreak on their subjects.Over the course of 45 minutes, Howell and Lester, now in their thirties, share the “apocalyptic constant stress of the Dan and Phil dating conspiracy”, where “fans” subjected them to frenzied speculation for 16 years straight. Whole subsets of the Dan and Phil fandom were dedicated to “proving”, once and for all, that the pair – known as “Phan”, à la Brangelina – were more than just friends. Online sleuths went on to dox, harass, and borderline stalk Howell and Lester; in the video, they describe even being filmed at the supermarket.As Lester describes, being a fan of Dan and Phil was as much about their funny videos as it was about “the secret mirror world of content” fans became obsessed with: the supposed hints and clues they dropped that would out a relationship they didn’t want to make public.Howell describes the impact of his “extremely homophobic childhood”, which kept him “deep in the closet” for many years (Howell and Lester individually came out as gay in 2019).“In my mid-20s, I felt we had to hide the relationship because I was still hiding who I was to my friends, family, myself,” Howell says. “This is why all of the digging from people online hit a nerve, because Phil was my safe space. […] what we had was the most important thing to me and I wanted to protect it, so when other people tried to grab it and drag it into the light, I felt completely violated.”The duo relate the unique humiliation of having a private Valentine’s Day video, made by Lester for Howell in the early, heady days of their relationship, get leaked due to a YouTube glitch. Only a handful of fans saw it, but the damage was done. The video was reuploaded, shared, commented on, used as evidence in the quest to uncover the conspiracy. It nearly broke Howell and Lester’s relationship for good.“I remember messaging someone saying, ‘Please, can you take this down?’” Lester says. “And they said, ‘No, what’s on the internet is for ever. It’s your fault.’ And I was like, ‘How can someone be so mean about something so personal?’”Howell, clearly still shaken by the experience more than a decade later, adds: “It felt like an assault.”Howell and Lester remain remarkably good-humoured in the video, and praise their fan community on the whole: “I want to be clear,” Howell says emphatically. “We love our audience. Dan and Phil followers are the funniest fandom. So creative. They’re good people.”But the more distressing revelations are startling, and an apt summation of the toxic way some modern fandoms function. The term “stan” originates from Eminem’s titular 2000 song about a fan so disturbed by his obsession with the artist that he ends up committing murder suicide – and these days, in online spaces, it feels as though the ‘stan’ and the ‘hater’ are becoming one and the same. Just days ago,Billie Eilish was physically dragged into the crowdby someone in the front row of her concert.In late 2019, K-pop idol Goo Hara took her own life after being subject to severe online harassment. And just in August,Amazon shared a PSA to fansof its hit show The Summer I Turned Pretty, instructing them that there was a “zero tolerance policy for bullying and hate speech”.“Keep the conversation kind,” Amazon posted later. “The show isn’t real but the people playing the characters are.” The caption accompanied a video graphic that read: “The summer we started acting normal online.”In 2025, almost every public figure has a‘snark’ subredditdevoted to them, whose participants track their every move obsessively; imagine keeping a running tally of how many timessomeone yawns. Haters, just like fans, are the first to click on a new video, a new song, a new Instagram upload. The parasocialism of the stan and the hater is one and the same.And when it comes to scrutiny over someone’s sexuality, we know how invasive it can be for the subjects – because they’ve told us. In the Dan & Phil video, Howell describes experiencing suicidal thoughts directly related to the intense speculation over his relationship from so-called fans. Last year pop star Shawn Mendesspoke publiclyagainst the widespread rumours about his sexuality, saying it “always felt like such an intrusion on something very personal to me”. This week, Stranger Things star Noah Schnapp recalled journalists asking if he was gay when he was just 12 and 13. “I was obviously very scared of talking about it,” he said in an interview with Time. “I didn’t know what to say.” A subsection of Taylor Swift fans known as Gaylors pick over her songs and interviewsfor evidence she is secretly a lesbian.As Howell and Lester acknowledge, it’s normal towonderabout the private lives of celebrities – but the relentless scrutiny they have endured goes far beyond innocent curiosity. Regardless of whether it was coming from stans or haters, the “apocalyptic, constant stress” of it would feel exactly the same.Explore more on these topicsYouTubeCelebrityTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Here is a gnarled landmass of bubblegum blues, powder pinks and strange, luminous beasts, where evolution seems to occur at light speed. This world’s considerable beauty is amplified by how it is rendered: like a 1980s fantasy movie filled with charmingly handmade practical effects. Keeper is the latest title from Double Fine, maker of trippy platformerPsychonauts 2, Kickstarter sensationBroken Ageand many other idiosyncratic titles. It is an action-adventure resplendent with the lumps and bumps of life’s imperfections, as if its 3D modellers had sculpted the setting from papier-mache rather than using computer software.Even stranger than the setting is the protagonist: you play as a lighthouse, coming to appreciate this gleaming ecological fantasia by shining its beacon about the environment. Long shadows stretch behind illuminated objects, making the outlines of spectacularly supersized plants and tiny critters all the more pronounced. The casting of light is how you interact with the world: it often causes vegetation to grow before your eyes, and sometimes unusual inhabitants will feast upon it. As you lumber through this environment – calm lagoons and sun-baked canyons filled with prickly cacti – there is joy to be found in simply looking, taking the weirdness in, and then bringing it to even greater life.View image in fullscreenPuzzle solving … Keeper.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosThat seems to be your role in Keeper: lighthouse as life giver. Quickly, you gain a companion: a bird called Twig, whose beak is made from driftwood. You become a double act: at various points, you send your feathered friend to turn a crank (in this far-future take on planet Earth, the organic and mechanical have fused, like a steampunk take on Henry David Thoreau). But these puzzles are no match for the daring ingenuity of the visual design, nor do they especially resonate with the game’s celebration of biology. Early on, you are merely swivelling the analogue stick, making the one cog line up with another.Too often, puzzles feel like a roadblock to exploration rather than an enabler. But, slowly, Keeper begins to lean into the surrealism of its world to generate surprises. At one point, a candy floss-like substance gets stuck to your lighthouse, causing it to become weightless. Rather than wobbling awkwardly, suddenly you’re leaping with grace, suspended in the air for many seconds, exuberant at the ability to take flight.Thereafter, Keeper finds an evolutionary groove. The lighthouse transforms into a boat of delightfully piscine characteristics: what pleasure there is swishing and whirling about in azure blue water. The game then takes a darker, more abstract turn as you become a red-hot disc of metal, carving through knotted undergrowth like a primordial Sonic the Hedgehog.View image in fullscreenA surreal setting … Keeper.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosKeeper speaks clearest through its tremendous images, while billing itself as a “story told without words”. But the latter isn’t quite right. At various points, button prompts flash up on screen: for example, press X to “peck”. In spelling out exactly what the player should be doing, the world’s ambiguity is diminished.This problem recurs at the game’s conclusion, albeit from a different angle. Without spoiling exactly what happens, the player seems to be presented with the magnificent and incomprehensible totality of existence itself. How do we interact with such transcendent profundity? Sadly, with another rote shape-based puzzle involving kaleidoscopic crystals and a black hole. That is Keeper in a nutshell, a game that lacks the interactive vocabulary to wholly embrace the weirdness it depicts with such sparkling, vivid imagination.Keeper is out now onXboxand PC, £24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesXboxPCPuzzle gamesAdventure gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there are others that need to be savoured, and sometimes even suffered. Silent Hill f is in the latter category, which is why our review is somewhat delayed. This slowburn descent into psychological horror is set in 1960s Japan, but it also has pertinent things to say about the modern era and the tendrils of misogyny crawling out of the basement of the culture wars.Lead character Hinako Shimizu is a school girl in the small conservative town of Ebisugaoka. Her father is a bully who treats his wife like a servant and his daughter like an inconvenience, and her best friend is Shu, a boy who may harbour deeper feelings for her – much to the frustration of another friend Rinko, who has a serious crush on him. It reads like a teen drama, which in a way it is, until an apocalyptic supernatural fog descends on the town and almost everyone goes missing.View image in fullscreenFilled with arresting imagery … Silent Hill f.Photograph: Konami Digital EntertainmentFrom here, we are very much in classic Silent Hill territory. You must explore the streets and alleys of the stricken town, now populated by a range of perversely eroticised monsters, from jolting marionettes with daggers to the wildly Freudian hatchers, who are covered in breast-like cysts and continuously give birth to more beasts. Whenever Hinako loses consciousness she finds herself in a shadowy underworld, where a man with a fox mask effectively gaslights her into a seemingly destructive quest of self-discovery and rebirth – against the warnings of her childhood doll, which makes regular visitations.The game, then, joins a crowded pantheon of horror texts that explore – often with a sense of dread and repugnance – the transition from girl to woman. Like The Exorcist, like Carrie, like the onryō movies of modern Japanese horror cinema we are in the territory of the “monstrous-feminine”, cinema academic Barbara Creed’s famous study of horror films in which the female reproductive body is a source of abject anxiety and revulsion. Just as the village in Silent Hill 2 came to embody lead character James Sunderland’s psychosexual neuroses , the monsters that lurk in the darkened, misty corners of Hinako’s home town are exaggerated versions of her own everyday fears as well as the attitudes of the society she lives in.Silent Hill at 20: the game that taught us to fear ourselvesRead moreIt is fascinating stuff, filled with arresting imagery. From the desolate farmland bordering the town, to the shadowy halls of the spirit world, each location is filled with detail that quietly serves the narrative. Combat is stilted and sometimes frustrating, but that was always the case with this genre until Resident Evil 4 came along, and we’re playing as a school kid, not a special ops soldier or an elite cop. The puzzles are familiar to survival horror veterans, but challenging enough to keep you going. The little cinematic scenes in which you meet up again with Rinko and Shu build the complexities of their friendship, and the societal expectations it apes, without outstaying their welcome. The endings tie in with previous games, providing an array of outcomes, some ghastly, some hilarious.Most of all, this is that rarest of things: a horror game that actually has something to say. Rather than simply throwing jumpscares and black-haired ghost maidens at you until you submit, it uses rural mythology and superstition as a lens through which to examine the harms of patriarchy and the rigidly gendered expectations it thrusts on to teenagers. It also proves that the survival horror genre still has so much to give, 30 years after its inception. You must come to Ebisugaoka as soon as you can, and stay at least a week, maybe longer.Silent Hill f is out now, £60Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

The demonstrations come as former intelligence and national security officialswarnthat the country is sliding towards “competitive authoritarianism”, in which elections and courts survive but are systematically manipulated by the executive.The justice system is not a nice addition to democracy but a core, constitutive element of it. This is now imperilled not only by Mr Trump’s stacking of the judiciary, pardoning of January 6 rioters who assaulted police, and ignoring of rulings that restrain the executive’s actions, but also by its abuse for political ends. The US is descending fromrule of lawtowardsrule by law: from law as the restraint upon the executive, applied without fear or favour, to law as its weapon.Thursday saw the announcement of theprosecution of John Bolton– the third high-profile political target of Mr Trump within a month to be criminally charged.Letitia James, the New York attorney general who successfully sued Mr Trump for fraud, was indicted for alleged mortgage fraud; the former FBI directorJames Comey, under whose watch the bureau investigated Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, for analleged false statementto Congress. Both deny all charges.Mr Trump said the quiet part out loud in asocial media postapparently publishedunintentionally, which urged Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to take legal action against Ms James, Mr Comey and the Democratic senator Adam Schiff: “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”The indictment of Mr Bolton for alleged mishandling of classified information – he denies the charges and drew parallels to Stalinist purges – issomewhat different. The other indictments followed the installation of a former personal lawyer for Mr Trump as prosecutor. This case was pursued under the Biden presidency and a career prosecutor signed off the charges.Yet the administration shrugged when the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,shared details of planned military strikeswith relatives and a journalist via a commercial messaging app. Mr Trump has repeatedly made plain his enmity for Mr Bolton, a former national security adviser turned outspoken critic, including byaxing his security detail. He regularly calls for the jailing of opponents, including judges who obstruct his administration, as well asJB Pritzker, governor of Illinois, and Brandon Johnson, Chicago’s mayor,after the Democrats opposed the deployment of troops to the city.Mr Trump has sold personal vindictiveness as political righteousness, campaigningwith the words“I am your retribution”. He has been remarkably successful. In a recent survey, a third of Republicansbacked the ideathat American citizens who oppose the president should be deported.The administration has already presented Saturday’s protestsas a threat to order. Mr Trump’s political triumph has been built on invoking crisis to distract from or justify the erasure of democratic safeguards. This is an old playbook, and no less frightening for its familiarity. It is the weaponising of a fundamental part of US democracy that is the real emergency.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS supreme courtJohn BoltonLetitia JamesJames ComeyPete HegsetheditorialsShareReuse this content"

He is preparing for battle against the ‘enemy within’Fri 17 Oct 2025 12.51 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 17.55 EDTShareDonald Trump had better hope the members of the Nobel committee are not paying attention to what’s happening inside the United States. If they did take a look, they’d notice a jarring pattern. While the US president likes to play the peacemaker abroad, at home he is Trump, bringer of war.It’s easy for the first fact to conceal, or divert our attention away from, the second. This week was a case in point. It began with Trump travelling to Israel, where he was hailed as a latter-day Cyrus, a mighty ruler whose name would be spoken of for millennia to come, the man who had brokered what he himself boasts is an“everlasting” peace.Never mind that Trump’s success, for which he certainly deserves some credit, was in pushing Hamas and Israel to agree a ceasefire and release of hostages and prisoners, a fragile arrangement that does not address, let alone solve, the underlying Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He presented it as a triumph of the ages and one more notch on his peacemaker’s bedpost, taking the tally of wars he claims to have ended to eight.Indeed, buoyed up by his success, he is having another go at the one he thought would be easy but which, to his irritation, has proved as complex as all the hated experts and deep state naysayers warned it would be: Russia’s war on Ukraine. On Thursday he announced his plan to meet yet again with Vladimir Putin, this timehosted by Viktor Orbánin Budapest (which has the happy side-benefit of trolling the EU).Unfazed by the failure of their last meeting in Alaska, and by his own failure ever to stand up to Putin, Trump clearly believes he has pacific momentum and that the healing magic his touch brought to Gaza will similarly unite Moscow and Kyiv.But what undermines this new, Nobel-ready look of Trump’s is not only the absurd braggadocio, or even the confusion of the style and optics of peacemaking for the substance and hard graft it requires. It is the fact that he is fomenting war at home on his own citizens. I am not speaking metaphorically. Increasingly, serious analysts not prone to hyperbole are warning that Trump seems bent onprovoking a second American civil war. The evidence is piling up.The most obvious is Trump’s deployment of US troops on the streets of America’s cities. He claims that his original decisions to send in the National Guard to Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, Portland and Memphis were motivated solely by concern over crime. In his telling, these places were “overrun” by violence and local police needed his help. But that doesn’t stack up.The data showsthat most of the cities Trump has targeted havelowerrates of violent crime than other large cities that have remained untouched. (Of the 10 major US cities with the biggest crime problems, Trump has hit only one: Memphis.) So why would Trump be sending in the troops?One explanation is that he lives in such a closed filter bubble, his sources of information so narrow, that he is not in possession of the actual facts. Earlier this month, he described Portland, Oregon as a “burning hellhole”, adding that “You see fires all over the place. You see fights, and I mean just violence. It’s just so crazy.” The people of Portland – cycling or taking their kids to the park, as normal – were bemused. It seemedTrump had been watching Fox News, confusing footage from the riots of 2020 with today.But none of this is a mistake. For what the likes of Chicago, LA and Portland have in common is not imagined rates of runaway crime but something that angers Trump much more: they are Democrat-run cities in Democrat-led states. (The giveaway is that Cleveland, Ohio and Kansas City, Missouri have higher rates of violent crime but are under Republican governors. So they have been left alone.)This is a political act by Trump, designed to intimidate potential strongholds of opposition. Some critics suspect the administration hopes to provoke violence from those whose cities now feel like occupied territory. Perhaps a riot or an attack on the military that can be instantly spun, as the assassination of Charlie Kirk was, as an act of leftist terrorism that merits a further crackdown, seizure of emergency powers or suspension of liberties.Others believe this is about normalising the presence of troops on the streets before next year’s midterm elections, a crucial contest that could see Republicans lose the House of Representatives, handing Democrats a serious check on Trump’s power. In this view, troops will be in place either to scare away minorities and others who might usually vote for the Democratic party, or for the battle after polling day, to enforce an attempt by the White House to void results that don’t go their way. Think of a re-run of 6 January 2021 – except this time with the armed forces on hand to ensure Trump’s will is done.The obvious objection to this scenario is that the US military would surely refuse to let itself be used as a partisan political instrument. But that is to miss what Trump and Pete Hegseth – now rebranded not as secretary of defence, but as secretary of war – are doing to the US military. Witness last month’s jawdropping meeting of hundreds of top US admirals and generals, gathered from across the globe. Trump could not have been clearer, instructing them that they now faced an “enemy from within”, that their job was to deal with “civil disturbances” and that they should regard America’s “dangerous cities as training grounds”. At one point, Hegseth said that any officer who disagreed with the new, Trumpian conception of the US military should “do the honorable thing and resign”.All of this comes in the context of a president who is nakedly using the justice system to punish his critics – notethe indictment issued on Thursdayagainst his former national security adviser John Bolton – whose chief adviser called the Democratic party a “domestic extremist organisation” even before the Kirk killing; that sends masked agents to snatch people, including US citizens, off the streets; that is using the government shutdown to eliminate “Democrat agencies”, meaning those pockets of the independent civil service that might act as a restraint on presidential whim, while cutting funds to institutions, from the universities topublic broadcasting, that might do the same; and that is imposing ideological orthodoxy on the entire federal bureaucracy, with the FBI’s firing of an employee who haddisplayed the pride flagonly the latest example.Trump likes talking the peace talk when it comes to Palestinians and Israelis or Russians and Ukrainians. But inside the US, where red meets blue, he does not see a contest between rivals but rather a conflict with an enemy headmits he hates– one that has to be fought by any means necessary, even to the very end.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just a bunch of fibers sprouting out of your skin, yet we make a massive fuss over it. Those with it, flaunt it. News anchors, fashion models, that damned Jeremy Allen White. Boy, does he love to show off. His hair should be nominated for an Emmy, just on thickness alone. What did he do to deserve that floppy mess on top of his head? I thought this country was a meritocracy? Nope. He’s obviously benefited from a family history of thick locks.Call me greedy if you must, but I don’t just wantsomehair – the sad remnants of a life in decline – I wanta lot of hair. I want so much hair that I have to employ a live-in barber to trim me up twice a day just to keep it all from consuming my entire face. I want people in the streets screaming at the top of their lungs. “Look at that hair! The guy under it isn’t so bad, either!”I wouldn’t dare classify myself as bald, though. Thinning? Sure. Most people are not tall enough to see my bald spot, nor can they clearly see the nearly imperceptible retreat of my hairline. Unless they spend even a second comparing photos of me today to my Guardian author photo, which is from nine years ago. You might not notice, but I do. I have to carve out an extra 20 minutes every morning just to fuss over my bald spot. I summon what little hope I have left to comb and fluff the thin area at the top of my head, praying I can figure out the cheat code for hiding my darkest shame. Eventually, I surrender – the rage over my metaphorical windmill subsiding as I accept reality.‘The worst of all time’: Trump rails against ‘super bad’ Time magazine coverRead moreUnfortunately, for some, being angry and indignant is a prominent part of their personality. Donald Trump’s latest tirade is, at its core, about his own battle with the ravages of time. Literally and figuratively. Once again, Trump has come face to face with what he actually looks like, which would terrify and enrage just about anyone. When he’s notobsessing over the afterlife, Trump spends an inordinate amount of time kvetching about his appearance. First, it was apainting that made him look like a time-traveling Tudor monarchwho just got kicked out of a Sizzler buffet line. Now, he’s directed his ire at Time magazine, which put him on the cover in tribute to his efforts to broker peace in Gaza. The headline, “His Triumph”, cements the fawningly positive positioning.The staff at Time probably thought they were going to get a gentle kiss on the cheek from Daddy (the owner of Time is the billionaire Marc Benioff, who has recentlycome out as a Trump supporter), but instead they received a digital tongue lashing for the cover photo – shot from underneath, Trump’s obscene neck crease filling the frame. At the top of the cover, Trump’s signature metallic yellow wave of hair looks thin and wispy, like someone dumped a handful of dry angel hair pasta on his head as a college prank.As is his right as an American with the power of free speech as enshrined in our constitution, Trumpused Truth Socialto register his displeasure. “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”Maybe Ice got a hold of his hair and refuses to disclose its whereabouts. As for the crown, you’d think he’d appreciate the honor, but gratitude is not a Maga virtue. I understand the thing about the angles, though. Who wants to be photographed from underneath besides models for an obscure fetish blog and professional wrestlers?I recognize that the natural first reaction to realizing you’re losing your hair is to be angry about it. Surely, it must be someone else’s fault. It’s the angles or the lighting. The reality is what it is, though, and it’s better to live in the world than to imagine it as something else. The man is nearly 80. Hair loss at that age seems inevitable, unless you’re an obscure Kennedy cousin or a member of the Rolling Stones. But there have never been more ways to solve the problem of thinning hair.There are transplant procedures, the tried-and-true Rogaine method, spraying Krylon paint on yourself and praying the temperature doesn’t rise above 70F, and various magical pills that supposedly offer painless hair regrowth. I was watching the Major League Baseball playoffs recently, which is a treasure trove of ads for bizarre medical treatments, alcoholic beverages and sitcoms no one watches. One of the ads was for a product called Nutrafol, which is a pill that promises to regrow hair “from within” – not exactly where I want hair to grow. I’m not looking to grow an afro in my colon, so maybe they should rethink their marketing strategy.The Nutrafol website looks like you should be able to order Sweetgreen from it – bland fonts, tasteful product shots, and random photos of people looking up to the sky like a 747 is about to crash into their barn. The pills contain a variety of natural-sounding ingredients like “horsetail” (horses have beautiful hair!), kelp (not much hair down in the ocean, but sure), and something called “tocotrienol complex”, which sounds like the name of a synth band from the late 1980s.I can’t in good conscience endorse such a product in my position as a credible journalist, but you know who can? The president of the United States. The Trump administration has already vaporized most norms and rules of decorum for the highest office in the land, so why not reach a little bit deeper into our collective pockets for some more loose change? Spin this negative into a positive and let Trump – who has already successfully sold his fans hats, steaks, fake college educations, wine and an imploding economy – endorse a pill for bald guys.

A ceasefire is in place. Humanitarian trucks have begun to roll in. Hostages and prisoners are being exchanged. Israel has begun a first-phase pullback from the territories it controls, and under Trump’s plan its troops will eventually be deployed in a buffer zone along Gaza’s land border.Given these developments – all part of the opening phase – dismissing the momentous changes in Gaza is to deny reality. There have already been disputes over the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages, but there are unresolved longer-term problems that could derail the ceasefire and imperil the rest of the Trump plan.One concerns Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza. Even after the IDF’s first pullback, it will control more than half of the territory, including thePhiladelphi corridoradjacent to Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has insisted it must relinquish. The next withdrawal is supposed toreduce Israel’s military presencein Gaza to 40%, followed by another that cuts it to 15%.Disputes over the extent and pace of the IDF’s withdrawals could jeopardise the ceasefire. The plan heightens this risk by failing to specify a timeline for the IDF’s remaining disengagements – or who will ensure their implementation, and how.These aren’t trivial omissions.Hamashad long insisted that Israel must leave all of Gaza as part of any ceasefire deal. Its negotiators settled for less because of intense pressure from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, enlisted by Trump for that purpose.If Israel balks at additional withdrawals, Hamas can’t count on Trump to act as enforcer. It doubtless remembers that in March Israel walked away from the multi-stage15 January agreement, which the US supported, once it came time to negotiate a timetable for the departure of its troops – even though hostage releases remained incomplete. The White House did nothing in response, not even after Israel also imposed athree-month blockadeon aid deliveries.More recently, Hamas watched Benjamin Netanyahu ignore Trump’s call earlier this month forIsrael to haltits bombing, issued after Hamas’swritten responseto his plan convinced him that its leaders were prepared for peace. Again, the US stood by as Israel continued its offensive in Gaza City,killing dozensof its inhabitants, including children, within a day of Trump’s appeal.The Trump plan prohibits Israel’s occupation or annexation ofGaza. That proviso doesn’t, however, rule out an open-ended Israeli military presence – portrayed as temporary and justified by allegations that Hamas hasn’t met its disarmament obligations. But the more Hamas believes that Israel is seeking to delay its departure, the more likely it is to stall on disarmament.Though the plan calls on Hamas to surrender its weaponry and permit the destruction of its underground tunnel network and weapons production centres, it lacks monitoring and verification provisions.This omission could give Israel leeway to delay withdrawing troops by citing Hamas’s non-compliance and provide Hamas room to deny the charge. How will the veracity of Israel’s claims and Hamas’s rebuttals be verified? How will Hamas’s obligations be enforced, and by whom?Given the complete lack of trust between Hamas and Israel, the plan’s vagueness makes disputes over disarmament all but inevitable – and potentially fatal to the ceasefire.This isn’t a far-fetched scenario. Yechiel Leiter, Israel’s ambassador to the US,said recentlythat Israel would remain in Gaza until Hamas disarms fully, and shortly after his cabinet approved the ceasefire plan, Netanyahu vowed to resume the war if Gaza wasn’t “demilitarised”. What’s more, Israel hasnot promiseda total military withdrawal even if those conditions are met.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also worries that the IDF will then have greater freedom to remain in parts of Gaza that lie beyond the buffer zone or to demand that the zone extend deeper into Gaza. Tellingly, Hamas’s statement accepting the ceasefire did not mention disarmament. Moreover, on Saturday, one of its senior officialsstatedthat, “The demand that we hand over our weapons is not up for negotiation,” adding that disarmament was “out of the question”.Another problem with the Trump plan is theinternational stabilisation force(ISF), which it says will be composed of troops from regional states and other Muslim countries, and will assume responsibility for Gaza’s security after the IDF hands over the areas it leaves. The plan offers no details on the size of this peacekeeping force, the scope of its responsibilities and the means it will use to contain disorder, whether from clashes between Hamas and Israel or violence pitting Hamas against armed groups (some rival clans, othersbacked by Israel), something that hasalready occurred. Plus, thougha fewstates have signalled their interest, none has yet committed to providing troops for the ISF – perhaps because of these looming dangers.And assuming that Israel will countenance a robust peacekeeping force in Gaza – where it has acted without constraint since seizing the territory during the 1967 six-day war – is a leap of faith. Should Israel continue to intervene in Gaza, citing threats to its security, it’s hard to imagine the ISF resisting, particularly if the IDF goes further and reoccupies parts of the territory.Gaza’s ceasefire isn’t fated to fail, but its foundation is fragile. If it cracks, the rest of the Trump plan – continued aid deliveries, the deployment of peacekeepers, a postwar governance structure and economic reconstruction – will remain aspirational. Worse, Gaza could revert to a killing field.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They’re all coming out.”The Republican Minnesota congressman Tom Emmer said the party’s “terrorist wing” was holding the “Hate America” rally. “Democrats want to keep the government shut down to show all those people that are going to come here and express their hatred towards this country that they’re fighting President Trump,”said the House majority leader, Steve Scalise. The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, embellished the story onFox, referring to the demonstrations’ “paid protesters” and adding: “It begs the question who’s funding it.”These people are, of course, slandering the second round ofNo Kingsmarches, following those on 14 June, which dwarfed Trump’s pitiful birthday party military parade. This time the events – more than2,500of them, according to organizers, planned for every state – promise to be even larger.Stephen Miller is the most dangerous man in the Trump administration | Judith LevineRead moreTrump’s allies are trying to overwrite the patriotic, historically resonant words “No Kings” with insinuations of treasonous violence.Everyone participating in the protests must prove them wrong. Nonviolence, both rigorously disciplined and open-hearted, must define 18 October.The stakes are bigger than anything that happens tomorrow. Because these politicians are not just talking. This smear campaign is one skirmish in the all-fronts war on a vaguely defined leftwing entity the administration calls “antifa”. This war – declared in the 25 September national security presidential memorandum,Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence– is not just supported by propaganda. Disinformation is its essence.The national security reporterKen Klippensteinpublished a restricted-circulation FBI/homeland security bulletin on “domestic violence extremists” (DVE), released on 1 October, that links attacks on Ice buildings to peaceful anti-Ice demonstrations. Since June, it says, “small groups of threat actors, some of whom are DVEs, have leveraged large, lawful protests” in California and Oregon “to engage in violent activity” against Ice facilities and “violent confrontations with law enforcement”.Last week, at a White House“antifa roundtable”, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, claimed: “Antifa is just as sophisticated as MS-13, as [Tren de Aragua], as Isis, as Hezbollah, as Hamas, as all of them.” The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, thanked the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, “for getting to the bottom of these funding mechanisms and individuals who are perpetuating [sic] this violence on our American cities”.Commentators on the “Hate America” blitz, including some of the events’ organizers, have called it an attempt to silence dissent by scaring would-be marchers into staying home. My hunch is that diminishing the crowds is just half of the strategy. The other half is more pernicious. With Ice and the military already dispatched to terrorize Black and blue cities, such language may inspire civilian paramilitaries – many of them armed, organized and trained – to go into the streets and cause mayhem.These militias took action on 6 January 2021. They are itching for another opportunity to attack the “enemy within”, and they don’t need explicit orders to do so. “Hate America” is the phrase that could impel them to act.Maga wants nothing more than violence at the marchesIn larger cities like New York and San Francisco, the marchers will far outnumber any counter-protesters. In the cities occupied by federal troops, where local police don’t relish the optics of teargas wafting through crowds of elderly baby boomers and babies in strollers, there’s no guarantee the feds will restrain themselves. The national guard and Ice have alreadygassed and pepper-sprayeddemonstrators apparently doing nothing more aggressive than standing around and yelling, or, like theChicago pastor shot in the headwith a pepper ball canister, nothing aggressive at all.Enter the freelance enforcers. And it’s in the red states, where gun laws are lax and progressives constitute a small minority, that the odds of aggression and goading to aggression by Maga loyalists are highest.Maga wants nothing more than violence at the marches. Any violent clash, no matter who starts it, will be a green light to the administration to step up the policing crackdown, including on Saturday. The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has beentossing around the word “insurrection”to describe peaceful opposition to the Trump agenda. The president could use anything construable as chaos to invoke the Insurrection Act.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not mild, not even friendly. Contradictory as it sounds, steadfast nonviolent resistance against a violent state is the most righteous expression of rage.It’s reassuring that the national non-profit Indivisible, which is also reportedlyin Trump’s sights, is among the groups at the helm of the No Kings events. Since its founding in 2016, the organization has been committed to nonviolence. “We reject all forms of political violence and intimidation, no matter the source or the target,” reads itswebsite. “That’s not just a moral stance – it’s a strategic one. Movements that create lasting change do so by building trust, forging solidarity and demonstrating discipline, even in the face of threats or attacks.”Almost all of the 250partner organizationsthat appear on NoKings.org are as politically vanilla as progressives can get: the ACLU, Faithful America, the Sierra Club, the Feminist Majority.Alert to the administration’s provocations, Indivisible provides detailedinformationon running legal, safe and peaceful events. “We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values,” itsays. Weapons of any kind are always prohibited.The good news is that nonviolence is the 21st-century US left’s default behavior. With few exceptions, it is not just nonviolent; it is anti-violence. Prison abolition, disarmament, the feminist politics of care, pacifism – these are leftwing movements. By contrast, extreme-right causes, institutions and tropes – gun rights, the carceral state, the “warrior ethos” – spell out a politics of coercion, cruelty and punishment.On 18 October, tens of millions of people in the streets, peacefully exercising the democratic rights that the Trump regime is laboring to eliminate, will give the lie to Maga’s hallucinatory network of bomb-throwing traitors. No Kings will show America who the real haters are.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

Indeed, for his part, James’ only contribution to the discourse has been astatement of support for Israel. Otherwise, athletes have largely chosen to shut up and dribble.However, in December 2023, former NBA player and Guardian contributorEtan Thomasprovided a windowinto how many NBA players actually feel, noting that in response to his own public comments on Gaza he received “over a dozen messages from different active NBA players and even more from retired NBA players thanking me”. One anonymized player told him, “Their oppression is too forreal !! It’s just evil!” while another explained, “I was actually advised by my agent to stay far away from this topic unless I wanted theKyrie treatment….Hard to admit we’ve been hoodwinked our entire lives on Israel and if we say anything, we’re labeled anti semitic smh.”In order to better understand what is going on around athlete activism andGaza, we spoke to seven current and former athletes. Some players we spoke to were granted anonymity to protect them from reprisal for their comments.US Olympic trial runner Jesse Joseph was frank about his despair at the situation: “It’s been hard seeing the silence from so much of the professional running world, especially knowing that many of these athletes truly do want an end to the slaughter but don’t want to speak out on a public stage. … Athletes for the Palestinian national teams in multiple sports have been killed by Israel, yet most of the sporting world appears to be totally fine entering into competition with Israeli teams as if everything were normal.”He noted that “there are many pressures that prevent athletes from speaking out - fear of losing sponsorships, general fear of backlash, and fear of repression.”Another US Olympic trial runner, echoed this point: “It’s the conversations that don’t happen, and the impacts felt in the shadows that I’ve just had to accept. You never know if you’ll get passed up for a job, if you’re ending up on some surveillance list, or if it’s just a silent backing away of support that will make itself known in the future.”Still, Joseph underlined, compared to sport, in “other cultural fields that have similar pressures such as the film industry, people have been more outspoken. It helps to have a critical mass of voices. There’s safety and solidarity in numbers.”One of the issues we asked the athletes we spoke to about was whether players are being specifically counseled not to speak. A current athlete and former Olympian told us, “I have not been counseled at all. But, hey, I am notLeBron James.”His perspective is that what athletes struggle with most “is that focus on their sport and how they balance that with their political activism. And how they can signal to their sponsor, ‘Hey, my head is still in the game despite all the stuff I might be involved outside of it,’ and I think that is probably the most telling on whether or not a company fully pulls funding or not. Or resorts to silencing tactics.”Sponsorship, as every athlete we spoke to mentioned, is a critical issue.Nikki Dryden, two-time Olympic swimmer and human rights lawyer, told us, “Some athletes have morality clauses in their sporting contracts or sponsorship contracts, and whether this issue would be included or not, the fear that it could be used will silence some. These disrepute clauses are very broad and use threats and intimidation to keep athletes from speaking out. At the Olympics for example, if you violate anything in your athlete agreement you are threatened with having your Olympic results erased ... think about Manizha Talash, a 20-year-old refugee who was literally kicked out of the village by the IOC and left on her own on the streets of Paris!”A recently active NFL player echoed this concern: “I would guarantee that sponsors are part of the reason players don’t speak out about Gaza. Talking about homophobia is a piece of cake compared to talking about Israel in this moment. Sponsors are comfortable about that. When it comes to the war on Gaza, that feels way way more like there will be consequences to sponsorship for speaking out on the ‘wrong’ side.”In the most striking case of the players we spoke to, a women’s professional basketball player told us, “As a professional, one thing I did have to navigate was firing my agent, as it was revealed to me through her instagram stories that she was a raging Zionist, spreading false propaganda and frankly racist narratives that painted Palestinians as ‘savage’ or ‘terrorists’. This agent was/is a highly respected and well connected agent in the women’s basketball space, so maybe in theory I could be missing out on some brand deals, or playing opportunities. Maybe there are also opportunities I am not even aware I am missing out on due to my stance on Gaza, given there are a lot of powerful people in the NBA and WNBA who are Zionists.”“But,” the player added, “I feel much more satisfied standing on my principles and using my platform to speak out against a genocide that will go down in history as one if not the worst human rights abuses of our lifetime.”The former NFL player told us that one area of principal concern is the prospect of being labeled antisemitic. He told us, “When it comes to someone speaking about Israel, I think it is something that gets escalated because of the assumption of antisemitism. There seems to be socially a ranking of which issues are okay, and it seems like in the last hundred years, antisemitism has shot up that list.“Even if someone is incredibly well-educated on Gaza and also feel in a way that is left-leaning and feeling that there is a genocide and the reaction to October 7 is vastly overdone,” he continued, “I think there is hesitance to speaking out on that because people have had to walk back things based on investorship and thinks like that. It seems like a less normalized topic than something like gay marriage. … I think Israel in our country has been thought of as the victim because of the Holocaust for so long, it seems illogical that they would become the perpetrator of similar crimes.”A former international soccer player elaborated: “When you say, ‘Why are innocent people being murdered and maimed en masse?’ and the narrative gets flipped, and you are called ‘antisemitic,’ that’s gaslighting. That’s a tactic, it’s a form of deflection back at other people as if they’re the problem.” Similarly, the WNBA player noted that others are “afraid/confused by the antisemetic label.”Backlash and harassment are another significant and associated issue. The Olympian pointed to “the backlash on social media and the constant harassment and inundation and noise that brings with it,” adding that “there is an overarching narrative in the general population that athletes are supposed to be these entertainers and national representatives of all the people of the nation and as such they should really take this approach of ‘shut up and play.’”The basketball player we spoke to highlighted the dangers of “the McCarthyist response from government” and “Zionists gaslighting and doxxing people,” but also drew on personal experiences in college. “I would post as much info on my story as I could, which sometimes led to locker room discussions by teammates who had engaged in pretty good faith. I always knew that there was the chance of higher ups within my college program, coaches, administration, or donors, taking issue with what I had to say. One of the first instances of direct intimidation was when a family member of mine received threats from parents of a player on the team. This instance, amongst others, never discouraged my conviction to speak up. Again, I always felt that any lost opportunity in my career pales in comparison to what Gaza’s people are enduring.”The former international soccer player suggested that this issue is emblematic of systemic problems in sport more broadly: “Most athletes learn early that compliance is rewarded and that truth, or questioning the status quo, is punished. This conditioning does not just preserve order; it protects exploitation. Silencing happens quietly, through the fear of losing sponsorship, selection, or reputation, and through the violence of online attacks. Many fear being branded as something they are not, or accused of causing harm simply for naming it. I know this from decades of witnessing and experiencing these same patterns of behaviour in sport and beyond. The question is not just why athletes are not speaking out; it is what kind of culture and leadership ecosystem we have built, and who we have become within it, when silence feels like our best and only option. And in the end, what do we lose within our humanity in the process?”Former Olympian Dryden notes that this sort of potential backlash can lead to “some of the same fear, apprehension, confusion that many people are struggling with around the history of the region and a worry that they will say the wrong thing and be attacked in the media.” Part of the problem is that “many athletes are young and don’t always have time (or interest) to be educated on complex issues.” The recent NFL player felt similarly, noting that “Although Israel has gone down this road for decades, the conflict feels new to my generation in the US, whereas we are much more aware of other struggles like gay rights.”Then too there is the relative financial precarity of Olympic athletes. This can lead to different perspectives. The still-active Olympian told us that “perhaps political activism is tolerated in Olympic sports because the financial consequences are not as severe for business as they are for the NBA and NFL or whatever.” Dryden, by contrast, herself a former Olympian, felt that for Olympic athletes, “we are living on the financial margins already and live in a state of just feeling grateful for the opportunity...Sadly, this has a tendency to keep us silent and compliant.”The WNBA is a particularly interesting case. Although Natasha Cloud has been among the most outspoken active athletes in the world against the genocide, it is striking how little her colleagues have said on the subject despite their established record of social justice activism.The basketball player we spoke to tried to unpack for us why that might be. “For some reason, the courage to speak onPalestineseems to me like maybe it takes another degree of courage and also awareness,” she told us. “It’s an international issue and I think Americans tend to fail hard in that arena [with the] ‘I don’t know enough’ cop out, plus years of ant-Muslim and xenophobic propaganda, ‘the Middle East is always at war,’ ‘it’s too complicated,’ etc… I think some people maybe just like to think ‘it’s none of our business,’ whereas something like Black Lives Matter is very close to home and people feel empowered to speak on it as a predominantly Black league.”But, there is another dimension as well: direct familiarity with the Israeli context. She explained, “there is a good amount of women’s basketball players who have played in Israel!! I know multiple people playing there right now….[thumbs down emoji]. Which is insane to me but some people really just keep their head down, I guess? Like I know a lottt of W players have played there in their overseas career. So you have that experience and obviously the propaganda they take in, they pay well, etc.”She contrasted this to Natasha Cloud, who, she said, “played a season in Jordan. Which is a country with a good amount of Palestinian refugees. And I know for a fact that played a role in her stance because she said somewhere that her teammates in Jordan taught her about the conflict! Which is amazing.”Part of the frustration of athlete silence for Jesse Joseph is how impactful theycouldbe. He remarked on the success of fans and local runner in pressuring Saucony todrop sponsorshipof the Jerusalem Marathon “which runs through Occupied East Jerusalem” and the Denver Colfax Marathon todrop Chevronas a sponsor on grounds of genocide complicity.“Connecting with and amplifying the organizing of these local athletes and communities would be an incredible way to use the platform that high profile athletes have,” Joseph told us.Still, over two years of genocide, such leadership by athletes has been far more exception than rule.As the former international soccer player put it, “In 2022, when many people were speaking about migrant workers’ rights, Fifa just said that the players had to play, which of course is incorrect. Because it is political, it is about power. When you say ‘stay in your lane and just dribble,’ you’re saying don’t take our power away.”Unfortunately, when it comes to Gaza, too many players have listened.Nathan Kalman-Lamb is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of New Brunswick.

Hart was one of five former Team Canada World Junior players initially charged with sexual assault stemming from an incident in 2018, and, though acquitted earlier this year, remains suspended by the NHL until 1 December. Ina statementabout Hart’s contract signing, the Golden Knights said that the team remains “committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception” and that the team expects “that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward”.Blood, bias and the Battle of Florida: how the NHL’s dirtiest rivalry exposed hockey’s old-boy rotRead moreWhich sounds all well and good, but there’s a difference between expecting someone to meet a standard and maintaining it – or even enforcing it. It’s not surprising that Hart is back on the ice in theNHL. For one thing, he was indeed acquitted, along with the other four accused, which is technically grounds for readmittance, whether one agrees with the ruling or not. For the league, the union, and the teams, the story is – or can be – relatively simple: a player cleared by the courts is ready for a comeback. But the real reason Hart’s return will strike many as unsurprising is because, well, this is just how hockey works. That is, yes, everyone can talk about values and standards and expectations, but in reality hockey is still driven by silence.The 2018 sexual assault scandal was neither an isolated incident nor unprecedented. Shortly after the Team Canada story broke, the Canadian Hockey League and its member major junior leaguespublicizedthe findings of an independent review panel examining its hazing, bullying, harassment, and abuse policies. The paneldeterminedthat the leagues and its teams have “a systemic or ‘culture of embedded behaviours’, where off-ice misconduct is perpetuated, condoned, or ill-addressed” and that a “code of silence” existed when it came to reporting misconduct. As the allegations surrounding the 2018 Team Canada players swirled, it also emerged that Hockey Canada, the country’s national governing body for the sport,had paid out$2.9m in settlements in 2022.And just a year prior, the same code of silence was revealed when former Chicago Blackhawks player Kyle Beachcame forwardas the player at the center of sexual abuse allegations against the team in 2010. Beach alleged that he’d been sexually assaulted by one of the Blackhawks’ then-video coach Brad Aldrich. Afollow-up reportfound that, though Beach informed the team of his allegation, and the information was discussed in a meeting that included the general manager, Stan Bowman, and head coach, Joel Quenneville, nothing happened for three weeks – until after the Blackhawks had won the Cup.View image in fullscreenCarter Hart was acquitted of sexual assault in July.Photograph: Cole Burston/Getty ImagesMuch like with Hart, the men at the center of that scandal went away – but not for long. Afterstepping downfrom his role as general manager in Chicago, Bowmanwas hiredthree years later, in 2024, by the Edmonton Oilers and remains the general manager there. Quenneville isback behind the bench, as of May. He’s the head coach of the Anaheim Ducks. It’s a pattern of redemption without reckoning. As for the moral question, that’s left up to the fans. The NHL and hockey more broadly makes what it might simply call a business decision – even cynically, perhaps, seeing an opportunity for a cut-rate contract – and moves on, leaving its supporters to sort out the ethics of it all, or to do the mental gymnastics of separating the player from the person.The case of the Team Canada players was billed as a reckoning for hockey – finally. In the end, the case itself, and the judge’s ruling, made a clear line of justice difficult to draw. And so, yet again, no reckoning. The so-called watersheds come and go, the turning points lead to the same place. The behavior, the pattern, remains. A scandal, a moment of reflection, then a quiet reabsorbing of those involved back into hockey’s ecosystem. The machinery of hockey, from development to junior to pro, protects itself. The game goes ahead and change, when it happens, feels incidental rather than intentional.Hart was acquitted, that’s true. Legally, he bears no criminal responsibility. He has the right to rebuild his career. But what the courts decide and what a sport chooses to celebrate or reward are not the same thing. Neither is acquittal equal to absolution. Acquittal doesn’t negate the power imbalances that shaped the case. And it doesn’t delete the learned behaviour that makes these situations seemingly so common – the kind that teaches young athletes that consent may be negotiable, or that group loyalty outweighs empathy, or that success is a sanitizer. The accused in this case were found not guilty, that is not up for debate. Still, being legally innocent and being ethically fit for a role are two different things. The court may have had its say, but hockey’s silence, as usual, speaks louder.Explore more on these topicsVegas Golden KnightsNHLIce hockeyUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Nonsense: speech is only free when it is anchored in truthFri 17 Oct 2025 04.10 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 11.24 EDTShareFacts are becoming less sacred by the day in Donald Trump’s US, where many of his supporters now deny the very existence of truths. To them, inconvenient evidence is by definition “bias”. His followers and those who fear his fist are falling into line: media, universities and that infamous regiment of tech zillionaires who stood right behind him on inauguration day. The day after Trump’s election victory was certified by an electoral vote tally in Congress, Meta’sMark Zuckerberg announcedthat, starting with the US, the company would “get rid of factcheckers and replace them with community notes similar to X”.A similar hammer blow has just struckFull Fact, the exceptionally valuable UK factchecker whose word is a gold standard for honesty. Google has pulled its £1m funding. Along with the possible ending of sizeable donations from Meta, the charity tells me this amounts to a loss of a third of its funding.Full Fact’s CEO,Chris Morris, says: “We think Google’s decisions, and those of other big US tech companies, are influenced by the perceived need to please the current US administration, feeding a harmful new narrative that attacks factchecking and all it stands for. Verifiable facts matter and the big internet companies have responsibilities when it comes to curtailing the spread of harmful misinformation.”Morris pioneered the BBC’s reality check, now calledBBC Verify, charting the BBC’s perilous course through the Brexit and pandemic years. As a member of the European governance body of the European Fact-Checking Standards Network, Full Fact has shared its falsehood-finding AI tool with factcheckers in more than 40 countries.The “community notes” system that replaces factchecking atGoogle, Meta and X abandons a notion of objective truth verified by science or evidence. Instead, it crowdsources any comments on a piece of content and the algorithm finds a “consensus”: the Earth could be flat if most people say so.Googlerecentlydropped its ClaimReview, a tagging system that lets search engines, apps and social media platforms find fact checks and display them with the original factual error: Google used to boast it reached billions of users. When I asked why it had gone, a spokesperson directed me to the company’s statement that it is “simplifying search results”, and pointed out that it also continues to offer dedicated tools such as Fact Check Explorer, “for people who specifically want to explore claims that have been reviewed”.The anti-fact ideology was proclaimed in JD Vance’s full-throated assault on Europe in February in Munich, when he warned that European democracy was at risk from the enemy within. (Many might identify a different enemy.) He claimed that Joe Biden’s administration “threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation”.He described “misinformation”as an “ugly Soviet-era word” and suggested anyone using it doesn’t like the idea that “somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion”.Vance seems to think factchecking is censorship. Full Fact responds that it “doesn’t restrict debate: it strengthens it by grounding it in truth”. The checkers never ask to remove or censor content from the internet. In its now at-risk partnership with Meta, it would simply attach a label to a post suggesting that readers might want to see what Full Fact says about it before sharing it further. Among the things Full Fact checks are harmfulfinancial scams, false andmisleading medical informationthat damages people’s health, and online videos that encourage suicidal thoughts among teenagers.The word “misinformation” is now all but banned among any in the US relying on government approval: the US National Science Foundation, for instance,terminated grantsworth many millions it had awarded to researchers studying misinformation. But asFull Fact says, “debating the language risks missing the real issue: our online information environment is under greater threat than ever before.” This dispute is also at the heart of debate on the UK’s Online Safety Act, designed to protect children and others from the worst harms. Nigel Farage pledged to abolish it on his trip to the US Congress last month wherehe said of UK free speech: “At what point did we become North Korea?”A long list of distinguished institutional and charitable funders back Full Fact. It is free to use and, like the Guardian, relies on individual supporters, who relish, as I do, avalanches of daily checks. Here’s a sample: No, the UK hasn’t pledged£40bn to Gaza’s reconstruction. No, James Cleverly didn’t (quite) say about China whatKeir Starmer claimed he didin PMQs. No, policedid not sayimmigrants are eating swans. No,immigration didn’t increase four-foldunder the Tories, but it doubled. There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that London isunder sharia law. A picture of beautiful Epping mums protesting in pink against an asylum hotelis an AI fake(but there were mums there). Itsrolling government trackeris compelling: 59 out of 86 pledges happened or are in progress.In her conference speech, Kemi Badenoch quoted Margaret Thatcherclaiming that “the facts of life are conservative”, a dangerous line of thought when JD Vance seems to believe that facts belong to Trump. The critical value of independent checkers is to hold on to the truth that facts belong to no one. Right here, this is one of the Enlightenment’s frontlines against the gathering storms of unreason.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now the Mavericks’ new phenom, 18-year-old Cooper Flagg, inherits the mantle – whether he wants it or notFri 17 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 04.01 EDTShareEvery time Jack Johnson’s big Black fists smashed into a white fighter’s face, he wasn’t just breaking the bones of his opponents, but the spirit of White America. Blow after blow after blow. Out of this shame, a mythos was born. One after another, white fighters propped up like scarecrows. One after another, collapsing. As cultural critic Gerald Early has argued, Johnson’s fights became less about sport and more about the drama of race in America, with every knockout symbolizing a direct challenge to white supremacy. For the next 100 years, across multiple sports, whites have tried to find the next champion to return them to glory. This myth-making even inspired Howard Sackler’s Pulitzer-winning play The Great White Hope.In basketball, figures like Jerry West and “Pistol” Pete Maravich represented Anglo excellence before the NBA’s full desegregation revealed the overwhelming superiority of African-American players. By the time Larry Bird rose in the 1980s, the Great White Hope narrative had simply been repackaged for a new generation. Bird was a badass hick from Indiana. Bird was a godsend to Boston’s white working class. Bird was Magic’s equal. Bird was the Great White Hope disguised as the Great White Hope denier.From a 1985 Sports Illustrated profile:I don’t want to be seen as the Great White Hope. I just want to be a great basketball player, period.But that was 40 years ago. The MVP-level white players since have all been European (Dirk Nowitzki, Luka Dončić, Nikola Jokić). There hasn’t been an American white All-Star in the NBA since Kevin Love in 2018: a good player, but no superstar.If there were ever a made-for-TV plot for the next Great White Hope to emerge, Sackler couldn’t have imagined a better milieu than the Dallas Mavericks. This is the only franchise that can say its three best all-time players are all white (Steve Nash, Nowitzki, Dončić). With Dončić’s trade to the Lakersstill fresh and raw, Dallas are desperate. The city has been languishing, nursing an open wound. So when luck on thelevel of conspiracy fellin Harrison’s lap,Cooper Flaggbecame part of a myth-cycle that pre-dates him by a millennium.Not since LeBron James in 2003 has a rookie arrived carrying such immense expectations, along with the hopes of a city desperate for deliverance. In Dallas, the 18-year-oldFlagg is walking into a shit show.The Dončić trade was one of the worst ever. When he was traded, the fanbase protested losing him outside the arena for weeks, evendragging a coffinto the steps of American Airlines Center. A dead fandom in a dead box. Harrison should thank his dumb luck, or the scripted simulacrum that landed him Flagg, who ostensibly saved his job.None of this is Flagg’s fault. He’s just a nice kid from Maine who wants to hoop. But the reality is the Mavericks are a massive question mark. Harrison is still the GM, so anything is possible regarding roster construction. Kyrie Irving re-signed with Dallas this summer, but is out for the year with a torn ACL. Anthony Davis is a former superstar who might still have something special left in the tank at 32, but remains the most injury-prone big man in the NBA. The rest of the roster has rangy bigs and defensive-minded wings. Shot-creation will fall primarily on Flagg, who will be the rightful favorite for Rookie of the Year. He also has a chance, with Irving out, to lead the Mavs in scoring and assists. Flagg is more known for his all-around two-way game, especially his voracious defense. But in year one, he will be asked to run the offense.Checking out his full shooting profile reveals the cracks and the promise. From Maine United to Montverde to Duke, the data shows what kind of looks he hunts and what he makes of them. Layups (1.22 points per shot) and free throws (a ridiculous 1.62) are his bread-and-butter. Unguarded catch-and-shoot threes are money at 1.08 points per shot. Then the cracks: pull-up twos at 0.64, floaters at 0.87 sink like stones. This is where defense will force him in year one. As a rookie, he’ll have to live at the rim and on the line. The polished Bird-style pull-up daggers will come later.View image in fullscreenCooper Flagg shakes hands with NBA commissioner Adam Silver after being selected first overall by the Dallas Mavericks in June’s draft.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesUnlike the opponents Johnson put on the floor, Flagg is the real deal. He obliterates the old stereotype of the “crafty but unathletic” white player. His vertical leap is violent and quick, his defense freakishly reactive. He can shoot, handle, defend and playmake. His favorite player? Bird. No shit. He has Bird’s bawdy panache, too, which he will need every ounce of, playing forMavericks owner Miriam Adelson. Her titles include: gambling lobbyist. Trump’s top donor. Architect of legalized vice. Builder of casinos. Propagandist for Israel’s genocide in Gaza. She is all of those things, and she is also the main architect behind legalizing gambling in Texas so that she can sink Dallas into gambling degeneracy. Rookies don’t get to decide where they’re drafted. Flagg has to play for an owner whose politics are toxic. That’s part of the pressure he’ll face just trying to hoop.Dallas have a fanbase accustomed to white superstars. Flagg doesn’t have to fill Dončić’s shoes, but he does have to follow in his footsteps. Dirk was the silent assassin, gentle and approachable. Dončić was a devilish imp, sarcastic and full of South Dallas swag. Both were beloved. Flagg’s handoff is broken before it begins. He’ll have to dominate on the court and establish a presence off it.So far, he’s responded coolly: “I wouldn’t look at anything as pressure. … I’m not worried about living up to certain players’ expectations. … I’m just going to be myself and really try to get better every single day that I can.”But Flagg’s not only walking into racial baggage – he’s entering a national zeitgeist. After the first two decades of the NBA being dominated by American whites, desegregation made clear that Black players were superior in every part of the game. Ironically, Nowitzki became the archetype that helped Europe catch up to America. Dirk was the first European-born MVP, but Jokić has racked up three of his own. Former Mav Nash won back-to-back MVPs in Phoenix. Meanwhile, the US has mostly produced white role players like JJ Redick: shooters, facilitators, table-setters. It’s hard to continue to claim America is the best basketball country when it’s been eight seasons since it produced an MVP.Flagg has the chance to be more than that. He looks like a transcendent talent, a player who could change not just how the game is played but how it’s taught. Post-Dirk, every big shoots threes. Not since Brent “Bones” Barry have we seen a white kid from the suburbsdunk like this. Defensively, Flagg is already built different. His timing and coordination are preternatural: those “dead arm” blocks where he meets the ball midair without flinching. His rim protection already resembles that of a perennial All-Defense candidate before he can legally buy a beer.Similarly, Caitlin Clark’s arrival in the WNBA was a maelstrom of a ratings boom and culture war for a white phenom in a Black-dominated league. Flagg steps into something similar, though the script is older on the men’s side and stitched directly into NBA mythology.It’s foolish fandom to root against anyone because of race. But it happens across all races and sports. Dallas is unique in its history of generational white stars. Flagg will have to block out the noise and focus on ball. He’s done that at every level. The city is wounded, still raw from Dončić’s departure, and there’s healing that must happen. Providing entertainment for the masses will help, but Dallas doesn’t have a mythical Jack Johnson to defeat. There’s no racial redemption arc waiting to be fulfilled. There’s just bad blood and hard truths.Flagg doesn’t exist to redeem whiteness or avenge Jack Johnson’s ghosts. He exists in a league where those myths linger but no longer dictate the game. His story is about possibility. He’s a teenager stepping into a story larger than himself. At worst, Flagg will be a welcome distraction. At best, he could write the next chapter in basketball’s complicated history of expectations.Explore more on these topicsCooper FlaggDallas MavericksNBABasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Uncertain and anxious about the future?Older cultures have left behind maps and guides for living in uncertain times, whether it be through texts, philosophies, religions or letters.Ancient civilisations didn’t have to deal with emergentAIor the scale of the climate crisis or the internet, but so much wisdom they left behind can be adapted for whatever comes our way. It is as Roman emperor and practising Stoic Marcus Aurelius said: “Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future too.”Big Tech deploys Orwellian doublespeak to mask its democratic corrosion | Peter LewisRead moreI relied on the ancient philosophy of Stoicism to get through lockdowns and the pandemic – particularly in the early days before vaccines. And post-2020, in our current hellscape, I have found that the framework provided by Stoicism is more important than ever.In my new book The Seeker and the Sage, a troubled journalist is given an assignment to interview a mayor in a community run according to Stoic principles. Over three days she grills him on how Stoicism can help us deal with the problems of 2025.As the journalist discovers, the maps drawn in the past can help us navigate the present and the future.How to deal with threats and uncertainty from AIAurelius advised to know reality, to not shirk from it. “The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.” In today’s era this means being real about the threats from emerging technology and having a plan B, if and when your work becomes obsolete. (The same goes for government – as well as being prepared to regulate, they also need to have an alternative with regard to universal basic income or some other form of income support, should AI create mass unemployment.)But it’s not just preparing for a future where our work is eroded and mechanised – it’s also deciding for ourselves how much decision making we want to retain.For Stoics, one of the most important aspects of being human is our ability to think rationally and the capacity to develop wisdom.We must guard, protect and strengthen our critical thinking and not give it up easily just because we can’t be bothered constructing an essay, an email, a birthday party speech, eulogy or a condolence card.If we feel things sliding into madness, the best thing we can do, the thing in our control, is to be different and to be betterBy exercising rational thinking, and thinking for ourselves, we are able to judge and make choices in a way that best serves our own interests and those of others.Handing over our critical thinking to a machine is to also hand over one of the few things that is within our control –the ability to think for ourselves.How to handle political conflict“We are bad men living among bad men and only one thing will calm us – we must agree to go easy on one another,” wrote Seneca thousands of years ago.Basically, we are screwed unless we find a way to coexist with each other. When social cohesion frays, when the left no longer speaks to the right and vice versa, there cannot be a healthy dialogue about how to govern society in the best interests of everybody.Stoicism developed in times of unrest and upheaval – and those that lived through those times saw that no gains could be made for society as a whole, if people were engaged in never-ending conflict.This also includes the conflicts in our own heads. The Stoics devoted time and energy to establishing a baseline of calm in their own lives, to minimise reactivity and anger. They knew better decisions could be made if they did not come from a place of anxiety, anger and hate.Economic insecurityTo count on continuing economic and material prosperity and not prepare for poverty is unwise, according to the ancient Stoics.In a world where techlords rule us by whim, Australia’s stance against deepfakes is reason to celebrate | Van BadhamRead moreSeneca – once one of the richest men of his time – practised fasting and intentional discomfort as a means of habituating himself to material loss.Seneca writes that one should “set apart certain days on which you shall withdraw from your business and make yourself at home with the scantiest fare”. The goal is to “establish business relations with poverty,” so you do not suffer twice when you lose all your money and possessions.The first suffering is the loss of money, but the second suffering is being unable to endure the loss. The latter we can prepare for.Financial collapse on a global scale or on a personal level through job loss, bad investments or scams should be viewed not as a hypothetical situation but as something that is likely to happen to you in your lifetime. Rather than feeling anxious about this, you should use the good times to prepare for poverty.LeadershipIf we feel things sliding into madness (at whatever level we are operating at – or even what we see on the news), the best thing we can do, the thing in our control, is to be different and to be better.Stoicism elevated four virtues above all others: courage, wisdom, temperance and justice. Stoics believe that there are not many things in our direct control – but we can control our own characters.And all of us, no matter what our circumstances, have the ability to be more wise, more just, more courageous and more moderate (or temperate).Modelling these virtues through our own behaviour is contagious. We cannot control other people, but we can be the type of person we want to see in the world.A world run by people of poor character is in many ways a reflection of the collective. But we can change the collective by changing and improving our characters, and valuing a good character in others.“Don’t explain your philosophy.

The vexed and long-running saga over who owns theTelegraph Media Group, which last week landed back on the desk of the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, may leave Guardian readers cold, but it goes to the heart of the transparency and independence of the media industry.The US private equity group RedBird Capital, whichfinally submitteddetails of its £500m takeover plans to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport last week, two years after emerging as a potential buyer, is a key part of an increasingly globalised and opaque media business. Its bid connects the 170-year-old newspaper of retired British colonels to the tech billionaires of the west coast with some of the most storied news organisations in the US.By publicly backing the notion of creating the “New York Times of the right”, RedBird’s founder, Gerry Cardinale, has also sought to place the Telegraph at the forefront of efforts to shift the mainstream media narrative from an supposedly overly liberal viewpoint towards the right. Secrecy and political influence has long been a factor in media ownership – but, unlike theprevious ownersof the Telegraph, the RedBird consortium appears to have the money to change all of our lives, not just its own.Nandy inherited this mess from the last Conservative government. RedBird’s original bid as the standalone entity RedBird IMI caused a political firestorm: 75% of this was paid for by International Media Investments (IMI), a companyowned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City and a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, caused a political firestorm. The Gulf state’s terrible track record on press freedom made its land grab for the erstwhile house bible of the Conservative party embarrassing for the then government.So it would be understandable if Nandy, closely watched by Downing Street overseers keen to avoid any more rejections of a cash-rich Gulf state, simply wanted to move on without further public interest regulatory reviews. But this would be a terrible mistake. Both for reasons of editorial independence and control, Nandy should call for a further, immediate, regulatory review into this deal. And if it does pass muster, RedBird should commit to maintaining editorial independence, perhaps with its own board. The previous history of such boards suggests such commitments do not always guarantee independence from proprietorial interference, but they’re a start.View image in fullscreenSheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan with Donald Trump in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 13 October 2025.Photograph: Yoan Valat/ReutersQuestions remain about how the new Telegraph ownership will work. With IMI forced to limit its stake in the Telegraphto 15%under the new foreign state interference regime, RedBird will become what it calls “the sole controlling owner”. Cardinale has not used the word “proprietor” to describe his fund’s debt-backed stake, but then who is? Other minority investors include the billionaireLeonard Blavatnik and the Daily Mail group, with about 10% each.Some of these questions were raised in a letter to Nandy by across-party groupof parliamentarians this summer. They have so far gone unanswered.RedBird has far bigger fish to fry. It knows all about outcries over editorial influence, even if one step removed. It is the second largest investor in this summer’s blockbuster deal – the new $8bn (£6bn) media powerhouseParamount-Skydance, which brought together the Hollywood film studios and storied US news channel CBS.Paramount, led by David Ellison (the son of the Oracle founder and Trump superfan, Larry) and backed by RedBird, has caused outrage for taking over CBS News and installingBari Weiss, a woman who famously left the New York Times for oppressing her, as its head. The group alsowants to buy Warner Bros, which will add CNN to its list of possessions.CBS and the Telegraph are very different media beasts. If CBS is known as the “Tiffany network” because of its perceived quality, the once-great Telegraph, starved of funding and support first by heavily indebted owners and then an ongoing ownership limbo, is in danger of becoming the Ratners of broadsheet titles.Cardinale made encouraging noises about the future of the title earlier this year when he first mooted the idea of the “New York Times of the right”, a paper in which Pulitzer prize-winning news coverage sits alongside wildly popular recipe and games apps.Trump’s anti-truth crusade is not just an attack on facts – it’s an unravelling of the Enlightenment | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe media analyst Alice Enders told me this slogan had the “credibility of a peanut”. Yet Cardinale made good on this promise in part last week when he appointed an award-winning, 27-year veteran of the Financial Times, Matthew Garrahan, asoperating partner at RedBird, responsible for “news and entertainment”. Garrahan’s arrival suggests a renewed focus on trusted journalism for a paper that needs a new strategy, with an old and dying readership and little loyalty among digital subscribers if churn rates are to be believed.While the talk may be big, huge investment would go against the known behaviour of private equity groups. The fear is that RedBird follows other media owners, from Richard Desmond to Reach, andslashes cost and journalismin order to improve profits.It is unlikely that the UK government will care much about the future of the Telegraph. There is precedence for Labour governments treating the paper as an internecine struggle for the other side. The Blair administration allowed the Barclay brothers to buy the newspaper group without a fullpublic interest investigationin 2004.The world is different now.Newspapersbought for influence, and ideological and financial ends are as old as print. But at a time of existential crisis from disinformation and bot-produced nonsense, independent, ethical journalism matters more than ever, and full transparency is the best place to start.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group. She writes in a personal capacityThis article was amended on 17 October 2025 because an earlier version suggested that IMI is a backer of RedBird Capital’s funds, which it is not.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a ridiculous question, obviously; a loaded assumption that women spent years clambering out from under. Mothers have worked long and hard to dispel the myth that anyone should be able to single-handedly juggle a job, children, a happy relationship and a meaningful life without ever breaking sweat or (more pertinently) needing help.And to some extent we have succeeded, judging by a survey of 5,000 UK fathers published this week by the charity Working Families which foundthree-quarters now saythey genuinely want to share the parenting load equally with their partners. Except, it seems, the outside world has yet to catch up.One in five men said they had been asked, when requesting time off work for family reasons, where their wife or partner was. Translation: isn’t thatherjob? And perhaps, sotto voce: if in your house it’s not her job, what kind of man does that make you? Most of the other hurdles men reported – such as being challenged on whether the family crisis was really so urgent, or worrying that their boss would think less of them for asking – will be wearily familiar to most working mothers. But I’ve never been asked why I can’t just get my husband to do it all, in a way that implies there must be something wrong with me if not.Working fathers’ battles are both the same and also subtly different from those of working mothers, and therein lies the faint air of suspicion lingering between two camps essentially fighting the same war. (The lazy assumption that mothers are the default parents, the ones who just have to down tools if a child is sick or the school calls, is toxic for both sexes because it undermines women’s careers and also men’s attempts to be good fathers.) Yet it can be hard to see the similarities at work when you’re fighting each other at home, locked in competition over who is most exhausted, or whose turn it is to trudge off to soft play. Where were you when we were doing the hard yards?, women think grimly to themselves, when they hear a certain kind of man talking loudly about how he prides himself on being really present for the kids. Ohnowmen are interested in flexible working: now the pandemic has completely normalised working rather agreeably from home, and it’s just a matter of actually using the legal rights that women once fought like tigers for? When some of the new intake of male Labour MPs started campaigning vigorously for better paid paternity leave and being upfront about taking it themselves, they didn’t always endear themselves to female colleagues who’d been on those barricades for years, though fathers stepping up was always the last piece of the equality jigsaw.But someone has to show men it can be done. The lesson from the introduction of shared parental leave – which means couples can in theory split up to 50 weeks of leave between them in their child’s first year – is that many fathers don’t feel comfortable taking up new rights they’re given because they still feel pressure to be the main breadwinner. The government has already pledged a review of parental leave more broadly, and this summer the cross-party Commons equalities committeeargued in a reportthat more generously paid paternity leave should be a priority (currently many men are stuck with the statutory minimum, frozen in time at less than half the national living wage). But even that won’t be a gamechanger unless men feel they can take it without being punished.One solution offered at this week’s Equal Parenting conference in London, where the Working Families research was discussed, was a campaign for men to “parent out loud” by taking their full whack of leave and openly putting nursery pickups in their office calendars, instead of pretending to be leaving early for some mysteriously important meeting. If nothing else, that might open a conversation about the stresses some men appear to be bottling up.For the dads are not, it seems, necessarily all right. An in-depth survey of British men’s attitudes to masculinitypublished this weekby YouGov paints a heartening picture in many ways, noting that – contrary to popular belief – young men are not all angry misogynists radicalised online. (Only 13% of Gen Z now holds a positive view of notorious influencer Andrew Tate, though arguably that’s 13% too many.) But it suggests a surprising streak of bitterness in millennial men, the group now well into their 30s and 40s who are most likely to be in the knackered toddler-wrangling years. They’re the age group now most liable to say that women have it easier in society than men, or that women’s gains in recent decades have been at men’s expense. Though these are still minority views, embraced by less than a quarter of millennials, YouGov finds a widespread belief across generations that life was better for men 25 years ago.Perhaps these are just the voices of the romantically left behind, scarred by years of dating-app rejection. (Millennials were also the age group most likely to say that women are only interested in high-status men.) But could at least some of them be men caught between partners furious that they’re not pulling their weight – which frankly some still aren’t, judging by statistics showing men stillspend only two-thirds of the timewomen spend on unpaid childcare – and the fear of professional failure?The Working Families survey certainly suggests many young fathers feel torn, to an extent their own fathers may not have been. They worry about missing milestones in their children’s lives, but also about being a burden to their colleagues if they take time off. A third hadn’t taken as much paternity leave as they would have liked, and almost two-thirds regularly felt judged at work for putting family commitments first. Almost eight in 10 thought the resulting tensions were putting strain on either them, their partner or their child’s welfare.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our writer found some he may hate even more – and others pivotal to his riseHannah Jane ParkinsonFri 17 Oct 2025 12.24 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 12.37 EDTShareIn a turn of events that may surprise some, Donald Trump expressed a few relatable insecurities this week. First he questioned the attractiveness of his beach body, then he blasted Time magazinefor an unflattering cover photo. In fairness, he wasn’t wrong. He called the picture, taken from below, “the worst of all time”. People have focused on the wattle neck, the gossamer hair, the inside of his nostrils.‘The worst of all time’: Trump rails against ‘super bad’ Time magazine coverRead moreThe question he asked of the editorial decision was actually a pertinent one. “What are they doing, and why?” This is the kind of scrutiny that the press should attract, except that media literacy is dying a fast death – and that has a lot to do with Trump himself. Constantly lambasting Pulitzer prize-winning publications as “fake news” and then retweeting Photoshopped images and deep fakes isn’t helping the situation.Here are some past memorable Trump covers – some of which he admired, and others which, in no uncertain terms, he did not.Time, 2024View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Evan Vucci/TimeThis is no doubt a cover much more to the President’s liking. Love him or despise him, it’s undeniable that standing up mere secondsafter a bullet grazes the side of one’s headand yelling “Fight, fight, fight!” is a brave move. Crazy maybe, but brave. The photo of that moment, shot by Evan Vucci, will go down as one of the most significant images in political history.Time and Trump have a turbulent relationship. He famously mocked up covers of himself to hang at four of his golf clubs, which resulted in themagazinewriting to the President to ask him to remove them (and a pilloryingcartoon from The New Yorker). The magazine has issued a number of memorable covers of Trump, including an illustration ofstormyconditions in the Oval Office, and one of his golf cart stuck in a bunker.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: TimeOne of his more recent Time covers was when he was named Person of the Year – a title Trump hasreceived twice. (Although he once claimed he had turned it down, Time magazine denied it in a statement.) Before Trump entered the White House for the first time, he hadonly featured on the cover of the magazine once, in 1989. But in 2017 hefalsely claimedto have been on the cover more times than anybody else. In fact Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan at that time surpassed him.On the second occasion he received his Person of the Year designation, Trumpsaid: “Well, thank you very much. This is an honor, a tremendous honor.” (Up for debate, when previous recipients include Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.) He was pleased too with one Time cover,brandishing it at a rally in Des Moines. “They used to call it the ‘Man of the Year,’ but they can’t do that anymore. They call it ‘Person of the Year.’ It’s the same thing. That’s fine. But look at that – that’s a good-looking cover.”Esquire, 2004View image in fullscreenPhotograph: EsquireWhile Trump may not have featured on the Time cover very much pre-politics, he did feature on many others as New York’s brash, publicity-seeking business mogul and Manhattan social scene fixture. Trump is obsessed with gold. He loves bling. It makes sense then that Esquire would kit him out in medallions and rings galore. Also shout out to the accompanying cover lines of: “Wild tales of strippers! Streakers! Tsunamis! Leopard Attacks!” Talk about something for everybody. And note the other feature: “The Case for Bush”. This is not, in fact, an editorial on pubic hair,but about George W.Oh, and the strap for the Trump story?“How I’d Run the Country (Better)”. Indeed, Trump’s first mention of his wish to achieve the highest office was circa 1987. Turns out we should have taken him bothseriously and literally.C 41, 2016View image in fullscreenDonald trump on cover of C 41 MagazinePhotograph: C 41 MagazineAn extremely innovative cover from theMilan-based magazinededicated to all things design and style. Layering the cover with a Trompe-l’œil style technique (pun possibly intended), the magazine’s gallery arm put on anexhibitionentitled American Change, in which this cover, created by Japanese artist Kensuke Koike, features. A copy of the magazine was also included in the London Design Museum’sHope to Nopeshow.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Washington PostThere are other similarly themed covers; Trump’s mouth is rather a subject of fascination. Note that impressionists will first attempt to nail his voice; then the second thing is the puckering of the mouth. Recently, the queen of the Netherlands wascaught mocking Trump’s lip movements– a bold move given he was standing right next to her. Some might liken the general aesthetic of this particular maw to a cat’s bum, but that wouldn’t be me. What is good about this cover is it is a departure from the usual way cover designers depict Trump’s mouth – which is black text across his philtrum to resemble a Hitler moustache. It’s been done, guys. Many, many times.Vanity Fair, 2024View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Vanity FairIn the past few years outlets have taken to producing digital covers for online readers. This was a striking one in 2024 from Vanity Fair, not just for the pore-intense close-up, but the directly presented set of numbers down the lefthand side. Can’t really complain when the facts add up. The cover wentviral on its release, with millions of likes and views on X alone.Trump has a history of beef with Vanity Fair. In particular with its former editor, Graydon Carter, who once referred to Trump as“a short-fingered vulgarian”. In turn, Trump has called Carter “a real loser”. Trump has often dissed the magazine on social media, and in 2016tweeted: “Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!” He was right about the last part – but Carterstepped down in 2017, staying on longer than intended to cover the beginning of Trump’s administration.Internazionale, 2017View image in fullscreenPhotograph: InternazionaleThe matryoshka doll design isn’t super original, but this is very well executed from the progressive weekly Internazionale, which translates long-form articles from around the world into Italian. Theimplicationof the cover is clear, and the detail is such that one doesn’t need the fully exposed face of Putin to recognise him. We can spot those thin lips and filler-enhanced cheeks anywhere.Bloomberg Businessweek, 2016View image in fullscreenPhotograph: BloombergPerhaps the most unsettling of the bunch, courtesy of a 2016 Chinese edition of Bloomberg Businessweek. Trump likes to assert his reputation as a great businessman, which is questionable given hismultiple bankruptcy filings. Nevertheless, he iscurrently receiving praisefor his brokering of the Gaza ceasefire. (Maybe he listened to the audiobook of The Art of the Deal to brush up on his skills.)The cover line translates to: “Donald Trump is a modern political Steve Jobs, turning his US presidential campaign into a one-man show.” This would have pleased Trump no end, as he seemed to have something of a crush on Jobs,tweeting many times about himin glowing terms. Except for when he declared: “I’ve always been a fan of Steve Jobs … but the yacht he built is truly ugly.”Trump, however, is very much not a fan of Steve Jobs’ widow, who holds shares in The Atlantic, opining that the late Apple designer would “not be happy” about Laurene Powell Jobs “wasting money” on the publication. (Powell Jobs alsodonated $930,000to the 2020 Biden campaign.)Playboy, 1990View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PlayboyTrump is back in his playboy era here – literally. We know Trump is keen on this cover because he waspicturedholding and signing the magazine not too long ago. (A signed copy isavailable on eBayfor $4,000.) The truth is he does look good here. The suit is a much better fit than theone he wore to Buckingham Palacein 2019 – although true confirmation can only come fromMenswear Guy.In the cover interview, whichyou can read here, Trump appears to rule out a future run for the presidency – despite the topic being raised precisely because of his previous musings. Speaking about himself in the third person, he told the outlet: “The presidency? No, that takes an election, and it is clear that Trump is not that patient.”Trump will probably not be too happy to hear that Hugh Hefner’s son has said that his father “regretted” the cover.Speaking to The Hollywood Reporterin 2017, Cooper Hefner said: “We don’t respect the guy. There’s a personal embarrassment because Trump is somebody who has been on our cover.”New York, 1992View image in fullscreenPhotograph: New YorkThe funniest thing about this cover is that the tie makes Trump look for all the world like he goes to an underperforming British comprehensive school. The tie is screaming Geography second period. And the stance? Organised fight behind the maths block at the end of last bell. The reason Trump has to “scramble off the canvas” to quote the subhead, is that in the late 80s Trump seemed down and out. As Politico hasdescribed it, the businessman “lost his mind” and “sowed the seeds of his near-ruin” with catastrophic financial choices. But if there’s one thing Trump has proved, it’s that he has staying power. He is the human embodiment ofChumbawamba’s biggest (only) hit.New York, 2015Photograph: New YorkIs there a headline that has aged worse than “Donald Trump Is Saving Our Democracy”? Probably not, what with him trying toorganise a coup against the elected government.Trump’s hair is one of the most recognisable things about him, so this cover, digitally manipulated so he’s wearing wear a coiffed wig in emulation of George Washington, is quite the deviation. And while the reference to the founding father is obvious, the look does slightly veer towards nan’s perm.The above two examples aren’t the only New York editions featuring striking covers of Trump. The “Loser” strap line is one, for which the magazine issued anonline explanation. And there’sthis one, which aged about as well as the Washington one.Libération, 2016View image in fullscreenPhotograph: LibérationThere’s nothing equivocal here. The left-leaning Libération melds what some might consider two of New York’s most famous villains, with Trump channelling Patrick Bateman. There’s also a touch ofThe Godfather. The French periodical is not the only publication to have referred to Trump on its cover as the Bret Easton Ellis character, with the New Statesmandoing the same.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Der SpiegelIn terms of unsparing assessment, a competitor could be Die Welt’s no-nonsense strap line “Das Ende Der Welt” on a 2016 cover, which I feel even non-German speakers can take a stab at understanding. That was a great cover, featuring Trump as a roaring streak of anger in comet-form on track to consume the earth. Illustrated by Edel Rodriguez,it won a top prizeat the Art Directors Club Germany awards. The magazine and Rodriguez followed up with amuch more controversial and perhaps ill-judged coverof the President decapitating the State of Liberty.The Economist, 2018View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The EconomistOne for the pop culture aficionados. In 2013 Miley Cyrus’s certified banger Wrecking Ball (taken from the accurately titled album Bangerz) was riding high in the charts – and she was riding a giant wrecking ball in themusic video. Memes abounded at the time, but five years on the Economist took inspiration and came out swinging with this cover. I’m not sure Trump suits the cherry Doc Martens that Cyrus wore in the video, but props to the illustrator Ben Kirchner for including them. And it is not impossible he does own the real thing – the singerauctioned the boots off for charity. The accompanying cover story you canread here.The New Yorker, 2016View image in fullscreenIllustration: Barry Blitt/The New YorkerThe symbol for the Democrats is a donkey and for the Republicans an elephant. The former has an association with Andrew Jackson (opponents called him a“jackass”), and the latter with Abraham Lincoln (“seeing the elephant” was aterm used by soldiersduring the Civil War). It’s a clever cover from The New Yorker to depict how Trump cleaved apartthe old school GOP. It’s safe to say the Never Trump movement has failed abysmally – and now there are masked mendragging people off the streetand it’s horrifying. But don’t forget: with the circus trick, the subject of the sawing is a volunteer.The cover was illustrated by the New Yorker’s own Barry Blitt and given the title “Grand Illusion”.Blitt saidit was the fourth time in less than a year he had drawn the President. There is a gallery of Blitt’s previous Trump covershere.Explore more on these topicsDesignTime magazineDonald TrumpConsumer magazinesMagazinesNewspapers & magazinesUS press and publishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It uses the simplest of plot devices – simplicity is hard – a letter that was never delivered 50 years ago. I bet lots of romcom stars on this list are glowing and shiny and young, but step back kids to watch Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi give a masterclass. Most romcoms are short, sharp bursts, as if happiness can’t last and we need to hit the end credits before the arguments start. But Last Tango has already run for five seasons, with incredible invention putting that central love story to the test. It’s even possible to imagine that Anne Reid’s Celia would be voting Reform now, and that’s a season I’d love to see. My favourite scene has to be the end of the very first episode, where the two lovers meet and ignite almost immediately, with both their daughters hot on their heels – two women destined to become endless enemies. Look at the amount of story in that!And who says it’s over? More please, Sally.Russell T Davies, creator of Queer As Folk and It’s a SinFeel GoodView image in fullscreenGiddy … Mae Martin and Charlotte Ritchie in Feel Good.Photograph: Channel 4There is plenty of both rom and com inFeel Good, though the title offers a promise of cheer that it has no intention of delivering, at least in any conventional form. Mae Martin plays a comedian called Mae Martin, who gets together with George (Charlotte Ritchie), AKA “Dangerous Mary Poppins”, who has previously only dated men. The giddiness of the falling-in-love part is done briskly, mostly via montage. What follows is a funny, tender and sensitive look at obsession, trauma and the hard work that goes into a long-term partnership, when the bright flash of falling hard for someone has subsided. Its two seasons are warmly human, bittersweet and quite lovely.Rebecca Nicholson, TV criticHim & HerView image in fullscreenNailing it … Sarah Solemani as Becky and Russell Tovey as Steve in Him & Her.Photograph: Guy Levy/Big TalkStefan Golaszewski’sHim & Heris a love story set in a bedsit inhabited by Steve and Becky (Russell Tovey and Sarah Solemani), who are both drowning and stewing in their own domesticity. It features two of the funniest and warmest performances in comedy history, Russell nailing many moments of physical comedy in a subdued setting, making us root for him in every scene, while Sarah’s subtle yet hilarious glances toward her desperately trying boyfriend make it one of the most authentic romcoms ever. The show gradually sprawls outward into the lives of horrendous bridezilla sister Laura, her sweet victim Shelly, closeted-himbo Paul and the cringe-inducing tagalong Dan, and constantly proves that a really good comedy only needs one little shithole flat and perfectly drawn characters trying to see past each others’ flaws.Jack Rooke, creator of Big BoysLovesickView image in fullscreenTotal recall … Antonia Thomas as Evie and Johnny Flynn as Dylan in Lovesick.Photograph: Brian SweeneyLovesickhad the rockiest of births – it was canned by Channel 4 after a single season, perhaps because it aired under the legitimately disastrous titleScrotal Recall– only to flourish on Netflix as one of the smartest, sweetest comedies of the last decade. When Johnny Flynn’s Dylan is diagnosed with chlamydia, he’s forced to contact everyone he has ever slept with, offering him a chance to re-examine old relationships and grow as a person. All of this edges him closer to Evie (Antonia Thomas), the old university friend with whom he’s secretly in love. Cleverly structured, perfectly executed and sincere in its emotions, Lovesick deserves its place in the pantheon.Stuart Heritage, Guardian writerInsecureView image in fullscreenDeliciously funny … Issa Rae and Jay Ellis in Insecure.Photograph: Raymond Liu/Warner MediaIssa Rae’sInsecureis easily my favourite romcom of all time. Not only was it great, not only was it hella Black, it was deliciously funny and compelling. As a millennial, Insecure was one of the first shows that felt completely relatable as someone trying to navigate adulthood, friendships and love. I loved how honest and flawed every character was, yet you rooted for everyone. This led to the most juicy storylines and plot twists. It’s no secret that this series was a major inspiration for my seriesDreaming Whilst Black.Adjani Salmon, creator of Dreaming Whilst BlackCatastropheView image in fullscreenRings absolutely true … Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney.Photograph: Channel 4When Rob finds out that Sharon is pregnant after their week-long transatlantic fling, he unforgettably declares: “A terrible thing has happened. Let’s make the most of it!” Over its four seasons, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney’sCatastrophetries to do just that – and ends up with them married with two kids and pregnant with a third. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill first love romcom; it’s a brutal, truthful depiction of the endless endurance test that is parenting young kids while trying to carve out a happy-enough existence with a partner. It deals with the big ​stuff life throws at you increasingly as middle age marches on – addiction, strokes, ​death, affairs – ​but, God, it has beautiful moments in between all the hilarious barbs. Sharon and Rob’s last act – jumping in for a spontaneous dip while their kids nap in the car despite the “danger: rip currents” sign on the beach – seemed more tragic than romantic (are they floating through life together or drifting to certain death?) but it did ring absolutely true. It also gave us one of the greatest TV endings ever.Kate Abbott, Guardian TV editorNobody Wants ThisView image in fullscreenDelightful … Kristen Bell and Adam Brody in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixIt’s often said romcoms stand or fall on the charm of the leads, and Kristen Bell as sex-dating podcaster Joanne and Adam Brody as “Hot Rabbi” Noah are a casting coup for the millennial audience. They share an easy chemistry, one of the most perfect first onscreen kisses in memory and, while Noah isn’t completely unproblematic (wasn’t the offhand treatment of his ex a little brutal?), it’s a genuine relief to crush on a male love interest who isn’t dark or twisted – but justquite delightful. Did I mention his beard?Mhairi McFarlane, author of romantic comedy novel Cover StorySex and the CityView image in fullscreenRevolutionary … Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City.Photograph: HBOSex and the Citywas the blueprint for everything that has come since, but I wonder if we’ve collectively forgotten how revolutionary it was back then. Based on Candace Bushnell’s New York Observer column (and later book), her trials of dating in New York were given heart and structure by gay men (Darren Star and Michael Patrick King). After a decade of sexual puritanism necessitated by the Aids crisis, Star and King were able to put uninhibited sex back on the agenda through the lens of metropolitan singletons Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte. They have become the archetypes; they are iconoclasts. One was romantic, searching for her Big romance; another was career driven; Samantha was a sexual conquistador; and Charlotte was bound by old-fashioned dating rules. Much of what has followed owes a great debt to SATC. No longer is a woman defined by the man she ends up with; she’s defined as the woman she had to become in readiness for meaningful love. Though let us never speak ofAnd Just Like That.Juno Dawson, author and creator of Sex and the City podcastSo I Got to ThinkingStarstruckView image in fullscreenA gift to single people … Rose Matafeo and Nikesh Patel in Starstruck.Photograph: Album/AlamyRose Matafeo’sStarstruckwas a gift to single people deprived of sex and intimacy when it first aired as we came out of lockdown. Not only was it a very funny nod to the romcoms we grew up on: a will-they won’t-they with cinema worker Jessie (Matafeo) and movie star Tom (Nikesh Patel). But it made the potential to date and fall in love feel tangible again – along with all the awkward, painful and thrilling moments. Take the glorious scene where Jessie leaves a one-night stand on a barge and is so ecstatic that she dances to Return of the Mack in the sun along Regent’s Canal in London (there is something extra-romantic about a love story playing out in the city you live in). The most wonderful moment, though, is when Jessie purposely misses her bus stop at the end of series one, because she wants to stay with Tom and give it a go. They nervously stare out of the window, smiling – then turn towards each other and launch into a massive snog. A real joy for all of us who know, oh so well, that tummy-flipping feeling of desperately not wanting a bus to come at all after a great first date.Hollie Richardson, Guardian assistant TV editorQueer As FolkView image in fullscreenGroundbreaking … Craig Kelly and Aidan Gillen in Queer As Folk.Photograph: Channel 4It’s not strictly a romcom. But it is funny. And romantic. And sexy. And sex positive (take that now mythic rimming scene between Charlie Hunnam and Aidan Gillen in episode one). In an era when, before it aired, MPs were debating cancelling EastEnders because it showed two men kissing,Queer As Folkmade being gay seem cool. Glamorous even. Which was groundbreaking even when I watched it as a teenager in the 2000s on a DVD box set bought at our local Oxfam.Alex Lawther, star of Alien: Earth and Leonard and Hungry PaulThe Office (US)View image in fullscreenSo special … John Krasinski as Jim and Jenna Fischer as Pam in The Office (US).Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIt’s not a traditional romcom, but there are a couple of romances in the US version ofThe Officethat I love. Jim and Pam are so clearly in love with each other, and watching it you want it to happen so much – because their relationship is just so normal, but also so special. There’s also Michael and Holly. It’s not a traditional romance. He’s so pathetic and needy, and sometimes his behaviour is so worm-like, until he meets Holly, who is basically the female version of him. She’s silly and dorky, but also really sweet and completely in love with him, despite who he is. Suddenly Michael relaxes as a person, he just has this peace, and I think that’s really beautiful. It is so pure and wholesome. Watching it, you’re just overcome with absolute joy.Harriet Kemsley, co-host of Single Ladies in Your Area podcastEver Decreasing CirclesView image in fullscreenLove as it really feels … Richard Briers as Martin Bryce, Peter Egan as Paul Ryman and Penelope Wilton as Anne Bryce EverDecreasing Circles.Photograph: BBCDig beneath the 1970ness of it and you’ll find the first attempt in sitcom to reflect love as it really is, as it really feels, without the trinkets and the fakery or the emotional bleach of gags. Penelope Wilton stands at the centre of it, giving a performance of profound truth. She transforms the flat, bloodless sitcom wife role into a nuanced portrait of love, frustration and endurance.Stefan Golaszewski, creator of Him & Her, Mum and MarriageSpacedExquisite … Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes in Spaced.Spacedis mainly remembered for splicing the sitcom form with nerdy pop culture parody and bottling gen X social mores in the process. Really, it’s a heartstoppingly romantic comedy. We kick off with a meet-cute in a greasy spoon: Jessica Hynes’s wannabe journalist Daisy is flat-hunting via a copy of Loot (the year is 1999) and starts chatting toSimon Pegg’s wannabe comic book artist Tim. Yet the pair’s instant soulmate energy is quickly sublimated into comic shenanigans when they pose as a couple to secure a dream rental. It takes a maddeningly long time for life to imitate the lie. Luckily, the interim is stuffed with ingenious jokes and giddying stylistic invention. And we get to hang out with Daisy, perhaps the most recognisably human female protagonist in romcom history (and definitely the funniest and most likable). The whole thing ends with exquisite understatement: a 45-degree head tilt and one of the greatest needle drops ever. It’s more than worth the wait.Rachel Aroesti, Guardian TV writerTryingView image in fullscreenHappily ever after … Esther Smith and Rafe Spall in Trying.Photograph: Colin Hutton/Apple TVIf anyTryingfans don’t know, they won’t be surprised at all to learn that Rafe Spall and Esther Smith became a couple while filming Andy Wolton’s gorgeous Richard Curtis-ish comedy. They are Jason and Nikki, who cannot have kids, wish to adopt, and have eccentric friends and family. All that’s fine … but the magic is in the chemistry between the two leads, which is right in that golden zone between enviable and relatable. She’s a worrier and he’s a joker, but she’s emotionally braver; he seems to calm her nervous excesses but probably needs his partner’s reassurance more. They interlock so neatly and so sweetly.Jack Seale, Guardian TV writerBlueyView image in fullscreenSurely the greatest tale of canine love … Chilli and Bandit in Bluey.Sure,Blueyis most frequently seen as a kids show, given that it’s: a) a cartoon b) a cartoon about dogs and c) definitely a kids show. But, like all great TV for children, inside lurks something that only parents can appreciate: a heartwarming spot of romance. Behind the wildly creative tales of childhood development lies the love of Chilli and Bandit. We see them bicker, make up and express a level of patience for each others’ foibles that is borderline superhuman – despite having to deal with two high-energy kids. One entire episode is based on Bandit trying to give Chilli some alone time, another around how lifelong love looks past a partner’s grosser habits to keep passion burning – or, as the show poignantly puts it, want to “smoochy kiss”. They’re kind, considerate, tender and so in love that they’ll sideswipe you with a touching expression of desire while role-playing robots – all the classic romantic tropes. Frankly, if it weren’t so damn aspirational, it would be annoying. Surely the greatest tale of romance ever conducted between blue and orange canine.Alexi Duggins, Guardian deputy TV editorEmily in ParisView image in fullscreenKeep believing … Lily Collins as Emily and Lucas Bravo as Gabriel in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Stephanie Branchu/NetflixYou might considerEmily in Parisas merely an annoying Netflix series in which an American speaks too much English to a load of French people and which – at least initially – ticked off the good people of l’Hexagone. Not only is it not so annoying any more I just prefer to think of it as more of a performance art piece these days) it’s also my favourite TV romcom. As well as the very French menage a trois enjoyed by her boss, Sylvie, the show has also long dangled the possibility of romance between Emily and Paris’s top chef Gabriel. It has simmered away like a fine soupe à l’oignon for four seasons now, regularly hindered by miscommunications and other suitors. Such is the ridiculousness of the show, I can barely remember what happened at the end of its last season. But I do know that Emily is in Rome and that she has a new love interest, Marcello, who I’m sure will absolutely not get a well-rounded story arc in season five. Emily will be back in France before we know it, and surely reunited with Gabriel. It may be the city where she speaks her own language loudly and slowly but, well, Paris is also the city of love.Hannah J Davies, Guardian TV writerShare your favouriteYou can tell us your favourite TV romcom using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Her love life, her parenting andher relationship with her bodyhave all been the stuff of Fostekew’s shows in the recent past, and she revisits them all here. Apparently a show about tolerance (if she didn’t tell us, we wouldn’t know), Iconic Breath ranges widely across our host’s life and thoughts, while she conjures with the qualities she has inherited from her lovable but angry dad, and her inspiringly positive but recently deceased gran.She is an adroit mix of both in this show, with plenty of the trademark furious-but-fun rants about things that tee her off – including a volcanic mocking of female American podcasters and a bit about the pointlessness of meditation. But the show is upbeat, too, plotting a route through despair at the state of the world via the touchline of her son’s football matches, where she finds common cause with parents whose values are a world apart from her own. Not for the first time, Fostekew finds rich comedy in her role as doting but dismayed mum to a son who is maturing into quite the masculine stereotype, with a choice line in passive-aggressive filial put-downs.One or two of the set pieces here raise an eyebrow more than a laugh, such as the one about the embarrassing pall-bearing incident at her gran’s funeral. One might wish, meanwhile, for more developed thinking about, or reasoning behind, the show’s ostensible theme of tolerance, which seldom comes into focus. But if this isn’t an hour with impetus, it is consistently entertaining, as this “geriatric millennial feminist” riffs on the petty frustrations of co-habitation with her partner, re-enacts an undignified journey on a preposterously crowded tube, and delivers a bulletproof routine about pocket-dialling with her backside while out for a run. She may never be an airport comedian, but Iconic Breath is another Fostekew show that attains soaring altitude with impressive technique and efficiency.AtSoho theatre, London, until 18 October.

Should anyone decide to challenge the songwriter’s self belief – or as she names it in the hit single Selfish, “heritage ego” – this week’s back-to-back arena gigs prove her hard-earned place at the forefront of Black British music is warranted.Before she walks on to the stage, 90s baby pictures of an even littler Simz flash on the drop down screens, before we flick through the years to an awkward yet adorable teenager with her first guitar. It all leads to the present, where tonight she is an honorary Manc in a khaki overcoat, swinging her arms behind her lower back with plentiful Gallagher swagger: “Missed you!” She radiates joy and gratitude, but the live show does not shy away from her life’s trials, and she confronts the fallout of a messypublic financial disputewith menacing metaphors and a slick vengeance that slips readily from her tongue.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianEnough is a firm highlight, with a skanking, ESG-inflected Factory Records groove animated by bass maestro Marla Kether, whose fluid post-punk basslines and signature Bantu knots rightfully pull focus away from Simz for a good few minutes. Acid-green strobe lights spew across the arena for Venom, a viral fan-favourite, until grumbling feedback cues the emergence of a DJ booth from underneath the floor.Simz switches gears and takes to the decks to perform songs from her EP Drop 7, headphones hanging from one ear and friends huddling around to hype her up, instantly transforming the space into a late-night club. Mood Swings is drenched with Drexciya and Detroit techno vibes, as onlookers grind and contort with strangers-turned-dancers against sultry 808s and subaquatic synths. It’s thrilling: few artists can take a full arena from a friendly singalong to a sweat-fuelled Boiler Room set in the space of just a couple of songs.The encore features this year’s Glastonbury standout Gorilla, scratching and rewinding in classic Yardie sound system style, until Simz truly feels the crowd are ready to feel the rhythm. When the horn sample swells, even those seated have no choice but to leap to their feet. “Name one time where I didn’t deliver?” Simz shouts and giggles in her final closing lyric. It’s an affirmation that no-one here could contest.Little Simzplays 02 Arena, London, 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsLittle SimzRapHip-hoplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

History will always remember her as the first woman to win a best director Oscar, which she did in 2010 forThe Hurt Locker.But in her new film,A House of Dynamite, history may not have long to run. It is the story of a nuclear missile, launched at an American city. The rest is about what happens next. Bigelow would like you to consider Armageddon.“Someone I know said the bomb for the audience is realising this is possible,” she says. She smiles. “I’m glad if people come away from the movie as concerned as I am.”Today, though, her bearing is Zen. Almost six feet and wearing tinted sunglasses, she looks like a rock star, and younger than 73. Her own memories of the nuclear era stretch back to the early 1960s, and a cold-war childhood in California. School involved “duck and cover” drills, teaching kids to stay safe in a nuclear attack. “I grew up hiding under my desk. Of course, I was too young to understand what I was doing down there.”View image in fullscreenRebecca Ferguson as White House security analyst Olivia Walker in A House of Dynamite.Photograph: BFA/AlamyA House of Dynamite is a belated answer. Bigelow’s previous movie,Detroit, was a 60s true story, an account of racist police violence. Now she is back in the period she most likes making films about: right now. It is an age of ironies. On our phones, nothing is beyond the pale, and everything makes us furious. And all, she says, while ignoring a nuclear stockpile able to render our online dramas irrelevant. “It’s the one thing we never mention, much less question. It’s crickets out there. It isn’t on TikTok, so it doesn’t exist.”The movie, then, reminds us of a terrifying fact of life. “Our world is combustible. And it’s extraordinary to me how that ever became normalised.”The cast includes Rebecca Ferguson as a White House security analyst and Idris Elba as the US president. Rich with closely researched detail, the film shows us the same nightmare experienced by multiple characters. Who fired the missile is never clear. Retaliatory strikes are still prepared. The film does exactly what its director intends. It makes everything else you might be thinking about feel absolutely trivial.The art world felt rarefied. But film crossed every cultural and class line, and you could just hit the ground runningBigelow has long staked out her own place in cinema. Singular and self-made, she is one of the few working film-makers to have climbed Kilimanjaro. She is also still among the most controversial of directors.She first made a name in what were seen as male genres – Blue Steel a cop movie,Point Breaka heist flick (with surfers). Later there were political third rails: The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty set amid US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.But only a fool would dispute her gifts as a film-maker: a virtuoso of action, tension and release. Jamie Lee Curtis, star of Blue Steel, once compared her to a military general. It was meant as a compliment, describing a woman of quiet, “machinelike” strength. When I mention it, though, Bigelow’s eyebrows shoot up. “The general!”View image in fullscreenIdris Elba plays the US president in A House of Dynamite.Photograph: NetflixThe playwright and actor Tracy Letts is among the stars in A House of Dynamite. On a personal level, he says, he still doesn’t feel he really knows Bigelow. But she lost her reserve on set. “I wasn’t sure what I’d find. She really does have a quality of genius, so I wouldn’t have been surprised to meet Francis Ford Coppola on Apocalypse Now. In fact, she was the calm at the eye of the storm.” Working days, he says, were full of praise. “And you’re reassured because you know why she’s there. She’s already got the awards, and I’m sure she has enough money. So, you know, the film actually matters to her.”One astonishing scene involves a civil war re-enactment. (The event was real, shot documentary style.) On screen, as the world hangs in the balance, it feels brilliantly cool-eyed. America, you think, can be deeply self-obsessed. “I think you are not wrong,” Bigelow says. “And also we are a culture defined by war. I wish we could define ourselves differently.”View image in fullscreenThe Hurt Locker (2008), for which Bigelow was the first woman to win the best director’s Oscar.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyFor all the dread plausibility of A House of Dynamite, she also keeps its fictional politicians free of reminders of their real-world counterparts. “The situation in our film stands outside that situation.” Even so, it can be hard not to watch Jared Harris play the secretary of defence without remembering that the post now has a secondary title attached to it: secretary of war.Today, Bigelow makes a joke – or half of one – about lately thinking a lot about moving to London. (For the moment she lives in what has been described as a “30-hectare horse property” in upstate New York.) Interviews with movie talent now sometimes specify no questions about Trump; Bigelow doesn’t roll that way. She looks tense when the subject comes up, though. The risk, she says, is derailing conversation about the film. But with troops in US cities, how anxious is she? “Well, I did just make a movie about nuclear war. So that may say it all.”Part of why her career has been a giant Rorschach test has been her reluctance ever to say too much. Her movies leave room to think as well, much as her characters don’t tend to have backstories. Still, her own can feel like a breadcrumb trail. She was shy at school. Her mother was an English teacher; her father managed a paint factory. (She was an only child, a situation in which, she has said, “You kind of become peers with your parents.”)By the 1970s, she had become a New York artist, living and working amid the downtown scene.Philip Glasswas a friend;Cindy Shermana neighbour; a conversation with Andy Warhol helped convinced her she should work with film. “The art world felt rarefied. Everything relied on existing knowledge. But film crossed every cultural and class line, and you could just hit the ground running. It was so much more exciting to communicate with.”View image in fullscreenBigelow (centre) on her way to accept the Academy Award for best director for The Hurt Locker, in 2010.Photograph: Matt Petit/AMPAS/EPABy the 90s, she was a sensation. Blue Steel and Point Break made her a favourite among postmodern theorists and multiplex crowds alike. But the edge of transgression people found so ticklish also caused problems. Her techno-thriller Strange Days (1995) drew complaints about a scene of sexual violence. Then came K-19: The Widowmaker, the true story of a stricken Soviet nuclear submarine in 1961, members of whose crew died preventing an accident that might have started world war three. Executives asked her who US audiences were supposed to root for. The box office was bad enough to stall a once spectacular career.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I realised it never hadShe says now this was also when she started to think again about the nuclear threat. Making the film, she visited the Arctic, where abandoned subs rusted under the sea, waiting to leak radioactivity. “In the 90s, we’d all assumed the bomb was just going to magically disappear. I realised it never had.”She made TheHurt Lockersix years later, the story of a US army bomb disposal unit in Baghdad. It made for a triumphant next chapter. Being the first woman to be awarded an Oscar for directing even brought a sense of Hollywood respectability. (There was also the fun sidebar of Bigelow beating to the prize her ex-husband, James Cameron, who was nominated for Avatar.) But the thought of being pinned in place as a woman film-maker made her uneasy. “If I can represent that the impossible can be possible, I love it,” she says today of being a role model. Then there is an audible full stop.Her time in the establishment was short-lived. Her next movie,Zero Dark Thirty, about the US hunt for Osama bin Laden, was a tour de force and a source of vast rancour – and saw her accused of colluding with the CIA. A decade later, she can still seem bruised, though time has made her wry. “Something that struck me …”, I say at the start of this interview. “Uh oh!” she exclaims. Later, I call her films conversation starters. She bursts out laughing. “And Istillthink that’s a good thing.”She says she sees a clear relationship between her hot potato films of the past 20 years and her new one. K-19 left her haunted by nuclear ghosts. Then, while others had their say about her, The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty sharpened her self-image as a film-maker adjacent to journalism. “The films start with my own curiosity, and then there’s a desire to provide access to information the public doesn’t have that I think might be important.”The other link, of course, is the military. A retired three-star general acted as a consultant on A House of Dynamite. She points out she has never sought endorsement from the Pentagon. Indeed, the story is more than sceptical about the accepted wisdom of mutually assured destruction – and the billions spent maintaining it. “Our nuclear armoury is a fallible structure,” Bigelow says. “Within it are men and women working thanklessly behind the scenes, whose competence means you and I can sit and have this conversation. But competence doesn’t mean they’re infallible.”View image in fullscreenA heist flick (with surfers) … Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break (1991).Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/20 Century Fox/AllstarIt feels like an idea close to Bigelow’s core. Letts even compares her to Ken Loach. “I know it sounds a strange parallel, but they both make movies about flawed systems, and ordinary characters trapped inside them.” For her own part, she retains an endearing faith in people’s ability to make good choices with enough real information. She also thinks we need to start taking responsibility.“We are our own villain,” she says. Humanity made the bomb; at some point, we have to deal with it. “Of course, the challenge is this is a global problem. Climate change is the same. But we have to act. And I would say a first action is to see this issue as your main responsibility when you vote.”From high-octane action to arthouse intrigue … all Kathryn Bigelow’s films – ranked!Read moreBut are movies still the all-powerful communication tool they were when the younger Bigelow discovered film? “I do read things about the future of our industry that are very grim. But I’m also kind of detached. I don’t live in Los Angeles any more. And I just keep moving forward.”And so, inevitably, we come to AI. In 2025, no one talks about nuclear weapons, but the world can’t stop discussing theartificially generated actor Tilly Norwood. Bigelow says she would never use AI for anything to do with a performance. Beyond that, who knows? “When I made Strange Days, which now seems a hundred years ago, I was always being asked about technology. And I said then: what’s important is who uses it.” She tells me she is readingIf Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, the bestseller about our AI future. It is, she says, as pessimistic as the title implies. “Fascinating.”The problem, I say, is people often look to film-makers for answers. “I know. They do.” She rewinds out loud back through our conversation. “AI. Climate change. Nuclear war.” She smiles again. “Next time, I’m making a comedy.”A House of Dynamite is in cinemas now and on Netflix from 24 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmKathryn BigelowHurt LockerZero Dark ThirtyOscarsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, she’s adding another title to her résumé: novelist.This month, the 49-year-old releases her first work of fiction, Gone Before Goodbye, co-written with the bestselling thriller author Harlan Coben.Already tipped to hit the bestseller lists on publication, the book follows Maggie McCabe, a former army combat surgeon who takes a discreet medical job for an anonymous client – only for a patient to vanish under her care, setting off an international conspiracy. “I’ve never had an idea for a novel before,” Witherspoonsaid recently. “I’m always the actor who shows up and executes someone else’s vision. I thought, maybe it’s time to take the big leap and build the world myself.”Witherspoon and Coben are touring the book and will appear together at the Royal Festival Hall next week as part of the London literature festival. But for Witherspoon, the move is less a pivot than a continuation – the latest chapter in a career defined by reinvention and an unerring sense of what audiences want.Born in New Orleans and raised in Nashville, Witherspoon made her screen debut at 14 in The Man in the Moon (1991). She spent her 20s playing sharp, ambitious young women who defied expectations: Tracy Flick in Election, Woods in Legally Blonde, Melanie Carmichael in Sweet Home Alabama. Her performance as June Carter Cash in Walk the Line earned her an Academy award and confirmed her as one of Hollywood’s most bankable stars.“She’s got that quality that men find attractive, while women would like to be her friend,” the director Alexander Payne once said. “But that’s just the foundation. Nobody else is as funny or brings such charm to things. She can do anything.”Despite her reputation, the late 2000s were professionally tough for Witherspoon. Her film choices faltered, and the scripts coming her way were uninspiring. “There are a lot of really, really big movies about robots,” she said at the time, “and there’s not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie.”The lack of complex roles for women prompted her to start producing her own material. In 2012, she founded Pacific Standard, later folded into her larger media company Hello Sunshine to tell stories by and about women.The strategy paid off. Gone Girl, Wild and Big Little Lies became critical and commercial hits, each one led by complex female protagonists. Subsequent projects, such as The Morning Show, Little Fires Everywhere and Daisy Jones & the Six, confirmed Witherspoon’s status as a cultural power broker (when Hello Sunshine sold in 2022 for a reported $1bn, it made Witherspoon one of the richest and most powerful women in Hollywood).In 2017, Witherspoon launched Reese’s Book Club, whichnow boasts millions of membersand an uncanny ability to turn any selection into a bestseller – creating its own term: the Witherspoon effect. The novels she picks are mostly stories of female resilience and reinvention, and many of them later become Hello Sunshine screen projects, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. In 2022, she wrote the first of her Busy Betty series of children’s books beforeannouncing her pivot to adult fictionlast year.Perhaps it was inevitable Witherspoon would one day write a novel. In recent yearsa slew of famous names have moonlighted as novelists. Keanu Reeves collaborated with the British fantasy writer China Miéville; Hillary Clinton teamed up with the mystery novelist Louise Penny; Bill Clinton co-wrote thrillers with James Patterson. According to Nielsen BookScan data, in 2023, eight of the top 100 bestselling paperback novels, and five in the top 20, were written by celebrities.View image in fullscreenReese Witherspoon has previously written children’s books.Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesFor Witherspoon and Coben, their story began nearly a decade ago when they met at a conference – he admired her work with books and she admired his knack for plot. When she phoned him years later with an idea about a surgeon forced to become a fugitive, their collaboration took shape over a single, three-hour call. “We both knew at the end there’s no way we’re not going to do this,” Cobentold USA Today. “It was just too much fun.”The premise has a personal resonance for Witherspoon. Her father was a military doctor who served as a lieutenant in the US army reserve, her mother was a professor of nursing. “We did not want any of this to appear gimmicky,” Coben said. “Neither of us needed a résumé thing. We both agreed it had to be our best work.”Whether it is remains to be seen. Early reviews have been encouraging –The Los Angeles Times praised the novel’sability to “pull the reader deep”, and the book holds a four-star average on Goodreads – but Witherspoon’s name alone will guarantee attention. Coben has already mused on the cinematic quality of the story and his co-author’s suitability for the lead role.But for now, Witherspoon’s ambitions are focused on the page. She has said she hopes Maggie McCabe can do for medicine what Elle Woods once did for law: inspire women to see themselves in professions where they are too often underestimated.Explore more on these topicsReese WitherspoonThrillersFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Time of falling leaves and Mike Oldfield chimes presaging Halloween? For David Teniers the Younger, the arrival of autumn doesn’t mean any of these. It means time for a drink, because the wine harvest is here. Other artists too have celebrated this time as the season of the vintage, from Poussin to Cy Twombly, but Teniers doesn’t even bother with scenes of the grape harvest. He cuts to the chase and portrays a plump tipsy bloke holding up a glass. His shiny face looks vaguely at us but he balances the glass perfectly, as he dangles the flagon he’s emptied in his other hand. Once Teniers, from Antwerp, was the most famous of 17th-century north European artists of everyday life: his ruddy realism was seen as the essence of this so-called “genre” tradition. As such he influenced British artists such as Hogarth and David Wilkie to paint ordinary, unprettified human existence.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There have been continuous protests outside the city’s Ice facility in recent months.Rapp told the concert audience that as she was performing in Portland, “at the same time, some other people who shouldn’t fucking be here are … So let’s just make a few things abundantly fucking clear. Fuck Ice. Fuck this administration. And fuck Trump.”She is one of the fastest rising pop stars in the US, earning a UK No 1 album in August for her second album Bite Me, which reached No 3 in the US. She is also a successful stage and screen actor, taking a lead role in the Broadway production of the Mean Girls musical and in TV seriesThe Sex Lives of College Girls.Rapp joins a number of musicians opposing Ice as immigration crackdowns intensify in the US under the Trump administration.“I got a new chain, it say: Fuck Ice,” declared Chance the Rapper on his recent album, Star Line. Meanwhile, Finneas – the singer and brother of Billie Eilish, who produces her music – said of an Ice protest he attended in Los Angeles: “Teargassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown. They’re inciting this.” Tyler, the Creator, Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong and Kehlani also decried Ice’s activity in Los Angeles.Earlier this month, the country music star Zach Bryan debuted a snippet of a new song with lyrics including: “Ice is gonna come bust down your door … Kids are all scared and all alone.”The US Department of Homeland Security criticised him, with assistant secretary of public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, telling Bryan to “stick to Pink Skies, dude”, referring to one of his previous hits. The department also mockingly soundtracked an Ice enforcement video with a Bryan song.This week, the indie record labels Epitaph and Anti- called on Spotify to stop carrying advertisements for Ice. “Artists and fans deserve platforms that reflect the values of the culture they sustain,” each label said in a shared statement. Earlier in the week, Spotify defended carrying the ads, saying the “content does not violate our advertising policies”.‘I’ve never asked for the approval of conservative white bigots’: Reneé Rapp on pop stardom, problem fans, and speaking her mindRead moreOn Wednesday, Trump’s attempts to deploy national guard troops in the left-leaning Portlandwere blockedby a federal judge in Oregon, extending a previous order.Federal agents have clashed with protesters during the months-long protests, making arrests and firing non-lethal rounds and teargas, while local police have separately made arrests. The protests have often been whimsical and absurdist, featuring inflatable costumes and naked bike rides.The Trump administration said it would “crush violent radical left terrorism” with the troop deployment, butOregonofficials have countered that claim. “There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security,” said governor Tina Kotek, while Portland mayor Keith Wilson said “we will not engage” with Ice and affirmed Portland’s “sanctuary city” status for immigrants.“The actions of certain federal officers continue to be deeply disturbing to our community,” Wilson said in a statement, “and the lack of accountability and transparency for what appears to be unconstitutional behaviour against individuals expressing their rights will only serve to deepen the divide between this facility and our community.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockPortlandOregonDonald TrumpIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

Fender sings on the chorus “Just wanna talk to you / Wanna talk with my best friend / Wanna let go of everything that I carry”, and has said the song is about: “the end of a long relationship – about the regret, the mistakes and the lessons that come with it. It’s that feeling of losing your best friend, and coming to terms with that. I was playing around with the riff and thought, ‘What I need is a really good pianist’, and then, ‘Hmmm, I wonder who I can call?’ And of course, who better thanElton John?”John added: “Sam was writing and recording in a studio in west London, and called to say he’d written a song with a piano riff that he thought would sound great with me playing it. I couldn’t resist, and it was so much fun playing it for him. I truly love Sam. He’s been a friend for many, many years and it’s incredible to see him grow into being a truly world class artist.”Fender is riding high as one of the UK’s most successful singer-songwriters. His third albumPeople Watchingtopped the UK album chart, just as his previous two had, and two of its songs – the title track and Rein Me In, a duet with Olivia Dean – have reached the Top 10.

Father would have been very surprised.”The unveiling ceremony at Awdry’s former home, named Sodor after the fictional island his anthropomorphic engines inhabited, also forms part of this year’sRailway 200 celebrations.Awdry was working as a curate in Kings Norton, Birmingham, when the first book in the series, The Three Railway Engines, was published in 1945. On his retirement in 1965, Awdry and his family moved to Stroud, where he continued developing the world of Sodor.The Rev W Awdry (second from left) in a family photograph.Photograph: Awdry family/Historic EnglandChambers said Awdry’s requirements for the house included a room for his study and another to host a model railway.“He felt what he was doing with his stories was as much an outreach to people as being a parish priest,” said Chambers. “Lots of people used to write to him for advice, a bit like an agony aunt. He was non-judgmental and understood children.”Since his death in 1997 at the age of 85, the phenomenon of Thomas has continued to grow across the world, helped by television adaptations.A stained glass window starring the tank engine has been installed at St Mary Magdalene church in Stroud and enthusiasts are often found there.View image in fullscreenAwdry with a Thomas the Tank Engine figurine. TV adaptations made the series a global phenomenon.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyChambers said Awdry would have been surprised at the idea of fans visiting Gloucestershire. “I don’t think he could ever quite understand why Thomas and his friends were so popular. I think it’s because children are pretty much the same anywhere in the world and they seem to relate to the different characters – Thomas is cheeky, Percy misunderstands things and Gordon is big and bossy.”Nigel Prenter, a Stroud district councillor, said one of his grandchildren had all the books in the series and slept with one under his pillow every night. He said: “Just this week my wife, Joanne, showed three Japanese visitors the stained glass window, which they had come specifically to see.”Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said it was an honour to celebrate Awdry and the happiness he brought to so many childhoods. He said: “The early books, which would become The Railway Series, laid the foundation for a global phenomenon, based on the magic of the steam train.”The heritage minister, Fiona Twycross, said: “Our railways are a vital part of our national heritage, and the Rev Awdry’s books are an excellent example of how they can spark creativity and imagination.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageChildren and teenagersGloucestershireRail transportChildren's TVnewsShareReuse this content"

More invisible,” says Leonard, blinking up at the night sky. “One thing’s led to another and now I feel like if I don’t do something I’ll just carry on in this …” – he searches for a fitting encapsulation of his life – “… minor, harmless existence.” Hungry Paul – Leonard’s best and, indeed, only friend – considers the implications of this announcement. “Nothing wrong with that, though,” he replies, bathrobe flapping thoughtfully in the breeze. “Better than trying to make a mark on the world only to wind up defacing it.”For those exhausted by the bluster and rat-tat-tat of today’s TV terrain, here is Leonard and Hungry Paul with a foil blanket and warming mug of Ribena.Like its harmless protagonists, Leonard and Hungry Paul – a six-part comedy written by Richie Conroy and Mark Hodkinson based on Rónán Hession’s understated 2019 novel – takes a dim view of modern life; peering disapprovingly over its prematurely middle-aged glasses at anything in the way of unnecessary noise, sudden movements or – heaven forfend – an abundance of ambition. The series is, instead, an ode to introversion; a quiet celebration of those content to pootle around below the parapet. And yet. Leonard (another sublimely idiosyncratic turn from Alex “The End of the F***ing World/Andor” Lawther) is unsettled. He feels a creeping “need to open the doors and windows of my life … a little”. The recent death of his beloved mother has whisked the rug from under his slippers and the 32-year-old ghost writer now finds himself questioning the choices that have brought him to where he is (single; defensively moustached; working on a range of children’s encyclopedias for a man who signs off emails with the phrase “ciao for now”).And so Leonard launches himself on a quest for emotional fulfilment, with the slightly bolder, if no less socially uncomfortable, Hungry Paul (Laurie Kynaston) serving as his confidant, life coach and co-conspirator in a weekly board games evening that serves both as symposium (“Is the pool warm because kids pee in it, or do kids pee in it because it’s warm?”) and refuge.(Why “Hungry” Paul? No idea. The origin of the nickname appears lost to the mists of time. Perhaps the postal worker once ate a sandwich unusually quickly, or responded to a socially fraught incident by panic-peeling four scotch eggs with his teeth).Into Leonard’s gentle world cartwheels Shelley (Jamie-Lee “Derry Girls” O’Donnell) a new, spring-loaded colleague who cheerily offers to kill Leonard’s appalling boss (Paul Reid) during the office fire drill. That whooshing sound you can hear is Leonard’s gentle world being turned upside down.Elsewhere in the first episode of a series driven less by plot and more by what the under-30s may refer to as “vibes”, we meet Hungry Paul’s dad (the ever-wonderful Lorcan Cranitch), a battered sofa of a man who secretly watches, records then replays daytime quiz shows to impress his adoring wife with his general knowledge.Shepherding us through all this minor-key niceness is a narrator who sounds very much like – and, indeed, very much is –Julia Roberts. Yes, Julia Roberts. If you are thinking, “Surely the inclusion of a major Hollywood star is at odds with the series’ unshowy MO and initially serves only as a distraction?” you would be correct. Still, Roberts acquits herself well, and lines such as “Leonard’s problem is that he lacks a ‘eureka’ face” help ensure that early misgivings give way if not quite to appreciation, then at least to acceptance.But that’s enough grumbling for now. Leonard and Hungry Paul’s heart is in the right place: the right place being “sitting on a park bench next to the Detectorists, pointing out its favourite duck”. It’s a series that ambles along in its sleeveless jumper, occasionally looking up at the stars, occasionally down at its slippers, quietly confident that there is nothing in the world as cheering as spending time in the company of good friends.Open the doors and windows of your life a little, and let it in.Leonard and Hungry Paul is on BBC iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJulia RobertsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then it reaches the 90s and it all peters outStuart HeritageFri 17 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 17 Oct 2025 00.01 EDTShareThe world is not short on documentaries about Martin Scorsese. Those wanting to see his inspirations and methodology can already seek out 1995’s A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, 2004’s Scorsese on Scorsese or any of the endless biographiescompiled by fans on YouTube.But all of these are incomplete, either frozen in time at a midpoint in Scorsese’s career or lacking direct input from the man himself. Rebecca Miller’s sprawling Apple TV documentary Mr Scorsese is an attempt to correct that. If it isn’t entirely successful, it’s because five hours is nowhere near enough time to do justice to the man’s multitudes.The project does feel somewhat necessary. The Scorsese of 2025 has a cast-iron reputation. He is perhaps the greatest film-maker in the history of the medium. He is lauded and respectable, a pillar of the monied establishment. What Mr Scorsese does well is remind you this was not always the case.Pointedly, in interviews conducted by Miller, Scorsese is keen to remind the world that he spent most of his life as the ultimate outsider. A sickly kid who was born in Queens, New York near the street where the mob would dump their dead bodies, he was riddled with asthma and had to watch the world through his third-storey window, only escaping to air-conditioned cinemas that would alleviate his symptoms.Throughout his life he was, as he puts it, ostracised time and time again. Ostracised from his neighbourhood after a family dispute. Ostracised by his own peers for making (in the words of John Cassavetes) a “piece of shit” in Roger Corman’s Boxcar Bertha. Ostracised by his religion for making The Last Temptation of Christ. Ostracised by Hollywood after the twin flops of Kundun and Bringing Out the Dead. Ostracised by his own body after he was hospitalised, blood pouring from every orifice, when his gargantuan drug intake caught up with him in his 30s. And yet, every time he was knocked down, his talent and determination helped him find his way back.The series doesn’t shy away from any of these downfalls. There’s a sequence on The Last Temptation of Christ that is particularly shocking, with nuns appearing on TV to tell the audience that buying a ticket represents a mortal sin, and antisemitic protests outside the home of the studio head Lew Wasserman.No wonder there are so many stories about Scorsese’s volcanic temper. We’re reminded of times that he flipped desks, smashed phones and destroyed rooms whenever anybody dared to stand in the way of his vision. Mercifully, this seems to have calmed now. Towards the end of the series it seems like a combination of tangible success, domestic happiness and the realities of acting as a carer for his wife have softened the edges of a man who at times seemed frighteningly uncompromising.But Mr Scorsese also attempts to reinforce the director’s place within the industry. Steven Spielberg is interviewed at length, and Ari Aster proves to be as adept at deconstructing Scorsese’s films as Scorsese is with the films that inspired him. Perhaps the biggest get is Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives an uncharacteristically charming and unguarded interview about his two projects with Scorsese. Obviously the fact he is married to Rebecca Miller probably helped with access, but his participation is an undoubted highlight.Nevertheless, despite its extended runtime, something about Mr Scorsese still feels frustratingly slight. Perhaps it’s that the series noticeably loses density as his career wears on. The first few episodes are rich and packed with information, but we’re still stuck in the 1990s by the end of the fourth episode. That leaves just a single hour to clatter through a quarter-century of his work, during which he made nine films, and a quarter of that is given over to Gangs of New York. Hugo – his 2011 attempt at a family 3D film – doesn’t even warrant a mention.His vital work restoring and preserving lost classics with the Film Foundation and the World Cinema Foundation, his work as a documentarian, his choice to champion exciting new voices as a producer – any one of which could sustain half the length of Mr Scorsese alone – are all brushed away in the sprint to the finish line. In other words, the definitiveMartin Scorsesedocumentary remains unmade. But if you have a love of film and five spare hours, you could do much worse.Mr Scorsese is on Apple TV now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMartin ScorseseDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

This Q is currently in his 50s; his backstory includes a fling with Miss Moneypenny, and emotional baggage in the form of his retired history don father. What’s drawn him home is the mysterious drowning of his old friend, quantum scientist Peter Napier, who has left him an encrypted note; although the coroner has ruled the death to be accidental and Q’s old flame, DCI Kathy Burnham, is not minded to reopen the case. The stakes here are worthy of the Fleming canon – Napier’s revolutionary work may have terrible consequences – and even if you’re not a Bond fan, you can’t fail to enjoy this solidly plotted and unexpectedly funny blend of nostalgia and new technology.View image in fullscreenThe Killing Stonesby Ann Cleeves (Macmillan, £22)Bestseller Cleeves’s latest novel is billed as the return of Jimmy Perez, as Perez and his life partner DI Willow Reeves, now living on the Orkney Islands with their young son, team up to solve a murder. It’s nearly Christmas when Jimmy’s old friend Archie Stout is found dead at the site of an archeological dig, felled by a Neolithic stone purloined from the local heritage centre. Suspects soon proliferate: the artist with whom roving-eyed Archie may have been having an affair; teacher and local history enthusiast George Riley; mediagenic archeology professor Tony Johnson, and even the deceased’s wife. With an evocation of place that is second to none, Cleeves keeps the narrative plates spinning beautifully to create a complex plot that takes in both the thorny issue of who controls heritage and the pernicious effects of online misogyny.View image in fullscreenThe Long Shoeby Bob Mortimer (Gallery, £22)Unemployed bathroom salesman Matt, protagonist of Bob Mortimer’s third novel, is someone who aims low in life and usually misses. He will be familiar, albeit with a different name and CV, to anyone who has read the first two books, right down to his ventriloquised cat, this symbol-of-loneliness role having previously been taken by, respectively, a squirrel and a pigeon. Not only has Matt lost his job, but his girlfriend Harriet has left and he’s about to be made homeless. Offered a rent-free luxury flat, he jumps at the chance, but of course there’s a catch; and meanwhile, Harriet is having problems of her own. Whether or not you enjoy this will depend more on your fondness for Mortimer’s surreal humour than your liking for crime fiction. Matt’s inability to take appropriate action at any given moment will have punctilious readers foaming at the mouth, but at the heart of the preposterous plot is a touching story about human relationships.View image in fullscreenBenbeculaby Graeme Macrae Burnet (Polygon, £12)Graeme Macrae Burnet’s latest is part of the Darkland Tales series of contemporary takes on Scottish history and legends. The Booker-shortlisted author has chosen a true story from 1857, when labourer Angus McPhee murdered his parents and aunt at their small farm in Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. Tried and found to be criminally insane, he spent the rest of his life in the Criminal Lunatic Department of Perth Prison. Based on such records as are available, Burnet’s account of the events is narrated, some years after the fact, by Angus’s brother Malcolm, who is still living, alone and largely ostracised by the community, in the family home. Recalling the events that led up to the killing, Malcolm slowly loses his grip on reason as he tries to make sense of something senseless. Burnet’s vivid portrayal of a troubled household by a man attempting to explain the inexplicable is dark, intense and utterly compelling.View image in fullscreenThe Winter Warriorsby Olivier Norek, translated by Nick Caistor (Open Borders, £18.99)Prize-winning French author Norek, best known for his cop series, has turned his hand to crime on a grand scale: the 1939 Soviet invasion of Finland. The “Winter war”, during which the temperature plummeted to -51C and the massively outnumbered Finns succeeded in keeping the Russian bear at bay and inflicting far heavier casualties than they sustained, was so embarrassing to the Kremlin that the conflict was written out of official Soviet history. Although Norek gives us a god’s eye view of proceedings, the moral and dramatic centre of the action is Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä, who, like most of the main characters, is drawn from life, and whose skill earned him the nickname “White Death”. The Soviet generals were more afraid of Stalin than of the enemy; horribly topical and wholly immersive, with descriptions vivid enough to make you shiver, this astonishing book is not only a testament to bravery and resilience, but a powerful indictment of the cruelty and needless suffering that result when ideology comes up against reality.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

As a branch publicity officer, one of his tasks was the monthly production of an in-house newsletter, and he decided to print, anonymously, a comic anecdote in verse form. When he asked a colleague who was a grammar school teacher what he thought of the contributor’s effort, the answer was dismissive: it did not rhyme or scan! Maurice decided to take up the challenge.An industrial technical writer by profession, he knew something about the building of ships. Now he would investigate the craft of poetry construction. In the public library, he discovered The Oxford Book of Twentieth-Century English Verse, chosen by Larkin. He bought the book – the first collection of poems he had ever owned.At this stage the poets who captured his attention were those who wrote movingly of their second world war experiences, such as Charles Causley, Keith Douglas, Vernon Scannell and, especially, Henry Reed, whose poemNaming of Partsshowed Maurice a picture from his own life as an 18-year-old conscript in charge of his first rifle.View image in fullscreenRutherford receiving his honorary doctorate from the University of Hull, 2023.Photograph: Phil CurryMaurice’s poetic skills and public presence flowered. Importantly, he went deeper into the work of the Welsh poet RS Thomas, and developed his “ear” for the music of language. He attended courses run by the Arvon Foundation. There were poetry competition successes, and increasing appearances in literary journals.In 1982 he published a first collection, Slipping the Tugs, with Lincolnshire and Humberside Arts, bringing to life the streets and people of Hull, the “rust-measled” ships and “ebbed-out estuary”, “the quiet men” and their war stories.His subsequent publications are This Day Dawning ( 1989), Love is a Four-Letter World (1994), After the Parade (1996), And Saturday is Christmas, New and Selected Poems (2011) and Flip Side to Philip Larkin (2012). Readers, critics and poets were enthusiastic. Causley, reviewing This Day Dawning, described Rutherford as “a totally original voice, sure, wide-ranging, very moving and arresting, as well as often being very funny”.Maurice shared a birth year with Larkin, but had a very different experience of Hull, east Yorkshire, the city where Larkin spent much of his life and where Maurice was born. He clearly relished writing as one of the everyday people Larkin had described as a “cut-price crowd”. In his poem View from Hessle Road, dedicated toJean Hartley(Larkin’s Hull publisher), he adapts some of Larkin’s words with mischievous intent, imagining the local response to “Hull’s late bard”: “Oozee? … / “We’ve never ‘eard of ‘im down ‘Ezzle Road. / No, bollocks. Poetsarra … crowdacraps!” However, Maurice, who, like Larkin, identified with no poetry movement, admired and learned a lot from his contemporary. Both were brilliant technicians and, though realists, could write with great lyrical sensitivity, especially when observing the natural world.Maurice was the son of Evelyn Rutherford, a manager for a salt cod curing business in Hull, and his wife, Maud (nee Rawson), and had three siblings, one of whom, Barbara, went on to write historical novels. He enjoyed poetry at school, but opportunities were limited: he left Hull Commercial College aged 16 to work as a clerk at the Hull Graving Dock. His second world war service was initially with the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and later with the Royal Armoured Corps, his duties taking him to Italy and North Africa. He left with an exemplary record.Olive Gray, his wife-to-be, was in the Women’s Land Army in Sussex during the war. She and Maurice met at a dance, were married in 1947, and went on to have two children, Ian and Jeannie. Maurice’s postwar career continued in the Humberside shipbuilding and engineering industries where he was a technical writer, and prepared accounts and estimates for ship repairs. He took early retirement in 1986, when Humber Graving Dock, in Immingham, Lincolnshire, went into liquidation, and moved from Grimsby back to Yorkshire.In 2016, he collaborated with Jeannie, an artist, on Marshalled Musings, an illustrated miscellany of short prose meditations and new poems. Also a gifted photographer, he curated, with the help of his granddaughter, Katy, and the leading music industry photographer Dan North, an exhibition of his rhymed haikus and accompanying photos, which ran at Cliffs in Cliftonville, Kent in 2019.In 2023, at the age of 100, Maurice, by then blind, was recognised by the University of Hull with an honorary doctorate. Before he heard about the honour, he had had a dream, and recorded it in a poem that ends by imagining, “The day my parents would have loved, / Mum in cherried hat and lemon-gloved, / My father standing taller than his height, / Willing this dream hold firm come morning’s light.” Yes, it rhymes and scans – but what’s unforgettable is the timelessly sharp and loving vision of two proud parents.Working at the University of Hull’s Larkin Centre for a period, I had the pleasure of discovering Maurice’s poetry and meeting him in person. I went on to feature him twice in the Guardian poem of the week series:The Autumn Outingsin 2009 andMistin 2022.Olive died in 2012. Maurice is survived by Ian and Jeannie, by two grandchildren, Katy and Alec, and four great-grandchildren.Maurice Rutherford, poet, born 28 September 1922; died 2 October 2025Explore more on these topicsPoetryPhilip LarkinobituariesShareReuse this content"

Yet with the cast and crew of productions already fretting over the coming role of AI in the industry, it is anincreasingly troubling undertaking.“It happens without warning,” says Olivia Williams, who adds she has been scanned more times than she cares to remember during a career that has spanned fromThe Sixth SensetoDune: Prophecy.“You are on set. You are in costume. A friendly assistant director who is already known to you, who brings you tea and holds your phone while you’re acting, says that the VFX [visual effects] team are in today – and just after you finish the scene, could you pop over to the VFX bus? And off you go.“Actors are, by and large,people pleasers. To have a standoff about scanning when you are in the midst of a scene annihilates your creativity, engenders fear that you will never work again, that your agent will drop you. So you comply.”Lead and supporting actors, stunt performers and dancers have all told the Guardian of similar experiences on set, of being ushered into scanners despite being unclear on their rights relating to the biometric data produced.Williams said performers were told that “if you want to be in the scene, or you want the scene to look cool with the alien crawling out of your brain”, then scans were needed.View image in fullscreenScanning ‘happens without warning’, said Olivia Williams, who said actors complied through ‘fear that you will never work again’.Photograph: David Vintiner/The ObserverThe experience has caused unease for some time, but the development of “AI doubles” for performers and claims about the arrival of “AI actors” has injected urgency into clarifying exactly what is happening to the data harvested on set.Those concerns were flushed into the open with the publicity aroundan AI actor called “Tilly Norwood”. It seems unlikely that the company behind the creation will generate the first AI star, but it has given a focus to an ongoing fight to clarify performers’ rights.Williams decided to put her head above the parapet out of concern for young actors just starting out, as well as the existential threat posed to performers known in the industry as supporting artistes (SAs), who populate a show’s crowds and backdrops.Dave Watts, an experienced SA who has appeared in numerous superhero movies and major productions, has been scanned several times. He said there were wider implications for the industry.“I already hear crew members saying: ‘To be honest, we don’t even need to do this any more. We can just ask AI to create a crowd of 1,000 people based on information which has already been captured,’” he said.“If you don’t have your usual crowd of 100, 200 or 500 SAs on a big production, then you also don’t need the assistant directors that look after them, and you don’t need the hair and makeup people. You don’t need the costume people, the costume fittings, all the caterers, all the drivers and location marshals. There’s a whole range of jobs there that AI effectively puts at risk.”View image in fullscreenImages of the AI-generated actor ‘Tilly Norwood’ have heightened concerns for performers.Photograph: ReutersA dancer, speaking anonymously due to concerns speaking out would affect their work, raised similar points about the pressure to be scanned and the use of the data. “Filming is gruelling – you’re getting up at 3am,” they said. “It’s now 8pm and you’re not allowed to go home until you’ve done it. The way it happens, you just really don’t have a choice.“You wonder, have we all done ourselves out of a job? It makes you feel a bit of a fool.”Alex Lawrence-Archer, a data rights lawyer from the law firm AWO which has been working with actors on the issue, said performers were hampered by a morass of complicated, overlapping laws. He said it was crucial for them to have clearer agreements going into a production, rather than trying to reclaim their data after the fact.“Contracts are often quite poorly drafted, often industry-standard wording that has been around for many years,” he said. “They’re really not designed with these kinds of technologies in mind.

They need to negotiate better contracts that are clearer and that truly reflect a fair agreement between actors, studios and AI developers.”There are now signs of a fledgling rebellion. On one recent shoot, performers were given advanced notice of scans after concerns were raised.“The cast has collectively been pushing back against the atmosphere of ambushing actors,” said one of the performers, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We succeeded in getting them to put a sort of addendum into our agreement, which basically prevents them from using the digital scans for anything other than the show without our written consent.”View image in fullscreenFilming in Cardiff for Mr Burton. As well as actors, AI puts the jobs of assistant directors, hair and makeup artists, costume designers and wardrobe staff, caterers, drivers and location marshals at risk, says one supporting actor.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe battle for rights in the face of the AI industry’s thirst for data can seem hopeless. Such data can be harvested from various footage and sources that sidestep professional performers. However, there is a consensus over attempting to take back some control.“The technology could conceivably be used in a reductionist way that drastically reduces the need for human performers, or it could be used to benefit creativity and build things out in a really positive way,” said Theo Morton, a professional stunt performer and member of the British Stunt Register. “There’s a lot of uncertainty and no one truly knows. That’s why it’s so important to create safeguards contractually, to protect against this potential erosion of control that could happen.”Williams, however, is among those who despair that control has already been lost.The great unknown is where exactly the data training AI models is coming from. Lawrence-Archer said that remained a closely guarded secret, but needed to be exposed. He also warned against reducing the issue to extra compensation for performers.“The AI industry relies on large amounts of data,” he said. “Someone is gathering it. We know that these questions are very sensitive for AI developers and studios. We have supported actors to make these data access requests, trying to learn more. I personally know of actors who have been paid off by AI companies in order to withdraw those requests.“We need to be building a world in which the human creativity, connection and performance of actors carries on being valued. If we focus only on legal and compensation questions, there’s a risk that you end up with actors becoming data gig workers, rather than the creative performers they are.”Explore more on these topicsAIData protectionRights issuesFilm industryArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyOlivia WilliamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our discussion has fallen back in time to the start of the first mass Palestinian revolt against British rule and Zionism. It’s the year from which her latest film,Palestine36, takes its name, a year she’s heard about her entire life. It’s also the origin, she believes, of today’s reality – even if for others it’s a historical void. “A lot of people don’t even know, surprisingly, that the British were even in Palestine,” Jacir says incredulously. “This film is for Palestinians. It’s our story that hasn’t been told.”The veteran film-maker is undoubtedly well placed to tell it: this is her fourth feature to be selected as Palestine’s Oscar entry. And although a period film, it does not belong to the past. While years have passed since the executions, widespread detentions and demolished villages under Britain’s 30-year rule, she argues that history is alive. At one point in the film, a young Palestinian man is tied to the front of a vehicle by British soldiers, as a human shield. While filming the scene in Nablus, a city in the West Bank, the very same dayIsraeli soldiers strapped a wounded Palestinian man to a military vehicleduring a raid in Jenin. “Everything that is going on now was set up back then in 1936; everything that the Israeli army does, in fact, is all taken from that moment,” says Jacir.‘We need to do something’: the company releasing Palestinian films no one else willRead moreWe speak over video shortly after Palestine 36 premiered at the Toronto film festival to a 20-minute standing ovation. Understandably, Jacir is overwhelmed. The 10-year project has been “so difficult to come to life” and is a gift, she says, from a cast and crew who persevered despite living through “the darkest moments of our history”.As arguably Palestine’s foremost film-maker, Jacir has a gift for transporting Palestinians’ experiences of exile and rebellion on to the screen, notably withWhen I Saw You, her second feature, which is set in the aftermath of the 1967 Israeli invasion of the West Bank, and more recently,Wajib(winner of 36 international awards).Palestine 36, however, is macabrely applicable to the present moment. Days before our conversation, alongside other nations, theUK moved to recognise Palestinian statehood. Weeks earlier,global genocide scholars backed a resolution stating that Israel’s actions in Gaza met the legal definition of the crime. More than 65,000 Palestinians – a figurebelieved by academics to be an underestimate– have been killed since the attacks of 7 October. In the occupied West Bank,forced displacementsof Palestinians have intensified since.“There’s a genocide,” Jacir says. “I don’t want a state. I don’t give a shit about a state. We just want to live. That’s what Palestinians want. We want to have a life.”She tells me her father, born in 1936, survived the 1948 Nakba – the mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland after the creation ofIsrael– and speaks nonstop of the trauma and dispossession of the past. Jacir’s own backyard in Bethlehem is littered with canisters from Israeli weapons, tear gas, bullets, all labelled ‘Made in the US’. “There’s no respite for any generation of Palestinians. It never stops. Time is going quickly,” she tells me, “and yet we’re going nowhere.”Palestine 36 is stamped by Jacir’s resolve. From the start she was adamant about filming in Palestine, but production was shut down days before it was due to start, following the 7 October attacks. The foreign team were evacuated and it took hours for Palestinian crew members to return to their homes amid total lockdown. Forced to relocate to Jordan for 13 months, they were later able to return, but found one location – an entire village that they had painstakingly restored, including planting tobacco and cotton – had been overrun by settlers. There was also a risk of actors being misidentified if seen in military fatigues or rebel outfits. “It’s a very tense situation,” she says, “there’s no way we were going to put anybody’s life in danger.”View image in fullscreen‘These places are real, they exist’ … Palestine 36.Over two years, production stopped and started four times. The financial hit was massive. As the situation worsened, producers proposed filming in Cyprus, Greece or Malta instead, but for Jacir it was worth fighting to film in Palestine. “It’s so critical that Jerusalem is Jerusalem in the film. It’s not somewhere else. These places are real, they exist,” she says. “We do feel this can all be taken away, it’s being taken away.”While filming in the occupiedWest Bank, the Palestinian director was conscious it could be the last time they were there, just as she was aware of her own privilege at being on land many are unable to return to. The work felt all the more critical since this was the only feature film to shoot in Palestine in the past two years. Did filming in proximity to Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza change her relationship to the art of film-making, I wonder? “Artistically, the project changed. I couldn’t help but react to that.”While the film is large in its historic scope, covering the three-year Arab revolt, what we are left with is an emotional story of everyday people struggling to live. We find characters at a turning point, each life interwoven as skilfully astatreez– a hand-stitched embroidery central to Palestinian culture, which was top of mind for Jacir in the writing process. Each character was a thread for her to cross and intertwine – ultimately leaving us with a portrait of resistance in the face of imperialism.This is evidenced too in the film’s casting, with a mix of actors, from its animated lead, first-time feature film actor Karim Daoud Anaya, to Succession’sHiam Abbassand Game of Thrones’s Liam Cunningham, and in its use of colourised archival footage. Wanting the film to “feel alive”, Jacir says it was important to blend fiction with reality. The footage also took on further meaning after certain locations became inaccessible as the war worsened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As the number of Jewish immigrants escaping antisemitism in Europe rises, so too do Palestinian concerns over loss of land under British mandate. What follows is a farmer-led revolt that mobilises Palestinians from all classes. The British respond with martial law and the deployment of thousands of troops. Palestinians are imprisoned and executed, leaders are exiled and homes are scorched.In one scene, a young girl Afra (Wardi Eilabouni in her screen debut) finds a gun hidden in blanket folds near her sleeping grandmother, who catches her mid-act. She tells the girl she will teach her how to use it, “but you must know you have something more powerful than the entire British empire”. Afra is perplexed: what is it? Her grandmother takes her hand. “You will know on your own,” she tells Afra sagely. In another scene, we see Kareem (another debut, by Ward Helou) being told to bite his father’s finger, while his father does the same to one of Kareem’s. Kareem withdraws in pain. “I won. Do you know why?” his father asks. “Because I endured longer, not because I’m stronger. You need to endure so you can win in the end.”The two scenes are connected by their sense of hope – something Jacir says is important to hold on to. But in response to the ongoing devastation inGaza, she reined in the lighter moments. Suddenly, being playful or smart or intellectual hit a wrong note. “It’s not the time for lightness. It’s not the time for poetry. It’s not the time for being abstract and experimental,” she says.Just like the characters in Palestine 36, we don’t know what will happen next. By the film’s end, we see Afra run through Jerusalem in a tatreez dress, toward some future unknown. There’s no telling where she is going, or what is happening, but as news of a fragile ceasefire breaks, Jacir’s message of endurance feels urgent rather than historical. “It’s just about continuing,” she says.Palestine 36 will be released in UK and Ireland cinemas from31 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmPalestineWest BankWorld cinemaIsraelColonialismGazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has co-written the screenplay with another A-lister: Canadian actor and director Sarah Polley.And yet the resulting picture, adapted from the2013 novel by David Gilbert, feels nebulous and laborious. It is dependent on a giant twist-reveal, which is bafflingly implausible and strangely uncompelling even if taken at face value, and which tends to undermine the emotional reality of the whole film and its big confrontation scenes – though there is one riveting showdown between Staunton and Nighy, two black-belts each at the top of their game.Nighy is Andrew Dyer, a cantankerous old literary lion revered throughout the world for the brilliant novels of his youth, who has published nothing for years and is now marooned like a bearded, drunken hermit in his huge Oxfordshire mansion, boozing, playing jazz LPs too loud and shouting at the walls. He lives with his longsuffering Czech housekeeper Gerde (Anna Geislerová) and high-schooler Andy (Noah Jupe), the product of an affair that destroyed his marriage to Isabel (Imelda Staunton).Andy is (possibly) like Smerdyakov in Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov: the non-canonical brother to his other, older siblings, would-be documentary film-maker Jamie (George MacKay) and recovering alcoholic screenwriter Richard (Johnny Flynn). The entire family is imperiously summoned to the mansion by Dyer.Andy and Richard are furious with the old man for how he treated their mother but self-hatingly aware they are still using him for their various careers. The film shows that their intense dislike of Dyer is not helped by the extraordinary claim he now makes about Andy – is it just a delusional, self-serving excuse for his infidelity and the only imaginative effort of which the raddled old man is now capable? Or could it be true?Either way, there isn’t much drama to be had from it. The whole situation circles around Dyer’s revelation without satisfactorily fleshing out its claims to the truth, or its implications as fiction. Jupe, MacKay and Flynn transmit their roles strongly enough, though the male cast are perhaps upstaged by Staunton as Dyer’s estranged wife; it is actually Flynn’s character Richard, furiously obsessed with what Dyer owes him, who delivers the film’s second disclosure, which would be quite enough on its own for most stories.There are memories here of other films about ageing, conceited toxic-male authors: Bjørn Runge’sThe Wife(2017) and Alice Troughton’sThe Lesson(2023). Although as a movie about a dysfunctional family, it isn’t anywhere near the quality of Trapero’s own tremendous crime-family movieThe Clanfrom 2015.& Sons doesn’t deliver on the promise of all its film-making talent but Nighy is always amusing, especially when he crisply orders his nephew Emmett (Arthur Conti) to fix him a whisky. In his untutored way, the kid fills the glass almost to the brim and Dyer grinningly congratulates him on an excellent “Scotch-to-air ratio”.& Sons screened at theLondon film festival.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025London film festivalImelda StauntonBill NighyFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nicolas Roeg’sfilm adaptationa couple of years later added a prologue in which we actually witness the recent loss of their youngest child, Christine, in a drowning accident. It is a horribly drawn-out scene, masterfully edited, and this new production directed by Douglas Rintoul opens by paying homage, while keeping the story’s original cause of death as meningitis.With the house lights up, Christine comes out to play on a reflective stage and darkness slowly descends. Against Daniel Denton’s rippling, misty video design, her blue dress seems to foreshadow a watery death. The next time we see her, John is cradling her lifeless body.It is a compelling opening for Nell Leyshon’s adaptation, which lets Laura voice more of her pain (Du Maurier’s story is filtered through John’s perspective). Leyshon has the couple reflecting on their return to the very hotel room of their carefree honeymoon, years earlier, painfully accentuating the strain on their relationship. She adds several realistic touches, threading their grief with guilt, and shows John (Mark Jackson), like their callous doctor, brusquely trying to get Laura (Sophie Robinson) to “move on” from what happened.View image in fullscreenThe supernatural elements never unsettle … Alex Bulmer, Robinson and Olivia Carruthers.Photograph: Manuel HarlanDu Maurier’s story is driven by an awful foreboding that colours each scene, not just the encounter with a pair of sisters who claim psychic visions of Christine but also the walking, waiting and confusions that occur after news arrives of an emergency back in England. On stage, those episodes crucially lack the creeping sense of dread: they are persistently lukewarm instead of chilling and the supernatural elements never unsettle. Although it is wisely played straight through without an interval, the closing section in particular slackens. Jess Curtis’s set becomes an empty shell on which John, the Venice police and the story’s famous hooded figure run around, with faintly ridiculous results.Until that climax, Curtis’s set had efficiently switched from hotel room to restaurant, while opened doors revealed the depth of the stage, and evoked places of worship and the ghostly streets of a city described as “slowly dying” in the story. Curtis’s costumes come mostly in the colours of the canals and, as in Du Maurier’s original, the often empty surroundings – mournfully lit by Jessie Addinall – underscore the absence the couple suffer.Like Adrienne Quartly’s score, the script is far better at conveying sadness than suspense. Leyshon describes water that looks like oil and boats that resemble coffins but John is given a number of overwrought psychic episodes, which scupper the mysteriousness of Laura’s later surprise appearance alongside the sisters (Olivia Carruthers and Alex Bulmer). Although it is moving to see John and Laura strive to rediscover their intimacy, some of the performances can sound stilted and the characters never get under your skin. Any suspense is sadly submerged.AtNew Wolsey theatre, Ipswich, until 25 October andSalisbury Playhouse, 29 October to 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreHorror booksDaphne du MaurierFictionShort storiesreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are countless ways to fuse the two or play them off against one another, especially when musicians and dancers are physically sharing the stage.In a UK premierefor Dance Umbrella festival, here is a 400-year-old piece of music, Carlos Gesualdo’s Tenebrae Responsoria, and six singers from baroque ensemble Les Arts Florissants entwined with four dancers choreographed by Senegal-born, France-based Amala Dianor. They are not obvious bedfellows – a Muslim choreographer who started out in hip-hop, alongside sacred vocal music on the Passion of Jesus from 1611 – and the unexpected coupling brings consonance and dissonance.At first the performers move as one unit, singers and dancers together in slow procession. All are dressed in black except Damiano Bigi’s Jesus, in white. The musicians are agile of voice, measured in movement, their sound never losing its refinement even when, for example, they’re called to sing lying on the floor.View image in fullscreenThe dance does not always bow to the music … Gesualdo Passione.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDianor leans into iconic imagery: Judas’s kiss, the crucifixion, Jesus’s body cradled by soprano Miriam Allan, a proxy Mary. There are some exquisite moments. Musical sections recur, so when they first sing of Christ’s last breath, the singers are kneeling around Jesus’s folded body. When the phrase is repeated, the singers return to their places but the body has disappeared, and a mystical tingle hangs in the air.The dancers, as they break from the pack, have heavy human bodies, not heavenly ones. There’s urgency in their controlled convulsions. But the dance does not always bow to the music; it follows its own unsentimental mode and is rhythmically independent, especially when the dancers begin to stomp their feet in a pulsing pattern, infiltrating the spacious resonance of the music.When the singers line up along the front of the stage and face the audience, there’s a relief in being able to focus on the music’s own movement, to see who is singing each part, bringing clarity to the ever-shifting harmonies. Meanwhile, Xavier Lazarini’s lighting turns dancers into silhouettes, like shadow puppets. He also makes columns of light flicker like glowing torches, creating a sacred space to hold this music of Holy Week. But in terms of choreography, perhaps passion is the missing connection.Dance Umbrella festivalcontinues until 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageDanceClassical musicBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Dub techno is something I always reach for at this time of year, cold but with a crackle of heat at its heart. Pioneered in the early 90s and blending stern techno with kindlier ambient and the sagely nodding offbeat of dub, it has been a deep, slow current in dance culture ever since and still has excellent new proponents such as Purelink, Cousin and the Glasgow producer Conna Haraway (who also heads up the labels co:clear and Index:Records).Following his debut album Lusidiq in 2023, Haraway has released two superb EPs this year. Spatial Fix is an unhurried 35 minutes, opener Freon riding a tropical trip-hop take on usually frigid dub techno, before a grayscale veil of static drifts on to the rest, closing out with the gorgeous dancehall of Patent.The three-track Shifted, meanwhile, is released on Short Span, a new label from Matthew Kent (much admired for his 2010s mixtape label Blowing Up the Workshop) that has been pushing dub techno forward this year, releasing outstanding LPs from Mammo and Sa Pa. Haraway’s entry in their discography opens with Redirect (a collab with fellow ambient-tech traveller Xenia Reaper), which feels like running your hand over the cool, subtly textured surface of slate tiling. Then it’s into Detach, a gripping four-four track that’s the most club-ready of those mentioned here, followed by Duration, in which trippy phasing effects are kept in orbit by a nimble syncopated beat. The subtle swing to Haraway’s beats, and the tactility to his sound design, build deep layers into this misty, majestic music.Ben Beaumont-ThomasThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenShuck the pain away … Peaches.Photograph: The Squirt DeluxePeaches – Not in Your Mouth None of Your Business“I cannot be squashed or minimised!” As they prepare their first album in a decade, out next year, Peaches declaims an awesome manifesto for queer resistance over a fist-raising electroclash beat.BBTThis Is Lorelei – Name the BandAnother perfectly turned pop gem from one half of Water from Her Eyes: a crunchy, 90-second bedroom anthem about the hurt of hurting someone by accident, brimming with boyish feeling.LSDexter in the Newsagent – I Told YaLondon pop-R&B​ artist Charmaine Ayoku​ has a spring in her step over this cute, bumping beat, as she realises she’s dating someone she doesn’t even really like and shrugs them off with breezy self-determination.BBTLala Lala – Does This Go Faster?“Hell is the day after the party,” sings Lillie West on the kind of wistful, bumping indie-pop dreamer that feels like the kind of moment that should last for ever.LSArmand Hammer andthe Alchemist – Super NintendoOver a beautifully noodling synth melody Alchemist ​has sampled from God knows where, Billy Woods reflects on time’s passing a​n​d Elucid delivers a stunning verse of surrealist ​p​oetry​, his flow summed up by ​his closing line: “Grew peculiar and wild, style ca​st shadow like sundial​: ta-dow!”BBTJulianna Barwick and Mary Lattimore – Melted MoonAnchor yourself with something heavy before listening: the combined beauty of two of modern composition’s most celestial-sounding musicians may induce transcendence.LSSteve Hauschildt – DividuaOnce a member of esteemedkosmischeband Emeralds, Hauschildt extends his solo career with a beautiful new album, Aeropsia.

From 2002, Rochford’s unique sax-led quintetPolar Bearbegan earning nominations for Mercury, Mobo and Urban Music prizes, as well as the kind of fame rare in instrumental jazz. He also played key roles with Acoustic Ladyland, Basquiat Strings, Fulborn Teversham,Sons of Kemet, and as a sideman with Damon Albarn, Brian Eno and Adele.Finding Ways follows 2023’s A Short Diary (a duo album in partnership with pianist Kit Downes) in dealing with the death in 2019 of Rochford’s beloved poet father Gerard. The title of Finding Ways is no accident: this sharply contrasting record features edgy, metal sounds from seven studio-mixed electric guitarists, including acid-to-improv musician Tara Cunningham, Portishead’s Adrian Utley and former Verve and Albarn sideman Simon Tong. But it’s Rochford’s signature, songlike chemistry – subtly transformed by rich textures, energised by his own unpredictably shifting ambiguities of rhythm – that still infuses his sound.The opener Maybe begins with a slashing rhythm-guitar riff that turns to splintery atonal improv, and Being Outside’s chord changes suggest Rochford’s early rock-punk teenage life. Rising UK jazz guitarist David Preston’s handling of the lyrical Who’s Your Person?, the reggae jive of Community and the romantic pop vibe of What You Hold in Your Heart are all highlights. As with A Short Diary, Rochford is on a personal journey back through intimate memories now, and this one is very different from its predecessor. But considering the diversity of this subtle artist’s experiences in sound over the past quarter-century, it’s fascinating to ponder where a possible third episode might go.Also out this monthUK saxophonistEmma Rawicz’s self-produced debut Incantation, made when she was a student of 19, was a real-deal revelation of old-school sax lyricism and post-bop power. With Inkyra (ACT), she and her regular live lineup including flautist Gareth Lockrane and guitarist David Preston now stretch their skills further on 10 of the leader’s vivid originals, spanning dreamily cinematic soundscapes, snappy polyrhythmic tenor-sax groovers and atmospherically songlike meditations.Dog Soup’s Fragments (Dark Circles Recordings) recovers and remasters a lost Loop Collective classic of the 00s, led by trumpeter Robbie Robson in an original, free and dramatic reprise of the sound of the Miles Davis group of the late 1960s, with drummer Tim Giles a thrilling catalyst. And US saxist and former Bowie Blackstar sidemanDonny McCaslinoperates at the outer reaches of rock-saturated jazz intensity, with the significant help of guitarist Ben Monder and bassist Tim Lefebvre on Lullaby for the Lost (Edition).Explore more on these topicsMusicJazz album of the monthJazzreviewsShareReuse this content"

Miracle in the Gorbals, commissioned by Sadler’s Wells in 1944, was one of Arthur Bliss’s most audacious projects, although harmonically it is fairly conventional. Highlights include lilting, almost Parisian waltzes for two young lovers and a troubled sex worker, an aching neoclassical sarabande to accompany the drowned girl’s cortege and a central jazz-infused Dance of Deliverance, improvised tom-toms and all.View image in fullscreenBliss, Miracle in the Gorbals/Metamorphic Variations album artwork.Photograph: ChandosBy contrast, Metamorphic Variations from 1972 is abstract in narrative terms. Recorded in its entirety for the first time (Bliss cut two movements, adding them to the published score as an appendix), it emerges as a late masterpiece containing the accumulated wisdom of a lifetime. Complex yet persuasive, its extended melodic lines are frequently adorned with glittering swathes of tuned percussion. The prancing Polonaise, with its splendidly inappropriate castanets, is perhaps the standout, but there’s much else here to enjoy.Michael Seal and the BBC Philharmonic unfurl the contrasting beauties of each work in dynamic performances, aided by Chandos’s signature state-of-the-art engineering.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperareviewsShareReuse this content"

Here is a gnarled landmass of bubblegum blues, powder pinks and strange, luminous beasts, where evolution seems to occur at light speed. This world’s considerable beauty is amplified by how it is rendered: like a 1980s fantasy movie filled with charmingly handmade practical effects. Keeper is the latest title from Double Fine, maker of trippy platformerPsychonauts 2, Kickstarter sensationBroken Ageand many other idiosyncratic titles. It is an action-adventure resplendent with the lumps and bumps of life’s imperfections, as if its 3D modellers had sculpted the setting from papier-mache rather than using computer software.Even stranger than the setting is the protagonist: you play as a lighthouse, coming to appreciate this gleaming ecological fantasia by shining its beacon about the environment. Long shadows stretch behind illuminated objects, making the outlines of spectacularly supersized plants and tiny critters all the more pronounced. The casting of light is how you interact with the world: it often causes vegetation to grow before your eyes, and sometimes unusual inhabitants will feast upon it. As you lumber through this environment – calm lagoons and sun-baked canyons filled with prickly cacti – there is joy to be found in simply looking, taking the weirdness in, and then bringing it to even greater life.View image in fullscreenPuzzle solving … Keeper.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosThat seems to be your role in Keeper: lighthouse as life giver. Quickly, you gain a companion: a bird called Twig, whose beak is made from driftwood. You become a double act: at various points, you send your feathered friend to turn a crank (in this far-future take on planet Earth, the organic and mechanical have fused, like a steampunk take on Henry David Thoreau). But these puzzles are no match for the daring ingenuity of the visual design, nor do they especially resonate with the game’s celebration of biology. Early on, you are merely swivelling the analogue stick, making the one cog line up with another.Too often, puzzles feel like a roadblock to exploration rather than an enabler. But, slowly, Keeper begins to lean into the surrealism of its world to generate surprises. At one point, a candy floss-like substance gets stuck to your lighthouse, causing it to become weightless. Rather than wobbling awkwardly, suddenly you’re leaping with grace, suspended in the air for many seconds, exuberant at the ability to take flight.Thereafter, Keeper finds an evolutionary groove. The lighthouse transforms into a boat of delightfully piscine characteristics: what pleasure there is swishing and whirling about in azure blue water. The game then takes a darker, more abstract turn as you become a red-hot disc of metal, carving through knotted undergrowth like a primordial Sonic the Hedgehog.View image in fullscreenA surreal setting … Keeper.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosKeeper speaks clearest through its tremendous images, while billing itself as a “story told without words”. But the latter isn’t quite right. At various points, button prompts flash up on screen: for example, press X to “peck”. In spelling out exactly what the player should be doing, the world’s ambiguity is diminished.This problem recurs at the game’s conclusion, albeit from a different angle. Without spoiling exactly what happens, the player seems to be presented with the magnificent and incomprehensible totality of existence itself. How do we interact with such transcendent profundity? Sadly, with another rote shape-based puzzle involving kaleidoscopic crystals and a black hole. That is Keeper in a nutshell, a game that lacks the interactive vocabulary to wholly embrace the weirdness it depicts with such sparkling, vivid imagination.Keeper is out now onXboxand PC, £24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesXboxPCPuzzle gamesAdventure gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

My wife and I bought our passes for all of Europe (under £500 for one-month unlimited rail trips) and it was great to rediscover the sense of freedom and adventure travelling by train gave. Having a romantic dinner in Paris, getting on the night train and having coffee and croissants for breakfast in Nice on the Côte d’Azur for example. I corrected the teenage mistake of trying to do too much and see too many places so we lingered longer in places such as Poland and Romania, soaking up the atmosphere in Wrocław and Bucharest. It was interesting to compare the speed, quality and comfort of train services too. We found that sometimes slow travel was better – like when we got on the wrong train from Rome to Naples, allowing us to appreciate the scenery, locals and way of life of people who were not in a hurry. The trip was a learning experience at 61 as much as it had been at 16.PeterFlight and fancy-free, cycling from Saint-Malo to NiceView image in fullscreenKaren and Andrew on their trip.In pursuit of a flight-free adventure, we packed our bikes (and several panniers) on to the Eurostar for a three-week cycling trip across France. Our initial worries about sore legs and flat tyres quickly faded away as we pedalled along comfortable cycle lanes in the picturesque French countryside, fuelled by village boulangeries and cold local beer. We covered 1,040 miles from Saint-Malo to Nice via the Dordogne, staying in B&Bs or rented apartments each night (from £100 per night). Highlights included stops for refreshing swims in rivers, avoiding airport chaos, and proving that holidays in your 60s can be active and fun.Karen and AndrewProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

With one eye on my pension settlement and another on the atlas, I dreamed of travelling the world, staying in breathtaking locations with stupendous views. I never realised that the most rewarding stay would be in a tiny cabin in Clyro, Powys. Was it the compact design, the comfortable bed, the picture windows framed by woods and pasture? Partly, but more importantly I learned how little I needed to feel happy and comfortable. In this beautiful woodland setting, within walking distance of a pub and not too far from twee little Hay-on-Wye, I had everything I needed.LindaI went to Japan for the cherry blossom – and saw it at its peakView image in fullscreenCherry blossom in Tokyo.Photograph: Falcon0125/Getty ImagesAt 69, I embarked on an 18-day solo adventure across Japan. My goal was to witness the cherry blossom, and I saw it at its peak. Starting in Osaka, my journey led me through Kyoto, Kobe, Okayama, Kurashiki and finally Tokyo. I wandered through historic gardens unchanged for centuries, admired weeping cherry trees along riverbanks, and watchedsakurareflections dance across still ponds. Every path seemed lined with blossom, and side trips to shrines, temples and castles deepened the sense of timeless wonder.Marilisa FioraniSquabbles and giggles from London to San SebastiánView image in fullscreenSue travels with university friends ‘collected over 54 years’.Five female friends from York to Brighton, collected over 54 years from university, between 74 and 84, do rail trips round Europe. Last year we did London to Paris, staying in La Rochelle, Bordeaux and San Sebastián. We are like an extended marriage, dipping in and out of shared history, politics, and to disagree and insult each other with only temporary hurt. It takes months of planning, each person booking accommodation or part of the rail journey – which is where theMan in Seat 61is so helpful. We are three vegetarians, two meat eaters, four fish eaters, two teetotallers. At an amazing fish restaurant in La Rochelle, one of the two vegetarians asked: “Couldn’t you do us an omelette?” The waiter chased them away rather angrily, but the rest of us had delicious seafood with good wine. In La Rochelle we disagreed over the way to the Airbnb. Running late, we were greeted with applause by the owner’s mother, who had spotted five old ladies with backpacks and wheelie suitcases from many metres away!SueBrittany on two wheels is heavenView image in fullscreenKelvin Atkins explored Brittany by van and bicycle.Earlier this summer, at 64, I used a 22-year-old van conversion as a base for exploring Brittany’s Gulf of Morbihan by bicycle. Pedalling along deserted lanes and canal paths, I discovered picture-book villages and towns, tidal creeks, coastal cliffs and ancient woodlands. I came across dolmens and menhirs, medieval castles and Nazi bunkers, and took ferries to car-free islands with empty beaches and incredible views. I rode to creperies for lunch and restaurants for dinner, ate like a king and slept like a baby. For a 64-year-old on two wheels, Brittany is nothing short of heaven.Kelvin Atkinsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Islamic, Russian colonial and post-independence influences merge in the architecture. A palace, mosques, museums, galleries and caravanserais are jammed together in delightful disarray. One highlight is theMaiden Tower, certainly 12th century and possibly once a Zoroastrian fire temple. ThePhilharmonic Garden, just beyond the wall, provides a calming green space. We enjoyed our stay at theTwo Seasons boutique hotelin Sabir Street, and would recommend it.AlexI left my comfort zone for TurkmenistanView image in fullscreenTurkmenistan was worth its challenges, says Helen Jackson.Visiting five former-Soviet “stans” in 34 days was destined to be challenging, regardless of age. But when you’re a pampered, weak-bladdered 65-year-old, yurt camps with outdoor toilets and shared facilities in family homes were not within my comfort zone. Crossing into countries with difficult neighbouring relationships proved time-consuming, with Turkmenistan, one of the world’s least visited countries, involving copious paperwork, expensive visas and, in June 2024, a Covid test. There was no ideal time to visit, and temperatures ranged from 40C to -10C at night. However, stunning scenery, friendly people and ubiquitousplov(a rice-based pilaf), meant I not only survived the trip but thoroughly loved it.Helen JacksonA trek to a holy valley in NepalView image in fullscreenMichael Wilson travelled to the Tsum valley by eight-hour minibus journey.In 2017, aged 69 and with friends, I took an eight-hour minibus journey from Kathmandu then walked for four days to get to the Tsum valley, a remote Himalayan valleyclose to the Nepalese border with Tibet. The path was about 3,000 metres high and was surrounded by the 7,000-metre peaks of the Ganesh Himāl; we found people living without mechanisation, roads, vehicles or wifi. Buddhists regard it as abeyul, a hidden and holy refuge to be discovered when it is feared the planet is approaching destruction and the world has become too corrupt for spiritual practice. It seemed an appropriate place to be, then and now. I planned the journey using Kathmandu-based trekking companyBeyond the Limits.Michael WilsonPedalling through Portugal’s AlentejoView image in fullscreenThe Alentejo and parts of the Algarve are perfect for a leisurely cycle, says our tipster.Photograph: Westend61/AlamyMy friend and I are both in our early 60s and love cycling in Portugal.

Now it has 10 and will soon have 13. Queensland has 15 and Victoria has three multiday walks with “Great” in their names. Then there’s Great Walks of Australia, a collective of 13 luxury guided walks, not to be confused with the popular SBS television seriesGreat Australian Walks.So where did all this greatness come from?What is a Great Walk?Short answer: they come from across the ditch. New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DOC) launched its world-first Great Walks program in 1992 to manage “overcrowding and ecological damage from indiscriminate camping and walking” on New Zealand’s eight most popular multiday walks such as the Milford, Kepler and Routeburn tracks, according to a DOC spokesperson.There are now 11Great Walks in New Zealandincluding the Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track, which opened in 2024 after a NZ$7.9m refurbishment, and a five-day canoe trailcalled the Whanganui Journey (so great, you can walk on water).‘They spread magic’: New Zealand’s ‘trail angels’ offer weary hikers food, showers and hopeRead moreGreat is not just a name in New Zealand, but an entire management system with online bookings, caps on walker numbers and affordable campsites and huts. It’s also a public access success story. Independent walkers now make up 93% of all bookings – the rest are guided trips and school groups – and the NZ Great Walks brand has become the gold standard for walking tracks worldwide.Australia’s Great WalksIn Australia, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is the latest tourism body to catch on.NSW Great Walks, launched in 2023, is part marketing tool and part infrastructure project. Its aim is to create durable walking tracks for hikers of all levels, protect sensitive environments and encourage recreational walkers to spread out across the state – reducing overtourism while bringing more tourist dollars to regional NSW.View image in fullscreenFletchers Lookout at the recently renamed Grand Cliff Top Walk, Wentworth Falls, NSW.Photograph: Remy BrandView image in fullscreenThe Scenic Rim Trail in Queensland. The state has 10 or 15 Great Walks, depending on who you ask.Photograph: Scenic Rim TrailTen of the 13 NSW Great Walks are open to the public, with NPWS saying the final three will open by mid-2027. Most are existing trails that have been upgraded – along with their campsites, huts and lookouts – and extended to create new routes. Some, such as the Gidjuum Gulganyi Walk in northern NSW (which opened this year), the Grand Cliff Top Walk in the Blue Mountains and the Snowies Alpine Walk, have been given new names to reflect the new routes.In Queensland, the Great Walks trail gets muddier.Until September, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service listed only10 Great Walks of Queensland, eight of which have “great” in their names, such as the Cooloola Great Walk. But Tourism and Events Queensland has always promoted15 Great Walks– includingthe Thorsborne Trail, which wasn’t on the Parks and Wildlife Service’s original list despite being one of the state’s best-known walksandin a national park (Hinchinbrook Island national park).Deserted beaches, wild rivers and seaside chill: four days walking in NSW’s largest coastal parkRead moreWhile Victoria has no official list of Great Walks, it does have the spectacular coastal Great Ocean Walk, the Great South West Walk (officially opened way back in 1983) and the Great Dividing Trail, named after the Great Dividing Range it traverses.Nor are there any Great Walks in Western Australia, South Australia or the Northern Territory, despite these states having plenty of great walking tracks.Tasmania is in a league of its ownThen there’s Tasmania. Despite its reputation as a walking holiday destination, the island state doesn’t officially have any Great Walks, just an impressive list of60 Great Short (day) Walks.View image in fullscreenMaria Island Walk is one of four Tasmanian tracks represented in Great Walks of Australia as well as The Great Walks of Tasmania.Photograph: Matthew Newtown/Maria Island WalkBut six of Tasmania’s classic multiday walks are part ofGreat Walks of Australia(GWOA), a program launched by Tourism Australia in 2013 to “grow the country’s profile as a world-class walking destination”, says Genevieve Matthews, Great Walks of Australia’s executive officer.Just to confuse matters, four of those Tasmanian walks are also represented inThe Great Walks of Tasmania, a different venture set up by a group of walking companies.How great are these Great Walks?Confusion aside, the Great Walks brand, in all forms, seems to be encouraging many of us to walk more. In NSW there has been a 20% increase in bushwalkers on trails that have become Great Walks within the past two years, according to NSW NPWS. And when the Flinders Island Walk in Tasmania joined Great Walks of Australia in 2024, its tour operator, Tasmanian Expeditions,reporteda 72% increase in bookings on the previous year.“Our guests often treat the Great Walks of Australia as a curated shortlist of Australia’s most iconic walking experiences,” says Phil Wyndham, general manager of Australian Walking Holidays and Tasmanian Expeditions, which both operate GWOA walks. “We hear time and again that it gives people the confidence to book, especially if they’re trying multiday walks for the first time.”View image in fullscreenTasmania’s Flinders Island walk was added to the Great Walk of Australia list in 2024.Photograph: Lachlan Gardiner/Flinders Island Walking Adventure in ComfortSome experienced walkers aren’t sold on the Great Walks label, however. Hobart-based hiker Andrew Bain says Tasmanians tend to create their own lists of non-Great Walks such as Frenchmans Cap and Lake Rhona – or tackle more challenging goals such as the 158 Abels, the Tasmanian mountains higher than 1,100 metres.Two days hiking on Hinchinbrook Island: the trek that nearly (sort of) killed meRead moreAnd for Melburnian long-distance hiker Laura Waters, the author of two hiking books, New Zealand’s Great Walks remain the benchmark. “The Great Walks badge has been attached to so many random walks in Australia it has become a bit meaningless,” she says.“In New Zealand it represents a clear and consistent offering. You know you’re going to get an epic, scenic walk with certain track standards, rangers and hut facilities. I’ve personally ticked off seven of New Zealand’s Great Walks, not in a peak-bagging way, but because I know each one is going to be a walk that’s really worth doing.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia holidaysWalking holidaysAustralasia holidaysTasmania holidaysNew South Wales holidaysAustralian lifestyleQueensland holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the bar, we make it withSavoia Orancio, a fruity, spiced Italian aperitivo that’s not all that easy to find, but rosé vermouth does the job almost as well.Rude cosmoServes1For the syrup70ml lingonberry juice, or cranberry juice70g caster sugar1 small handfullemon verbena leaves, or the finely grated zest of ¼ lemonFor the drink40ml good-quality blanco tequila– we usePatrón20ml rosé vermouth–Lustau Vermut Rosé, ideally20ml lingonberry and lemon verbena syrup(see above and method)20ml fresh lime juice1 strip orange zest, flamed to release and caramelise the oilsFirst make the syrup. Put the lingonberry juice, sugar and lemon verbena in a small saucepan, heat gently to 70C, then leave to cook at that temperature for 10 minutes, until all the sugar dissolves. Take off the heat, leave to cool and infuse, then strain into a clean bottle or jar, seal and store in the fridge; it will keep happily for a good two to three weeks (mixed with cold soda water, it also makes a great non-alcoholic spritz).To build the drink, measure all the liquids into a shaker, add a decent handful of ice and shake hard. Double strain into a chilled nick & nora glass, garnish with the flamed orange zest and serve.Andy Kerr, co-owner,Parasol, London N16Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

Despite my best efforts to get through them, a couple of well-ripened, black-skinned bananas in the fruit bowl is an all too common sight. Banana bread feels the obvious choice, but sometimes you just don’t have the time or enough people to share it with. A quicker option that I like to make at weekends is french toast, though I tend to lean into the Hong Kong-style in which the slices of bread are stuffed with peanut butter and drizzled generously with condensed milk and butter. Delightful stuff.Peanut butter and banana french toastPrep5 minCook20 minServes22 large eggs60ml milk1 tsp vanilla extract½ tbsp brown sugar2 tbsp smooth peanut butter4 slices brioche2 small ripe bananas, peeled and sliced30g salted butter, plus extra to serve1 tbsp oilCondensed milk, to servePut the eggs, milk, vanilla and brown sugar in a shallow bowl and whisk to combine.Spread the peanut butter over one side of two of the brioche slices, top with the sliced banana, then sandwich with the other two slices of brioche. Carefully dip the sandwiches into the egg mixture, making sure to coat them all over.Put the butter and oil in a large pan on a medium heat. Once it’s melted, lay each sandwich in the pan, leave to cook for two to three minutes, then flip and repeat on the other side. Using tongs, hold the sandwich on all its edges so they also brown and crisp up.Put the french toasts on plates and, while they’re still warm, drizzle with condensed milk and some extra butter. Serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotFruitBreadDessertEggsNuts and seedsBreakfastrecipesShareReuse this content"
